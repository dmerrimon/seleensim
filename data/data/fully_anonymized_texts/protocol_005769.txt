Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  
 A Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled evaluation of PLN -[ZIP_CODE] 
on type 1 collagen deposition using 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI imaging in participants with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)  
Study Number:  PLN -[ZIP_CODE] -IPF-205 
Study Phase:   2a 
Number of 
Participants Approx. 12 ([ADDRESS_713269] -[ZIP_CODE] and 4 receiving placebo)  
Objectives:  Primary:   
• Quantification of type [ADDRESS_713270]-[ZIP_CODE], as assessed by [CONTACT_462147] 68Ga-CBP8 positron 
emission tomography (PET) / magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracer uptake 
patterns 
Secondary:  
• Assessme nt of the safety and tolerability of PLN -[ZIP_CODE] in idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) participants  
Exploratory: 
• Relationship between PLN -[ZIP_CODE] systemic exposure and PET imaging and 
biomarkers in IPF participants  
• Forced vital capacity (FVC): absolute FVC vo lume and FVC as percent of 
predicted as assessed by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038]  
• Patient -reported outcome (PRO): a visual analog scale (VAS) for cough severity  
Study Design:  This is a Phase 2a, single -center, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled 
study to evaluate  type 1 collagen deposition in the lungs following once -daily (QD) 
treatment with [ADDRESS_713271] -[ZIP_CODE] for 12 weeks in participants with IPF.  
The study consists of an up to 28- day screening period, a 12- week treatment period, 
and a 2 week (±3 days) post treatment follow -up period.  
Potential participants who provide written informed consent will be screened for study eligibility up to [ADDRESS_713272] dose of study drug. 
Approximately 12 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio ([ADDRESS_713273]-[ZIP_CODE] vs placebo; [ADDRESS_713274] -[ZIP_CODE] and 4 receiving placebo) on Day 1 
(Visit 3). Study treatment will be administe red once daily for [ADDRESS_713275] of care (SoC) IPF therapy with pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365] (SoC use; yes or no).  
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI scans will be conducted within 7 days prior to baseline and at or 
within 7 day s prior to Week 12, as indicated in the Schedule of Events . 
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 weeks of treatment will be encouraged to remain in the study to complete all 
remaining assessments; if this is not feasible, they will be asked to return to the clinic 
for an Early Termination (ET) visit for follow -up evaluations. If a participant elects to 
withdraw from the study after the 6
th week of randomization , an end of participation 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI wil l be offered to the participant to enhance appropriate data 
capture. 
Potential acute exacerbations, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -
related deaths will be reviewed by [CONTACT_122371].

analysis will be obtained predose and at 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_713287] 2 hours postdose at Weeks 4 and 12.  
Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
PET/MRI Imaging for the Assessment of Type 1 Collagen Deposition  
All PET/MRI will be performed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. PET imaging will be performed at prespecified times
 
as indicated in the Schedule  of Events. Blood samples will be obtained prior to each 
PET/MRI and will be stored for future analyses.  The total amount of radiation 
exposure from the PET/MRI is equal to a whole -body exposure up to 22 mSv (11 mSv 
per administration  of 68GaCBP8). 
MRI for the Assessment of PET/MRI Relationship  
All participants will undergo dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI during each PET/MRI 
session. This will be pe rformed using gadoterate meglumine at a predefined weight -
base dose and injection rate, as detailed in the study’s Radiology Manual . 
Biomarkers in Urine, Plasma, and Serum  
Urine, plasma and serum samples will be obtained at predetermined times  as indicated 
in the Schedule of Events. These samples will be used to measure specific proteins, 
peptides, metabolites and/or messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts that may 
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 6  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  be elevated in patients with inflammatory/fibrotic disease or act as pharmacodynamic 
(PD) markers that may change with inhibition of α vβ6. 
Pharmacogenomic Assessments  
A whole blood sample for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation will be collected 
before dosing on Day 1 from each participant in the study.  
Exploratory Efficacy 
Assessments:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_545160].  FEV1 will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_282892].  
Patient-reported Outcome (PRO)  
Study participants will respond to a VAS for cough severity at the timepoints specified 
in the Schedule of E vents.  
Safety Assessments:  Open ended adverse event (AE) inquiry; clinical chemistry and hematology; vital 
signs; 12-lead ECG  
Sample Size 
Justification: The sample size of approximately 12 participants ([ADDRESS_713288]-[ZIP_CODE] and 4 receiving placebo) is expected to provide a meaningful evaluation of 
PLN-[ZIP_CODE] safety, tolerability and PK in the target population, and add to the data of approximately 21 participants planned to be evaluated at this dose level in an ongoing multicenter, dose ranging Phase 2a study (PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-202). 
Statistical Methods:  Analysis Populations  
Safety Population: All randomized participants who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  
PK Analysis Population: All rand omized participants who have sufficient PLN -[ZIP_CODE] 
concentration data for PK calculation will be included in the PK analyses.  
PD Analysis Population: All randomized participants who receive any amount of study 
drug and who have results from Baseline and from at least one post -baseline PET/MRI 
scan or PD assessment will be included in the PD analyses.  
Primary Endpoint: PD  
Quantification of type 1 collagen in the lung following 12 weeks of treatment, as assessed by [CONTACT_462147] 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer uptake patterns.  
PET/MRI scans will be interpreted by [CONTACT_545177] (ABNM)-certified nuclear medicine physicians in an unblinded manner. Lung contours will be generated from baseline and post -treatment PET/MRI. Mean and maximum 
standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements of contoured lungs will be calculated using MIMS software, by [CONTACT_545178] 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI within 
the lung, and by [CONTACT_545179] -treatment scans. 
Numeric al and graphical results will be presented by [CONTACT_2715].  
In addition, relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and PET imaging, may be evaluated in an exploratory fashion and presented in a graphical manner  
Secondary Endpoint: Safety  
Safety data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug will be incorporated into the final safety analysis.  
Exploratory Endpoints  
PK and PD  
Plasma PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-versus- time profiles (with plasma concentrations on both a log  
and linear scale) will be plotted for each participant. Non- compartmental analysis will 
be used to calculate PK parameters as appropriate .

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  1 INTRODUCTION  
Pliant Therapeutics Inc. (Pliant) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_39558] -[ZIP_CODE] for the treatment of idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and treatment of 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) associated with at least severe coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID -19).  
IPF is the most common interstitial lung disease usually observed in the elderly characterized 
by [CONTACT_545180], with median survival of 
3.8 years after diagnosis based on 2014 data in the [LOCATION_002] (US). The hallmark 
honeycomb appearance of IPF on high- resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is the 
result of extensive fibrosis ( Lederer  and Martinez, 2018). Although not completely 
understood, IPF appears to be a response to alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_545164] ( Kreuter et al, 2015 ; Wilson and Raghu, 2015) and 
propagated by [CONTACT_545181]. As has also been indicated to be the case for other fibrotic conditions, signaling mediated by α
v integrins is central to the control of fibrosis in the lungs. 
Specific roles proposed for α vβ6 in epi [INVESTIGATOR_39560] α vβ1 in myofibroblasts for induction of 
fibrosis are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure for PLN -[ZIP_CODE]. 
PLN -[ZIP_CODE] is a small molecule and a selective dual inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins: 
50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) 5.7 nM and 3.4 nM, respectively, in an in vitro ligand-
binding assay (protein- free); IC 50 30 nM and 19.5 nM (10.2 nM and 6.6 nM unbound), 
respectively, in an in vitro co- culture assay of transforming growth factor beta (TGF -β) 
activati on. PLN -[ZIP_CODE] reduced collagen synthesis in mice with bleomycin- induced lung 
injury, a commonly used experimental model for IPF ( Moeller et al, 2008 ). In ex vivo human 
IPF lung tissue (precision cut lung slices), treatment with PLN -[ZIP_CODE] significantly decreased 
collagen type  1 alpha 1 ( COL1A1 ) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels 
after a 3 -day incubation period, providing an indication of antifibrotic activity in IPF. Mice 
completely deficient for α vβ6 function live a normal lifespan ( Horan et al, 2008 ), suggesting 
that even full inhibition of such integrins is well tolerated.  
1.[ADDRESS_713299] -[ZIP_CODE] (PLN -[ZIP_CODE]- P1-01), a total of [ADDRESS_713300] -[ZIP_CODE] for up to 14 days, with single and multiple doses 
ranging from 10 to 75 mg. Overall, the study showed that single ascending dose (SAD) and 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) administration of PLN -[ZIP_CODE] was well tolerated at all dose 
levels, with no apparent relationship between frequency or severity of adverse events (AEs) 
to PLN -[ADDRESS_713301] -[ZIP_CODE]- 106 (Relative Bioavailability Study), a total of [ADDRESS_713302] -[ZIP_CODE]- 107 (mass balance study), [ADDRESS_713303] -[ZIP_CODE] 
was safe and well tolerated.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detailed information on these 
studies.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_713304] -[ZIP_CODE] showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile after up to 7 days of tre atment, 
with no new safety concerns observed during this dose -escalation study. There were no 
clinically significant alterations in vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) or laboratory 
parameters across either the SAD or MAD cohorts indicative of a safety signal. There were 
no deaths reported during or after the study period.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional detailed information on this study. 
(Note that analysis of data from single doses greater than 320 mg and multiple doses greate r 
than 160 mg is ongoing.)

1.[ADDRESS_713308] -[ZIP_CODE]- IPF-205 
IPF is characterized by [CONTACT_545182] 1 collagen deposition in the lungs that replaces healthy 
parenchymal tissue with collagen -rich scar. As the disease advances , progressive 
architectural di stortion and dysfunction ensues resulting in often subtle but limiting 
breathlessness, fatigue and cough. TGF -β is an important pleotropic cytokine that is a key 
regulator of tissue fibrogenesis in both normal wound repair and pathologic fibroproliferative 
diseases such as IPF. TGF -β is constitutively secreted and bound within the extracellular 
matrix in its latent or inactive form. Release or activation of latent TGF -β may occur with 
proteolytic cleavage via plasmin or matrix metalloproteinases, or interaction with several different integrins, namely α
vβ6 (expressed on epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]) and α vβ1 (expressed on 
fibro blasts) in the lung. In IPF, α vβ6 and αvβ1 expression are increased with a resultant 
increase in TGF -β signaling and its downstream pro- fibrotic targets, notably COL1A1.  
PLN -[ZIP_CODE] is an oral, once -daily, dual -selective inhibitor of α vβ6 and α vβ1 integrins in 
development for the treatment of IPF, with orphan drug designation granted by [CONTACT_43747] (FDA). PLN -[ZIP_CODE] was generally well tolerated in over 
180 participants treated to date in clinical studies, with single doses up to 320 mg  and 
multiple doses up to 160 mg once daily; additionally, single doses of up to [ADDRESS_713309] -[ZIP_CODE] inhibits the interaction of these integrins 
with latency associated peptide and blocks the release of free TGF -β into the extracellular 
matrix for subsequent binding to its receptor and activation of profibrotic pathways, 
including collagen synthesis. Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) generated from IPF patient 
lungs collected during transplant were used to evaluate the ability of PLN -[ADDRESS_713310] -[ZIP_CODE] (200 nM or 1820 nM), collagen gene 
expression and SMAD2 phosphorylation (a marker of TGF -β signaling) in IPF patient PCLS 
were significantly reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50%. In vivo efficacy studies of PLN -[ZIP_CODE] 
were also performed using the bleomycin mouse model of pul monary fibrosis. In a 
prophylactic treatment study (PLN -[ADDRESS_713311] -bleomycin challenge), PLN -[ADDRESS_713312] -[ZIP_CODE] in the bleomycin 
model (oral administration from [ADDRESS_713313] -bleomycin challenge). Lung 
hydroxyproline levels were significantly reduced and morphometric analysis of lung tissue showed a dose -dependent and significant reduction in interstitial fibrillar collagen deposition 
in mice treated with PLN -[ZIP_CODE]. These data suggest that PLN -[ADDRESS_713314] and quantify elevated collagen levels in patients with IPF compared to healthy individuals, particularly in the subpleural regions of the lung where fibrosis is known 
to be prominent ( Montesi et al, 2019 ). Importantly, increased collagen tra cer signal was also 
noted in radiographically normal areas on computerized tomography (CT) prior to architectural distortion, indicating the 
68Ga-CBP8 probe may be more sensitive than HRCT 
in detecting active and/or early fibrosis. Furthermore, 68Ga-CBP8 u ptake in mouse lungs has 
been shown to correlate with levels of fibrosis following injury, with data suggesting that the 
tracer more readily binds newly formed collagen in active disease than established mature 
collagen. PLN -[ADDRESS_713315] that 
68Ga-CBP8 may be an effective tool for measuring disease activity (e.g., recently deposited 
pulmonary collagen levels) and therefore a powerful tool for evaluating efficacy of anti-fibrotic agents such as PLN -[ADDRESS_713316] -[ZIP_CODE], the measurement of 
68Ga-CBP8 PET ligand wi ll serve two 
functions ; changes over time will provi de an exploratory endpoint of both pharmacodynamic 
(PD) activity and  efficacy (reduced collagen levels) of PLN -[ZIP_CODE].  
To complement the evaluation of antifibrotic effects in the proposed PLN -[ZIP_CODE]- IPF-205 
study, ongoing Phase 2 studies conducted in participants with IPF (PLN -[ZIP_CODE]- IPF-202) or 
PSC (PLN -[ZIP_CODE]- PSC-203) will assess the safety and tolerability of PLN -[ZIP_CODE], along with 
exploratory endpoints relevant to fibrosis. In the PLN -[ZIP_CODE]- IPF-202 study, exploratory 
efficacy endpoints will be assessed, including change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and 
quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) from baseline following [ADDRESS_713317] -[ZIP_CODE]. These established (FVC) and exploratory assessments of progressive disease 
and collagen deposition in IPF will complement the current study, which will be first of its kind to quantify changes in type [ADDRESS_713318] -[ZIP_CODE] using 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/ magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) tracer upta ke.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 2a, single -center, randomized, double -blinded, placebo- controlled study to 
evaluate type 1 collagen deposition in the lungs following once -daily (QD) treatment with 
[ADDRESS_713320] -[ZIP_CODE] for 12 weeks in participants with IPF.  
The study consists of an up to 28- day screening period, a 12- week treatment period, and a 
2-week (±3 days) post treatment follow -up period.  
Potential participants who provide written informed consent will be screened for study 
eligibility up to [ADDRESS_713321] dose of study drug. Approximately 
12 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2 :1 ratio ([ADDRESS_713322] -[ZIP_CODE] vs placebo; 
[ADDRESS_713323] -[ZIP_CODE] and 4 receiving placebo) on Day 1 (Visit 3). Study treatment will be 
administered once daily for [ADDRESS_713324] of 
care (SoC) IPF therapy with pi[INVESTIGATOR_545165] (SoC  use; yes or no).  
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI scans will be conducted within 7 days prior to baseline and at or within 
7 days prior to Week 12 , as indicated in the Schedule of Events  (Appendix 1 ). 
Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 weeks of 
treatment will be encouraged to remain in the study to complete all remaining assessments; if 
this is not  feasible, they will be asked to return to the clinic for an Early Termination (ET) 
visit for follow -up evaluations. If a participant elects to withdraw from the study after the 
6th week of randomization, an end of participation 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI will be offered to 
the participant to enhance appropriate data capture.  
Potential acute exacerbations, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related 
deaths will be reviewed by [CONTACT_122371].

5.1.2 Placebo  
A corresponding matching placebo will be provided.  
5.1.3 PET Tracer   
The 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer is not considered a study treatment but is an investigational 
tool used during the PET procedure for obtaining the images necessary for this trial.  
[68Ga]CBP8  is given as an  intravenous injection within [ADDRESS_713345] -[ZIP_CODE] oral tablets will be packaged in high- density polyethylene bottles with 
desiccant canisters. Details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3 Storage and Accountability  
The study drug should be stored refrigerated at  2°C to 8°C and protected from light, whether 
at the site pharmacy or at the participant’s home.  
All used and unused study medication bottles must be returned to the study site at the 
Week  4, 8, and [ADDRESS_713346] -[ZIP_CODE] or matching placebo administered orally QD  (2 tablets)  
PLN -[ZIP_CODE] and matching placebo will be supplied by [CONTACT_39583] a tablet for oral 
administration. Study drug will be taken once daily at approximately 24- hour intervals.  
6.2 Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
There will be no dose modifications of the study drug. If the study drug needs to be 
interrupted for safety or tolerability issues, this should happen, as feasible, in consultation 
with the Sponsor Study Director, who together with the Investigator will assess and decide 
whether the study drug interruption should be temporary or permanent on a case by [CONTACT_17878]. Participants who discontinue study drug for safety reasons prior to completion of 12 
weeks of treatment will be asked to remain in the study to complete all remaining 
assessments; if this is not fe asible, then they will be asked to return to the clinic for an early 
termination visit.  
Dose modifications or interruptions of pi[INVESTIGATOR_39567] (e.g., liver enzyme elevation; se e 
Section  9), in accordance with their corresponding prescribing information and in 
consultation with the Sponsor Study Director. This should not affe ct the administration of the 
study drug or the continuation of participants in the study.  
6.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Participant  
Participants will be encouraged to take their study drug at the same time of the day, each day. Participants will take the study drug on an empty stomach (no food for 2 hours before or 
2 hours after dosing) and will drink up to 240 mL (~1 cup of water) after swallowing the 
study drug.  
 
A dose will be considered missed if the participant cannot take the dose within 12 hours of 
their regular dosing time.  
• If a participant has missed a dose of study drug and is still within 12 hours of the time it 
is usually taken, the participant should take a dose of the missed drug as soon as possible. 
The participant may then continue  the usual dosing schedule.  
• If the participant has missed a dose of study drug more than [ADDRESS_713347] -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 29  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  6.4 Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 12 eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio ([ADDRESS_713348] -[ZIP_CODE] 
vs placebo). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_39580] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_16346]) (SoC  use; yes or no).  
Assignment will be performed in a blinded manner using interactive response technology 
(IRT) based on a previously generated randomization code. Randomization will occur 
immediately  prior to dosing on the morning of the first dose (Day 1).  
6.[ADDRESS_713349] the sponsor  Study Director before unblinding any participant’s treatment assignment, 
but must do so within one working day after the event. A written explanation of the reason for unblinding should be provided to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_713350], the Investigator should consult with the sponsor Study Director as soon as 
feasible.  
Only treatment with approved SoC for IPF (nintedanib or pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]) is allowed. These 
drugs must have been given at a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_713351] -[ZIP_CODE] PK. Treatments to address IPF disease 
symptoms, (e.g., cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease, etc.) are allowed.  
Other medications to provide reasonable patient care of comorbidities are allowed during the 
study; however, these should only be used if necessary because, at this stage of development, 
no formal drug- drug interaction studies with PLN -[ADDRESS_713352] -[ZIP_CODE] concentrations; if such treatment is required, this must be discussed and 
approved by [CONTACT_545184] . 
PLN -[ZIP_CODE] is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp and multidrug toxin extrusion transporter 
(MATE1). Participants who receive substrates of these transporters should be monitored for 
potential tolerability issues.  
This includes monitoring for signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis, which has been 
reported in patients receiving metformin, a substrate for MATE1. Symptoms of lactic 
acidosis include: malaise, myalgias, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], somnolence, and abdominal pai n. 
Laboratory abnormalities include elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. If lactic acidosis is 
suspected or confirmed, metformin must be discontinued immediately, and the participant 
should undergo clinical evaluation and appropriate management. The Sponsor Study 
Director should be notified within 24  hours of any suspected or confirmed onset of 
lactic acidosis.   
Coadministration of nintedanib with P -glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may 
increase or decrease nintedanib exposure, respectively (see local prescribing information). As PLN -[ZIP_CODE] is a moderate inhibitor of P -gp (but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4), 
participants receiving nintedanib should be mo nitored for potential tolerability issues, 
including treatment -emergent elevations in liver enzymes (See Section 9). 
6.6.2 Disallowed Medications  
Treatment  with potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, 2C9 or 2C19 or, potent inhibitors 
or inducers of P -gp, BCRP or OATP1B1/1B3 transporters is prohibited. This includes 
fluconazole (a strong inhibitor of 2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of 2C9 and 3A4), which is 
disallowed.   
Treatment with digoxin, which has a narrow therapeutic window and is a substrate for P -gp, 
is not allowed since PLN -[ZIP_CODE] is a moderate inhibitor of this transporter (IC
50 9.98 µM) 
and could increase digoxin exposures.  
Use of rifampin (a potent inducer of CYP3A4) is not allowed, as it is expected to result in reduced PLN -[ADDRESS_713353]. John's wort is not allowed.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  Treatment with a disallowed medication, other investigational drug or investigational device 
is prohibited within 30 days or, in the case of medications, 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) 
before screening.  
6.7 Restrictions  
6.7.1 Prior Therapy  
Previous use of IPF SoC treatment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]) is allowed for participation in 
this study.  
6.7.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
Participants should be dosed with the study drug on an empty stomach (no food for 2 hours 
before or 2 hours after dosing). Dosing should be accompanied by [CONTACT_3450] 240 mL 
water (1 cup).  
6.7.[ADDRESS_713354] agree to use a contraceptive method with a 
failure rate of <1% per year or remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse, if that 
is their preferred and established lifestyle) during the treatment pe riod and for [ADDRESS_713355] dose of study treatment.   
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if:   
• She has not reached a postmenopausal state, defined as ≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause or 6 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle -stimulating hormone [FSH] levels 
>40 mIU/mL  
• She has not undergone surgical sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and/or bilateral oophorectomy  
Examples of contraceptiv e methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include:  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Male sterilization (>3 months from Day 1 or provide a zero sperm count)  
• Hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation (initiated >3 months from Day 1)  
• Hormone- releasing intr auterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1)  
• Copper intrauterine devices (initiated >3 months from Day 1)  
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_713356] agree to use contraceptive 
measures, as defined below, or alternately to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse)   
• Male participants, with female partners of childbearing potential, must use a condom 
plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% 
per year or  remain abstinent during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_713357] dose of study treatment.  
• Male participants with pregnant female partners are excluded from this study.  
• Male participants whose female partners become pregnant during the study must stop 
the medication immediately as outlined in Section 8.6. 
Female and Male Participants  
Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those with a failure rate of < 1% per 
year (adapted from Trussell,  2004; CTFG 2014).  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the durati on of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  Complete abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method when refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the study treatment.

Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_713360] 2 hours postdose). Additional 12‑lead ECGs may be obtained at other times if clinically 
indicated, using unscheduled visits. All ECGs should be obtained after the participant has 
rested quietly in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 10 minutes with the triplicate ECGs recorded 
within ~ 5 to 10 minutes. The triplicate ECGs will be averaged and the mean values per time 
point (average of t he 3 assessments) used to interpret the ECG tracings. QT correction will 
utilize the Fridericia Method ( Fridericia 1920).  
The Investigator (or designee) will evaluate the ECG tracings and will record 1 of the 
following interpretations on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs): normal; abnormal, not 
clinically significant; or abnormal, clinically significant. Clinically significant changes from 
baseline in ECG findings will be recorded as AEs. Refer to the ECG Manual for more 
information. 
7.7 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
7.7.1 Laboratory Parameters  
Participants will be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526]. Safety laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum chemistry and coagulation) will be collected from fasting (at least 
8 hours) participants where appropria te. Results from these safety laboratory assessments 
will be recorded in the electronic data capture (EDC) as detailed in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). including at the end of treatment or at early termination. A detailed list of 
laboratory tests is provided in Table 1. Creatinine clearance will be calculated using the 
Cockcroft- Gault equation.  
The Investigator will review the results of all laboratory tests as they become available and will ascertain if any laboratory value is abnormal or represents a clinically significant change 
from baseline for the individual participant. If a laboratory value is determined to be 
abnormal and to represent a clinically significant change from baseline for the participant, the 
Investigator will determine if it qualifies as an AE. If “yes,” the abnormality will be reported 
on the AE eCRF. All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that occur during the 
study and that were not present at baseline should be followed and evaluated with additional tests, i f necessary, until diagnosis of the underlying cause or resolution.

The actual collection time of each sample, as well as the dosing time, must be recorded in the 
source data and on the eCRF. If the participant discontinues the study early, a plasma sample for PK should be taken at the ET visit if possible.  
Aliquots of these PK samples may be used to measure nintedanib and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_545168].  
If participants experience treatment -emergent elevations in liver enzymes or ECG 
abnormalities, additional PK samples will be collected at the time of repeat laboratory or 
ECG testing (See Sections 9 and 10). 
7.10 Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
7.10.1  PET/MRI Imaging for the Assessment of Type 1 Collagen Deposition  
All PET/MRI will be performed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. PET imaging  will be performed at prespecified times 
according to the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1) using the collagen- targeted tracer, 
68Ga-CBP8 as synthesized at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and following 
predefined instructions as detailed in the Radiology Manual for the study. The radiochemical dose is up to 12.9 mCi per administration; but in practice, the dose  averages to  5.[ADDRESS_713363] . The total amount of radiation exposure from the  PET/MRI  is equal to a whole -body 
exposure up to 22 mSv (11 mSv per admin istration  of 
68GaCBP8).  Blood samples will be 
obtained prior to each PET/MRI and will be stored for future analyses. Details for blood sample collection and processing are detailed in the Radiology Manual.  
7.10.2  MRI for the Assessment of PET /MRI Relationship  
All participants will undergo dynamic contrast -enhanced MRI during each PET/MRI session. 
This will be performed using gadoterate meglumine at a predefined weight -base dose and 
injection rate, as detailed in the study’s Radiology Manual. Additional MRI sequences for anatomic assessment will be performed as detailed in the Radiology Manual.  
7.10.3  Biomarkers in Urine, Plasma, and Serum  
Urine, plasma and serum samples will be obtained at predetermined times as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1 ). These samples will be used to measure specific proteins,

causal relationship to this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or 
a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/ serious adverse 
event [SAE]).  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
- Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
- Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
- Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen

8.4 Causal Relationship of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will assess the relation ship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
AE. The Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of each AE to study drug will be 
recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, 
concomitant therapy, other  risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The following definitions 
are general guidelines to help assign grade of attribution.  
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 41  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug (PLN -[ZIP_CODE] or placebo) should be 
assessed using clinical judgment and the following considerations:  
No  
(not related):  Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study 
drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre -existing 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  
Yes 
(related):  A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration of the 
study drug that cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, the AE appears with some degree of 
certainty to be related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic 
actions or AE profile of the study drug. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
The relationship to study procedures (such as venipuncture) should be assessed using the 
following considerations:  
No 
(not related):  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other  than the study procedure  
Yes 
(related):  The AE occurred as a result of protocol -mandated procedures.  
 8.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE eCRF as follows:  
• Recovered / Resolved  
• Recovering / Resolving 
• Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae 
• Not Recovered / Not Resolving  
• Fatal  
• Unknown

participant or the female partner of a male study participant will be fo llowed through the 
outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator is required to provide all the relevant information 
to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Information Form to do so.  
The pregnancy will be followed through delivery. If the pregnancy results in a c ongenital 
anomaly/birth defects, this will be considered and reported as an SAE as per definition 
detailed in Section 8.8. 
8.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse  Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (eg, ECG, vital signs) per se are not reported as AEs. However, those 
abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant or are ass ociated with signs and/or 
symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE, as described in Section 8.2 (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious , as described in 
Section 8.8). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other abnormal findings that a re 
detected after consent or that are present at baseline and worsen after consent are included as AEs (and SAEs if serious).  
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. 
Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or 
be likely to result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, to be considered clinically 
significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical 
symptoms may jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent immediate 
consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_39597], yet be of a magnitude to require glucose 
administration to prevent such sequelae.  
8.[ADDRESS_713372] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Is life -threatening  
- An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_39571], its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Results in death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (ie, admission) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Except:

• Is an important medical event  
- An event that does not fulfill any of the serious criteria above, but is considered t o be 
clinically significant and may jeopardize the participant, or when medical or surgical intervention may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
- Examples of such events include, but are not limited to: laboratory abnormalities 
meeting  the criteria for suspected drug induced liver injury (DILI) or QT prolongation 
that lead to permanent study drug discontinuation, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment at an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.

All AEs and SAEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an open 
question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. Any clinically

Total bilirubin  0.0 – 1.0 mg/dL  
 
Participants who experience treatment -emergent elevations in serum ALT or AST that reach 
the thresholds listed below must be managed carefully:  
• ALT or AST ≥ 8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN  for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN  and (Total Bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio [INR] >1.5)  
• ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN  with liver -related symptoms including the appearance of 
fatigue , nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (> 5%)  
 
Participants must return to the study site for reevaluation within [ADDRESS_713374] dose of study drug (and that of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365], if applicable) must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
If prompt evaluation is not possible within 48 to 72 hours after receipt of the abnormal 
laboratory results, study drug should be interrupted immediately (date of last study 
drug dose [and that of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365], if applicable]  must be recorded in the 
eCRF), and the participant must return to the study site as soon as possible for reevaluation . The Sponsor Study Director  should be notified of laboratory abnormalities and 
any clinical symptoms within 48  hours of the availability of laboratory results and/or 
assessment of clinical symptoms.  
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_713375] ≥  2 × ULN  (but 
< 3 × ULN) should be managed as follows:  
• Participants  must return to the study site for reevaluation within [ADDRESS_713376] bilirubin.  
• A PK sample must be obtained at the same time that the repeat clinical laboratory 
samples are drawn, and the date and time of the PK draw and the last dose of study drug 
(and that of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365], if applicable) must be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
In the absence of liver -related symptoms and/or elevations in total bilirubin or INR, 
participants with confirmed treatment- emergent elevations in ALT or AST ≥ 2 × ULN (but 
< 3 × ULN), may continue dosing of study drug and be monitored closely with frequent (eg, 
at least once weekly) hepatic labo ratory testing and clinical assessments using unscheduled 
visits, including a thorough causality evaluation and in consultation with the Sponsor Study 
Director . 
Study drug must be permanently discontinued in the event of confirmed elevations in 
serum ALT o r AST that meet the following criteria for suspected acute DILI, based on 
the Guidance for Industry on Drug- Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation 
(FDA, 2009 ).  
Criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug for confirmed ALT or AST 
elevations: 
• Confirmed ALT or AST ≥ 3× ULN with (Total Bilirubin >  2 × ULN or INR >  1.5) 
and/or, presence of liver -related symptoms, if no other etiology is suspected/confirmed 
and liver enzymes are sustained following interruption of study drug  
• Confirmed A LT or AST ≥ 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks, if no other etiology is 
suspected/confirmed and liver enzymes are sustained following interruption of study drug  
• Confirmed ALT or AST ≥ 8× ULN, if no other etiology is suspected/confirmed and liver enzymes are sus tained following interruption of study drug  
 
All elevations in serum ALT and/or AST that are confirmed upon repeat testing AND 
that meet the criteria for suspected DILI (as listed above) must be reported to the 
Sponsor Study Director within [ADDRESS_713377] permanently discontinue 
study drug immediately and continue to be followed for close monitoring and causality 
and clinical evaluation as follows:  
• Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests at least once a week until abnormalities 
stabilize (i.e., levels are clinically comparable to baseline values or baseline grade of 
abnormality) and the participant is asymptomatic  
• Obtain a detailed history of symptoms and prior or concomitant diseases  
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 47  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  • Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription or over -the-counter 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational 
drug use, and special diets  
• Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; alcoholic hepatitis; 
hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
• Obtain immunoglobulin G1 (IgG -1), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti -smooth muscle 
antibody (anti -SMA), anti -liver-kidney microsome type  1 (anti -LKM1), and anti -liver 
cytosolic antigen type  1 (anti -LC1) levels to be compared with  baseline values, to rule 
out autoimmune hepatitis  
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents  
• Consider a gastroenterology or hepatology consultation, which may include a liver biopsy, for definite diagnosis  
 
For participants with confirmed elevations in liver enzymes (as described above) warranting 
temporary interruption of study drug but not meeting permanent drug discontinuation criteria 
as stated above, more frequent hepatic laboratory testing and clinical assessments must be 
conducted using unscheduled visits, including a thorough causality evaluation and in consultation with the Sponsor Study Director .  
Reinitiation of study drug can only be considered if another etiology is identified and 
confirmed and if  liver abnormalities have returned to baseline values. The decision to 
restart study drug must be discussed and approved in consultation with the Sponsor 
Study Director prior to reinitiation .  
Participants who permanently discontinue study drug due to pote ntial liver toxicity must be 
followed for close monitoring until abnormalities stabilize to baseline levels or baseline 
grade of abnormality and the participant is asymptomatic. Participants should be encouraged 
to remain in the study and completed all scheduled visits and assessments. Long- term 
follow- up information should be provided for participants who permanently discontinue drug 
due to potential liver toxicity, including information on immunosuppressive therapy and new 
liver histology.

Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 General Considerations  
This is an exploratory study, with exploratory efficacy and biomarker assessments; as such, 
no statistical hypotheses are being tested. In general, data will be summarized using 
statistical summary methods; graphic presentations of data may also be prepared. A statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), prepared and agreed before final database lock, will describe the 
analytic approach and methods in mor e detail.  
12.2 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of approximately 12 participants ([ADDRESS_713383] -[ZIP_CODE] and 4 receiving placebo) is expected to provide a meaningful evaluation of 
PLN -[ZIP_CODE] safety, tolerability and PK in the target population, and add to the data of 
approximately 21 participants planned to be evaluated at this dose level in an ongoing 
multicenter, dose ranging Phase 2a study (PLN -[ZIP_CODE]- IPF-202).  
12.3 Analysis Populations  
Safety Population:  All rand omized participants who receive at least one dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety analyses.  
PK Analysis Population:  All randomized participants who have sufficient PLN -[ZIP_CODE] 
concentration data for PK calculation will be included in the PK anal yses.  
PD Analysis Population:  All randomized participants who receive any amount of study drug 
and who have results from Baseline and from at least one post -baseline PET/MRI scan or PD 
assessment will be included in the PD analyses.  
12.4 Demographics and Basel ine Characteristics  
Data will be summarized using statistical summary methods.  
12.5 Primary Endpoints  
12.5.1  Primary Pharmacodynamic Endpoint  
• Quantification of type 1 collagen in the lung following 12 weeks of treatment, as assessed 
by [CONTACT_462147] 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI tracer uptake patterns.  
 
If a participant elects to withdraw from the study after the 6th week of randomization , an end 
of participation 68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI will be offered to the participant to enhance 
appropriate data capture.  
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 53  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Pliant Therapeutics, Inc.  PET/ MRI  
PET/MRI s cans will be interpreted by [CONTACT_545177] (ABNM) -
certified nuclear medicine physicians in an unblinded manner. Lung contours will be 
generated from baseline and post -treatment PET/MRI. Mean and maximum standardized 
uptake value (SUV) measurements of contoured lungs will be calculated using MIMS software, by [CONTACT_545178] 
68Ga-CBP8 PET/MRI within the lung, and by 
[CONTACT_545179] -treatment scans. Numerical and graphical 
results will be presente d by [CONTACT_2715].  
In addition, relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and PET imaging, may be evaluated in an exploratory fashion and presented in a 
graphical manner (see Section 12.7.1 ). 
12.6 Secondary Endpoints  
12.6.1  Secondary Safety Endpoint  
• Assessment of the safety and tolerability of PLN -[ADDRESS_713384] study visit. Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that 
emerged or worsened in severity after the first administration of study drug.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA®). All 
AEs will be graded for severity per the CTCAE grading scale and listed by [CONTACT_545187].  
The incidence of AEs, the incidence of TEAEs, the incidence of treatment -related AEs, and 
the severity of AEs will be summarize d by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and maximum 
severity. In cases where a participant reports multiple occurrences of the same event 
(preferred term), the greatest severity will be included in the summary. The number and 
percentage of participants with SAEs and treatment -related SAEs, and the number and 
percentage of participants who withdraw due to an AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_545188].  
Clinical laboratory test parameters will be listed, using the CTCAE grading scale, for 
individual par ticipants, with values outside the reference ranges flagged. The incidence of 
treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by [CONTACT_926]. Summary 
statistics will be calculated for each parameter.  
Individual ECG results will be listed for each participant. Summaries of ECGs will include changes from baseline for each parameter. The number and percentage of participants with abnormal ECGs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].  
Protocol PLN -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_713385] current World Health Organization drug dictionary available.  
12.7 Exploratory Endpoints  
12.7.1  Exploratory Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
• Relationship between PLN -[ADDRESS_713386] -[ZIP_CODE]-versus- time profiles (with 
plasma concentrations on both a log and linear scale) will be plotted for each participant. 
Non-compartmental analysis will be used to calculate PK parameters as appropriate. Plasma 
PK parameters will be presented in listings and summarized with descriptive statistics. The 
data will also be presented graphically.  
Further details of the analyses will be provided in the SAP to be prepared and agreed prior to 
final ‘database lo ck’ at the end of the study. The PK analysis plan and report may be 
prepared separately from the SAP as appropriate.  
PET/MRI  
Relationships between PK and type 1 collagen deposition, as well as between MRI and PET imaging, may be evaluated in an exploratory  fashion and presented in a graphical manner. 
The analysis of PET/MRI imaging is described in Section 12.5.1. 
Pharmacodynamics: Biomarkers  
Urine, pla sma, and serum samples will be analyzed for biomarkers (presence or actual 
concentration). These samples will be used to determine the levels of these markers in 
participants, the relationship between these markers, and the level of PET tracer uptake 
(type 1 collagen deposition) in the lung. Results will be presented in listings and summarized 
with descriptive statistics and in graphical form.  
12.7.2  Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)  
• Absolute FVC volume and FVC as percent of predicted as a ssessed by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_545172] (mL) will be assessed using the standard spi[INVESTIGATOR_545173] -[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-205, Amendment 1, 4 October 2021 Page 55

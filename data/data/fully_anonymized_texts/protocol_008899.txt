The term “ chemotherap y

the study  design and the 
associated secondary  
objective to study  
tolerability  in pediatric 
patients with GI ST.
Multiple changes were made 
according the new [COMPANY_007] 
standard safet y language for

significant change insafety  
language is the following in 
Section 8.2 Reporting 
Period
: Should an 
investigator be made aware 
of an y SAE occurring any 
time after the active 
reporting period, it must be 
promptly  reported.  
Previously , this SAE 
reporting required a 
potential caus

to the study  drug.
A change in contraception 
language for the [LOCATION_006] was 
made at the request of the

Administrative changes and 
clarifications made 
throughout .
Amendment 2 31 July  2017 The number of patients to be 
enrolled in the study  (in the 
range of age from 6 to < 18)  
hasbeen reduced from 15 to 
6evaluable patien ts. 
The centralized review of 
imaging ( ie,MRI , CT scans 
etc) aimed to confirm the 
efficacy  endpoint is no 
longer required.
As this study  is part of a PIP, 
both these changes above 
have been agreed with 
PDCO and are aligned with 
the PI P binding elements. 
Rationale for changes are as 
follow:
The primary  
objective of the 
study  is thecharacteriz ation 
of plasma PK profile of 
sunitinib and its active 
metabolite in patients with
unresectable GIST.  
A total 
of six pediatric patients
have been included in the 
study  as of today ,andthe 
enrollment of additional 
patient is unlikely due to the 
rarity of the disease.
  
Recognizing this number is 
lower than originall y 
planned it still allows the 
characterization of the pk 
profile in pediatric patients 
i.e 
the anal ysis of the
primary  endpoints of the

In regards to the centraliz ed
review of imagine, this is 
considered no longer 
necessary due to the small 
number of patients enrolled, 
and in absence of PR or CR.
The wording related to the 
reporting of SAE has been 
aligned with the current 
protocol template .
New text: SAEs occurring to 
a patient after the active 
collection period has ended 
should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator 
becomes aware of them; at a 
minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at 
least a reasonable possibility  
of being related to 
investigational product are 
reported to the sponsor.

Page 5PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a tumor of mesench ymal origin occurring in the 
gastrointestinal tract.  GIST is a very  rare and newly  recognized tumor in children.  Pediatric 
GIST has a different clinical behavior and biology  than ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_292076].  The majority  of 
pediatric GI ST occur sin females, and these tumors commonly  do not bear the genetic 
mutations present in adults with GI ST.
Sunitinib (SUTENT) received approval from the US FDA and the European Medicines 
Agency  (EMA) in [ADDRESS_356439] after disease progression on or intolerance 
to imatinib mesy late.  Following negotiations with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO), 
the sponsor ([COMPANY_007]) agreed to conduct this single agent, open -label, single arm, multi-
centre 
trial of sunitinib to investigate the use of sunitinib for thetreatment of pediatric GI ST, 
collecting safet y, pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy data in at least 6children aged [ADDRESS_356440].  Secondary  objectiv es include evaluation of whether doses greater than the established 
pediatric maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are tolerated in pediatric patients with GI ST, and 
the safet y, tolerability , and anti -tumor activity  of sunitinib in children and young patients 
with GIST.  The study  will explore PK -pharmacody namic relationships with respect to safet y 
and efficacy if data allows.  The primary  endpoint will be the PK parameters of sunitinib and 
its main active metabolite including total plasma exposure (AUC24) and oral clearance 
(CL/F).  Secondary  endpoints will include the definition of adverse events and laboratory  
abnormalities, the objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression -free 
survival (PFS), and the overall survival (OS) at [ADDRESS_356441] will be detailed, if data allows. 
Study  Design: This study is a single arm, multi -center, multi -national, trial evaluating the 
PK, safet y and preliminary  anti- tumor efficacy  of sunitinib in children and young adult s 
diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST.  The study  aims to enroll 6 evaluable children 
aged 6 years to less than 18 years.  In addition, up to 15 young adult s aged 18 years to less 
than 21 years may  beenrolled.  The starting dose of sunitinib in children will be 
approximatel y 15mg/m2/day for 4 weeks followed by  2weeks with no study  drug, using the 
MTD established during the pediatric Phase 1clinical trial conducted b y the C hildren’s 
Oncology  Group.  Intrapatient dose escalation of sunitinib will be allowed, based on 
tolerability .  Investigators will have the option to access real -time PK results to aid in dosing 
decisions.  Sunitinib dosing for the young adult s will follow a pproved guidelines (per current 
USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_65073]).  Study treatment for all patients may  continue for up to 18 cycles, equaling 
approximatel y 2years of therap y.

1.Tumor characteristics : Tumor KIT, PDGFRA, and BRAF genotype and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) protein expression by [CONTACT_9064].   
If some or all of these have not been previously done , tumor specimens may be sent for analysis during screening.  For patients with no available, 
previously collected tumor tissue and incomplete testing information covering all of the above tests, a core biopsy is requir ed, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], a biopsy would create an unacceptable risk to the patient. Refer to Section 6.1for additional details and exceptions .
2.Day 1 Assessments: Physical examination, hematology, blood c hemistry and urinalysis are not required if acceptable screening assessment s are obtained 
within 7 days prior to the start of study treatment without suggestion of clinical deterioration. Day 1of subsequent cycles may commence up to tw o day s 
prior to the scheduled Day 1 visit until one day after the scheduled visit (ie,the washout period can be from 12 -15days).
3.D15 visit.   Day 15 of Cycle 1 is a mandatory visit, which includes PK, lab tests, and physical exam.  For Cycles 2 and 3 a Day 15 visit is req uired if dose 
escalation occurs during that cycle, and includes PK, lab tests, and physical exam.  Beyond Cycle 3 Day 15visits will only occur if a dose escalation 
occurs or as clinically indicated.  PK w ill not be collected at these additional Day 15 visits but lab tests and physical exam will be performed.
4.End of Treatment/Withdrawal: Assessments (See Section 6.4.1 ) not required if performed within 1 week of study withdrawal (within the las t 8weeks 
for radiological tumor assessments).
5.Medical/Oncologic History and Demographics: Includes demographics, oncologic history, history of other diseases (active or resolved), concomitant 
illnesses, and information on prior cancer treatments includin g best response observed.  Changes in blood pressure medications (new prescriptions, 
discontinuations, or changes in dose) w ill also be recorded.

screening and Day 1 of each cycle and at EOT for pediatric patients.  Examination of major body systems; vital signs to include temperatu re, blood 
pressure (see Section 5.2.11 for guidelines), heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  Abnormal physical examination findings after screening will be reported as
adverse events. Patients below the age of 11 who turn 11 while on-study will then require ECOG performance evaluations.
7.Hem atology & Chemistry: Required safety tests are also listed in Section 7.2.2 .  These include white blood count with differential, he moglobin, and 
platelets; sodium, potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinin e, glucose, uric acid, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, total 
bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosph atase, total protein, albumin, amylase, and lipase.  At any 
time after initiation of dosing if liver function test s are abnormal refer to Section 8.5.2 for guidelines. On visits that do not include dispensation of study 
drug, t hese tests may be performed by [CONTACT_292093].
8.TSH at screen and Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4, follow ed by  [CONTACT_2006]  1of every even cycle (ie, 6, 8, 10…etc.) thereafter (see also Section 6.2). Prothrom bin 
time: PT orINR at screening, then as clinically indicated.  When performed, the same test should be used.
9.Urinalysis: During screen ing and Cycles [ADDRESS_356444] indicate a ≥2+ proteinuria, then follow -up should be performed with a quantitative urine protein analysis a ccording to local standard 
practices, w ith data captured on the AE CRF if AE criteria are met.
10.Pregnancy Test: Urine test required for all females above age [ADDRESS_356445] dose of sunitinib, on Day 1 of each 
cycle, and at the end of treatment.  Patients of less than 11 yrs at study start who turn 11 while on -study will then require pregnancy testing per the 
Schedule of Activities . Refer to Section 7.2.3 for details.
11.PK sam pling: All PK samples collected before and on the Cycle 1 Day 28Visit should be shipped immediately to BASi Lab for bio-analysis; refer to 
Section 7.1for details.  Optional Visit Days are C1D7 (D4-D10, inclusive) and C1D2 1(D18 -D24, inclusive); refer to Section 7.1for details.
12.Sunitinib dosing: Sunitinib will be dosed Days [ADDRESS_356446] 28 days of each cycle with the exception of 
study visit da ys on which the dose for that day should be withheld until immediately after the completion of all study visit day activities and the 
investigator’s approval for continued dosing. See Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_356447] radiograph at screening and as clinically indicated. Patients who undergo Tumor Imaging (MRI or CT scan) that includes the chest do not need to 
have a Chest radiograph performed.
14.Tumor Im aging: MRI (or CT scan) of abdomen and pe lvis and any other applicable sites of disease at screening, within 14 days prior to the end of each 
even numbered cycle (Day 28, preferably), whenever disease progression is suspected, to confirm a partial or complete respons e (at least 4 weeks after 
initial documentation of response), and at the End of Treatm ent/Withdraw al (Refer to Section 7.4).
15.FDG -PET at baseline and at the cycle 1 day 28visit (i f locally available; see Section 7.4).
16.ECG: Three consecutive 12 -lead ECGs approximately 2 minutes apart will be performed at screening, on Cycle 2, Day 1 and at the end of treatment to 
determine the mean QTc interval.  Attempts sho uld be made for the ECGs to be performed in the morning and time -matched (1hour) w ith screening 
assessment.  ECGs should be done before blood is drawn or 30 minutes afterwards.  If the mean QTc interval is prolonged (>500 msec), the ECGs should 
be read by a cardiologist at the site for confirmation.  Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.  ECG should be per formed 
approximately 2 weeks following any sunitinib dose escalation.
17.Echocardiogram  or MUGA scan at screening, then on Day 1 of every 3rdcycle (for example, Day 1 Cycle 3, Day 1 Cycle 6 ..etc.).  As clinically 
indicated at the end of t reatment/withdrawal per Section 6.3.1 and see suggested dose modifications guidelines for left ventricular systolic dysfunction in

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a tumor of mesench ymal origin oc curring in the 
gastrointestinal tract.  GIST is a very  rare and newly  recognized tumor in children.  Pediatric 
GIST has a different clinical behavior and biology  than ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_292076].1-3In contrast to 
GIST in adults, the vast majority  of pediatric GI ST occur in females, lack large scale 
chromosomal aberrations, and lack the characteristic mutations in KITor PDGFRA .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_292077] y, most 
pediatric patients survive with active disease for many  years, suggesting a more indolent 
clinical course than observed with adult GI ST.4-7Further evidence supporting a distinct 
biology  comes from recently  published reports of differing gene- expression profiles and 
genetic progression mechanisms in p ediatric GI ST versus adult GIST.8While most pediatric 
GIST lack KITmutations, KIT is expressed and activated, suggesting that inhibition of KI T 
may have clinical efficacy  in these tumors.1In vitro data show that sunitinib’s IC50is 
90% lower than imatinib’s I C50 for mutation -negative KIT.  Earl y clinical studies seem to 
correspond with the in vitro data.  Clinical benefit rate (defined as partial response [PR] or 
stable disease [SD] in KITmutation -negative GI ST is 56% versus 34% in adult, KIT
mutation -positive GI ST.9Median OS was also significantly  longer for adult patients with 
exon 9KITmutations (26.9 months) or a mutation- negative genot ype (30.5 months) than for 
those with e xon 11 mutations (12.3 months).  Neither PFS nor OS differed significantly  
between patients with exon [ADDRESS_356460] mutations in succinate 
dehy drogenase ( SDH ).10Such mutations result in a loss of SDH expression in these tumors 
that can be assessed b y immunohistochemistry .  A loss in SDH expression could potentially  
result in increases in intra- tumor VEGF expression.  Antitumor activity  has been reported 
with sunitinib, which targets the VEGF signaling pathway , in a cohort of pediatric patients 
with imatinib -resistant, predominantly  KITmutation -negative GI ST.5One of seven of these 
patients achieved PR, five patients had SD and one patient had PD on sunitinib.  I n most 
pediatric patients treated with imatinib followed by  [CONTACT_292095], the time to progression on 
sunitinib was longer than on prior imatinib.

1.3.Introduction/Rationale for Development
Receptor t yrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins containing extracellular 
ligand- binding domains and intracellular catal ytic domains.  RTKs are activated following 
binding of their cognate ligands, and man y of the processes involved in tumor growth,

Page 17progression, and metastases are mediated b y signaling molecules acting downstream fro m 
these proteins.11,12Several members of the split -kinase domain famil y of RTKs are 
implicated in deregulated/autocrine proliferation and survival of solid and hema tologic 
cancer cells, including the platelet -derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR and ); 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) Ty pe 1 and 2 (FLT1 and FL K1/KDR); 
the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, KIT; and the FL T3-ligand receptor.  In addition, PDGFR 
and VEGFR are implicated in tumor- dependent angiogenesis.
RTKs play  a critical role in embry onic development and are potent mediators of vascular 
endothelial cell and malignant proliferation.13Inhibitors of the RTKs, such as sunitinib, 
target mediators of tumor -related angiogenesis and cellular survival. 
1.3.1. Sunitinib
Sunitinib malate is an orally -bioavailable, small -molecule RTK inhibitor that antagonizes 
cellular signaling of multiple targets inv olved in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, with 
specific activity  against VEGFR, PDGFR, KI T, FLT-[ADDRESS_356461] indicated 
that sunitinib selective ly inhibits Class 3 (PDGF) and Class 5 (VEGF) RTKs, and inhibits 
RTK phosphory lation in vivo .  Sunitinib has shown in vivo activity  in decreasing 
VEGF -induced vascular permeability , RTK phosphory lation and tumor grown in murine 
xenograft models.16-20
In 2006, sunitinib (SUTENT) was approved b y the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) for the treatment of GIST after disease 
progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesy late and for the treatment of advanced renal 
cell carcinoma.21,23SUTENT was also approved by [CONTACT_292096] 2010 and by  [CONTACT_40563] 2011.
Following negotiations with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO), the sponsor ([COMPANY_007]) 
agreed to conduct this single agent, open -label, single arm, multi- centre trial of sunitinib to 
investigate the use of sunitinib for treatment of pediatric GIST, collecting safet y, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy  data in 6children aged [ADDRESS_356462] identified a 50 mg dose on the Schedule 4/2 (4weeks of therap y 
followed b y a 2 -week off period) as a tolerable, dose dense regimen.22,24Stead y state levels 
of sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662 are reached 7 -10days after repeated dail y 
dosing.  Drug accumulation with repeated 4 -or 6-week cy cles has not been observed.  No 
dose-dependent changes in Tmax or t 1/2have been observed.  Sunitinib is metabolized 
primarily  by [CONTACT_292097] P450 enzyme, 3A4 (CYP3A4).  The ter minal elimination 
half-lives of sunitinib and SU012662 are approximately  40hours and 80 hours, respectively .  
Fatigue/asthenia is the primary  dose limiting toxicity  (DLT); adverse events attributed to 
sunitinib, independent of treatment schedule have been constitutional (eg, fatigue/asthenia),

A multicenter, international, randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 3clinical trial 
A6181004 was halted after the planned interim analy sis demonstrated efficacy  of sunitinib in 
adult GI ST patients following failure of imatinib.  Sunitinib, administ ered at 50 mg once

Page 211.3.4. Pediatric Phase I Clinical Trial (ADVL0 612)
A Phase I stud y conducted by  [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology  Group (COG), ADVL 0612, was 
designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sunitinib in patients aged [ADDRESS_356467] 12.5 mg.
Twen ty-three patients were treated on Amendments A and B (protocol amendment explained 
below).  The median age was 13.9 years; (range, 3.9 – 20.6 years).  Table 4 summarizes the 
DLTs.  At the starting dose of 20 mg/m2(approximately  80% of the approved adult d ose), 
DLTs included grade 2 systolic dy sfunction, grade 3 anorexia and grade 4 neutropenia.  The 
sunitinib dose was then de- escalated to 15 mg/m2.  DL Ts in this cohort included prolonged 
grade 3 ALT elevation in 1 patient, and grade 3 diastolic plus grade 2systolic dy sfunction in 
a patient who had received maximal anthracy cline therapy  in addition to cardiac radiation 
exposure.  A detailed evaluation of both cases of reversible cardiac d ysfunction indicated that 
these patients had received cumulative doxor ubicin doses of either 
157mg/m2(grade 2systolic dy sfunction) or 347 mg/m2(grade 2 systolic dy sfunction) prior 
to entering the Phase I study .  There were also [ADDRESS_356468] been due in part to anthracy cline exposure and 
in one case compounded by  [CONTACT_292098].  Therefore, the protocol was 
amended (Part B) to exclude pati ents with prior anthracy cline or cardiac radiation exposure 
in addition to those with known bone marrow metastasis.

Eigh t patients were enrolled on Part B of the study at a starting dose of 15 mg/m2.  Two 
patients suffered early disease progression, therefore were not evaluable for DLT.  None of 
the 6 evaluable patients treated at this dose level experienced DLT.  Subsequen tly, 2of 
3patients treated at 20 mg/m2experienced DLT, including grade [ADDRESS_356469] been related to the natural history  of disease,25a possible attribution to

patients without prior cardiac radiation or anthracy cline exposure.  No cardiac dy sfunction 
was observed in Part B of the trial.
Patient characteristics and other safet y results are summarized in Appendix 2.  Neutrope nia, 
thrombocy topenia, and transaminase elevation were the most commonly  reported toxicities.  
Gastrointestinal sy mptoms and fatigue were the most commonly  reported sy mptoms. 
1.3.5. ADVL0612 Sunitinib Pharmacokinetic Profile
In the pediatric Phase 1 study , stead y state concentrations of sunitinib, the active metabolite 
SU012662 ,and total drug (sunitinib + SU012662) were reached b y Day 7.  Five of 
14patients (36%) at the 15 mg/m2dose level and five of nine patients (56%) at the 
20mg/m2dose level had steady -state total drug trough concentrations >50 ng/mL , the target 
total drug concentration for RTK inhibition based on preclinical studies.11Nine patients 
participated in the extended PK sampling study .  A median pea k sunitinib plasma 
concentration of 16.8 ng/mL  (range 9.5 – 61.4) was achieved [ADDRESS_356470] dose.  
Median values of the sunitinib and SU012662 half-
life, based on the accumulation ratios 
calculated from the steady -state data were 38.7 (range 23.9 – 61.7) and 93.4 (range 47.4 –
176) hours, respectivel y. 
1.3.6. Application of ADVL0612 PK Results to Young Patients with GIST
ADVL0612 has several features limiting its applicability  to the pediatric GIST population.  
Many  patients enrolled on ADVL0612 were heavily  pre-treated with chemotherap y and/or 
radiation therap y while pediatric GIST patients will not have received multiple cy cles of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy  prior to sunitinib.
At the established pediatric MTD, the C maxand AUC 48are both below the levels observed in 
adult patients with GI ST during sunitinib therapy .  The adult daily  dose of 50 mg is equal to 
a body  surface area ( BSA )-corrected dose of approximately  30mg/m2(ie, 50 mg /
1.73 m230mg/m2).  In adults who require a dose reduction, the dail y dose of 37.5 mg is 
equal to a BSA- corrected dose of approximatel y 22 mg/m2(ie, 37.5 mg / 1.73 m2
22mg/m2).  A recent meta -analysis indicates that increased steady -state AUC of sunitinib 
and response probability , with AUC significantly  associated with improved stable disease in 
patients with GI ST.26
Based on the preliminary population PK analysis from ADVL0612, the oral clearance and 
volume of distribution in pediatric patients appeared to correlate with BS A.  When corrected 
for BSA, the oral clearance of sunitinib in children appeared to be similar to that in adult 
patients (anal ysis data in house).  However, since the MTD from this study  was lower than 
that observed in adult patients (ie, 15 mg/m2versus 30 mg/m2), the steady  state trough total 
drug concentrations fell below target concentrations (50 ng/mL , based on preclinical data) in 
9 of 14 (64%) patients.  While peak concentrations would be predicted to exceed this target 

Sunitinib malate
A6181196
Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_356471] patients 
treated at the 15 mg/m2dose.  Therefore, to achieve the optimal plasma concentrations, 
intra-patient dose escalation up to the adult MTD of 30 mg/m2per day has been incorporated 
into the study  design based on individual patient tolerability .  Since the incidence of DLT at 
15mg/m2in children is lower than those seen at the adult MTD of 30 mg/m2, it would be 
expected that the majority of pediatric patients would qualify  for intra -patient dose 
escalation.
To ensure that the plasma concentrations of sunitinib and its active metabolite in p ediatric 
GIST patients are comparable to that in adult GIST patients, the PK samples collected in 
Cycle1(after collection of Day  28of Cycle 1) will be batched together and sent immediately  
to the designated lab (ie, BASi) for bio- analysis.  Following the preliminary  quantification of 
sunitinib and its active metabolite in plasma samples, the preliminary  concentration data will 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] I nc. for P K analy sis.  Following the PK anal ysis using NONMEM or other 
approaches, the stead y state plasma total exposures will be estimated for that individual 
patient and compared to the plasma total exposures observed in adults GIST patients from 
historical data.   The PK analy sis results, in addition to the comparative analy sis, will be 
provided to the investigator as soon as possible, hopefully  prior to starting Cy cle 2 therap y.  
In addition to the patient’s safet y and tolerability data from C ycle 1, the PK data will be 
available to the treating investigator to guide a decision on the patient’s dose for C ycle [ADDRESS_356472].  The characterization of the PK profile of 
sunitinib and its active metabol ite has been selected as the primary  endpoint of this study  for 
the following reasons: 1 ) PK data for sunitinib and its active metabolite in p ediatric GI ST 
patients are lacking, 2) additional sunitinib PK data are needed to combine with the 
Phase 1pediatr ic data to more accurately  describe the PK profile of sunitinib and its active 
metabolite in children, and to identify  the fixed effect sources of variability  in children, 3) the 
PK data will be used to perform PK -PD modeling for both safet y and potentiall y efficacy 
endpoints to improve our understanding of the relationship between safet y and efficacy  and 
plasma drug concentrations, and 4) the PK samples may be used to facilitate the 
dose-optimization process in each individual pediatric patient.

5.2.2. Preparation and Dispensing
Sunitinib capsules will be dispensed at the beginning of each treatment cy cle. New drug 
supply  will be suppli ed at the start of each cy cle.  In the event of dose modification (and in 
consultation with study  team )where the patient has sufficient drug of the appropriate 
strengths to finish that current cy cle, new drug may  not be dispensed.
Only  qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
them and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of 
anti-cancer agents.
5.2.3. Sunitinib Administration
A cy cle of therap y is considered to be 42 days, with the reporting period for each cy cle being 
Day 1to Day  42.  For all patients, sunitinib will be dosed intermittently  [4weeks on stud y 
drug followed b y 2weeks off therap y (Schedule 4/2) ].
Sunitinib can be taken without regard to meals, but the incidence of drug-
associated nausea 
may be less when taken with food.  Therefore, it is recommended that sunitinib be taken with 
at least a small amount of food. 
Self-administration of sunitinib capsules will take place on an outpatient basis (under 
parent/legal gu ardian supervision as appropriate) except on days when PK sampling is 
performed.  Capsules should be taken once dail y in the morning on the first 28 days of each 
cycle with the exception of study  visit day s on which the dose for that day  should be 
withheld until immediately  after the completion of all study  visit day  activities and the 
investigator’s approval for continued dosing. Capsules must be administered whole, not 
opened, or manipulated prior to administration.
In the absence of progressive disease, patients may  receive up to [ADDRESS_356482], at the wrong time, or at th e wrong dosate strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, th e sponsor should be notified 
immediately .

Page 30Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product. 
Potential medication errors or uses ou tside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or 
do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.
Patients should take a missed dose as soon as they remember .  However, patients should not 
take the dose if it is close to the next dose.  Instead, patients should tak e the next dose at the 
regular time.  Patients should not take more than one dose of study  drug at a time.  The study  
drug may  be re -administered (after 1hr) in the case of vomiting if this event occurs within 
15min after administration or if all intact s tudy drug capsules are observed in the vomitus. 
5.2.5. For Children (age less than 18 years at enrollment)
Dosing for all cy cles will be based on the BSA obtained at the start of each cy cle. 
BSA for dosing should be calculated using the Mosteller formula.28
BSA in m2= [(height in cm x weight in kg)/3600]1/2
http://www.halls.md/body- surface -area/bsa.htm
The sunitinib intended starting dose will be 15 mg/m2/day (not to exceed 50 mg/day ) on 
Schedule 4/2 .(See Appendix 6).
Intra -patient dose escalation of sunitinib will be allowed after completion of Cy cle 1 based 
on dose modification guidelines detailed in Section 5.2.8. Dose escalation will be in 
increments of 7.5 mg/m2, up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/m2(notto exceed 50 mg/day ).  
The dose and the dose change increments will be rounded to the nearest number which is a 
multiple of 6.[ADDRESS_356483] dose stre ngth available.   After Cy cle 1, when the minimum 
frequency  of clinic visits is reduced, an additional Day  15visit is required if the sunitinib 
dose is escalated during that cy cle.
At each dose level (mg/m2), based on each individual patient body  surface a rea (BSA )the 
calculated total dose in mg is rounded to the nearest number which is a multiple of 6.[ADDRESS_356484] dose strength available (See Table 5for the available doses).  The rounded doses 
considering an individual pati ent’s BSA for daily  Dose Levels of 15 mg/m2, 22.5 mg/m2and 
30mg/m2have been provided in Appendix 6
.

5.2.8. Dose Modifications
Patients will be monitored for toxicity , and the sunitinib dose may  be adjusted according to 
individual patient tolerance at the discretion of the investigator.  The available doses were 
presented in Table 5above .  After C ycle 3, when the frequency  of clinic visits may  be 
reduced to a minimum of once per cy cle, investigators may  wish to include more frequent 
visits for assessment of blood pressure and/or to perform clinically  indicated laboratory  tests 
if sunitini b related toxicities are expected or observed.  The following are suggested 
guidelines that investigators may  use as a reference. 
For 
patients < 18yrs, intra -patient dose escalation of sunitinib will be allowed after 
completion of Cy cle 1 and/or later cy cles, and in the absence of toxicit y greater than 
Grade 1in the prior cy cle, with exceptions listed in the footnotes to Table 6.  Dose escalation 
will be in increments of 7.5 mg/m2, up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/m2(not to exceed 
50mg/day ).  The sunitinib dose may be reduced in response to toxicities based on 
investigator discretion ,with general guidelines listed in Table 6. Dose reductions in patients 
<18y rs will be in decrements of 7.5mg/m2.For y oung adults aged 18 -<21years, inclusive, 
the intra- patient dose modification will be in 12.5 mg increments or decrements, consistent 
with Sutentdrug label recommendation.
Sunitinib will be held for Grade 3 and 4 toxicities until the toxicity  decreases to 
Grade 1 (Grade 2 for hematologic toxicities) or baseline, at which point sunitinib will be 
resumed as detailed in Table 6below.  Re -escalation will be permitted with appropriate 
supportive care and monitoring at the discretion of the investigator.

diarrhea should persist at Grade [ADDRESS_356486] be removed from protocol therap y.
For Young Adults
For y oung adults, dose interruption and/or modific ation in 12.5 mg increments or decrements 
are recommended, based on individual safety  and tolerability .  The adult minimum 
acceptable dose for the purpose of this study  is 25 mg/day .

5.2.11. Management of Sunitinib -induced Hypertension
Baseline blood pressure (BP) is defined as the BP obtained at the examination used for study  
enrollment as follows: 
1.Measurements should begin after at least [ADDRESS_356488] 80% of the 
arm.
2.Obtain [ADDRESS_356489] measurements. 
5.The baseline BP is the average of the s ystolic over the average of the diastolic BP 
measurements.  This average BP should be recorded in the CRF as the baseline BP.
Hypertension , defined as elevation of either the sy stolic or diastolic BP, should be 
considered per the following criteria:
For children and adolescents, hy pertension is defined as a s ystolic and/or diastolic BP 
that on repeated measurement is 95thpercentile for age, height and gender.  Refer to 
Appendix 3.
Utilize NCI  CTCAE v4.0 to determine the grade of hy pertension for both pediatric 
patients and young adults.
Elevated BP measurements should be confirmed on the same day .  Patients with 
elevated BP should have BP measurements performed at least twice weekly until BP 
is consistently  <95thpercentile for age, height and gender.

1.Suggested hy pertension management guidelines for pediatric patients are p rovided 
below; alternativel y, hypertension may  be managed according to investigator discretion.  
However, In case of Grade 4 hypertension , the patient should be permanently  
discontinued from the trial and anti- hypertensive therapy  should be administered as
clinically  indicated.
2.If the average s ystolic and/or diastolic BP is < 95thpercentile for age, height and gender, 
continue sunitinib at the same dose.
3.If the average s ystolic and/or diastolic BP is greater than the 95thpercentile and
10mmHg higher than the 
95thpercentile , continue sunitinib at the same dose and 
recheck BP twice weekl y. BP can be measured at a study  site-approved local clinic as 
long as protocol guidelines are followed closel y, and study  site is involved with clinical 
decisions.
a.Upon r echeck, if the average BP is < 95thpercentile , continue sunitinib at the same 
dose;
b.If the BP continues to be 95thpercentile , when measured at least twice over a two 
week period, start anti -hypertensive therap y, continue sun itinib at the same dose, and 
monitor BP twice weekly.
4.If the average s ystolic and/or diastolic BP is 11-
25mmHg above the 95thpercentile
recheck BP twice weekl y.  If the BP continues to be >11 mmHg above the 95thpercentile
over a two week period (in at least 2 out of 3 average BP mea surements) start 
anti-hypertensive therapy, continue sunitinib at the same dose and monitor BP twice 
weekl y;
a.If the average BP returns to < 95thpercentile within 14 days, continue sunitinib at the 
same dose and continue anti -hypertensive therapy ;
b.If the av erage BP remains elevated 25mmHg above the 95thpercentile for more 
than two weeks after the institution of antihy pertensive therapy , hold sunitinib, 
monitor BP at least twice weekl y;
If the average BP returns to <95thpercentile within two weeks, restar t sunitinib at 
a reduced dose (reduce by  7.5mg/m2); 
If the average BP remains  95thpercentile for more than two weeks, patie nt 
should be removed from study .
5.If the average systolic and/or diastolic BP is >25 mmHg above the 95thpercentile , 
hold sunitini b, start or continue anti -hypertensive agent(s) per institutional guidelines.  
Monitor the BP at least twice weekl y. (See 4b. above for guidance on restarting dosing).

Page 36Antihy pertensive therapy should be continued until the BP is consistently  <95thpercent ile.
If anti -hypertensive therapy  is required, single agent therapy  (eg, a calcium channel blocker 
such as amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_6705]) should be started and the BP should be monitored at least 
twice weekly  until within normal limits.
Hypertension Management Guidelines for Young Adults
For y oung adults aged 18 -<21years there are no specific dose modification guidelines for 
hypertension. However , investigat ors may  wish to refer to Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_356490], patients on this trial 
may be supported with appropriate hormone replacement therapy  in the event they  develop 
adrenal insufficiency  in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable 
treatment -associated toxi city. 
5.2.13. Compliance
A patient dosing diary  will be used to track compliance, recording the date and time of each 
dose as well as any observed side effects, supportive treatments and/or medication errors.  In 
the case of a sunitinib dosing error, document ation of the error in the dosing diary  in addition 
to capturing the error on the dosing page of the associated CRF should be provided . This 
diary  should be reviewed with the treating phy sician at each clinic appointment while on 
study . 
Patients will be required to return all bottles of sunitinib at the beginning of each cy cle.  The 
number of capsules remaining will be documented. 
5.2.14. Study Drug Overdose Instructions
In the event of an overdose of sunitinib, study  drug should be withheld, symptomatic 
treatment sh ould be instituted, and the Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_292099] a clinical management plan.
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability
The investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions, 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. All study  drug supplies must be 
kept in a locked, limited access room.  Capsules should be stored at controlled room 
temperature (15 ºC to 30ºC) and protected from light.
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD [ie, Investigator Brochure (IB), Core Data Sheet 
(CDS), [LOCATION_002] Package Insert (USPI), Summary  of Product Characteristics (SPC), or

trial, [COMPANY_007] will provide instructions as to disposition of an y unused investigational product.  
If [COMPANY_007] authorizes destruction at the trial site, the invest igator must ensure that the materials 
are destro yed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , 
and an y special instructions provided by [CONTACT_4618].  Destruction must be adequately 
documented.  Otherwise, all bottles should b e returned to [COMPANY_007] for appropriate destruction.  
Only  appropriate, commerciall y labeled materials will be eligible for donation and will 
require explicit [COMPANY_007] pre- authorization.
5.4.Concomitant Medication(s) and/or Therapy
Patients must be instructed not t o take an y additional medications (including 
over-the-counter products) during the study  without prior consultation with the I nvestigator.  
Commercially  available palliative and supportive care for disease -related sy mptoms should 
be offered to all treated patients.  The Sponsor will not supply  palliative and supportive care 
agents.  All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as interventions 
(eg,paracentesis) received by  [CONTACT_292101] e -CRF. 
Every  medication including herbal supplements (specificall y St. John’s wort) or treatment 
taken b y the patient during the trial and the reason for its administration must be recorded on 
the relevant e -CRF.
Supportive care may  include pre medication with antiemetics to limit treatment-related nausea 
and vomiting.  During the first cy cle of treatment patients should be closely monitored for 
diarrhea and treated with anti-diarrheals (eg, loperamide) at the first sign of loose or frequent 
stools.  Patients may  receive secondary  proph ylaxis for treatment -induced diarrhea.
Blood product transfusions should be administered as clinically  indicated.

Page 38Patients who enter the study  on stable doses of ery thropoietin or darbepoietin may  continue 
this trea tment, and patients may  start either drug during the study  at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Patients with neutropenic fever or infection should be treated promptly  and may  
receive therapeutic colony- stimulating factors if appropriate. 
Anti- inflamma tory or narcotic analgesics may  be offered as needed. Steroids are to be 
avoided whenever possible since they  are metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 and may interfere with 
sunitinib metabolism.
Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery
Palliative radiotherap y to specific s ites of disease is permitted if considered medically  
necessary  by [CONTACT_74079].
Sunitinib should be interrupted during palliative radiotherap y –stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 1 day before and 
resuming treatment 1 day after.  Treatment with palliative radiotherap y sho uld be recorded 
on the appropriate CRFs. 
Surgery  is permitted after documentation of response as defined in Appendix 4(RECI ST 
v1.1).  This is to allow for resection of disease in patients whose tumors become r esectable 
following treatment with sunitinib. 
The appropriate interval of time between surgery  and sunitinib treatment required to 
minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined.  Based 
upon PK considerations of sunitinib , stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_292083] [ADDRESS_356492] 3 to 4days before minor surgery.  Patients who 
require surgery less than 14 days from treatment with sunitinib should be monitored closely  
for wound com plications.  The decision to reinitiate sunitinib should be based upon a clinical 
assessment of satisfactory  wound healing and recovery  from surgery .
5.5.Contraindicated Medications
5.5.1. Drugs with Proarrhythmic Potential
Concomitant treatment with any  drug having proarrhy thmic potential (terfenadine, quinidine, 
procainamide, disop yramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol, risperidone, indapamide 
and flecainide) is not permitted during the study . 
5.5.2. Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4
Sunitinib is primarily  meta bolized by  [CONTACT_292102], in particular CYP3A4.  There was a 
mean 1.8-fold increase in exposure of sunitinib when co-administered with ketoconazole, a 
strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a mean 4 -fold decreased in exposure of sunitinib when 
co-administered with rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4. 
Therefore, co -administration with strong inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithrom ycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir, nefazodone, 
voriconazole, telithromycin) and inducers (dexame thasone, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, pheny toin, St. John’s wort) of CYP3A4 may result in 
significant increases/decreases in exposure of sunitinib and may  alter the safety /efficacy  of 
the drug (See the Stud y Manual for fur ther information).

5.5.3. Anticoagulants
Therapeutic doses of coumarin -derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin ) are 
not recommended, though dose s up to 2 mg daily  are permitted for proph ylaxis of 
thrombosis, ie, PT and/or INR are targeted to <1.[ADDRESS_356494] (I RB)-approved informed consent form and assent form as per 
local guidelines.  All on
-study  procedures are permitted within the window frame indicated 
in Table 1.
6.1.Screening
The following screening procedures must be performed within 28days prior to treatment 
on-study  unless otherwise stated:
Patient, parental or legal guardian (for patients <18 years of age) signature [CONTACT_292124]-approved informed consent form and assent form per local guidelines; Tu mor 
tissue must be available from all patients to assess KIT, PDGFRA, and BRAF
genoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (for an y of these genes where genot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_292084]) 
and to assess succinate dehy drogenase (SDH) protein expression by  
[CONTACT_9064] .  For patients with no available, prev iousl y collected tumor 
tissue and incomplete testing information covering all of the above tests, a core 
biopsy  is required, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a biopsy  would create an 
unacceptable risk to the patient.  For such patients with inco mplete genoty pe/SDH 
information, where a tumor biopsy  cannot be obtained, patients may  commence 
treatment with sunitinib if there is previous confirmation of GI ST diagnosis (see 
below).  Similarly , if tumor tissue is obtained from patients during screening but the 
results of testing are inconclusive, it will not be necessary  to collect additional 
biopsies from patients before initiating treatment with sunitinib.  However, if 
archived tumor tissue is available it may  be requested for repeat anal yses on a cas e by 
[CONTACT_413], prior to treatment with sunitinib.
In cases where an y of the tumor analy ses listed above have not previously  been 
obtained, it is acceptable to obtain a paraffin block or 25 uns tained slides (charged 
slides
) representative of the tumor, along with the original pathology  report .  Tumor 
samples negative for SDH staining may  be further subjected to SDH genoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  It is 
suggested that for patients negative for SDH that patients/families be referred for 
genetic counseling. (See the Introduction for background on these tests).

7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure th e 
safet y and well being of the patient.  When a protocol required test cannot be performed, the

Page 46investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to a s soon as possible.  
The study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacokinetic- Pharmacodynamic Assessments
Blood to be used for pre -dose and post -dose pharmacokinetic (PK) plasma samples will be 
collected a ccording to Table 7for determination of plasma concentrations of sunitinib and its 
active metabolite SU012662 in 6children aged between 6 -17years and up to 15 patients 
aged 18-<21years in 1.[ADDRESS_356503] -dose samples obtained on 
Day 1are all mandatory ; however, some of the pre -dose samples are mandatory ,whereas 
others are optional ( Table 7
).  In situations where the mandatory  PK samples cannot be 
obtained, the patient will be scheduled to provide the missed PK sample time point(s) on the 
same time and day  of another cy cle.
During Cy cle 1, the mandatory  (M) PK samples are the pre-dose, 2,4, 6, and [ADDRESS_356504] 
dose samples for Day  1Visit, and the pre -dose sample for Day s 15 and 28 Visit s (Table 7).  
The optional (O) PK samples are pre -dose samples for Day s 7and 21 Visits ( Table 7
).
During Cy cles 2 and 3 , the mandatory  PK samples are the pre -dose sample for 
Days 1, 15 [ Day 15collection is applicable only  if a visit is required due to dose escalation], 
and 28 Visits ( Table 7).
For each nominal Visit Day  referred to above, the actual visit day  can fall within a 
pre-specified interval to provide more flexibility  for each individual patient ( Table 7).  All 
pre-dose samples can be collected at the same time as other chemistry  lab tests.  Additional 
PK samples may  also be collected at the discretion of the investigator.
In Cycle 1, after collection of the pre -dose sample for Day  28Visit, all PK samples collected 
should be batched together and shipped immediately  to BASi for bio- analysis ( Table 7).  In 
addition, a fter collection of the last PK sample all the PK 
samples should be batched together 
and shipped to BASi for bio- analysis (Table 7). 
Detailed instructions for collection, processing and storage of blood and tissue samples will 
be provided in the Central L ab manual.  Samples will be anal yzed using validated anal ytical 
methods in compliance with [COMPANY_007] standard operating procedures.  As part of understanding 
the pharmacokinetics of the study  drug, samples may  be used for metabolite identification 
and/or evaluation of the bioanaly tical method.  These data will be used for internal 
exploratory  purposes and will not be included in the study  repo rt.
For all samples collected, 1) the actual date and time of sample collection, and 2) the actual 
date and time of the last dose prior to the PK sample collection should be properl y recorded 
on the appropriate Case Report Form ( Table 7).

Page 48Non-Compartmental Analy ses (NCA) will be carried out to estimate pharmacokinetic 
parameters maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to C max(tmax), area under the 
concentration v ersus time curve from time zero to [ADDRESS_356506] dose (AUC 8).
In addition to the NCA, Non -linear Mixed Effects Modeling (NONMEM) approaches will be 
used to estimate PK parameters absorption rate constant (K a), oral clearance (CL /F), 
intercompartmental clearanc e (Q/F), volume of distribution for the central compartment 
(Vc/F) and peripheral compartment (V p/F).  Other parameters such as half life for the 
distribution phase (t 1/2) and elimination phase (t 1/2), maximum plasma concentration (C max), 
and area under the curve from time zero to [ADDRESS_356507] dose (AUC 24) will be estimated based 
on individual patient parameter estimates.
Subsequently , sequential PK -pharmacod ynamic modeling techniques using NONMEM will 
be applied to explore the relationships between safety  and efficacy  with plasma drug 
concentrations , if data allows .
Preliminary Analysis: Following the preliminary  quantification of sunitinib and its active 
metabolite in plasma samples from Cy cle [ADDRESS_356508] patients from historical data.  The PK anal ysis results, in addition to the 
comparati ve anal ysis, will be provided to the investigator as soon as possible, preferabl y 
prior to starting Cy cle 2 therapy . 
Definition of Evaluable: A patient will be declared evaluable for the primary  endpoint if 
oral clearance of sunitinib and its active metab olite can be calculated, using a population PK 
approach (NONMEM).
7.2.Safety Assessments
7.2.1. Adverse Events
Assessment of adverse events will include ty pe, incidence, severit y (graded by [CONTACT_292105] v4.0), timing, seriousness, and relatedness; and laboratory  abnormalities.
Baseline tumor- related signs and sy mptoms will be recorded as adverse events during the 
trial if they  worsen in severity  or increase in frequency .
7.2.2. Laboratory Safety Assessments
Local laboratory  studies will include:
Hematology , coagulation and blood chemistry  labs will be drawn as described in the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). 
Complete blood count (CBC); WBC with differential, hemoglobin, and platelets;
Coagulation: Prot hrombin time (PT) and/or INR;

creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, uric acid, glucose, total bilirubin, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline 
phosphatase, total protein, albumin, amylase and lipase;
Additional blood tests may  be performed for the purpose of planning treatment 
administration, dose modification or following adverse events.  At an y time after 
initiation of dosing if liver function test s are abnormal refer to Section 8.5.2 for 
guidelines. Electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, should be 
monitored throughout the study , addressing any abnormalities that are observed;
Urinaly sis (dipstick) will be performed locall y for protein.  Patients who develop 
≥2+ proteinuria will undergo testing of 24- hour urine protein.  In case of urine protein 
on two assessments, [ADDRESS_356509] every  other 
cycle; 
Urine pregna ncy test for women.  See the following section.
Laboratory  safet y assessments may  be performed outside of study  sites in cases where 
patient travel to the study site for these tests is not possible.  I n such cases, accurate 
reporting of these results remai ns the responsibility  of the study  site.
See Appendix 7for a full listing of required tests
7.2.3. Pregnancy Testing
For female patients above age 11, a urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity  of at least 
25mIU/mL, will be performed at screening, within [ADDRESS_356510] of I RB/IECs or if required by  [CONTACT_427].
7.2.4. Other Safety Assessments
Height and bod y weight will be recorded prior to starting each treatment cycle for 
pediatric pat ients .

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 50Physical examination: A phy sical examination including, but not limited to, general, 
lungs, heart, abdomen, and extremities will be performed.  The ph ysical examination will 
include examination of known and suspected sites of disease.
Performance S tatus: ECOG performance status scale will be used for patients ≥11years 
of age or Lansk y score for patients <11 years of age . Patients below the age of 11 who 
turn 11 while on- study  will then require ECOG performance evaluations. (Refer to 
Appendix 5);
Vital signs: Measurements of temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_292085] [ADDRESS_356511];  
ECG: Three consecutive 12lead ECGs (with a 10- second rh ythm strip) will be 
collected approxima tely 2minutes apart at screening, on Cy cle 2 Day 1(pre-dose) 
and at the end of treatment visit to determine the mean QTc interval.  It is preferable 
that the machine used has a capacity  to calculate the standard intervals automatically .  
If the mean QTc interval is prolonged (>500 msec), the ECGs should be overread by  
a cardiologist at the site for confirmation.  Additional ECGs should be performed as 
clinically  indicated, ie, after a new steady  state of sunitinib is reached 
(ie,approximatel y 2weeks) following :
Intrapatient sunitinib dose escalation, or 
Intrapatient sunitinib dose reduction in response to: 
a.QTc interval prolongation,
b.Significant electrol yte changes, vomiting, diarrhea, or addition of a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor listed in Section 5.5.2 after consultation with the sponsor’s 
medical monitor.
7.3. Growth and Pubertal Maturation Assessments (Patients <18 yr only)
The testing below may  be performed by  a pediatric endocrinologist if not s tandard practice 
within the local oncology clinic.
Growth Assessments: Imaging of growth plate for bone age determination per standard local 
practice at screen ing is required for patients less than [ADDRESS_356512] dose of study  drug. 
Tanner Staging: Tanner staging for patients less than [ADDRESS_356513] elapsed since the prior 
assessment and if the prio r staging was Tanner Stage 1 -4.  Tanner Staging will be captured 
for the following: pubic hair, breast (females), penis, and testes. 
7.4.Efficacy Assessments
All baseline tumor imaging assessments are to be performed within [ADDRESS_356514] 
dose of medication, and then within 14 days(closer to Day  28of the C ycle if possible) prior 
to the end of each even numbered cy cle(ie, Cycles 2, 4, etc.).  In the case of tumor response 
(PR or CR), confirmatory  imaging studies should be performed at least 4 weeks after initial 
documentation of response and may  be scheduled at 8 weeks for convenience.
Imaging studies will include MRI  (or CT) s can of the abdomen and pelvis, plus other 
applicable sites of disease.
The determination of anti -tumor efficacy  will be ba sed on objective tumor assessments made 
according to the RECIST criteria v1.1 .  (See Appendix 4).  MRI  (or CT)scans should be 
performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons.  In each patient, 
thesame imaging modality  should be used throughout the study  to measure disease whenever 
possible .Tumor evaluation by  [CONTACT_28124]  (PET) scan (baseline and at 
cycle 1 day 28 only ) or by  [CONTACT_292106]  (or CT)scans. PET scans 
will be used for exploratory  purposes onl y and will not be used in the assessment of efficacy.
For effusions or ascites, only  cases having cy tologic proof of malignancy  should be recorded 
as tumor lesions on the CRF.  Effusions that have not been evaluated using cytolog y or were 
found to be non- malignant should notbe recorded on the ‘non -target and new lesion’ CRF.
Measurable lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered target lesions 
unless increase in size ha s been observed following completion of radiation therap y.
7.4.1. Time -To Event Endpoints
For the purposes of endpoint definitions, the term “on- study ” includes the period of study  
medication treatment plus [ADDRESS_356515] dose of study  medication. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date 
of the first documentation of objective tumor progression.
PFS will be censored on the date of the last on -study  tumor assessment documenting absence 
of progressiv e disease for patients who are alive, on study  and progression free at the time of 
the anal ysis, are given antitumor treatment other than study treatment or are removed from 
treatment prior to documentation of disease progression or death on stud y.  For PF S, patients 
having no tumor assessments after screening will have tumor related endpoints censored on 
the date of enrollment.  Other censoring situations will be described in detail in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), for each endpoint anal yzed.

The [ADDRESS_356516] ive response rate (ORR) is defined as the percent of the full anal ysis population with a 
confirmed CR or PR according to RECI ST Criteria v1.1, relative to all enrolled patients with 
measurable disease at baseline.  Confirmed responses are those that persis t on repeat imaging 
study  4weeks after initial documentation of response.  Designation of best response of 
stable disease (SD) requires the criteria to be met at least once after the first dose of 
medication, at a minimum interval of [ADDRESS_356517](s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all adverse events, the in vestigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained 
by [CONTACT_292107].  The investigator is 
required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_292108] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs 
with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE.  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
For serious adverse events, the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] 
or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study  (ie, p rior to undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product) through and including 
28calendar day s after the last administration of the investigational product.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 53SAEs occurring toa patient after the active collection period ha s ended should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product are reported to the sponsor.
Adver se events (serious and non- serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the 
time the patient has taken at least one dose of study treatment through the patient’s 
last visit .
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the adverse event reporting period fo r 
non-serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must 
be reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last 
dose of investigational product, irrespective of an y intervening treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient 
administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy ;
Exposure 
via breastfeeding;

Page 54Medication error.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported 
as adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed 
by [CONTACT_292109].
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y, and/or
Test result is considered to be an adverse event b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  unto ward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect;
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and symptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as a serious adverse event unless the outcome is 
fatal within the safet y reporting period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292086].  If the 
malignancy  has a fatal outcome during the study  or within the safet y reporting period, 
then the event leading to death must be recorded as an adverse event and as a serious 
adverse event with CTC Grade 5 (see Section on Severity  Assessment ).

Page 55Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in dete rmining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require in tervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, 
the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convuls ions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.5.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug
-Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should alway s be considered important medical 
events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Patients who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values: 
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T ≥3times the upper limit of normal (X 
ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin ≥2 X UL Nwith no evidence of hemoly sis and 
an alkaline phosphatase [ADDRESS_356518] or not available.
For patients with preexisting AL TORAST OR total bilirubin val ues above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above.
For s ubjects with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range :AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  [ADDRESS_356519], or[ADDRESS_356520] 
(whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For patients with pre- existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased by  [CONTACT_292110]≥3times the 
upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller).

Page 56The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include labor atory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment and for oncology  studies, 
the possibility  of hepatic neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.  In addition 
to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatinine kin ase, total 
bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase, prothrombin time
(PT)/INR, and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such 
as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (paracetamol), recreational drug and supplement 
consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced patient, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or 
C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All cases confirmed on 
repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above, with no other cause for L FT 
abnormalities identified a t the time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases 
irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to determine 
etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as serious 
adverse events.
8.6.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292087].  An y initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a 
healthcare facility  meets these criteria.  Admission
also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292088]/intensive care unit (eg, from the ps ychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor 
to a coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit).   An emergency  room visit 
does not necessarily  constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, the event leading to the emergency  
room visit should be assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relie f);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Routine emergency  room admissions;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
adverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include:

Page 57Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition 
(eg, for work -up of persistent pr e-treatment lab abnormality );
Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (eg, for 
elective cosmetic surgery);
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the enti re protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
the adverse event, and the r esulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
adverse event.
8.7.Severity Assessment
Investigators will use the following definitions of Severity  in accordance with the appropriate 
Common Terminology  Criteria (CTCAE) term for Adverse Events (Ver sion 4.0, Publish 
Date: October 1, 2009, (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html) to describe the maximum 
intensity  of the adverse event.  If the event is serious, the CTCAE grade reported in the 
adverse event CRF must be consistent with the description of CTCAE grade included in the 
narrative section of the serious adverse event (SAE) report .
NOTE: The highlighted text above is not standard template language; please ensure 
Safety Risk Lead (SRL) has approved language and document on Study Decision Log.

0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in the 
v 4.0 document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE-THREATENING OR DI SABLING Adverse Event
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event.  For example, a headache may  be severe (inte rferes 
significantly  with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non- serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event ;generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided .  If the investigator does not know whether or not the
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see Section on 
Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality  assessment is "unknown but not 
related to investigational product", this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adv erse event is associated with study  
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if app licable.
8.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marked products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (also referred to as exposure in-utero [EIU] occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or being 
exposed (eg, 
because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes o r is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;

Sunitinib malate
A6181196
Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_356521] in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception or is exposed during 
his partner’s pregnancy .
If a stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigation al product, the investigator must submit this 
information to [COMPANY_007] on an EIU Form (this is a specific version of the Serious Adverse Event 
Form).  I n addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EIU Form.  
This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours 
of awaren ess of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date 
of delivery  (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy  outcome information on all EIU reports with an 
unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until completion or until 
pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EI U 
Form.  I n the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the neonate can be a ssessed at the 
time of birth.  I n the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified 
and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed 
by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedur e test findings are conclusive for a congenital 
anomaly  and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital ano maly [in a 
live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as serious adverse events 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_356522].
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case
-by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  patient with the EI U Pregnant Partner 
Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document on 
the EIU Form that the patient was given this letter to provide to his partner.

Page 608.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during t he performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit wi thin 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section 6.4 Patient Withdrawal)
Withdrawal due to AE should be dis tinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page.
When a patient withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly
 observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_292111].  In addition, each study  patient will be 
questioned about adverse events.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
events.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international re gulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_356523] be made immediatel y, irrespective of the extent of available 
adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information 
(follow -up) on previously  forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and 
follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy , exposure via breastfeeding cases , and 
occupational exposure cases .
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious
adverse event immediate ly (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.

submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be 
noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the 
adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a 
consistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both fo rms.  
Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as 
on the form for collection of serious adverse event information.
8.13.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.  In this clinical trial, the reference 
document for determining whether an event is unexpected is the Investigator’s Brochure.
9.DATA ANALYSI S/STATISTICAL METHOD S
The detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal ysis of the data collected in this 
study  will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_103].  This document may  modify  the plans outline in the protocol; however, an y major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
The following patient populations will be used in this study :
Full Analy sis population : Full Analy sis (or intent -to-treat) population will include all 
enrolled patients regardless of what treatment, if any , was received. 
Per Protocol (PP) population : Per Protocol (or as- treated) population will include all enrolled 
patients who receive at least one dose of study  drug. 
The efficacy anal ysis will be based on the full analy sis population.  The pharmacokinetic 
analysis and safety  anal ysis will be based on per protocol population.

Page 629.1.Sample Size Determination
Due to the rarity of the disease and the difficulties in identifying pediatric patient suitable for 
participation in this study only 6 patients will be included.  The statistical power has not been 
calculated.   Descriptive analysis approach will be adopted to report study results.
9.2.Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Descriptive statistics for observed and dose- corrected (where appropriate) PK data will be 
reported for all patients with at least one PK observation by  [CONTACT_292112], 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, percent coefficient of variation (CV%), median, 
minimum, maximum values.  In addition, geometric mean and the 95% CI for the geometric 
mean, will be reported where appropriate.  The key PK parameters in pediatric patients will 
be compared to adult patients with GI ST based on historical data if data allows .  The formal 
comparison will be carried out as part of the NONMEM portion using the historical PK data 
in adult GI ST patients if data allows .
9.3.Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy  anal ysis will be performed using full analy sis population, which inc ludes all 
enrolled patients in the study .  In addition, efficacy  analy sis may  be performed on the 
subgroups of patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years, patients aged 18 years to less than 
21years.
9.3.1.
Objective Response Rate 
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed 
complete (CR) or partial response (PR) relative to the number of patients enrolled in the 
treatment group.  The number and percent of patients achieving objective response (CR or 
PR) will be summar ized along with the corresponding exact 2 -sided 95% CI  calculated and 
presented.
9.3.2. Progression -Free Survival
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date 
of the first documentation of objective tumor progress ion or death due to any  cause, 
whichever occurs first.  PFS data will be censored on the day  following the date of the last 
tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who 1) are given 
anti-tumor treatment other than the study  treatment prior to observing objective tumor 
progression; 2) are removed from the stud y prior to documentation of objective tumor 
progression; 3) are ongoing at the time of the analy sis.
Patients who do not have any  post -baseline tumor assessments will hav e their PFS endpoint 
censored on the date of enrollment.  Death or disease progression that occurs after more than 
one missed visit will be censored on the day  following the date of the last tumor assessment 
as well.
PFS will be summarized using Kaplan- Meier methods and display ed graphically  where 
appropriate.  Median PFS and its corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI for the median will be 
provided.

Page 639.3.3. Duration of Response
Duration of response (DR) is defined as the time from the first objective documentation of 
compl ete or partial response that is subsequently  confirmed to the first documentation of 
disease progression or to death due to an y cause, whichever occurs first.  DR will be 
calculated for the subgroup of patients with objective disease response.  DR will be 
summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods and display ed graphically  where appropriate.  The 
median event time and 2 -sided 95% CI  for the median will be provided if appropriate.  The 
number of patients experiencing CR and PR may  be small and thereb y limit the use of the 
Kaplan -Meier method to provide reliable information.  I n this case, descriptive statistics or 
listings will be provided.
9.3.4. Overall Survival
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of death due to an y 
cause.  OS data will be censored on the day  following the date of the last contact [CONTACT_292113].  OS will be summarized using Kaplan- Meier methods and 
display ed graphically  where appropriate.  The median survival time and 2- sided 95% CI  for 
the median will be estimated. 
The 2 -year survival probability  will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and a 
2-sided 95% CI for the log [- log(1- year survival probability )] will be calculated using a 
normal approximation and then back transformed to give a CI for the [ADDRESS_356525] and Patient Disposition
An accounting of the study  patients will be tabulated.  Patients not meeting the eligibility  
criteria and/or deviating from the protocol will be identi
fied.  Patients not completing the 
study  will be listed along with the reason for their premature discontinuation.  Reasons for 
premature discontinuation will be summarized.  The full anal ysispopulation will be the 
analysis population for study  conduct and patient disposition.
9.4.2. Baseline Characteristics
Demographic characteristics such as patient age, gender, height, weight, ethnicity, prior 
therap y, prior medication, medical history, tumor characteristics (including KITgenoty pe, 
optional 
PDGFRA genoty pe, a nd optional SDH expression by  [CONTACT_4658]), and signs and sy mptoms 
will be tabulated.  The full analy sis population will be the anal ysis population for baseline 
characteristics.
9.4.3. Treatment Administration/Compliance
Study  drug administration will be described in ter ms of the total number of cy cles 
administered, the median (range) of cy cles administered, dose intensit y, and reasons for the

10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may  review sourc e documents 
to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will 
allow [COMPANY_007] monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  authorities direct access to 
source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be patient to review by  [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or 
companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_292115] y authorities.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Rep ort Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study .
A CRF is requi red and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensur ing that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_47616]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator ’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_356527] Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections from regulatory  authorities or audits from [COMPANY_007], 
the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating patients 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to I CH, lo cal regulations, or as specified in the Clinical 
Study  Agreement, whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_356528] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met. 
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institu tional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment adv ertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/I EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior t o IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Patients (Council for International Organizations o f Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (International Conference on 
Harmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 
2008).
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I nternational 
Conference on Harmonization (I CH) guideline on GCP, and applicable local regulatory  
requirements and laws.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_356529] be prospectively  approved by  [CONTACT_36552] I RB/I EC and [COMPANY_007] before use.
The investigator must ensure that ea ch study  patient, or his/her legal representative, is fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with 
participation.
Children and some adolescents are legall y unable to provide informed consent to participate
in clinical trials. Informed consent must be obtained instead from the legally acceptable 
representative of the child or adolescent, usually  their parent(s) or guardian. However, 
children and adolescents should be involved in health care decisions affect ing them.   To that 
end, I CH guidelines, EMEA Guideline on the Ethics of Clinical Trials in Children (in 
framework of Directive 2001/20/EC) and FDA regulations require that the assent from the 
child or adolescent be obtained when this is appropriate and whe n the potential patient is 
capable of providing assent. The determination of appropriateness and capacity  is made b y 
the investigator and/or the relevant I RB or IEC. Assent is not required if the Investigator 
and/or the IRB/IEC determine that the capabil ity of the child or adolescent patient is so 
limited that they  cannot provide assent.
If a patient signed assent for a stud y, a consent must be signed once the patient turns legal 
age, based on local requirements.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient's legal representative before an y study -specific 
activity  is performed.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed 
consent document.
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  [CONTACT_98299], investigator outreach through cooperative 
groups, patient advocacy  groups, and posting of the study  outline on websites may  be used as 
recruitment procedures.

Page 6812.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patients a gainst any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study  as stated in the 
regulatory  application [ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA) and ethics application in the 
Member State].  Poor recruitment (recruiting less t han the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all Participating Countries
End of Trial in all participating countr ies is defined as collection of the final data point in the 
study . Because this clinical trial includes a survival endpoint, the last data point is 
anticipated to be the last survival follow- up (ie, date last known alive or of death) prior to the 
cutoff d ate for database lock for the final Clinical Study  Report. 
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discret ion of [COMPANY_007].  I n 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of sunitinib at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contac t all participating patients and 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) within [ADDRESS_356530] extent possible.
15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS
Publication of study  results is discussed in the Clinical Study  Agreement.
15.1. Communication of Results by [CONTACT_292116].clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov).  Pfi zer posts the results of 
all studies that it has registered on ClinicalTrials.gov regardless of the reason for registration.

Adapted from Eisenhauer et al (2009) Eur 2009 Jan;45(2):228-47.
a.Measurability  of Lesions
Measurable disease .
1.Lesions with longest diameter [ADDRESS_356544] (bone lesions not 
included except for soft tissue expansile masses arising from bone) when assessed by  
[CONTACT_292120].
2.Lesions with longest diameter at least [ADDRESS_356545] disease, leptomeningeal 
disease, l ymphangitis, pulmonitis, clinical lesions that cannot be accuratel y measured with 
calipers, abdominal masses identified b y physical exam that are not measurable b y 
reproducible imaging techniques, nodes with short axis 
≥10but <[ADDRESS_356546] evidence onl y (eg, b y lab values), or previously radiated lesions that 
have not progressed.
Target and non -target disease. 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability  for 
accurate repeated measurements.  Measurements must be provided for target measurable 
lesions.
Non-target disease: All non -measurable disease is non- target.  All measurable lesions not 
identified as target lesions are also included as non-target disease.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_356547] be documented 
appropriatel y.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generall y should be 
indeterminate. Note: A tumor is considered evaluable but not measurable if an increase in 
tumor mass can be assessed even thou gh it does not meet the minimum requirements for 
measurability  as defined by  [CONTACT_23603] v1.1.  Examples would include ascites, pericardial 
effusion, or pleural effusion. 
Objective Status is to be recorded at each evaluation.
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  I f a change needs to be made the case 
must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate.
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target and non- target disease, with 
the exception of nodal disease.  All nodes, both target and non -target, must decrease to 
normal size (short axis <10 mm).  No new lesions.  All disease sites must be assessed.
Partial Response (PR): Applies only  to patients with at least one measurable lesion.  Greater 
than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable 
lesions.  The short diameter is used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is 
used in the sum for all other target lesions.  No unequivocal progression of non -target 
disease.  No new lesions.  No reappearance of lesions after a CR.  All target lesions must be 
assesse d.
Stable : Does not qualify  for CR, PR, Progression.  All target lesions must be assessed.
Objective Progression : One or more of the following must occur.  1) 20% increase in the sum 
of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if 
no decrease in the sum is observed during therap y), with a minimum absolute increase of 
5mm.  The short diameter is used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is 
used in the sum for all other target lesions.  2) Unequi vocal progression of non -target disease.  
Unequivocal progression is assessed with respect to non-target disease as a whole, not to 
each individual lesion.  An explanation must be provided.  3) Appearance of any  new 
lesion/site.  4) Reappearance of lesions after a CR . 5) A modest increase in an evaluable but 
not measurable tumor is usually  not considered sufficient to indicate unequivocal disease 
progression. 
Indeterminate , objective status unknown.  Progression has not been documented, and 
One or more t arget measurable lesions have not been assessed; 
Or assessment methods used were not the same as baseline;

Page 82Or one or more target lesions cannot be measured accuratel y unless due to being too 
small to measure;
Or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or 
increased. 
Objective status notes:
Non-target disease does not necessaril y affect objective status except in determination 
of CR (must be absent --a patient who otherwise has a CR, but who has 
non-measurable or non -target measurable disease present or not assessed, can at best 
be classified as PR), and in determination of progression (if new lesions develop or if 
unequivocal progression occurs).  Cases for which target disease is assessed as stable 
or better but non -target assessments are missing must reviewed carefully .  By  
[CONTACT_292121], it may  be reasonable to assume missed non -target 
assessments were not progression;
For unequivocal progression of non -target disease, generall y the overall tumor burde n 
must increase sufficiently  to merit discontinuation of therapy .  In the presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non -target disease 
should be rare.  In particular, increase of a single small non- target measurable lesion 
by 20% would not ordinarily  constitute unequivocal increase in non- target disease as 
a whole;
An objective status of PR or stable cannot follow one of CR.  Stable can follow PR 
only in the rare case that tumor increases b y less than 20% from the na dir, but enough 
that a previousl y documented 30% decrease no longer holds;
For bone disease documented on bone scan onl y, increased uptake does not constitute 
unequivocal progression;
Appearance or worsening of pleural effusions does not constitute unequiv ocal 
progression unless cy tologically  proven of neoplastic origin.  I n the case of 
worsening, the change must be substantial, eg, from trace to large;
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not 
disappear completel y,it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with 
biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337];
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to 
necrosis, the lesion may  be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_292091];
If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a 
large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used;

Page 83Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded.  If 
a target lesio n becomes too small to measure, [ADDRESS_356548] disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm is used;
If a new lesion is identified in a location not scanned at baseline, this is considered 
progression;
PET res ults are not used in determination of objective status;
Disease that is poorl y visible on scan such that status or size cannot be adequately 
determined should be assessed as Indeterminate;
If a target lesion becomes non- evaluable (for reasons other than to o small) this is 
recorded as indeterminate;
Measurable lesions that are irradiated or excised on study  are no longer measurable 
and should be assessed as I ndeterminate on the Tumor Assessment -Target L esions 
CRF. Subsequent increase or reappearance may con stitute progression of disease.

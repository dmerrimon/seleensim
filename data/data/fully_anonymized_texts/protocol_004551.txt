CONFIDENTIAL  4  Summar y of Changes  
REASON FOR THE AMENDMENT:  
The changes that were made to the protocol are listed in the following table, along with the 
rationale for each change:  
Section  Change  Rationale  
Section 5 OBJECTIVES  Revised objectives to include 
the open -label  extension.  Revised in accordance with changes in the 
study design . 
Section 6.1 Overall Study Design 
and Plan  The study  plan wa s revised 
to: 
1) Convert the post induction 
phase of the study from a 
blinded long-term extension 
to an open -label extension . 
2) Add  investigative sites in 
the Czech Republic.  
 1) The protocol was amended to allow all 
eligible subjects to  receive  KHK4083  after 
the 12-week , double -blind induction 
phase.  Subjects currently enrolled in the 
long-term extension who are receiving 
study medication but who are 
non-responders up to the Week 28 visit 
will be eligible to  receive KHK4083  in the 
open -label stud y extension.   
2) Sites in the Czech Republic will be 
added to the study to ensure complete 
accrual . 
Section 6.1.3  Open -label 
Extension Therapy:  Week 12 
(First Dose) to Week  52 Section added  Revised i n accordance with changes in the 
study design.  
Section 6.1.4  Transition ing from  
the Long -term Extension to the 
Open -label Extension  Section added  Revised in accordance with changes in the 
study design . 
Section 6.3 Study Safety 
Monitoring Plan  1) The Safety Monitoring 
Committee will evaluate the 
cumulative safety data 
available after the first 4 
subjects in a cohort at 
Week  6 for the 3.0 and 
10 mg/kg dose cohorts 
instead of Week 8 .  
2) The Safety Monitoring 
Committee and Sponsor may 
dose-reduce cohorts or not 
escalate to the planned doses 
based upon review of sa fety 
data. 
3) The dose administered 
during the open -label 
extension will be the same as 
the dose for that cohort 
during the induction therapy, 1) KHK4083 concentrations in serum at 
Week 6 are estimated to be approximately 
10% lower than those at Week  [ADDRESS_268890] the 
detection of safety signals and will allow 
for an earlier review of the safety data.  
2) To clarify how dose reductions for a 
cohort will occur.  
3) To clarify how the dose for the open -
label extension will be selected.  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  5  Section  Change  Rationale  
unless dose -reduction is 
recommended by [CONTACT_223483] . 
Section 7.3 Exclusion Criterion  2) Subjects with well-controlled 
immunologic, autoimmune or 
chronic infl ammatory 
disorders , other than 
ulcerative colitis , or 
autoimm une connective 
tissue diseases  may be 
included , after consulting 
with the medical monitor .  Ulcerative colitis is  often accompanied by 
[CONTACT_223484] s besides the colon 
and/or other autoimm une or chronic 
inflammatory disease s.  Including subjects 
with stable , well -controlled disease  
outside of the colon  will result in inclusion 
of a more representative population of 
subjects with ulcerative colitis . 
Section 7.3 Exclusion Criterion 3) The definition of  biologic  
treatment history  has been 
revised from “failed to 
respond to more than one 
biologic treatment ” to “failed 
to respond to  two or more  
biologic  treatment s with 
different  mechanism of 
action ” Clarifi cation of criteria .  Note that some 
patients with moderate ulcerative colitis 
receive two or more anti -TNF monoclonal 
antibodies, and failure to respond to drugs 
with similar mechanisms of action is not 
felt to impact the assessment of efficacy or 
safety.  
Section 7 .3 Exclusion Criterion  4) Modified  to allow subjects 
receiving stable doses of oral 
budenoside ≤ 9 mg/day to 
participate.  Amended to harmonize  this criterion with 
Inclusion Criterion  #6 
Section 7.3 Exclusion Criterion 
23) 
(see also Section 7.1Procedures 
for Enrol lment ) A subject who was 
considered a screen failure 
and not dosed with 
investigational product is 
permitted to be re -screened 
once due to failure to meet 
the Inclusion/Exclusion 
Criteria , whereas subjects 
with other reasons for lack of 
randomizati on may be re -
screened twice.  To allow for re -screening in cases where a 
subject fails screening because all 
assessments were not completed within 
the [ADDRESS_268891] who has two 
consecutive visits during 
Induction Therapy with a 
worsening from Baseline , in 
partial  Mayo Clinic score of 
≥ 3 points (e.g., partial Mayo 
Clinic score of 3 at baseline, 
6 at Week 2, and 6 at Week 
4) or two consecutive visits 
during maintenance therapy 
with a worsening from Week 
12 in partial Mayo Clinic 
score of ≥ 3 points at a visit 
and ≥  [ADDRESS_268892]’s and 
physician’s perception of the UC disease 
activity.  This permits an additional dose 
of study medication to be administ ered on 
a case -by-case basis for subjects who may 
not have clinical ly significant worsening.  
Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_268893] been amended as 
follows: If the subjec t 
discontinues during Induction 
Therapy,  a sigmoidoscopy  
will be performed at End -of-
Treatment/Week [ADDRESS_268894] discontinues more 
than 8 weeks after Baseline 
visit; the sigmoidoscopy  may 
be performed up to [ADDRESS_268895] 
discontinues during 
OLE/LTE therapy,  a 
sigmoidoscopy  will be 
performed at End -of-
Treatment/Week [ADDRESS_268896] discontinues more 
than 8 weeks after the Week 
12 visit; the sigmoidoscopy  
may be performed up to [ADDRESS_268897] been made.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose 
Modifications  Clarified that dose reduction 
is not permitted for an 
individual subject.   Doses 
chosen for each cohort, as 
determined by [CONTACT_223483], may result in dose  
reduction for all subjects 
enrolled in a cohort.  In order to determine the safety profile for 
KHK4083,  individual subjects are not 
permitted to dose reduce . Dose reduction 
for a cohort may occur based upon 
evaluation of safety by [CONTACT_223485].  
Section 9.1 Screening Period  (Day 
−28 to Day −1) For subjects who are 
rescreened, the original 
screening sigmoidoscopy  can 
be used to satisfy the entry 
criteria if obtained within [ADDRESS_268898] dose.  To obviate the need for a second 
sigmoidoscopy  during re-screening , if 
performed up to 42 days prior to Day 1.  
Section 10.4.1  Pharmacokinetic  
and Pharmacodynamic 
Assessments  The visit schedule for Part A 
has been revised to eliminate 
study visits on Days 3 and 4 
in Weeks 0, 10 , and 48 . The 
pharmacokinetic timepoints 
on Day 3 and Day  4 in Week 
0, Week 10 and Week 48 
were removed. The PD 
timepoint  was moved from 
Day 4 to Day 2 because of 
elimination of the Day 4 
visit. Considering the characteristics of the  PK 
profile for KHK4083 following 
intravenous administration, the PK 
sampling timepoints on Day 3 and Day 4 
are deemed not critical in determination of 
the PK disposition of KHK4083. The 
revised PK sampling schedule is 
considered adequate to assess the PK of 
KHK4083 in this study.  The PD timepoint 
is moving from Day 4 to Day 2 to 
coincide with the change in the visit 
schedule .

(KHK4083) in Subjects with Moderately Active  Ulcerative  Colitis  
Protocol Number:   4083 -002, Amendment 2 
Investigators and Study Center( s):  Multicenter at approximately 40 investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US), Russia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia  and Czech Republic ; other  countries may be included as 
needed.  
Phase of Development:   Phase 2  
Objectives : 
Primary:  
• Induction Therapy - Part A:  To determine the safety and tolerability of administration of multiple ascending 
doses of KHK4083 and to select the highest dose tolerated by [CONTACT_223486] (UC) to recomm end for use in Part B;  
• Induction Therapy - Part B:  To determine if the recommended dose of KHK4083 identified in Part A 
improves the mucosa in subjects with moderately active UC at Week 12 as measured by [CONTACT_223487] y subscore ( mMES).  
Secon dary:   
• To determine if KHK4083 at dose levels different than the recommended dose  improve the mucosa based on 
the mMES ;  
• To determine if any dose level of KHK4083 administered as Induction Therapy will meet the following 
objectives at Week 12 ( or as noted ): 
– Improve the mucosa based on the modified Baron endoscopic score ; 
– Improve the mucosa based on the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index  of Severity (UCEIS) ; 
– Induce mucosal healing based on the mMES ; 
– Improve clinical signs and symptoms based on total Mayo C linic score ; 
– Improve clinical signs and symptoms based on  partial Mayo Clinic scores  (Week 2 through  Week 12, 
excludes endoscopy subscores);  
– Induce a clinical response based on a reduction in the total Mayo Clinic score (i.e., reduction of at least 
[ADDRESS_268900] 30% from Baseline [Week 0] to Week 12) and rectal bleeding 
subscale (i.e., reduction of at least 1  point from Baseline [Week 0] to Week 12) ( or a defined absolute 
rectal bleeding score  of 0 or 1 at Week 12 );  
– Induce clinical r emission based on a total  Mayo Clinic score (i.e., score of ≤  2) and subscore s (i.e., no 
subscores >  1).  
• To characterize  the pharmacokinetic s (PK) of KHK4083  in subjects with moderately active UC following 
multiple dose administration ;

• To evaluate the develop ment of antibodies against KHK4083 (immu nogenicity).  
Exploratory:  
• To determine if multiple doses of KHK4083 administered during Open -label Extension (OLE) or Long -term 
Extension ( LTE) Therapy will meet the following objectives at Week 52 (or as noted)  when compared with 
Baseline (Week 0) scores  (or subscores) or assessments : 
– Improve clinical signs and symptoms based on total  Mayo Clinic score ; 
– Improve clinical signs and symptoms based on partial Mayo Clinic scores (excludes endoscopy 
subscores) at Week  16 through Week 52, and the OLE/ LTE Therapy  Follow -up Period (Week 56 
through Week  64); 
– Induce a clinical response based on a reduction in the total Mayo Clinic score and rectal bleeding 
subscale (or  a defined absolute rectal bleeding score);  
– Induce clinical remission based on a total  Mayo Clinic s core and subscore s; 
– Induce durable clinical responses and durable clinical remissions (present at both Weeks 12 and 52), and 
glucocorticoid -free clinical remission;  
– Induce mucosal healing based on the  mMES ; 
– Improve the mucosa based on the  mMES, UCEIS, and /or modified Baron endoscopic score ; 
– Induce a remission (Week 12; Week 52) based on modified Mayo endoscop y, stool frequency , and 
rectal bleeding  subscores  (defined as an mMES  of 0 or 1, stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, and rectal 
bleeding subscore of 0 ). 
• To evaluate the activity of KHK4083 on health -related quality of life, which will be based on the subject’s 
completed Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaires (IBDQs)  in comparison with Baseline assessments ; 
• To m easure changes from Baseline in corticos teroid (glucocorticoid) dosage s; 
• To d etermine the percentage of subjects who are glucocorticoid -free from  Week 16 through Week 52, and 
the OLE/ LTE Therapy Follow -up Period (Week 56 through Week 64); 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of KHK4083 ; 
• To explore the PK-PD relationship s. 
Study Design:  
This Phase 2, double -blind clinical study  of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 (or placebo) with a n 
OLE Therapy phase  will be conducted in approximately [ADDRESS_268901] a documented unsuccessful previous treatment. The study will include a 4 -week Screening Period, 
followed by a total of up to 64 weeks (treatment and follow -up) on study from the time of randomization to study 
completion. The Treatment Period  includes double -blind Induction Therapy (12 weeks) and OLE Therapy 
(40 weeks)  for eligible subjects at Week 12 . Subjects  already enrolled  in the double -blind, long -term extension 
(LTE) under preceding versions of the protocol  who worsen  may be eligible to  transition  to the OLE up to 
Week  28.  Select ed Sponsor  personnel will be unblinded after the last subject completes Induction Therapy.  
Post-treatment assessments will continue for [ADDRESS_268902]’s 
treatment pe riod. The doses selected for this study are based on a Phase 1a/1b  single -ascending dose study , 
which showed that KHK4083 was well tolerated and there were no dose -limiting adverse effects up to 10 mg/kg , 
the highest dose studied .

Screening Period (Day −28 to Day −1):  
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will review the written informed consent form (ICF) with each subject to 
ensure that the subject understand s the study and the study procedures. The subject will read, sign, and date the 
ICF and oth er locally applicable documents. Screening evaluations used to determine the subject’s study 
eligibility must be completed within the Screening Period (Day −28 to Day −1) prior to starting treatment on 
Day 1 (Week  0), and include a baseline sig moidoscopy  with biopsy being completed within 7 to 28 days prior to 
Day 1.  For subjects who are rescreened, the original screening sigmoidoscopy  can be used to satisfy the entry 
criteria if obtained within 42 days prior to Day 1 . All sigmoidoscopy procedures will be p erformed using a 
flexible sigmoidoscope.  
Double -blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 12/52): 
Each  subject must be carefully monitored at the investigative site for signs of acute, potential dose -limiting 
toxicity infusion reactions during and for at least [ADDRESS_268903] and second 
intravenous ( IV) infusions of investigational product, and for at least [ADDRESS_268904] who does not return for a visit at the investigative 
site. 
Induction Therapy:   Week 0 to Week 12 (Last Dose at Week 10)  
Double -blind Induction Therapy  is separated into Part  A for administration of multiple ascending IV doses of 
KHK4083 (or  placebo) to subjects in Cohorts  1 - 3 and Part B for administration of the recommended IV dose 
(one of three dose levels identified in Part A) of KHK4083 (or placebo) to subjects in Cohort  4. Subjects in each 
cohort will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive KHK4083 or placebo by [CONTACT_12781] 60  minutes 
(± 10 minutes ).  
Induction Therapy - Part A :  
In the first 3 cohorts, 27 subjects (9  subjects/cohort) will receive KHK4083 and 9  subjects (3  subjects/cohort) 
will receive placebo once every 2 weeks (Weeks 0 to 10) as follows:  
Cohort 1:  1.0  mg/kg or placebo  
Cohort 2:  3.0 mg/kg or placebo  
Cohort 3:  10 mg/kg or placebo  
The cumulative safety data available after the first 8 of 12 subjects  randomized in Cohort  1 will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_223488]  4 (~Day 29) to assess whether dosing will continue for subjects within 
Cohort [ADDRESS_268905] 8  subjects in each cohort at Week  4 
(~Day  29) with the first 4 subjects  in each cohort  at Week  6 (~Day 43) will be evaluated for continuation of all of 
the subjects and for dose escalation in the next cohort, i.e., Cohort 3 in Part A and Cohort 4 in Part B, 
respectively. The Safety Monitoring Committee and Sponsor may dose -reduce cohorts or not escalate to the 
planned doses based upon review of safety data .

Induction Therapy - Part B:   
The recommended dose ( one of three  dose levels in Cohorts 1 - 3 selected based on the safety data from Part A) 
will be administered once every 2 weeks (Weeks 0 to 10) to additional subjects (18  subjects to receive 
KHK4083, 6  subjects to receive placebo) in Cohort  4 who did not participate in Part A.  
For subjects in all cohorts, a sigmoidoscopy with biopsy is scheduled at Week 12 to assess improvement in the 
mucosa from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12. It is highly recommended that the sigmoidoscopy with biopsy be 
performed within 7 to 13 days prior to the Week 12 visit.  
Long -term  Extension Therapy:  Week 12 (First Dose) to Week 52  
The LTE is only active for subjects who entered it prior to approval of Amendment 2. Subjects who sign an ICF 
under  Amendment 2 are eligible for the OLE . 
Subjects who complete d double -blind Induction Therapy (i.e.,  at least five of six treatments) and had a clinical 
response or mucosal healing were eligible to continue in double -blind LTE  Therapy. A clinica l response is 
defined as a reduction in the total Mayo Clinic score of at least [ADDRESS_268906] 30% from 
Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12, and a reduction in the rectal bleeding subscale of at least 1  point from Baseline 
(Week 0) to Week [ADDRESS_268907]  been given two options:  
1) To receive no further treatment and proceed directly to the Induction Therapy Follow -up Period  
(Week  16 through Week 26) ; or  
2) To continue in double -blind LTE Therapy and receive 10 additional treatments of KHK4083 (at the 
same dose administered to that subject during Induction Therapy) or placebo as maintenance 
therapy. Each subject will receive one IV infusion every 4 weeks from Week 12 to Week 48 
followed by [CONTACT_223489] -of-LTE Therapy visit at Week 52, and then proceed to the LTE Therapy 
Follow -up Period (Week 56 through Week 64).  
Note:   Subjects who already started treatments in the double -blind LTE t herapy will continue to 
receive KHK4083 or placebo during LTE Therapy. If their UC worsens or flares  up to the Week [ADDRESS_268908]  receive d no further treatment and entere d the Induction Therapy 
Follow -up Period.   
Subjects in the double -blind LTE may enter the OLE up to the Week 28 visit if their UC worsens or flares.  
Open -label  Extension Therapy:  Week 12 (First Dose) to Week 52  
Subjects who complete double -blind Induction Ther apy (i.e., at least five of six treatments) are eligible to 
continue in open -label treatment OLE Therapy (refer to Section 7.4 for specific eligibility criteria).

All subjects who qualify will be given two options:  
1) To receive no further treatment and pro ceed directly to the Induction Therapy Follow -up Period 
(Week  16 through Week 26); or  
2) To receive 10 treatments of open -label KHK4083 (at the same dose administered to that subject 
during Induction Therapy) as maintenance therapy. Each subject will receive  one IV infusion every 
4 weeks from Week 12 to Week 48 followed by [CONTACT_223489] -of-OLE Therapy visit at Week 52, and then 
proceed to the OLE Therapy Follow -up Period (Week 56 through Week 64) . 
Subjects who do not qualify will receive no further treatment and wil l enter the Induction Therapy Follow -up 
Period.  
Each subject must be carefully monitored at the investigative site for signs of acute, potential dose -limiting 
toxicity infusion reactions during and for at least [ADDRESS_268909]  and second 
intravenous (IV) infusions of the open -label, investigational product, and for at least [ADDRESS_268910] of Induction Therapy or OLE/LTE 
Therapy, respectively.  If the subject discontin ues during Induction Therapy, a  sigmoidoscopy  will be performed 
at End -of-Treatment/Week [ADDRESS_268911] disc ontinues more than 8 weeks after Baseline visit; the 
sigmoidoscopy  may be performed up to [ADDRESS_268912] discont inues during OLE/LTE therapy, a  sigmoidoscopy  will be performed at End-of-
Treatment/Week [ADDRESS_268913] discontinues more than 8 weeks after the Week 12 visit; the sigmoidoscopy  
may be performed up to [ADDRESS_268914]-treatment Follow -up Period:  
Three on -site follow -up visits for post -treatment assessments will be conducted at Weeks 16, 20, and 26 for 
subjects who only receive Indu ction Therapy or at Weeks 56, 60, and 64 for subjects who receive both Induction 
and OLE/ LTE Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Subjects removed from the study for adverse events ( AEs) will be followed until there 
is a return to the subject’s baseline condition, or until a clinic ally satisfactory resolution is achieved.  
Primary Endpoints:  
Subjects with moderately active UC will primarily be evaluated for an improvement in the mucosa determined by

staining on all endoscopic biopsy samples, and flow cytometry analyses on whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononucle ar cells f or the measurement of specific immune -related cells.  
Immunogenicity:  
For immunogenicity , the development  of anti-KHK4083  antibodies  will be assessed .  
Safety:  
The safety variables include AEs  (including  SAEs ), physical examinations, vital signs, body weight, 12 -lead 
ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation profile, multiplex -31 
assays, and urinalysis).  
Safety Management and Monitoring : 
Kyowa Kirin Pharma ceutical Development , Inc. has primary responsibil ity for the ongoing medical review of 
safety data throughout the study.  
Recommendations will be made with the input of the Medical Monitor to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223450]. The Safe ty Monitoring Committee will 
evaluate the cumulative safety data available after the first 8 subjects (1.0 mg/kg dose cohort) at Week 4. For 
subsequent dose escalation, the Safety Monitoring Committee will evaluate the cumulative safety data available 
and after the first [ADDRESS_268928] 4 subjects in a cohort at Week 6 for the 3.0 
and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts. At each of the timepoints, the committee will assess whether dosing will continue for 
all subjects and if the invest igational product will be administered at the next higher dose level for subjects in the 
next cohort in Part A or for Cohort 4 in Part B. A separate Safety Monitoring Committee Charter will identify the 
membership and define the specific procedures of the committee.  
Statistical Methods and Planned Analysis:  
All categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables will be utilized. All su mmaries and 
analyses conducted will be by  [CONTACT_14338] (KHK4083 dose levels; combined KHK4083; and placebo) and 
by [CONTACT_765]. The last pre -administration observation will be used as the Baseline value for calculating post -
administration changes from Baseli ne. All data obtained on the electronic case report form and entered into the 
database will be provided in separate data listings showing individual subject values.  
The following analysis sets will be used in the study:  
Safety Analysis Set:   Includes all s ubjects who received any investigational product  (even a partial dose);  
Full Analysis Set :  Includes all subjects who receive at least one full dose of investigational product  and who 
have Baseline data and at least one post -treatment  assessment  of the pri mary efficacy variable .  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs) will be grouped and tabulated by [CONTACT_223495]. All TEAEs will be summarized showing the 
number and percentage of su bjects for each event with a start time  within the Treatment Period ( i.e., Induction

The overall safety and tolerability of KHK4083 compare d to placebo administered in multiple IV doses will be 
determined for all safety variables.  
All efficacy analyses will be performed in the FAS unless otherwise specified. All statistical analyses in this 
Phase 2 study will be descriptive or exploratory, a nd no adjustment to control Type I error will be performed.  
Pharmacokinetic , Pharmacodynamic , and Immunogenicity Methods : 
The PK parameters (i.e., Cmax, tmax, Cmin, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-τ, AUC 0-∞, t1/2, CLs, V ss, V z, and Rac) for KHK4083 will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_223496] . The dose proportionality of KHK4083 PK exposure 
parameters will be assessed using the Power Model for Cohorts 1 - 3 (Induction Therapy - Part A and  LTE 
Therapy). The PK exposure parameters include C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞, as appropriate.  
The PD parameters will be determined and summarized by [CONTACT_223497]. The PK -PD 
relationship s will be explored using graphic tools or modeling as  needed.   
The immunogenicity of KHK4083 will be determined  and t he percentage of subjects with confirmed 
anti-KHK4083 antibodies will be summarized by [CONTACT_223497], visit (week), and overall . The 
effect of positive anti -KHK4083 antibodie s on the PK, and possibly effica cy and safety , will be explored . 
Serum samples, which will be collected at specified times throughout the study, will be assessed using 
multiplex -31 assays at four sample collection timepoints:  Baseline  (Week 0) , Week 2, Week 12 
(End -of-Induction Therapy), and Week 52 (End -of-OLE/ LTE Therapy) or at a follow -up visit if the subject does 
not continue in OLE/ LTE Therapy.  For other potential study assessment s (e.g., exploratory biomarker analyses ),

CONFIDENTIAL  30  4 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
4.1 Ulcerative Colitis  
Inflammatory bowel disease s (IBD s) comprise  ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, 
which are considered to be common gastrointestinal  autoimmune diseases , and  are referred to 
as immune -mediated inflammatory diseases . (Mahmood, 2012; Khor, 2011) A peak 
incidence of UC occurs early in adult life (15 to 30 years)  with a greater  prevalen ce in males , 
nonsmokers or ex-smokers , and in developed countries . (Loftus, 2004; Hana uer, 2006)  The 
global  incidence rate of UC varies greatly from 0.5  to 24.5 per 100,000  persons . 
(Lakatos,  2006)  
Urbanization  and v ariances in exposure to sunlight, pollution, and industrial chemicals are  
considered potential contributing factor s to IBD . (Hanauer,  2006)  Other factors such as diet, 
oral contraceptives, perinatal and childhood infections, or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_223451] a role . (Loftus, 2004)  
Ulcerative colitis symptoms include abdominal pain/cra mps, diarrhea that is usually bloody, 
and severe urgency to have a bowel movement. The symptoms can be intermittent with fairly 
long periods between flare -ups and remission . Fatigue and loss of appetite with subsequent 
weight loss are common . Complications  can include severe abdominal bloating, bleeding 
from deep ulcerations, anemia, fulminant colitis , and toxic megacolon potentially leading to 
perforation of the colon.  In addition, there may be skin lesions, joint pain , eye inflammation, 
and liver disorder s. Patients with UC are at increased risk of colon cancer . (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, IBD , 2015 ) 
Ulcerative colitis is  characterized by [CONTACT_223498] . 
The inflammatory changes are limited to the mucosa and submucosa with cryptitis and crypt 
abscesses. Ulcerative colitis is considered to result from an improper  mechanism and 
continuing inflammatory response to  commensal microbes and environmental conditions in 
patients with genetic risk factors . (Khor, 2011)  The intestinal mucosa exists in a functional 
equilibrium with the complex luminal environment dominated by a spectrum of microbial 
species and their produc ts. A functional balance is essential to maintaining normal mucosal 
physiology. In addition to nutrient absorption, intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_223452] -transduction functions. Patients often have a compromised muc osa and an increase  
in presence of mucolytic bacteria . (Khor, 2011)  
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_268942] identified 99 non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_223453] 47 risk loci specific to UC of which approximately 30% (28) of IBD -related genetic 
loci are shared betwe en UC and Crohn ’s disease . (Franke, 2010; Anderson, 2011)  Analyses 
of the genes and genetic loci that contribute to IBD susceptibility show a multitude of 
pathways that are critical for intestinal homeostasis, including barrier function, epi[INVESTIGATOR_223454], microbial defense, innate immune regulation, reactive oxygen species generation, 
autophagy, regulation of adaptive immunity, endoplasmic reticulum stress , and metabolic 
pathways  associated with cellular homeostasis.  Homeostasis in the gut involves a balance 
between anti -inflammatory and pro -inflammatory signals, whereas an inadequate T -reg-cell 
response occurs with a heightened response mainly involving Th2 cells in UC. (Khor, 2011)   
A recent study showed significantly enhanced apoptosis of circulatin g lymphocytes in IBD 
patients during flare -ups compared to remission and is considered to be possibly a 
consequence of the systemic disease process . (El-Hodhod, 2013) Increased circulating 
lymphocytes apoptosis m ay also be attributed to a deficiency in nutrients , which is common 
in IBD patients . (Bager, 2011; El -Hodhod, 2013; Nakajima, 2011; Levin, 2011; 
O’Malley,  2011; Yakut, 2010)  
Cells with high synthetic capacity and secretory activity (e.g., Paneth and goblet) have high 
baseline levels of endoplasmic r eticulum stress, leading to activation o f the unfolded protein 
response , which controls cellular programs that allow proper protein processing. Th is 
response  is mainly cytoprotective, although it can signal apoptosis after sustained 
endoplasmic reticulum s tress. (Khor, 2011)  The role of apoptosis in intestinal lymphocytes in 
IBD shows that the inflamed gut T -cells have a resistance to apoptosis, a prolonged survival, 
and an increased cytokine production that may significantly aggravate the inflammation , 
whereas noninflamed gut T -cells have an  increased susceptibility towards apoptosis that 
limits expansion of T -cells and down  regulates mucosal immune responses . (Sturm, 2008 )  
In addition to its effects on cell viability and disruption of normal intestinal ho meostasis , due 
to an imbalance of production and apoptosis, s ustained endoplasmic reticulum stress also 
activates autophagy and IL -23 release, and may engage inflammatory circuits that are 
subsequently propagated by T cells . (Goodall, 2010; Kaser , 2008 ; Khor, 2011 ) 
Apoptotic cells have been shown to actively suppress inflammatory responses by [CONTACT_223499] . (Bodar, 2007; El -Hodhod, 2013; Fadok, 2001) Thus, 
apoptosis plays a critical role in lymphocyte development and homeost asis. Enhanced 
lymphocyte apoptosis can cause immunodeficiency through cell loss. Conversely, inhibition 
of apoptosis can lead to the development of autoimmunity or lymphoma. Two major 
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_268943] and death by 
[CONTACT_223500] . (El-Hodhod, 2013; Rathmell, 2002) Increased circulating lymphocyte apoptosis 
could also be considered as a protective mechanism against organ injury as increased 
lymphocyte apoptosis was found to be linked to anti -inflam matory cytokine secretion and 
thereby [CONTACT_223501] . 
(El-Hodhod, 2013; Neuman, 2007)  
The event that initiates the immune response in IBD has not been  identified , but p ossible 
factors include a pathog enic and nonpathogenic organism, an immune response to an 
intraluminal antigen (e.g., protein from cow milk), or an autoimmune process . (Abraham, 
2011; El -Hodhod, 2013; Nell, 2010) During an immune response, homeostasis is disturbed as 
antigen -presenting c ells (APCs) become activated and promote the clonal expansion of 
antigen -specific lymphocytes. Shortly after the peak of the response, controlled induction of 
apoptosis, of both APCs and lymphocytes, restores homeostasis. This process is critical to 
ensure  protective immunity and avoid lymphoid neoplasia and autoimmunity . (El-Hodhod, 
2013; Hildeman, 2007)  The influence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on the function of 
APCs varies as TNF can either activate APCs, augment antigen presentation capability, or 
upregulate the expression of costimulatory molecules , or TNF can inhibit the function of 
mature lymphocytes and possibly induce their apoptosis and impair antigen presentation to 
prevent the organ damage. It has been demonstrated that the addition of apopto tic 
lymphocytes to endotoxin -stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC s) causes a 
shift from secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF -α, IL -1β, and IL -12) to 
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL -10). (Voll, 1997)  
4.2 Current Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis  and Associated Benefit/Risks  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_79803] 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) i s the first line of treatment for mild to 
moderately active UC.  Patients with persistently active disease are then typi[INVESTIGATOR_223455].  Once remission is achieved , maintenance therapy , 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_223456] 5 -ASA,  is recommend ed for those with left -sided colitis, pancolitis or 
extensive disease.  
Patients with severe UC are usually treated with oral glucocorticoids, high dose oral 5 -ASA 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588], and often receive antibiotic treatment as well as nutritional support.  
Patients with severe or corticosteroid -dependent disease receive additional treatment, such as 
azathioprine or 6 -mercaptopurine, or a biologic agent. Tumor necrosis factor -alpha  (TNF -α) 
blockers  are used to treat autoimmune diseases , including Crohn's disea se and UC, either 
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_268944] -line immunosuppressors  (e.g., azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine ) or in association  
with these treatments . (Silva , 2010)  
The following are approved TNF -α blockers:  
• Chimeric IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) infliximab (Remicade ; Inflectra and Remsima 
- in the Europe an Union [EU] only ) - UC/Crohn’s disease  
• Human IgG mAb adalimumab (Humira) - UC/Crohn’s disease  
• Fully human mAb golimumab (Simponi)  - UC 
• Pegylated humanized Fab’ fragment certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) - Crohn’s disease  in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) only  
A humanized IgG1 mAb, vedolizumab (Entyvio®), which is an integrin receptor antagonist 
(i.e., binds to the human α4β7 integrin) is approved for both UC and Crohn’s disease in the 
US an d EU.  
Serious and sometimes fatal adverse effects have been reported with TNF -α blockers  
(Silva,  2010) , including  infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial (e.g.,  tuberculosis  [TB] ), 
invasive fungal infections (e .g., histoplasmosis , aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidiomycosis, 
blastomycosis, and pneumo cystosis), viral  (e.g., hepatitis B) , or other opportunistic pathogens  
(e.g., Listeria  and Legionella ). (US Food an d Drug Administration, Drug Safety 
Communications, 2011 and 2013)  Lymphoma, including a rare and fatal type called 
hepatosplenic T -cell lymphoma, and other malignancies, can occur in adults and children . 
Other serious risks include melanoma and Merkel cell  carcinoma, heart failure, 
demyelinating disorders, hypersensitivity reactions, and hepatitis B reactivation . 
(Marion,  2013)  
A review of the subject’s p rior medical history of neoplasias and infections , and evaluation 
for active TB and demyelinating diseas es, testing  for hepatitis B viral infection and latent 
infection  should be conducted . (Silva , 2010)

4.3.1  KHK4083 Development  
KHK4083 is a fully human, non-fucosylated IgG1 mAb specific for the costimulatory 
molecule OX40 (clust er of differentiation [ CD]134, tumor necrosis factor receptor 
[TNFR]SF4 ), a TNF R family member.  KHK4083  binds with high affinity and specific ity to 
an extracellular domain epi[INVESTIGATOR_223457]40, which plays a key role in maintaining late T -cell 
proliferation and  survival by [CONTACT_223502], and in inducing T -cell memory 
formation. OX40 has a unique pattern of expression, being restricted to antigen -activated, 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  34  effector T -cells (mostly CD4+), transient, and present in diseased areas in human autoimmune 
diseas es.  
OX40 has been shown to be highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tissue of patients with 
autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract ( e.g., celiac, UC, Crohn’s disease) . In a 
study on the expression of OX40, all UC and Crohn's disease  and most  celiac disease biopsy 
tissue samples (formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue stained with anti -OX40 antibody 
and alkaline phosphatase -anti alkaline phosphatase method [APAAP])  were positive, 
indicating the potential role of OX40 in pathogenesis of these  diseases . (Stüber, 2000)  
Expression of lymphocyte -endothelial receptor -ligand pairs, α4β7/MAdCAM -1 and 
OX40/OX40 ligand in the colon and jejunum of patients with IBD also have been assessed by 
[CONTACT_223503] (i.e., by 
[CONTACT_223504]3, ICAM -1, α4β7, MAdCAM -1, 
and OX40 ). The expression of MAdCAM -1 and OX40 ligand on gut endothelial and OX40+ 
cells was increased in sites of mucosal inflammation in patien ts with IBD. There was no 
evidence of increased lamina propria T -cells or increased vascular adhesion molecule 
expression in the proximal intestine of patients with distal IBD . (Souza, 1999)  
4.3.2  Nonclinical Development  
The generation of the KHK4083 mAb  and its  in vitro  characterization as well as the 
non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics  (PK) , and toxicology study reports are 
thoroughly described in the I nvestigator’s Brochure . All nonclinical safety studies were 
conducted in Japan, a member  country of th e Organisation for Economic Co -operation and 
Development ( OECD ) and compliant with the Mutual Acceptance of Data program . The 
studies conducted in accordance with the OECD Test Guidelines and Principles of Good 
Laboratory Practice  (GLP) are identified in t he Investigator’s Brochure . The 
nonclinical/toxicological program includes a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 4 -week intravenous ( IV) GLP study 
(SBL303 -081) and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 26-week subcutaneous ( SC) and IV GLP study  (SBL303 -104) in 
cynomolgus monkeys. In these studies, the no -observ ed-adverse -effect level s (NOAEL s) 
were  ≥ 100 mg/kg (IV) and ≥  30 mg/kg (both SC and IV) , in 4 -week IV and 26 -week SC and 
IV study, respectively. The mean AUC 0-∞ (area under the serum drug concentration -time 
curve from 0 to infinity ) and mean Cmax for male and female monkeys in the 100 mg/kg dose 
group were 607000  µghr/mL and 5345  µg/mL, respectively, after the first dose.  The mean 
AUC 0-2wk (area under the serum drug concentration -time curve from [ADDRESS_268946]-dose) 
and mean Cmax for male and female mon keys in the 30  mg/kg IV group were 
301500  µghr/mL and 1510  µg/mL, respectively, after the 13th dose (i.e., steady state). The 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  35  AUC s were  used to calculate the safety margins  for the dose levels planned for this Phase 2 
study . Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details on safety margins and selection of doses.  
4.3.3  Clinical Program  
The clinical program comprises a Phase  1a/1b study (4083 -001, completed in December 
2014 ) in subjects with mild to moderate plaque -type psoriasis  at 4 clinical sites in Canada . 
KHK4083 was well-tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicity was identified in the Phase 1 a/1b, 
single -ascending dose study of up to 10 mg/kg , the highest dose studied.   
The implementation of th is study is based on th e premise that KHK4083 may have the 
potential to reduce OX40 -bearing lymphocytes, which have been reported in colonic biopsies 
of patients with UC . (Stüber, 2000) I n sites of mucosal inflammation, the expression of OX40 
ligand on gut endothelial and OX40+ cells was increased in the colon and jejunum of patients 
with IBD . (Souza, 1999) Thus, further study of KHK4083 is planned for IBD, in particular in 
subjects with UC.  
5 OBJECTIVES  
The primary , secondary  (including PK and immunogenicity ), and exploratory objectives of 
the study (refer to Appendix 1 for primary and secondary efficacy definitions) are as follows:  
Primary : 
• Induction Therapy - Part A:   To determine the safety and tolerability of administration 
of multiple ascending doses of KHK4083 and to select the highest dose tolerated by 
[CONTACT_223505] B;  
• Induction Therapy - Part B:   To determine if the recommended dose of KHK4083

CONFIDENTIAL  40  6.1.1  Induction Therapy :  Week 0 to Week 12  (Last Dose at Week 10)  
Double -blind Induction Therapy is separated into Part  A for adm inistration of multiple 
ascending IV doses of KHK4083 (or placebo) to subjects in Cohorts  1 - 3 and Part B for 
administration of the recommended IV dose ( one of three  dose levels identified in Part  A) of 
KHK4083 (or placebo) to subjects in Cohort  4. Subjec ts in Part A are prohibited from 
participat ing in Part B.  
Subjects in each cohort will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive KHK4083 or 
placebo by [CONTACT_12781] 60  minutes  (± 10 minutes) . Each subject will receive a total of 
6 treatments (one  IV infusion per treatment) every 2  weeks from Week  0 (Day 1) to Week 10 
of Induction Therapy. Safety assessments (e.g., after 2 treatments for 1.0 mg/kg and 3 
treatments for 3.0  and 10 mg/kg are administered and [ADDRESS_268952] 
treatment ar e available ) will determine whether dosing will continue for subjects within a 
cohort and if the investigational product will be administered  at the next higher dose level for 
subjects in the next cohort in Part A or for Cohort 4 in Part B  (refer to Sectio n 6.3 for details 
on the Safety Monitoring Plan).   
For subjects in all cohorts, a sigmoidoscopy  with biopsy is scheduled  at Week 12 to assess 
improvement in the mucosa from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12. It is hi ghly recommended 
that the sigmoidoscopy with biopsy  be performed within [ADDRESS_268953] receives 
treatment  in the OLE/ LTE Therapy phase.  
6.1.2  Long -term Exte nsion Therapy :  Week 12 (First Dose) to Week  52 
The LTE is only active for subjects who entered it prior to approval of Amendment 2.  
Subjects who sign an ICF under  Amendm ent 2 are eligible for the OLE (s ee Section 6.1.3 ). 
Subje cts who complete d double -blind Induction Therapy (i.e., at least five of six treatments) 
and had a clinical response or mucosal healing were eligible to continue in double -blind 
LTE Therapy. A clinical response is defined as a reduction in the total Mayo C linic score of 
at least [ADDRESS_268954] 30% from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12, and a 
reduction in the rectal bleeding subscale of at least 1  point from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 
[ADDRESS_268955] been given two options:  
1) To receive no further treatment and proceed directly to the Induction Therapy 
Follow -up Period (Week  16 through Week 26); or  
2) To continue in  double -blind LTE Therapy and receive 10 additional  treatments of 
KHK4083 ( at the same dose administered to that subject  during Induction 
Therapy ) or placebo  as mainten ance therapy . Each subject will receive one IV 
infusion every 4  weeks from Week 12 to We ek 48 followed by [CONTACT_223489] -of-LTE 
Therapy visit at Week 52, and then proceed to the LTE Therapy  Follow -up Period  
(Week 56 through Week 64) . Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional dosing details 
in LTE Therapy.  
Note:  Subjects  who already started treatment in the double -blind LTE Therapy 
will continue to receive KHK4083 or placebo during LTE Therapy.  If their UC 
worsens or flares  up to Week [ADDRESS_268956]  receive d no further treatment  and enter ed the 
Induction Therapy Follow -up Period.  
6.1.3  Open -label Extension Therapy:  Week 12 (First Dose) to Week  52 
Subjects who complete double -blind Induction Therapy (i.e.,  at least five of six treatments) 
are eligib le to enter  OLE Therapy (refer to Section 7.4 for specific eligibility criteria).  
All subjects who qualify will be given two options:  
1) To receive no further treatment and proceed directly to the Induction Therap y 
Follow -up Period (Week  16 through Week 26); or  
2) To receive 10 treatments of open -label KHK4083 (at the same dose administered 
to that subject during Induction Therapy) as maintenance therapy. Each subject 
will receive one IV infusion every 4  weeks from W eek 12 to Week 48 followed 
by [CONTACT_223489] -of-OLE Therapy visit at Week 52, and then proceed to the OLE 
Therapy Follow -up Period (Week 56 through Week 64). Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]

Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  42  6.2 Study Rationale  
In a Phase 1a/1b study (4083 -001) in 68 subjects with mild to moderate plaque -type psoriasis, 
no dose -limiting adverse  effects were observed following a single SC injection (1.0  mg/kg) or 
IV infusion (≤  10 mg/kg). The current  study of KHK4083 in subjects with UC is based on the 
observation  that OX40 -bearing lymphocytes have been reported in colonic biopsies of 
patients wi th UC . (Stüber, 2000) I n sites of mucosal inflammation, the expression of OX40 
ligand on gut endothelial and OX40+ cells was increased  in the colon and jejunum of patients 
with IBD . (Souza, 1999)  
The 12-week efficacy evaluation for improvement in the mucos a is based on mMES and is 
the primary efficacy endpoint of this study.  The continuation of subjects  (i.e., who have 
evaluable total Mayo Clinic scores and have  a clinical response or mucosal healing ) in the 
40-week OLE/ LTE Therapy phase allows for extendin g the period of treatment and 
completing assessment s for delayed responses, durable clinical response , and durable clinical 
remission.  
6.3 Study Safety Monitoring Plan  
All subjects will be assessed regularly for potential occurrence of adverse events ( AEs) from 
the time of signing the informed consent form ( ICF) until [ADDRESS_268958] dose. If 
consistent mild and/or moderate  infusion reactions are observed, the Sponsor  may 
recommend pretreatment of subjects. In the event that any subject experiences an a cute 
infusion reaction considered to be a serious adverse event (SAE) , a slower infusion rate for 
administration of the investigational product and/or a mandatory pre -medication regimen 
(e.g., anti -emetics , H1 or H2 blockers , and/or corticosteroids) may be  introduced. Each 
investigative site must have trained staff and immediate access to emergency supplies and 
equipment including, but not limited to, drugs needed to treat a subject in case of a 
life-threatening emergency.  
The Sponsor  has primary responsib ility for the ongoing medical review of safety data 
throughout the study.  
Recommendations will be made with the input of the Medical Monitor to the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223458]. 
Medic al Monitoring meetings will be held on a regular basis to monitor the safety of the 
subjects and adherence to the protocol (e.g., inclusion and exclusion criteria, concomitant 
medications, and visits) in addition to the Safety Monitoring Committee meetings  described 
below .  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  43  The Safety Monitoring Committee, which recommends dose -escalation and continuation of 
the study will meet prior to starting each cohort (based upon projected enrollment rate is 
anticipated to be approximately every 3  months ) and as neede d during the study.  A separate 
Safety Monitoring Committee Charter will identify the membership and define the specific 
procedures of the committe e. 
The Safety Monitoring Committee will evaluate the cumulative safety data available after the 
first 8 subjec ts (1.0 mg/kg dose cohort) at Week  4. For subsequent dose escalation,  the Safety 
Monitoring Committee will evaluate the cumulative safety data available after the first 
[ADDRESS_268959] 4 subjects at Week 6  for the 3.0  and 10 mg/kg dose 
cohorts . At each of the timepoints, t he committee will  assess whether dosing will continue for 
all subjects and if the investigational product will be administered  at the next higher dose 
level for subjects in the next cohort in Part A or for Cohort 4 in P art B.  The Safety 
Monitoring Committee and Sponsor may dose -reduce cohorts or not escalate to the planned 
doses based upon review of sa fety data . The OLE dose will be the same as the dose for that 
cohort during the induction therapy, unless dose reduction is recommended by [CONTACT_223507] . 
The safety monitoring plan is as follows:  
Induction Therapy - Part A (Cohort 1) : 
• Prior to randomization of the first subject  - review rules and reach a consensus;  
• When safety data are availabl e on the first [ADDRESS_268960] completed Week 4  (~Day  29). 
Induction Therapy - Part A (Cohorts 2 and 3) : 
• When safety data are available on the first [ADDRESS_268961] complet ed Week 4 (~Day  29) with the first [ADDRESS_268962] completed Week 6 (~Day 43). 
Induction Therapy - Part B (Cohort 4) : 
• When safety data are available on the first [ADDRESS_268963] completed W eek 6 (~Day 43); 
• When safety data are available on all randomized subjects who complete or would have 
completed Week  12. 
Open -label/ Long -term Extension Therapy : 
• When safety data are available on all subjects who complete or would have completed 
Week  24; 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  44  • When safety data are available on all subjects who complete or would have completed 
Week  36. 
If unblinding of a cohort is necessary, the Sponsor’ s physician, clinical pharmacologist, a 
biostatistician, and a representative from Drug Safety Surveillance, all not associated with the 
conduct of the study, will make recommendations for study continuation and design, 
including dose selection for each cohort.  
This study’s safety monitoring plan is justifiable and adequate from a safety standpoint in 
view of the fo llowing:  
• The design of the safety plan permits a comparison of the safety response to KHK4083  
under baseline and post -KHK4083  administration conditions in the same subject.  
• The design of the safety plan allows a comparison of this study’s safety data set w ith the 
Phase 1a/1b study (4083 -001). 
• The safety monitoring follow -ups permit the evaluation of late appearing adverse effects 
that may emerge or progress after the administration of KHK4083 . 
• The measures used to assess safety are well -defined and reliable , and the proposed safety 
analyses are adequate to assess the effects of the administration of KHK4083 . 
6.4 Study Timeframe  
Subsequent to the 4 -week Screening Period, t he total study participation time is up to 
64 weeks  from the time of randomization to study completion . The  52-week Treatment 
Period includes a 12-week  Induction Therapy phase and a 40-week OLE/ LTE Maintenance 
Therapy  phase. A post-treatment F ollow -up Period  will be conducted either at Week 16 
through Week  26 for subjects who only receive Inducti on Therapy or at Week 56 through 
Week 64 for subjects who receive both Induction and OLE/ LTE therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . The date of the 
subject’s last post -treatment study visit will be considered the End -of-Study date.  
6.[ADDRESS_268964] should be monitored carefully for hematologic 
abnormalities and any applicable dose modification/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223459]. In a 
recently completed clinical study (4083 -001) in subjects with psoriasis, no  dose-limiting AEs 
were  observed during the 56-day safety assessment periods following single SC (1.0  mg/kg) 
or IV (≤  3.0 mg/kg) doses or during a 70 -day safety assessment period following an IV dose 
of 10  mg/kg.  
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_268965] AWAL OF SUBJECTS  
Male and fem ale subjects (age :  ≥ 18 years ) with moderately active UC  who meet all  the 
Inclusion Criteria and none of the Exclusion Criteria will be eligible for entry into this  study.   
7.1 Procedures for Enrol lment  
This multicenter study will be conducted in approximately 60 adult subjects with moderately 
active UC at approximately 40  investigative sites in the US, Russi a, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, Serbia  and Czech Republic ; other countries may be included as needed .  
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will review the written ICF with each subject to 
ensure that the subject understand s the study and the study procedures . The subject will read, 
sign, and date the ICF and other locally applicable documents . A photocopy of the signed 
ICF must be provided to the subject and the original doc ument retained in the subject ’s 
source or study file . No study -related procedures may be performed until the ICF is signed 
and dated .  
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT) s ystem will be used by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee) for assigning a Subject I dentification Number after the ICF is signed and dated.  
A subject who was considered a Screen failure and not dosed with investigational product is 
permitted to be re -screened  once  due to failure to meet the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria , 
whereas subjects with other reasons for lack of randomi zation may be re -screened twice . This 
allow s for re -screening in the event  a subject fails screening because all assessments w ere not 
completed within the [ADDRESS_268966] Identification Num ber 
will only be used once; thus, numbers for any Screen failures or non -treated, non -evaluable, 
or discontinued subjects will not be re -used.

Monoclonal Antibody [KHK4083] in Subjects with Mild -Moderate Plaque -Type Psoriasis)  
was conducted in 68 subjects.  Dose escalat ion of KHK4083 was started at 0.003  mg/kg 
(Cohort  1), followed by [CONTACT_223512] 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 
3.0 mg/kg (Cohorts 2 - 7) administered as 60 -minute IV infusions. A single SC dose of 
1.0 mg/kg (Cohort  8) also was administer ed. This study was amended to include an additional 
single ascending dose cohort of 10  mg/kg (Cohort 9) administered as a 120 -minute IV 
infusion.  The doses selected  for the current study (4083 -002) are based on the Phase 1a/1b 
study , which showed that KHK4 083 was well tolerated and there were no dose -limiting 
adverse effects  at doses  ≤ 10 mg/kg .

Laboratory Practice; NOAEL=no -observed -adverse -effect level.  
 
The safety margins calculated based on C max are comparable to the safety margins calculated 
based on AUC 2wk. As the Phase 2 study is to reach the PK exposure at the NOAEL dose level, 
and the 1.0, 3.0, and 10  mg/kg doses given every [ADDRESS_269000] overall PK exposure lower than the NOAEL , the selected doses are expected to be a 
safe dose for th is clinical study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Administration  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. The minimum IV infusion time will be 
60 minutes  (± 10 minutes) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion Reactions  
This study must only be performed in medical facilities with the necessary equipment and 
medications , and staff trained in their use,  readily available  to manage potential acute 
infusion reactions, including anaphylactic reactions.  
No pre -medication (e.g., anti -emetic; 5HT3 blocker; histamine H1 and/or H2 blocker (s); 
corticosteroid) is planned to be routinely/prophylactically administered prior to KHK40 [ADDRESS_269001] who does not return for a visit at the 
investigative site.  
Acute infusion reactions should not be classified as anaphylaxis unless symptomatic 
bronchospasm and/or allergy -related edema/angioedema is/are the principal clinical 
manifestation(s). (Refer to diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis in Appendix 5). Signs and 
symptoms of acute infusion reactions usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion 
and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of the infusion. Acute 
infusion reactions should be classi fied by [CONTACT_2236] (i.e., mild, moderate, or sever e) of the AE.  
Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting an infusion reaction including descriptions of specific 
symptoms observed or reported by [CONTACT_423].  
Althou gh mild infusion reactions require no intervention and no interruption of the infusion, 
investigators are permitted to interrupt the infusion for mild reactions, observe the subject for 
resolution of any signs/symptoms, and restart the infusion at one -half the infusion rate 
originally prescribed if the reaction substantially resolves.  The rate of the remaining infusion 
may be gradually escalated to the originally prescribed rate based on the subject’s subsequent 
tolerance and Investigator judgment. For subj ects who continue treatment, subsequent 
infusion(s)  may be recommended to be administered at a slower infusion rate.  
If a moderate  infusion reaction occurs, stop the infusion for at least 15  to 30 minutes. 
Paracetamol orally and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or  an equivalent anti -histamine may be 
administered. If symptoms abate, re -start the infusion at one –half the previous rate; if 
symptoms recur, permanently discontinue the infusion. For reactions that do not abate after 
[ADDRESS_269002] receive immediate medical/nur sing 
assessment and indicated supportive management per the institutional standard of care and 
local Investigator judgment until the signs/symptoms of the reaction have resolved.  
If consistent mild and/or moderate  infusion reactions are observed, the Spon sor (i.e., Medical 
Monitor and/or a representative from Drug Safety Surveillance) and the Investigator 
(or designee)  may recommend the pretreatment of subjects  or a slow er infusion rate . In the 
event that any subject experiences an acute infusion reaction considered to be an SAE , there 
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_269003] , and/or a mandatory pre -medication regimen (e.g., anti -emetics; 
H1 or H2  blockers; and/or corticostero ids), and/or dose -reduction in a cohort . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modifications  
Management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions due to study treatment  may require 
concurrent therapy , dose omission, prolonged infusion time , or temporary withholding or 
permanent discontin uation of treatment . No dose reduction should be planned for subsequent 
doses  for an individual subject.   
Doses chosen for each cohort, as determined by [CONTACT_223513], may result in dose reduction for all subjects enrolled in  a cohort.  
8.1.4  Treatment Period  (Weeks 0 to 52)  
The 52 -week Treatment Period (last dose Week  48) includ es double -blind Induction Therapy 
over 12 weeks followed by [CONTACT_223514]/double -blind LTE Therapy over [ADDRESS_269004]’s 
treatment period for on -site post -treatment assess ments  (refer to  Figure 6.1-1 for overall 
study design). No other investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_223465]4 [ADDRESS_269005]’s UC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Induction Therapy: Week s 0 to 12  (Last Dose:  Week 10)  
Double -blind Induction Therapy  (12 weeks)  comprises Part A  (Cohorts 1  - 3) for IV 
administration of multiple ascending doses  of KHK4083 or placebo ; and Part B  (Cohort 4 ) 
for IV administration of the recommended dose  of KHK4083 or placebo.  Subjects in Part A 
are not allowed to participate in Part B  of Induction Therapy. Select Sponsor  personnel will 
be unblinded after the last subject completes Induction Therapy (refer to Section 8.4 for 
details).  
Subjects in each cohort will be randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_269006] in each cohort (Cohorts 1  - 4) will be administered one IV infusion of KHK4083 
or placebo once every 2  weeks for a total of 6  treatments, i.e., Day  1 (Week  0), Day  15 
(Week  2), Day  29 (Week  4), Day  43 (Week  6), D ay 57 (Week  8), and Day  71 (Week  10).  
• Induction Therapy Part A (Cohorts 1 - 3):  36 subjects ( 12 subjects/cohort) will be 
administered investigational product , i.e., 27 subjects (9  subjects/cohort) will receive 
KHK4083 and 9  subjects (3 subjects/cohort) w ill recei ve placebo  once every 2  weeks 
(Weeks 0 to 10) as follows:  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  61  Cohort 1:  1.0  mg/kg or placebo  
Cohort 2:  3.0 mg/kg or placebo  
Cohort 3:  10 mg/kg or placebo  
The cumulative safety data available after the first 8 of 12 subjects randomized in 
Cohort  1 will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_223515]  4 (~Day 29) to 
assess whether dosing will continue for subjects within Cohort [ADDRESS_269007] 8  subjects in each 
cohort at Week 4 (~Day  29) and the first 4 subjects in each cohort at Week 6 (~Day 43) 
will be evaluated  for continuation of all of the subjects  and for dose escalatio n in the next 
cohort , i.e., Cohort 3  in Part A and Cohort 4 in Part B, respectively.  The Safety 
Monitoring Committee and Sponsor may dose -reduce cohorts or not escalate to the 
planned doses based upon review of safety data (refer to Section 6.3). 
• Induction Therapy Part B (Cohort 4) :  The recommended KHK4083 dose (one of three 
dose levels in Cohorts 1 - 3) is selected based on the safety data from Part A . At least 
24 subjects  will be administered the recommended dose of KHK4083 (18 subjects ) or 
placebo ( 6 subjects ) once every 2 weeks (Weeks 0 to 10) in Cohort  4.  
For subjects in all cohorts, a sigmoidoscopy with biopsy will be performed at Week 12  to 
assess improvement in the mucosa based on a mean change in the mMES from Baseline  
(Week 0) to Week 12.  It is highly recommended that the sigmoidoscopy with biopsy be 
performed within 7 to 13  days prior to the Week 12 visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Open -label/ Long -term  Extension Maintenance Therapy:  Week 12 
(First Dose) to Week 52  
All subjects who qualify and  continue double -blind  LTE or start open -label  maintenance 
therapy will be administered one KHK4083 or placebo (LTE) or one KHK4083 (OLE) IV 
infusion at Weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48 for a total of 10  additional 
treatments followed by [CONTACT_223516]-of-OLE/ LTE Therapy visit at Week  52, and then proceed to 
the OLE/ LTE Therapy  Follow -up Period (Week 56 through Week  64). The treatment at 
Week 12 will be administered at the scheduled visit or within 7 days after Week  12. The OLE 
dose will be the same  as the dose for that cohort during the induction therapy, unless 
dose-reduction is recommended by [CONTACT_223517] (see 
Section 6.3). 
During OLE/ LTE Therapy, corticosteroid (glucocorticoid) dosages o f prednisolone or its 
equivalent will be permitted to be tapered (decreasing by [CONTACT_8622] 2.5  mg/day per week) and 
other concomitant medications for UC may be tapered. Bolus or  “rescue” treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids or topi[INVESTIGATOR_223466] o r suppositories  (in addition to the 
dose of oral corticosteroids at Screening) is permitted only after Week 12 evaluations are

visit at Week [ADDRESS_269008]’s treatment period. For subjects who only receive Induction 
Therapy (i.e., last dose at Week 10 an d do not continue in OLE/ LTE Therapy), the Post-
treatment Follow -up visits will be at Weeks 16, 20, and 26. For all subjects who receive both 
Induction Therapy and OLE/ LTE Therapy  (last dose at Week 48) , the Post-treatment Follow -
up visits will be at Weeks  56, 60, and 64. Subjects removed from the study for AEs will be 
followed until there is a return to the subject’s baseline condition, or until a clinically 
satisfactory resolution is achieved. The date of the subject’s last post-treatment study visit 
will be considered the End -of-Study date.   
8.[ADDRESS_269009] meet s all study eligibility requirements at Screening  (refer to Section 7.1 for 
enrollment procedures) , the IRT system  will be used by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) to 
randomize the subject to double -blind Induction Therapy on Day 1 (Week 0). Subjects 
randomly assigned in Cohorts  1 - 3 will receive either KHK4083 (one o f three  dose levels) or 
placebo in a 3:1 ratio during Part  A of Induction Therapy. Additional subjects (Cohort 4) in a

8.3 Blinding  During the Double -blind Treatment Period  (Induction Therapy 
and Long -term Extension Therapy)  
The subject  and Investigator (or investigative site personnel ) will not know the treatment to 
which the subject is randomized  during the double -blind Treatment Period . Placebo  will be 
administered by  [CONTACT_223518] . The study is being 
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_269011] (or qualified des ignee) at each investigative site will be unblinded 
and responsible  for preparing the appropriate  treatment based on the treatment assignment  by 
[CONTACT_82550] . The unblinded pharmacist (or qualified designee) will ensure that the 
investigational product  administered to each subject is labeled such that the treatment identity 
cannot be determined .  
8.[ADDRESS_269012]’s trea tment assignment should only be unblinded by [CONTACT_7183]/or 
Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further 
management of the subject or may impact the safety of subjects in current and/or subsequent 
cohorts . Unblinding for any other reason will be considered a protocol violation.  
The Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_223519]’s treatment assignment. However, the Investigator may unblind for safety reas ons 
without prior notification, but must contact [CONTACT_223520]’s source records together 
with a completed SAE form. Any instance of unblinding will be reported in  the clinical study 
report.  
The Investigator or the designee who breaks the blind must record the date and the reasons as 
appropriate.  In such cases, treatment with the investigational product must be stopped and the 
Sponsor must be contact[CONTACT_15608] t o determine whether the subject should be 
withdrawn from the study. Every attempt should be made to contact [CONTACT_223521].  
The study will be unblinded to select  personnel from the Sponsor  (or consultants acting on 
behalf of KKD ) and/or from participating Contract Research Organizations . The individuals 
will be identified in the Blinding Plan and Unblinding Processes for Study 4083 -002. The 
study will be blinded to all other study personnel/consultants, investigative site personnel, 
and study subjects.  
After the last subject completes Part B of Induction Therapy , the study will be unblinded to 
additional select Sponsor  personnel. The study will be unblinded to all study

follow -up visit.  
8.5 Prior and Concurrent Therapy  
All me dications  (including prescription, non -prescription and supplements ) for treatment of 
UC taken within 6 months  prior to Screening ; any other medication taken 1  month prior to 
Screen ing; and any concomitant medications (including tracking probiotic usage) during the 
study  will be collected . For all biologic treatment s, the reason for discontinuation  should be 
collected  at Screening . Combination medications should be recorded by [CONTACT_223522].  
Stable doses of the following concomitant medications are permitted for UC treatment  during 
the study as specified below :   
• Aminosalicylates (5 -ASA  or mesalamine ≤  4.8 g/day; sulfasalazine ≤  3 g/day) for at least 
14 days prior to the Screening visit; and/or  
• Oral glucocorticoids, ≤  20 mg/day prednis olone or the equivalent, or budenoside 
≤ 9 mg/d for at least 14  days prior to the Screening visit (or fo r 4 weeks if a course of 
corticosteroids had started at less than 8 weeks prior to Screening visit); and/or  
• Azathioprine up to 3 mg/ kg/day or 6 -mercaptopurine up to 1.5 mg/ kg/day for a total 
treatment period of at least 12 weeks, including 4 weeks of stabl e treatment, prior to the 
Screening visit.  
Supportive therapy to manage symptoms or AEs is acceptable . Daily, chronic antidiarrheals 
should not be taken .  
One b olus or “rescue” treatment for up to 7  days with each of the following:  systemic 
corticosteroid s or topi[INVESTIGATOR_223467]  (in addition to the dose of 
oral corticosteroids at Screening) is permitted only after Week [ADDRESS_269013] 2  weeks prior to the sigmoidoscopy  at 
Week 52/End -of-Treatment visit . 
Dose reductions of concurrent medications are permitted for AEs from Baseline through the 
end of the study  as allowed by [CONTACT_81692]. Other d ose adjustments of concurrent 
medications (including corticosteroids  and other treatments for UC ) are permitted after the 
Week 12 visit (per Investigator ’s judgment) , i.e., during OLE/ LTE Therapy and the Induction 
Therapy and OLE/ LTE Therapy Follow -up Period s. After the Week 12 visit, corticosteroid  
(glucocorticoid) dosage s of prednisolon e or its equivalent  may be tapered by [CONTACT_3450] 
2.5 mg/d ay per week , at the Investigator’s discretion . Subjects who have recurrence of 
clinical symptoms ma y increase their chronic (>  7 days) dose of corticosteroids and other 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  65  treatments for UC may increase up to 110% of the original dose at the start of Induction 
Therapy.  
8.5.1  Prohibited Treatment  
During Screening and Induction Therapy, s ubjects are not permitted to receive rescue therapy 
for UC including increases in corticosteroids  or other medications  for UC treatment, except 
as specified above  (Section 8.5). 
During Screening , Induction Therapy , and OLE/ LTE Therapy, s ubjects are not permitted to 
receive any additional experimental therapy  or any other therapy to treat the UC, except as 
specified above . The following  is a list of specific prohibited treatments :  
• B-cell depleting agents including vedolizumab, natalizumab , efalizumab or rituximab or 
other lymphocyte -depleting treatments, including but not limited to alkylating agents 
(such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil) and total lymphoid irradiation;  
• Methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, thalidomid e, or other immune 
altering drugs; ( Note:  ophthalmologic preparations are permitted .) 
• TNF antagonists . 
The above  prohibited treatments are permitted during the Induction Therapy Follow -up 
Period and OLE/ LTE Therapy Follow -up Period of the study.  
Some med ications , such as nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs,  may need to be 
administered or held prior to a sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. Those will be detailed in a 
sigmoidoscopy manual.  
8.[ADDRESS_269014] to the KHK4083  (or placebo)  
dosing schedule required by [CONTACT_760].  At least five of six IV infusions of investigational 
product are required to be administered during Induction Therapy for treatment compliance in 
this study.  At least half of the  IV infusions of investigational product are required to be 
administered during OLE/ LTE Therapy for treatment compliance in th is study.   
8.6.[ADDRESS_269015] (KHK4083 o r placebo) will be 
administered every 2 weeks, for a total of 6 doses. A visit window, ±  2 days at Week 2, and 
± 4 days for all other doses, has been defined. If the study visit/dosing does not occur during  
the planned visit window, investigational product  should not be administered at the visit and 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  66  the next dose should be administered at the next visit. KHK4083 or placebo should not be 
administered less than 6 days from the previous dosing.  
9 STUDY PROCEDURES  
It is important to maintain the visit structure as accurately as possible . Whenever an 
adjustment to this structure is necessary, the date of the adjusted visit should occur within the 
number of  days (before or after) specified in the  planned schedule s for Screening, Induction 
Therapy, and Induction The rapy Post -treatment Follow -up Period (refer to Study Schedule of 
Events, Table  9-1) and for OLE/ LTE Therapy and OLE/ LTE Therapy Post -treatment Follow -
up Period (refer to Study Schedule of Events,  Table  9-2). The timing of any subsequent visits 
should be scheduled to maintain the visit structure relative to the first day that investigational 
product  was administered . 
Screening evaluations used to determine the subject’s study  eligibility must be completed 
within the Screening Period (Day −28 to Day −1) prior to starting treatment on Day  1 
(Week  0) unless otherwise specified . Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any 
study -specific procedures . Results of all Screening evaluations must be reviewed by [CONTACT_74320]/her designee to ensure that all eligibility criteria have been satisfied prior 
to randomization . For subjects who complete double -blind Induction Therapy and are eligible 
at Week 12 to receive  treatment , additional criteria are required for enrollment in OLE/ LTE 
Therapy (refer to Section 7.[ADDRESS_269016]  of criteria).  
All efficacy, PK , PD, immunogenicity, and safety measurements obtained during the course 
of the study are summarized in Table  9-1, Table  9-2, Table  10.4.1 -1, and Table  10.4.1 -2.

The secondary efficacy endpoints for all subjects who receive the recommended dose during 
double -blind Induction Therapy  are as follows : 
• Improvement in  the mucosa at Week 12;  
– Changes in the mucosa will be based on the percentage of subjects with at least a 
1-point improvement in their mMES (0 to 3) from Baseline (Week 0) to Week  12; 
and/or  
– Changes in the mucosa will be based the percentage of subjects w ith at least a 1 -point 
improvement in their modified Baron endoscopic score (5 -point scale) from Baseline 
(Week 0) to Week 12; and/or  
– Changes in the mucosa will be based on the mean change in UCEIS (0 to 8) and 
subscores from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12 . 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  82  • Mucosal healing at Week 12;  
Mucosal healing is defined as a mMES  of 0 or 1. 
• Clinical improvement at Week 12 ; 
Improvement will be based on a reduction (mean change from Baseline [Week 0] at 
Week  12) in the total Mayo Clinic score (0 to 12) . 
• Clinical improv ement at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12;  
Improvement will be based on mean changes from Baseline (Week 0) in the partial 
(excludes endoscop y subscore s) Mayo Clinic score (0 to 10).  
• Clinical response  at Week 12 ;  
A clinical response is defined as a reduction  in the total Mayo Clinic score of at least 
[ADDRESS_269048] 30% from Baseline  (Week 0) to Week [ADDRESS_269049] 1  point from Baseline (Week 0) to 
Week 12 or an absolute rectal bleeding scor e of 0 or 1  at Week 12 . 
• Clinical remission at Week 12;  
Clinical remission is defined as a total Mayo Clinic score of  ≤ 2 and no subscore s > 1. 
For all subjects who receive KHK4083 at dose levels different than the recommended dose 
during double -blind Induction Therapy, improvement in the mucosa at Week  12 based on the 
mean change in the mMES  from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12 is the main secondary 
endpoint. The other secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 12 for all subjects who receive 
KHK4083 at other than the recommended dose are the same as those listed and defined 
above, i.e., improvement in the mucosa based on the mod ified Baron endoscopic score  and 
the UCEIS ; mucosal healing; clinical improvement based on total, as well as partial (excludes 
endoscopy subscore at Weeks  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ) Mayo Clinic scores; clinical response; 
and clinical remission.  The PK  for KHK [ADDRESS_269050]

10.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
Efficacy and PD exploratory endpoints will be included in this study  for all subjects with 
moderately active UC who receive both Induction The rapy and OLE/ LTE Maintenance 
Therapy. The exploratory endpoints for all subjects who receive both Induction Therapy and 
OLE/ LTE Maintenance Therapy are as follows:  
• Clinical improvement at Week 52 ; 
Improvement will be based on a reduction ( mean change from Baseline [Week 0] to 
Week 52 ) in the total Mayo Clinic score (0 to 12).  
• Clinical improvement at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52 and  at

CONFIDENTIAL  94  10.6.4  Physical Examination  
The Investigator will perform complete physical examination s including general appearance 
and examination of head, eyes, ea rs, nose, and throat (HEENT ) and body systems 
(cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdominal, musculoskeletal, extremities, lymph nodes, and  skin) 
at Screening , Baseline ( Week 0, Day 1), End -of-Induction Therapy (Week 12), and 
End-of-OLE/ LTE Therapy (Week 52) . Brief physical examination s (only include HEENT, 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , and abdominal examinations) will be performed at all other visits 
during the Treatment Period and Follow -up Periods as specified in Table  9-1 and Table  9-2. 
Body weight (kg) and height (cm) will be obtained while the subject is wearing light clothing 
(without shoes) . Body weight will be documented during the Screening visit  and at each 
study visit du ring the Treatment Period and Follow -up Period ; height will be recorded at the 
Screening visit only  (refer to Table  9-1 and Table  9-2) 
10.6.5  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
An AE is d efined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a n investigational  product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and /or unintended sign  (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product  whether or not considered related to the product.  
An AE includes but is not limited to:   
• Any clinically significant worsening of a pre -existing  condition;  
• An AE occurring from overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that prescribed by a healthcare 
professional for clinical reasons, or a dose higher than that described on the marketed 
product label) of an investigational or marketed product, whether a ccidental or 
intentional;  
• An AE occurring from abuse (e.g., use for non -clinical reasons) of an investigational or 
marketed product.  
The collection of AE and SAE information commences following the subject’s written 
consent to participate in the study. The Investigator will inquire about AEs at all subject visits 
by [CONTACT_63397] a non -leading question such as: “How have you been feeling since your 
last visit?” All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_19007], must be 
collected . If a subject experiences an AE or SAE, the subject will receive appropriate 
treatment and supportive care as necessary, and the Investigator will continue to follow up 
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_269065]’s baseline condition, or until a clinically sati sfactory 
resolution is achieved.   
In addition to the Investigator’s own descriptio n of the AEs, each AE will be coded by [CONTACT_223527]  (MedDRA) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Intensity  
All AEs will be classified either as mild, moderate, or severe in intensity as defined below:  
• Mild  – Event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring intervention, or 
treatment; does not limit or interfere with daily activities (e.g., insomnia, mild headache).  
• Moderate  – Event is sufficiently discomforting so as to limit or interfere with daily 
activities; may require interventional treatment (e.g., fever requiring antipyretic 
medication).  
• Severe  – Event results in significant symptoms that prevents normal daily activi ties; 
requires interventional treatment and may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006] 
(e.g., anemia resulting in blood transfusion).  
Refer to Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_269066]; and discontinuing investigational product administration if the 
subject experiences a severe AE related to the investigation prod uct. 
The Investigator  will be instructed to closely monitor each subject who experiences an AE 
(whether ascribed to the investigational product  or not) until the outcome of the AE has been 
determined.  The AE must be monitored until the return to the subjec t’s baseline condition or 
until clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved (e.g., Grade 1 or stable).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Relationship  
The causal relationship of each AE to the investigational product (KHK4083 or placebo)  
must be determined by a medically qu alified individual . The causal relationship should be 
assessed  as one of the following:  
Related  
There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product  administration 
and the AE. The term “ reasonable  causal relationship” means the re is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship.  
Not relate d 
There is not a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administration and the AE.  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  96  [IP_ADDRESS]  Classifying Infusion Reactions  
• Mild  - infusion reaction requires no intervention and no interruption of the infusion ; 
however,  infusion interruption is permitted to observe the subject for resolution of any 
signs/symptoms before re -starting the infusion.  
• Moderate  - infusion reaction requires possible intervention (e.g., paracetamol orally and  
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or an equivalent anti -histamine may be administered) and 
interruption of the infusion for at least 15 to 30 minutes  prior to re -starting or 
discontinuing the infusion.  
• Severe  - infusion reaction requires medical intervention (i.e. , immediate medical/nursing 
assessment and indicated supportive management per the institutional standard of care 
and local Investigator judgment until the signs/symptoms of the reaction have resolved) 
and immediate discontinuation of the infusion.  
Refer t o Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details on continuing or discontinuing investigational 
product administration following an acute infusion reaction.  
10.6.6  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any AE that:  
• Resul ts in death.  
• Is immediately life  threatening . The term “life  threatening” as part of the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at imminent risk of death without 
urgent intervention at the time of the event; it does not refer t o an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is another important medical event. Important medical events are those that may not result 
in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered an  SAE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment , they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatme nt in an emergency room or at home, or blood dyscrasias that does not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in  
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache) . This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  97  pose a threat to life or functioning . Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
All AEs, whether non -serious or serious, must be recorded as appropriate . In addition, any 
AE that is initial ly considered serious or becomes serious must be reported as an  SAE .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Notification of Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics 
Committee of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to t he 
reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC . The IRB/IEC must be informed in a timely manner by 
[CONTACT_223528] . Investigators 
must also submit safety information provided by [CONTACT_223529] . Investigators (or the 
Sponsor  accordingly to specified regulations) also must submit safety information to the IEC. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Contacts  
All SAE reports and follow -up SAE documentation should be emailed to the Sponsor ’s Drug 
Safety Surveillance Departm ent:  SAESource@kyowa -kirin -pharma.com . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urgent Safety Measures  
In accordance with the principles of GCP as described  in ICH E6, the Investigator (s) 
has/have primary responsibility for assuring subject safety throughout the performance of 
study procedures . An urgent safety measure is defined as any measure , which an Investigator  
may need to implement , which is a deviation from, or a change in, the protocol to eliminate 
an immediate hazard(s) to study subject (s) without prior IRB/IEC  approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n. 
The Investigator  may take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect the subjects 
of a clinical study against any immediate hazards to their health or safety . However, the  
Investigator must inform the Sponsor  within  [ADDRESS_269067] be officially documented by [CONTACT_223530] (SAESource@kyowa -kirin -
pharma.com ) and must include details of what measures were  taken and the circumstances 
giving rise to those measures.  
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_269068] 
(KHK4083  or placebo ), the outcome of the event, and the relationship of the event to 
KHK4083  or placebo . A medical condition present at Screening, but that has increased in 
frequency or severity, must be recorded as an AE. For screen failures, SAEs should be 
collected and recorded only until the subject is determined to be a screen failure . Screening or 
withdraws consent to participate in the study, except for SAEs that occur outside of that 
window which are attribute d to screening -specific procedures. All AEs with onset after 
signing of the ICF should be collected. Adverse events which occur prior to first 
administration of investigational product  should be identified as occurring  pretreatment . No 
AE data should be en tered on the eCRF for screen failures.  
Standard medical terminology should be used to document AEs . The subject’s exact 
description of the event will be recorded in the source documentation . In the case of signs and 
symptoms, the underlying illness or diag nosis will be recorded as the event when known . For 
SAEs, a single term for the diagnosis or underlying illness should be provided  on the SAE 
Report form; if the underlying illness/diagnosis  is unknown, the chief sign/symptom making 
the event serious shoul d be recorded.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported according to regulatory guidelines.  
All serious and non -serious AEs must be followed for a final outcome until the end of the 
Post-treatment Follow -up Period. An outcome of “unknown” is not considered to be an 
acceptable final outcome . An outcome of “not resolved ” is an acceptable final outcome for 
non-serious AEs at the end of a subject’s participation in a study, and for SAEs at database 
lock.  
All SAEs re quire expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  Any SAE 
occurring in a clinical study subject must be reported to the Sponsor  or designee within 
[ADDRESS_269069] be submitted as soon as 
possible to the Sponsor . The Investigator will ensure that information repo rted immediately 
by [CONTACT_223531].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Infusion Reactions  
The s igns and symptoms of an infusion reaction usually develop during or shortly after drug 
infusion and  generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of the infusion. 
Infusion reactions should be recorded so that the presenting sign/symptom is part of the 
reported AE term(s) (e.g., chills or infusion reaction, fever).  Acute infusion  reactions 
should not be classified as anaphylaxis unless symptomatic bronchospasm and/or allergy -
related edema/angioedema is/are the principal clinical manifestation(s).  Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_269070] as well as the duration of each symptom should be recorded.  
The intensity of the infusion reaction (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for definitions of mild, 
moderate, or severe infusion reactions) and causal relationship (i.e., related or not related) to 
the investigational product (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  ) should be determined and reported.  
10.6.8  Other Significant Adverse Events  
Clinical laboratory abnormalities that qualify as AEs (other than those meeting the definition 
for serious) and /or any events that lead to an intervention (including premature 
discon tinuation or prolonged infusion time of the investigational product , or significant 
additional concomitant therapy) will be reported and evaluated as AEs.  
Any clinically important changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, ECGs, 
x-rays, o r any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are 
required by [CONTACT_760], must also be collected , and if serious recorded on the SAE Report 
form , when possible, in order for the Sponsor  to collect additional information about that 
Clinical Protocol [ADDRESS_269071] exposure of pregnant women and/or fetuses as well as the risks 
associated with exposure of a father, regarding congenital abnormalities or birth defects in 
their offspring . It also ensures compliance with applicable international and local regulations.  
The requirements are applicable to all subjects following exposure to the investigational 
product (KHK4083 or placebo) . 
Female study  subjects : The subject must be advised by [CONTACT_223532].  
Male study  subjects : The subject must be advised by [CONTACT_223533] . 
When a study  subject reports a  pregnancy (post -KHK4083  administration) to the Investigator , 
KHK4083  should be stopped immediately and a pregnancy test should be arranged for the 
subject (or their partner) by [CONTACT_68589] [ADDRESS_269072] information collected in 
the perf ormance of this study and that will be entered into the electronic data capture ( EDC ) 
system . These eCRFs are organized as an ordered series of electronic data entry modules 
specific for each scheduled and unscheduled study visit.  
The investigative site ED C users will exercise due diligence in ensuring that study data are 
entered accurately and in their entirety from the investigative site’s source documents and 
flow sheets into the appropriate data entry fields . Only staff listed on the “Delegation of 
Auth ority” page in the study file notebook and who have been appropriately trained to use the 
EDC system will be issued a user identification code allowing them to make entries and edits 
to the EDC system  and to respond to queries . Only the Investigator will b e issued a user 
identification  code allowing the application of an electronic signature [CONTACT_1639] a completed study 
subject record signifying the data has been reviewed and verified as complete and accurate.  
By [CONTACT_12570], the Investigator  agrees to tr eat all subject  data used and disclosed in 
connection with this study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules and 
regulations . In addition for US investigative sites,  compliance is required with all applicable 
provisions of the Health Insuran ce Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ) and its 
implementing regulations .

12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSIS  
12.1 General Statistical Considerations  
All categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335] . Descriptive statistics 
(mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum) fo r continuous variables 
will be utilized. All summaries and analyses conducted will be by [CONTACT_14338]  
(KHK4083 dose levels; combined KHK4083; and placebo) and by [CONTACT_765]. The specifics for 
these outputs will be described in detail within the Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . The last 
pre-administration observation will be used as the Baseline value for calculating post -
administration changes from Baseline . For efficacy assessments, Baseline is defined as 
Week  0. Data obtained and entered into the database will be provided in separate data listings 
showing individual subject values . The planning and reporting of statistical analysis will be 
carried out as described in the Sponsor ’s work instructions and standard operating procedures 
(SOPs ) governing clinical  studies.  
12.2 Populations to be Analyzed  
The following analysis sets will be used in the study:  
• Safety Analysis Set:  Includes all subjects who received any (even a partial dose) 
investigational product (KHK4083 or placebo) ; 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS) : Includes al l subjects who receive at least one full dose of 
investigational product  and who have Baseline data and at least one post -treatment  
assessment  of the primary efficacy variable .  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  103  Major protocol deviations will be assessed through the study team’s review and  the handling 
of these deviations described in the SAP. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_269074] Disposition  
The number of subjects enrolled  and completed /discontinued for each of the  period s 
(Screening, Induction Therapy, Induction Therapy Follow -up Period, OLE/ LTE Therapy, and 
LTE Thera py Follow -up Period ) will be presented . A summary of reasons for discontinuation 
will be provided . The number of subjects in the Safety Analysis  Set and FAS will be 
provided  as well as the number of subjects who were excluded from each analysis set . The 
reasons why subjects were excluded from any analysis set will be summarized and listed 
individually.  
12.2.2  Demographic and Baseline Disease Characteristics  
Summaries will include demographics (including age,  race, ethnicity, and sex), height, body 
weight, and Baseline values for  UC assessment  in the Safety Analysis Set . All demographic 
data, including  medical/surgical history  and physical examination results of note,  will be 
listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
12.2.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
The World Health Organization Drug Dic tionary  will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications by [CONTACT_223534] . Prior medications include 
any previous biologic treatment (for any indication),  all treatment  for UC taken within 
[ADDRESS_269075] ered for the entire Treatment Period. Extent of exposure  and total number of 
doses administered for each treatment  during Induction Therapy and OLE/ LTE Therapy will 
be summarized  as well as the number of doses administered to subjects by [CONTACT_6278] .  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  104  12.3 Efficacy Analysis  
All efficacy analyses will be performed in the FAS unless otherwise specified.  
12.3.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy variable  is the change from Baseline (Week 0) in mucosal score 
presented by [CONTACT_223535]  12 for subjects who received  the recommended dose  during 
Induction Therapy. This includes Part A  subjects who received the recommended dose 
identified for Part B as well as the subjects who received the recommended dose during  
Part B of Induction Therapy . (Note: For all other subject s who receive KHK4083 at dose 
levels different than the recommended dose in Parts A and B of Induction Therapy, this 
efficacy variable will be considered the main secondary variable .) The primary variable will 
be used for an exploratory efficacy analy sis using a linear model with Baseline values as a 
covariate to estimate the difference between t reatment cohorts  (each KHK4083  dose level  
versus placebo) .  
In order to test for optimal dose levels within this fitted linear model, t hree types of contrasts 
will be defined  to demonstrate which KHK4083 dose level is deemed closest to optimal.  The 
first contrast is for the scenario of “10  mg/kg is closest to optimal” and its vector, (P L M H), 
is (-1 -1 -1 3), where P: Placebo; L: 1 .0 mg/kg; M: 3.0 mg/kg; and H: 10 kg/mg.  The second 
contrast is for the scenario of “ 3.0 mg/kg is closest to optimal” and its vector is ( -1 -1 1 1).  
The third contrast is for the scenario of “1 .0 mg/kg is closest to optimal” and its vector is 
(-3 1 1 1).  Each contrast will be tested within  the fitted model to determine the dose level 
providing optimum benefit over placebo.   
12.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Analys es 
The s econdary efficacy  variables  for all subjects (i.e., recommended dose or any other dose 
level in Parts A and B of Induction Therapy)  are as follows : 
• The percentages of subjects with at least a 1 -point improvement in their mMES from 
Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12.  
• The percentages of subjects with at least a 1 -point improvement in their modified Baron 
endoscopic s core from Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12.  
• The mean change in  UCEIS (0 to 8) and subscores from Baseline (Week 0) to Week  12. 
• The percentage of subjects with a mucosal healing (the mMES  ≤ 1) at Week 12.  
• The change from Baseline (Week 0) in total Mayo Clinic score (0 to 12) at Week  12. 
• The change from Baseline (Week 0) in partial Mayo Clinic scores ( 0 to 9; without 
sigmoidoscopy) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  105  • The percentages of c linical response  (the change from Baseline in the total Mayo Clinic 
score ≤  −3 and the percent age change from Baseline in the total Mayo Clinic score 
≤ −30% to Week [ADDRESS_269076] 1  point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤ 1).  
• The percentages of clinical remission  (a total  Mayo Clinic score ≤ 2 and no 
subscore s > 1) at Week 12. 
Treatment (each KHK4083 dose level versus placebo) comparisons by [CONTACT_223536] .  
12.3.3  Exploratory Efficacy Analysis  
Clinical impr ovement (changes from Baseline [Week 0] to Week 52 in the total Mayo Clinic 
score ) at Week 52 will be summarized . In addition, change from Baseline (Week 0) in partial 
Mayo Clinic score s (without sigmoidoscopy)  will be summarized by [CONTACT_223537] 16 , 
20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52 and at OLE/ LTE Therapy Follow -up Period visits 
(Weeks  56, 60, and 64) .  
Clinical response at Week 52 will be summarized . Clinical remission  will be summarized at 
Week 52 .  
At Weeks 12 and 52, durable clinical respon se and  durable  clinical remission  (present at both 
Weeks 12 and 52), and glucocorticoid -free clinical remission at Week 52 will be 
summarized .  
Remission (mMES of 0 or 1, stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and rectal bleeding subscore  
of 0) rates at Week s 12 and 52 will be summarized.  
The percentage of subjects with mucosal healing at Week  52 will  be summarized. The 
percentages of subjects with improvement in the mucosa (change from Baseline of at least a 
1-point improvement in the mMES  and/or in the modifi ed Baron endoscopic scores ; and/or 
mean change from Baseline in the UCEIS score ) at Week  52. 
The change from Baseline in HRQL  based on IBDQ will be analyzed for total score and 
4 subscale scores  at all study visits (Weeks 2 to 52, including Induction Thera py Follow -up 
Period visits (Weeks  16, 20, and 26) and LTE Therapy Follow -up Period visits (Weeks 56, 
60, and 64 ). 
At Weeks 16 through 52 and through the OLE/ LTE Therapy Follow -up Period (Week 56 
through Week 64), the change from Baseline in corticosteroid (glucocorticoid) dosage s and 
the duration of glucocorticoid -free treatment will be summarized.   
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  106  Treatment ( each KHK4083 dose level versus placebo) comparisons by [CONTACT_223538]/LTE 
will be performed  with the linear model  for all exploratory efficacy analys es of continuous 
variables .  
Exploratory analyses are described in detail in the SAP.  
12.3.4  Sample Size Determination  
Assuming a 15% dropout rate, it is anticipated that approximately 60 subjects will be 
required to be randomized in order to achieve 51 evaluable  subjects in the  FAS. In Part A 
(Cohorts 1 - 3), the sample size is based on the feasibility of the safety and tolerability 
assessment to recommend starting the treatment of the next cohort of 12  subjects/cohort 
([ADDRESS_269077] s to receive placebo). In Part  B (Cohort  4) for 
the treatment of 24 subjects (18  subjects to receive KHK4083 at the recommended dose 
based on the safety and tolerability in Part  A and 6  subjects to receive placebo ), the sample 
size is based on the feasibili ty of exploratory assessments in efficacy and safety at the 
recommended dose level. Based on the UCEIS  and Mayo Clinic scores  and from  combining 
Part A and Part B , it is planned to have approximately a total of 27  randomized subjects 
receive the recommende d dose of KHK4083 and 15  subjects receive placebo.  
12.3.5  Significance Level  
All statistical analyses in this Phase 2 study will be descriptive or exploratory, and no 
adjustment to control Type I error will be performed.  
12.4 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immu nogenicity Analyses  
12.4.1  Pharmacokinetic  Analyses  
All subjects with sufficient quantifiable data will be included in the PK analysis. Serum 
concentration data will be summarized with descriptive statistics at each scheduled time 
point. Individual serum concentr ations at each sampling time point for KHK4083 will be 
presented by [CONTACT_39608]. Descriptive summary statistics of serum concentrations including 
means, ranges, SD , and percent  coefficient of variation ( %CV) will be presented. Individual 
and mean concentratio ns versus time will be plotted on linear and semi -logarithmic  scales.  
Concentration -time data for Cohorts 1 - 3 (Induction Therapy - Part A and LTE Therapy) will 
be analyzed individually by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analysis methods using actual elapsed times 
relative to the last  dosing . The following PK parameters will be summarized: Cmax, tmax, Cmin, 
AUC 0-t, AUC 0-τ, AUC 0-∞, t1/2, CLs, V ss, Vz, and Rac. The PK parameters for KHK4083 will be 
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  107  summarized by [CONTACT_223497] (i.e., Induction Therapy and LTE Therapy). 
All PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, maximum, 
median, minimum, and %CV).  
A sparse PK sampling strategy was planned for Cohort 4 (Induction Therapy - Part B and 
LTE Therapy) , therefore population PK analysis using mixed -effect modeling will be applied 
to the data from both Cohorts 1 - 3 (Part A ) and Cohort 4 ( Part B ). The PK exposure 
parameters will be calculated using a final population PK model.  
The dose  proportionality of KHK4083 PK exposure parameters will be assessed using the 
Power Model for Cohorts 1 - 3 (Induction Therapy - Part A and OLE/ LTE Therapy) . The 
PK exposure parameters include C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞, as appropriate. The PK -PD 
relationship s will be explored using graphic tools or modeling as needed.  
Additional details of the PK and PK -PD analys es will be addressed in a separate PK-PD 
Analysis Plan.  
12.4.2  Pharmacodynamic  Analyses  
The PD parameters will be determined in subjects with moderately active UC and 
summarized by [CONTACT_223497] (i.e., Induction Therapy - Part A and Part B , 
and OLE/ LTE Therapy). For the delayed -type h ypersensitivity assay, values will be 
summarized at Screening  and Week 10 for selected investigative sites. For fecal calprotectin, 
mean change and mean percentage change from Baseline (Week 0) at Week  12 and median 
values at Weeks 2, 12, and 52 will be an alyzed for subjects who received the recommended 
dose. For the wr-CRP  assays, mean change and mean percentage change from Baseline 
(Week 0) at Week  12 and median values at Weeks  2 through 12 and at Weeks 24, 36, 52 , and 
64 will be analyzed for the subjects  who received the recommended dose. The details will be  
described in the PK -PD Analysis Plan.  
12.4.3  Immunogenicity Analyses  
The immunogenicity of KHK4083 will be determined in subjects with moderately active UC. 
The percentage of subjects with confirmed anti -KHK 4083 antibodies will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_223497] (i.e., Induction Therapy - Part A and Part B , and OLE/ LTE 
Therapy), visit (week), and overall. The effect of positive anti -KHK4083 antibodies on the 
PK, and possibly efficacy and safety,  will be explored.  
Clinical Protocol 4083 -002, Amendment 2    
   
CONFIDENTIAL  108  12.5 Analyses of Safety Data  
The overall safety and tolerability of KHK4083 compared to placebo administered in 
multiple IV doses will be determined for reported AEs  (including SAEs) , physical 
examinations, vital signs, body weight, [ADDRESS_269078] dose  for 
potential AEs.  Treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs) will be grouped and tabulated by 
[CONTACT_223539]  (PT) and SOC. All TEAEs will be summarized showing the 
number and percentage of subjects for each event with a start time within the Treatment 
Period ( i.e., Induction  Therapy  and OLE or LTE Therapy ) and by [CONTACT_9084]  (KHK4083  versus 
placebo ) during Induction Therapy  or KHK4083 dose level versus placebo during OLE/ LTE 
Therapy .

Activity (Score 0 to 12 ) with Modified Mayo Endoscopy Subscore  
Score Range :  0 to 12 a, b 
Stool Frequency (subject to establish his/her ‘normal’ frequency)c (Subscore 0 to 3):  
0 = Normal number of stools for this subject  
1 = 1 to 2 stools more than normal  
2 = 3 to 4 stools more than normal  
3 = 5 or more stools more than normal  
Rectal Bleeding (most severe bleeding of day to be recorded)c (Subscore 0 to 3):  
0 = No blood seen  
1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time  
2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time  
3 = Blood alone passes  
Endoscopy Findingsb (Subscore 0 t o 3):  
0 = Normal or inactive disease  
1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern)  
2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, erosions)  
3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)  
Physician’s Global Ass essmentc, d (Subscore 0 to 3):  
0 = Normal  
1 = Mild disease  
2 = Moderate disease   
3 = Severe disease  
a: Higher scores indicate more severe disease. The total Mayo Clinic score (0 to 12) is a sum of the four subscores.  
b: Partial Mayo Clinic scores (0 to 9) exclude the Endoscopy Findings subscore because no endoscopy is performed. 
Endoscopy Findings subscore is amended  by [CONTACT_223551] a subscore of 1 ; thus any friability, even if 
mild, results in an endoscopic subscore of at least 2.  
c: Based  on a review of the subject’s diary. Mayo Clinic subscores will be derived from the diaries over [ADDRESS_269092] to each visit.  
d: Based on subject’s daily recollection of abdominal discomfort and general sense of well -being, and ot her observations 
(e.g., physical findings and the subject’s performance status).

1) Diagnosis of Anaphylaxis  
The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on the following three clinical criteria, with 
anaphylaxi s considered as highly likely when one of these criteria is fulfilled (Sampson , 
2006):   
a) Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the 
skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, 
swollen lips -tongue -uvula), and at least one of the following :  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hypotonia [coll apse], syncope, incontinence)   
b) Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  
allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):   
• Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, 
swollen lips -tongue-uvula)  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)  
• Persistent gastrointestinal sympto ms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)   
c) Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known  allergen for that patient  
(minutes to several hours):   
• Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than 
30-percent decrease in syst olic blood pressure   
• Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 
30-percent decrease from that person’s baseline  
Although none of the clinical criteria provide 100 -percent sensitivity and specificity, it is 
believed that these criteria are likely to capture more than 95 percent of cases of anaphylaxis 
(Sampson , 2006).  
 
Laboratory tests for evaluating anaphylaxis:   
 
At present, there are no sensitive and specific laboratory tests to confirm the clinical diagnosis of 
anaphylaxis.  Skin testing and in vitro diagnostic tests to determine the level of specific IgE 
antibodies directed against the therapeutic protein produ ct, mediator release, or basophil 
activation may be useful for characterizing the underlying pathophysiology and may provide 
insight into potential mitigation strategies (Simons , 2010; Lee and Vadas , 2011).  However, the 
results of unvalidated tests should  be interpreted with caution; and the clinical relevance of 
positive results from unvalidated tests may be uncertain during product development.

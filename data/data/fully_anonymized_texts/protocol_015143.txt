Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  6 to discontinue immunogenicity analys es due to practical or strategic reasons  (e.g., not enough 
blood volume collected fr om the patient).  
POPULATION:  
Adult CMV  seronegative  (-) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a CMV  seropositive  (+) 
living donor  (Groups 1 and 2) and adult CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant 
from a CMV seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living donor (Group 3) , recruited  globally  
from specified  transplant centers . Approximately 150 patients will be enroll ed. 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
This Phase 2 study of HB -101, a bivalent CMV vaccine, in patients awaiting kidney 
transplantation includes a randomized, placebo -controlled portion (Groups 1 and 2) and an 
open -label portion (Group 3).

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  7 For Group 3, adult CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living donor will be enrolled into Group 3. 
Post-transplant CMV management will follow either preemptive or prophylactic care as defined 
at study enrollment by [CONTACT_527558].  
Patients enrolled into Group [ADDRESS_684810] injection  of HB -101. Patients in Group 3 will receive HB -101 
vaccin ation (s) prior to their transplant surgery. Enrollment of Group 3 will be a minimum of  15% 
of total patients.  
Patients receiving at least [ADDRESS_684811] occurs:  
• When the patient completes the study follow -up ([ADDRESS_684812] -transplant).  
• If for some reason kidney transplant has not occurred by [ADDRESS_684813] dose of study 
drug (HB -101 or placebo).  
• If the patient experiences graft failure requiring removal of the transplanted organ or return s 
to dia lysis. 
• If the patient is withdrawn  or withdraws  from the study.  
• If the patient is lost to follow -up.  
• If the patient dies.  
The total duration of the study for each patient participatin g in the study will be approximately 
15 months.  
The dosing schedule rel ative to transplantation is listed in the table titled “ Timing of Kidney 
Transplant vs. Study Drug (HB -101 or Placebo) Injection,  Where Day [ADDRESS_684814] Dose 
of Study Drug .”

Day 91 = [ADDRESS_684824] dose of study drug ; Day  120 = [ADDRESS_684825] dose of study drug.  
In brief, it is the intent of this study to administer up to 3 doses of study drug (HB -101 or placebo) 
prior to transplantation and within proximity to the time of transp lantation.  However, 2 doses of 
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_684826] dose  of study drug is not feasible due to transplantation timelines. Patients will 
not receive study drug after transplantation.  
After Day 0 dose administration, the subsequent study drug administration(s) should be given 
28 days (±7 days) apart .  
Patients whose planned transplantation is less than [ADDRESS_684827] study drug 
(HB-101 or placebo) injection should not be enrolled.  
A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) must be planned between the last dose of study drug and 
transplantation , unless agreed otherwise between the sponsor and investigator on a case -by-case 
basis .  
Patients whose planned transplantation is no longer than [ADDRESS_684828] study 
drug (HB -101 or placebo) injection should be enrolled . Changes in transplantation timelines will 
not result in patient withdrawal from the study. In case of delayed transplantation, a dditional study 
drug injections prior to transplantation can be discussed with the sponsor  or sponsor designee (who 
should be blinded).  The maximum allowed number of patients receiving additional study drug 
injections prior to transplantation will be capped at 10 patients (less than 10% of planned sample 
size).  
For Groups 1 and 2, i n the event that t he living donor is not available and a kidney from a CMV 
seropositive (+) deceased donor becomes available, the patient can continue in the study after 
transplantation. For Group 3, in the event that t he living donor is not available and a kidney from 
a dece ased donor becomes available, the patient can continue in the study after transplantation.  
The additional study drug booster will be administered at least 7 days ( ±2 days) prior to the 
scheduled transplantation. This allows maximal protection against CMV p rior to the transplant. 
Blood collection for immunogenicity will be performed prior to each study drug booster 
administered. Immunogenicity will not be used to determine the administration of a booster as 
these results would be unblinding; instead, reactog enicity will be reviewed and the investigator  
and sponsor may decide not to administer the booster if there is evidence of increasing reactions 
with increasing number of vaccinations. The number and timing of vaccination s versus 
transplantation will be des cribed in the descriptive analyses.  
RATIONALE:  
Cytomegalovirus  is a common opportunistic pathogen in patients who have undergone solid organ 
transplantation (SOT). The majority of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527497] a seroposit ive donor organ. Viral replication in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527498], which  can 
progress  to end- organ disease. Active CMV infection correlates with a higher risk of other 
infections, post -transplant lymphoma, organ rejection, and overall morbidity and mo rtality. To 
prevent CMV infection and disease, transplant centers routinely employ either a prophylactic or 
preemptive strategy using ganciclovir or its oral prodrug valganciclovir. The prophylactic 
approach is effective in preventing end -organ disease whi le on anti -viral prophylaxis, but patients 
remain at  significant  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_527499] -onset disease once prophylaxis is stopped. 
Sometimes, late -onset disease is caused by [CONTACT_527559], which r equir es the use of more toxic second -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The p reemptive approach 
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  9 requires  close monitoring of CMV DNAemia  via polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and is thus 
often limi ted by [CONTACT_527560] , given the need for frequent blood draws . 
An effective CMV vaccine administered prior to transplantation would overcome the limitations  
of both the prophylactic and preemptive approaches. Hookipa Biotech  GmbH (hereinafter 
Hookipa Biotech)  completed a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study (Study H -100-001) of the 
predecessor HB -101 (encoding phosphoprotein 65 kD [ pp65]  and a truncated glycoprotein B [ gB] 
of human cytomegalovirus  [HCMV ]).  
In brief, Hookipa Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.  
• A favorable safety profile.  
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par with previous ly studied vaccines . 
• gB- and pp65 -specific T -cell immunogenicity  previously shown to correlate with prote ction 
(in adoptive  T-cell t ransfer  studies).   
Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipates that the vaccine should be more  effective than previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT  setting . 
Based on the available safety data of the H -100-002 study ( data cutoff date of 03  September  2019 ) 
(see the latest Investigator’s Brochure in circulation), H-100-002 protocol amendment Version  5.0 
will include Group 3 to explore additional safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data in CMV 
seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV s eropositive (+) or CMV 
seronegative ( -) donor. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data collected from this patient 
population will provide critical information for the registration trial based on the broad population 
of patients who are at intermedia te and high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_527500] -transplantation.  
PATIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : 
Inclusion Criteria:  
Patients who meet all of the following inclusion criteria for their respective groups will be eligible 
to particip ate in the study:  
1. Male or female patients [ADDRESS_684829] be CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) seronegative ( -) and will 
be receiving a kidney for transplantation from donors who are CMV IgG seropositive (+). (If 
CMV IgG serology is indeterminate, repeat testing  is recommended. If the serology for the 
donor is indeterminate upon repeat testing, it should be considered positive; if the serology for 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527501], it should be considered negative).  
5. For Group 3, patients must be CMV IgG seropositive (+) and will be receiving a kidney for 
transplantation from donors who are CMV IgG seropositive (+) or CMV IgG seronegative ( -).

or up to completion of the study, whichever is longer.  
Highly effective contraception methods include:  
• Total abstinence. Abstinence is acceptable only when this is in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient (e.g., true abstinence ). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
• Male or female sterilization.  
• Combination of any 2 of the following categories (Categories 1+2, 1+3, or 2+3):  
o Category 1: Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.  
o Category 2: Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.  
o Category 3: Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/va ult caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository. 
Note:  The use of Category [ADDRESS_684832] (urine testing limited to patients producing urine daily) prior to each dose of study drug 
(HB-101 or placebo), unless the pregnancy test is deemed a false positive and clinical evidence 
is negative for pregnancy  after discussion between the sponsor and investigator on a 
case-by-case basis; or be surgically or biologically sterile or post -menopausal.  
Post-menopausal females are defined as:  
• Age >[ADDRESS_684833] 12 months.  
• Age ≤[ADDRESS_684834] -menopausal range (>40 mIU/mL).  
• Permanently sterilized women (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy).

STUDY VACCINE DOSAGE  FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Vaccination schedule/site of administration:  
Three intramuscular doses of HB -101 will be administered according to the administration 
schedule as per  the table titled “ Timing of Kidney Transplant vs. Study Drug (HB -101 or Placebo) 
Injection , Where Day [ADDRESS_684838] Dose of Study Drug. ” 
Note that the injection site (s) can be the deltoid muscle of the  non-dominant arm (most preferred 
injection site), deltoid muscle of the dominant arm, or either thigh (least preferred injection site), 
as judged by [CONTACT_093] . In circumstances when administrati on of two 0.5 mL injections are  
used, the injections should be at differ ent sites ( e.g., both shoulders), or  if at the same site,  
separated  by [CONTACT_2669] 5 cm.  
Vaccine composition/dose:  
HB-101 has been developed by [CONTACT_456].  
HB-101 uses  replication -deficient lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) as a vector for a 
bivale nt recombinant vaccine against H CMV. One vector expresses the pp65 protein of H CMV,  
and one expresses a truncated  gB protein of H CMV. The [ADDRESS_684839] is manufactured by [CONTACT_44647] 1 batch of rLCMV pp65 a nd 1 batch of rLCMV gB 
in a 1:1  ratio based on pp65-  and gB -expressing vectors. HB -101 was  produced  pre-diluted and 
ready -to-use.  
HB-101 is formulated at 1.2 × 108 focus -forming units /mL.  The product is filled in 2 mL

Assurance documents. The  required approvals will be obtained.  
The vaccine will be  labeled and packaged according  to applicable regulatory requirements 
(European Union  Good Manufacturing Practice, Annex 13; and Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 201).  
The component s of HB -101 include water for injection, total rLCMV vec tors, sodium chloride, 
HEPES, pol oxamer 188 (Pluronic® F68), glycine, and recombinant human serum albumin  
(Recombumin® Alpha) . 
STUDY PLACEBO DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Placebo injection schedule/site of administration:  
For Groups 1 and 2 only, 3  intramuscular doses of placebo will be administered according to the 
administration schedule as per  the table titled “ Timing of Kidney Transplant vs. Study Drug 
(HB-101 or P lacebo) Injection,  Where Day [ADDRESS_684841] Dose of Study Drug .” All Group  3 
patients will receive open- label HB-101. 
Note that the injection site (s) can be the deltoid muscle of the  non-dominant arm (most preferred 
injection site), deltoid muscle of the dominant arm, or either thigh (least preferred injection site),  
as judged by [CONTACT_093] . In circumstances when administration of two 0.5 mL injections are 
used, the injections should be at differ ent sites ( e.g., both shoulders), or if at the same site, 
separated by [CONTACT_2669] 5 cm.  
Placebo composition /dose:  
Saline  (0.9% w/v sodium chloride)  will be used as the  placebo  and is ready -to-use. The volume of 
administration of 1 dose of placebo is 1.0 mL.  
EFFICACY PARAMETERS:  
Cytomegalovirus  viremia and the use of anti -virals  at treatment dose  will be used to assess the 
efficacy of HB -101. For the purposes of this study, CMV viremia will include all patients with 
evidence of CMV viremia via PCR and who ar e either asymptomatic, with CM V syndrome 
(fatigue, fever, leukopenia ), and/or end- organ disease as defined by [CONTACT_527561] (Clin Inf Dis 2017 ). 
CMV viremia/DNAemia:  
• The incidence, magnitude, and duration of CMV DNAemia  through 12 months after transplant 
will be assessed.

1.1 Background  
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ), also referred to as human herpesvirus 5,  is a virus of the 
betaherpesvirinae subfamily. Infection by [CONTACT_27912] ( CMV ) is common and is acquired by 
[CONTACT_527564]. In healthy immunocompetent subjects, primary infection typi[INVESTIGATOR_527509], though it can result in infectious mononucleosis. The primary 
infection invariably becomes latent  and can reactivate, especially during periods of immune 
suppression. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 1999  
to 2004, the overall age -adjusted CMV seroprevalence among individuals in the [LOCATION_002] 
aged 6 to 49 years was 50.4%.[ADDRESS_684858] candidate vaccines  incorporate variations of the 
HCMV glycoprotein B ( [gB], encoded by [CONTACT_527565]55) to induce virus -neutralizing antibodies. 
Glycoprot ein B is often combined with  phosphoprotein 65 kD ( [pp65] , encoded by [CONTACT_527565]83) as a key 
target of cellular immunity. The potential utility of gB and pp65 as H CMV vaccine antigens can 
be inferred from the natural history of infection. Neutralizing a ntibodies specifi c for gB3,4 and 
cluster of differentiat ion ( CD) 8+ cytotoxic T  lymphocytes specific for pp655 have been isolated 
from subjects following H CMV infection. Furthermore, pp65- specific T -cells isolated from donors 
can be transferred to hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], resulting in clearance of H CMV 
infection or a reduction of viral load.[ADDRESS_684859] not yet been reported.

immunogenic ,12 but was not fur ther pursued. An adjuvanted human leukocyte antigen

1.1.1 Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus  
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is the prototype member of  the arenavirus family. 
It is an enveloped, bisegmented negative single -strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus with an 
ambisense coding strategy. The genome codes for 4 proteins: the surface glycoprotein (GP), the 
nucleoprotein (NP), the RNA -dependent RNA pol ymerase L, and a zinc finger protein Z. 
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis  virus  particles are pleomorphic, with a mean diameter of 
approximately [ADDRESS_684863] other rodents, or accidentally ( albeit rarely ) be 
transmitted to primates and humans. It is a rare human pathogen , and, with the rare exception of 
vertical transmission and transplant -associated transmission, there are,  to Hookipa Biotech 
GmbH’s (hereinafter Hookipa Biotech)  knowledge , no doc umented cases  of human- to-human  
transmission. In humans , LCMV can cause a variety of symptoms from malaise to meningitis, 
though postnatal subjects nearly always recover without sequelae. Congenital infection more 
frequently results in clinical disease .[ADDRESS_684864] geographic

virus  (rLCMV ) has the following features of interest for vaccine applications:  
• Safety: The non- replicating virus is anticipated to infect target cells in the vaccine, replicate 
the genomic RNA , and express the foreign antigen, but not produce infectious virus due to  
absence of the essential GP  gene in the vector genome. Thus, this vector is - propagation 
deficient  in any cell, except engineered production cell lines. Because of this safety profile, it 
has the potential to be used in healthy subjects of all ages, as well as in persons with underlying health conditions.  
• Immunogenicity: In animal models, non- replicating rLCMV vectors that express foreign 
antigens induce strong functional antibodies against these antigens. The humoral response is 
combined with potent cytotoxic CD8+ T -cell responses, owing to intracellular processing of 
endogenously synthesized proteins and direct presentation via the major histocompatibility 
complex class [ADDRESS_684867].  
• Utility: Successive homologous boosts should be possible because of a low prevalence of 
pre-existing immunity to LCMV in the human population, and no to low virus -neutralizing 
immune response induced by [CONTACT_79827].

transplantation (SOT). The majority of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527510] a seropositive donor organ. Viral replication in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527498], 
which  can progress  to end- organ disease. Active CMV infection correlates with a higher risk of 
other infections, post -transplant lymphoma, organ rejection, and overall morbidity and mortality. 
To prevent CMV infection and disease, transplant centers routinely employ either a prophylactic 
or preemptive strategy using ganciclovir or its oral prodrug valganciclovir. The prophylactic 
approach is effective in preventing end -organ disease while on anti -viral pro phylaxis, but patients 
remain at significant risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_527511] a and late- onset disease once prophylaxis is stopped. 
Sometimes, late -onset disease is caused by [CONTACT_527559], which requires the use of mor e toxic second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The p reemptive approach 
requires  close monitoring of CMV DNAemia  via polymerase chain reaction  (PCR)  
and is thus often limited  by [CONTACT_527560] , given the need for frequent blood draws .  
An effective CMV vaccine administered prior to transplantation would overcome the limitations  
of both the prophylactic and preempti ve approaches. Hookipa Biotech completed a  Phase 1 healthy 
volunteer study (Study H -100-001) of the predecessor HB -101 (encoding pp65 and a truncated gB  
of HCMV) .

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  31 In brief, Hookipa  Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.  
• A favorable safety profile.   
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par  with previous ly studied vaccines . 
• gB- and pp65- specific T -cell immunoge nicity  previously shown to correlate  with protection 
(in adoptive  T-cell transfer  studies).   
Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipates that the vaccine should be more  effective than previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT setting . 
1.2.1 Rationale for Including Cytomegalovirus Seropositive Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527512] H -100-002 study (data cutoff date of 03 September  2019)  
(see the latest Investigator’s Brochure in circulation) , H-100-002 protocol amendment Version  5.0 
will include Group 3 to explore additi onal safety , immunogenicity, and efficacy  data in CMV 
seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV seropositive (+) or CMV 
seronegative ( -) donor. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data collected from this patient 
population will provide critical information for the registration trial based on the broad population of patients who are at intermediate and high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_527513] -post transplantation.  
1.3 Risk/Benefit   
Cytomegalovirus  is an important  pathogen for women of childbearing age  and for allograft 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], [ADDRESS_684869] 3 years of life is followed by [CONTACT_527567] 42  months. 
Accordingly, CMV  seronegative (-) mothers of CMV -infected children are at 20%  to 25% higher 
risk of primary CMV infection compared with CMV  seronegative  (-) mothers of uninfected 
children and become inf ected with a probability of at least 50% within 1 year after the child 
acquires the infection .24 
The success of SOT and hematopoetic stem cell trans plantations adds another growing group of 
patients at risk of C MV disease. In particular, CMV  seronegative (-) transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527514] a CMV  seropositive (+) donor  are at a high risk of severe CMV disease. In the 
allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], v iremic dissemination can cause end -organ disease, such as hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, and retinitis, and can predispose to transplant re jection.10 Anti-viral 
prophylactic strategies are limited by [CONTACT_119466], drug -drug intera ctions, and development of 
anti-viral resistance.25  
Patients enrolled in this study will be vaccinated while they await transplantation and are not 
currently receiving immunosuppression, per Exclusion Criteria 5, 8, and 9. The minim um time 
between vaccination and transplantation will be 7 days ( ±2 days) per study protocol.  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  32 The recombinant vaccine used in this study is replication- deficient. The non- replicating virus 
infects target cells (e.g., dendritic cells), where it replicates the genomic RNA and expresses  the 
foreign antigen , but does not produce infectious virus due to absence of the essential GP gene in 
the vector genome. Thus, this vector is propagation- deficient and as such has the potential to be 
used in healthy subjects of all ages, as well as in per sons with underlying health conditions.  
In animal studies performed in mice, Hookipa Biotech has demonstrated that the vector 
administered via all routes, including dedicated intracranial route administration, causes no 
pathology (including in the brain, which is devoid of resident immune defense). Biodistribution 
studies in immunocompetent mice indicated that the vector material can be found in multiple 
tissues after immunization, but was not associated with pathologic sequelae in any tissues 56 to 
90 days after inoculation. In addition, toxicity studies in rats supplement these safety data. 
Research studies using analogous vectors (encoding different antigens) were performed in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], rabbits, and non- human primates and no apparent toxicities were observed in any of these 
studies.  
Furthermore, HB -[ADDRESS_684870] be exposed to the CMV antigen after transplantation (in case of CMV primary infection 
from the graft or the environment). This was observed in [ADDRESS_684871] -transplantation as defined by 
[CONTACT_527568] (Transplantation 2018).
26 Indeterminate  titers are not unknown titers of anti -CMV 
immunoglobulin, they are low -level titers that can result from a waning immunity or passive 
immunity (i .e., in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527515]). For the purpose of the most conservative 
management of CMV risk after t ransplant, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_527516] (if any active immunity exists, it is weak) and indeterminate 
results for donor are assumed to be positive (while immunity might be old, the graft may still be 
infected by [CONTACT_527569]).  
1.3.1 Risks  
The risks to which subjects could be exposed in the clinical development  program can be separated  
into 2 categories: those typi[INVESTIGATOR_527517] a vaccine and its route of delivery,  and those 
possibly related to the administration of predecessor HB -101 or HB -101 in particular . Predecessor 
HB-101 and HB -101-specific risks are the vector, the antigens, the formulation, and the mode of 
action.  
At the time of the writing of this protocol amendment, no serious adverse reaction (i.e., 
drug- related serious adverse event [SAE]) has been reported ; therefore , no events are considered

[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks related to administration of vaccine  
Possible risks that are frequently associated with intramuscular vaccination include the occurrence 
of local reactions such as edema, induration and erythema, transient local pain, and reddening or 
tenderness at the injection site. Other adverse effects could include mild to moderate headache, 
myalgia, flu -like symptoms, malaise, o r fatigue (as documented for commercial vaccines [EPAR 
FLUARIX, 2015; EPAR HAVRIX, 2015]).  
Any vaccine could cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions, in addition to the described local reactions at the vaccination site, and systemic flu -like reactions.  
Needles during blood sampling could cause local reactions such as edema.   
There is a possible risk of sensitization (donor sensitization  and increased HLA sensitization) 
prior to transplantation . The sensitization risk can be mitigated by [CONTACT_527570] ’ HLA 
genotype s (see Exclusion Criteria, below). It has been reported that as many of 4% of dialysis 
patients awaiting kidney transplantation become sensitized.
[ADDRESS_684873] shown 
that this risk of sensitization following vaccination may be as high as 7.5%.  29 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Specific risks related to p redecessor HB -[ADDRESS_684874] other rodents, or accidentally (albeit rarely) be transmitted to primates  and humans. It 
is a rare human pathogen, and with the rare exception of  vertical  transmission  and 
transplant -associated transmission, there are, to Hookipa Biotech’s  knowledge,  no documented 
cases  of human to human  transmission. In humans, LCMV  can cause a variety of  symptoms from 
malaise to meningitis, though postnatal subjects nearly always  recover  without sequelae. Hookipa 
Biotech has developed a rLCMV vector platform.  
The risk presented by [CONTACT_527571][INVESTIGATOR_841]. The primary mitigation 
is the deletion of the essential GP  from the genome, which makes the vector unable to propagate 
outside of engineered packaging cell lines. Therefore, infection of the individual target cell is a 
self-limiting event and  the number of cells affected correlates with the dose administered.  
The vector has no theoretical risk of forming replication -competent virus ( RCV ). This was 
accomplished by [CONTACT_527572] -complementing production ce ll line. This eliminates the chance of  
gain-of-function genetic rearrangements. Furthermore, during the manufacture of predecessor 
HB-101 and HB -101, the lack of RCV was demonstrated in vitro for the master seed vi ruses and 
bulk drug subs tances. Finally, 3  biosafety studies in mice using research grade material comparable 
to vaccine demonstrated that injection of large doses of the vector into the brain or peritoneum of 
immune -compromised mice failed to produce pathology or infectious virus titers in the animals.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  34 Therefore, the design and testing of the vectors mitigate the risk of replicating vectors.  Clinical 
data showed no signs or symptoms of systemic disease.  
During the passive phase of Study H -100-001 (Month 4 + [ADDRESS_684875] from Cohort 3), it was noted that, owing to a strong 
increase of humoral and cellular immunity to HCMV after the conclusion of the active phase of 
the study, a primary H CMV infection was suspected in [ADDRESS_684876] (7%) developed a neutralizing antibody response during the

In brief, it is the intent of this study to administer up to 3 doses of study drug (HB -101 or placebo) 
prior to transplantation and within proximity to the time of transp lantation. However, [ADDRESS_684899] dose  of study drug is not feasible due to transplantation timelines. Patients will 
not receive study drug after transplantation.  
After Day 0 dose administration,  the subsequent study drug adminis tration(s) should be given 
28 days (±7 days) apart . 
Patients whose planned transplantation is less than [ADDRESS_684900] study drug 
(HB-101 or placebo) injection should not be enrolled.  
A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) must be planned between the last dose of study drug and 
transplantation , unless agreed otherwise between the sponsor and investigator on a case -by-case 
basis.   
Patients whose planned transplantation is no longer than [ADDRESS_684901] study 
drug (HB -101 or placebo) injection should be enrolled. Changes in transplantation timelines will 
not result in patient withdrawal from the study. In case of delayed transplantation, a dditional study 
drug injections prior to transplantation can be discussed with the spo nsor or sponsor  designee (who 
should be blinded).  The maximum allowed number of patients receiving additional study drug 
injections prior to transplantation will be capped at 10 patients (less than 10% of planned sample 
size).

a deceased donor becomes available, the patient can continue in the study after transplantation.  
The additional study drug booster will be administered at least 7 days ( ±2 days) prior to the 
scheduled transplantation. This allows maximal protection against CMV prior to the transplant. 
Blood collection for immunogenicity will be performed prior to each study drug booster 
administered. Immunogenicity will not be used to determine the administration of a booster as 
these results would be unblinding; instead, reactogenicity will be reviewed and the investigator

Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_684913] -transplantation. If a patient needs to discontinue study drug during the 
pre-transplant Treatment Period (Section 6.2 ), the patient should remain on the study and be 
followed for safety.  
For Groups 1 and 2, i f a patient is paired to a CMV seronegative ( -) kidney donor after study drug 
administration, the patient will discontinue study drug and will be evaluated for [ADDRESS_684914] 
study drug administration.  
Administration of study drug during the pre -transp lant Treatment Period (Section 6.2) will be 
stopped and no further administration will be made to any of the patients following the Withdrawal 
Criteria (Section 4.4 ).  
4.4 Withdrawal Criteria  
Participation of a  patient  in this clinical study can  be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
• The patient  withdraws consent or request s discontinuation from the study for any reason and 
without prejudice . 
• Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the patient  to substantial 
risk and/or does not allow the patient  to adhere to t he requirements of the protocol.  
• Any SAE , clinically significant adverse event, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition which indicates to the investigator  that continued 
participation is not in t he best interest of the patient . 
• Pregnancy.  
• Requirement of p rohibited concomitant medication.  
• Patient  failure to comply with protocol requirements  or study- related procedures.   
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_527576].  
If a patient withdraws prematurely from the study due to criteria  listed above  or any other reason, 
study staff should make every effort to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for  the 
End of Study Visit during pre-transplant  (if patient withdraws from the study before transplant)  or 
the End of Study  Visit during post-transplant  (if patient withdraws from the study after transplant) . 
If a patient withdraws consent, no additional study- related activities are required. The reason for 
patient  withdrawal must be documented in the eCRF.   
A premature withdr awal visit is not considered as the end of the study participation. At a minimum, 
all patients who discontinue study drug during the Treatment Period will be contact[CONTACT_527577] 
[ADDRESS_684915] be made and 
documented in the patient ’s medical recor ds. 
Withdrawn patients  will not be replaced.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  44 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment  Arms  
5.1.1 Groups 1 and 2  
Groups 1 and 2 will be  stratified  by [CONTACT_527553]  (as per investigator and institutional standards)  
regarding the use of anti -CMV anti -virals post -transplantation. Each group will be randomized 
into 2 arms  to receive either HB -101 or placebo (Figure 1):  
• Group 1: P atients to be followed preemptively post -transplant:  
o Arm 1a: CMV seronegative ( -) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a  CMV 
seropositive (+) living donor randomized to receive HB -101 before transplant, and 
monitoring after transplant.  
o Arm 1b: CMV sero negative (-) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) living donor randomized to receive placebo before transplant, and 
monitoring after transplant.  
• Group 2: Patients to be treated prophylactically with anti -virals post-transplant:  
o Arm 2a: CMV seronegative ( -) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a  CMV  
seropositive (+) living donor to receive HB -101 before transplant,  and anti -viral 
prophylaxis and monitoring after transplant.  
o Arm 2b: CMV seronegative ( -) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from a CMV 
seropositive (+) living donor to receive placebo before transplant, and anti -viral 
prophylaxis and monitoring after transplant.  
5.1.2 Group 3  
Group 3 will enroll CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a CMV 
seroposit ive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) living donor. Patient s will receive HB -101 vaccination (s) 
prior to their transplant surgery. Post -transplant CMV management will follow either preemptive 
or prophylactic care as defined at study enrollment by [CONTACT_527558].  
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
An effective CMV vaccine administered  prior to transplantation would overcome the limitations  
of both the prophylactic and preemptive approaches. Hookipa Biotech completed a Phase 1 healthy 
volunteer study (Study H -100-001) of t he predecessor HB -101 (encoding pp65 and a truncated gB 
of HCMV).   
In brief, Hookipa Biotech observed:  
• Neutralizing antibodies  formed against the antigen  after 2 or 3 vaccinations.   
• A favorable safety profile.  
• CMV -neutralizing antibodies  after 3 vaccinations  on par with previous ly studied vaccines . 
• gB- and pp65- specific  T-cell immunogenicity previously shown to correlate  with protection 
(in adoptive  T-cell transfer  studies).   
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  45 Based  on this, Hookipa Biotech anticipates that the vaccine should be more  effective t han previous 
vaccines tested in the SOT  setting . 
5.3 Justification of Selected Dose 
In the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study (Study H -100-001), the HB -101 dose of 2.6 ×  107 FFU was 
found to be as immunogenic as a dose of 2.6 ×  108 FFU, with the maximum immunogenicity 
attained more quickly with 2 dose s of 2.6 ×  108 FFU. The final concentration of HB -101 to be used 
in this study (H -100-002) is 1.2 ×  108 FFU/mL. Each vial of HB -[ADDRESS_684916] dose used in the Phase 1 study, patie nts 
will be administered 2 vials (1.0 mL total injection volume) for a total dose of 1.2 ×  108 FFU/mL 
per administration. Based on the Phase 1 study, this dose should attain maximum immunogenicity 
with minimal number of administrations.  
The intent of this  study is to attain maximum immunogenicity as quickly as possible prior to 
transplantation by [CONTACT_17801] 3 doses of HB -101. The dosing schedule for the 3 doses is planned 
for 0, 1, and 3 months (see Section 3.1 ). Patients enrolled should have a kidney transplantation 
ideally planned between [ADDRESS_684917] 2 doses of HB -101; however, unanticipated changes in transplantation 
timelines may not allow for [ADDRESS_684918]-transplantation is not allowed as part of this protocol, these patients will receive 1 dose of 
HB-101. This is not the intent of this study, but is a potential consequence of unanticipated changes 
in transplantation timelines.  
5.4 Randomization and Blinding  
5.4.1 Groups 1 and 2  
Adult CMV  seronegative  (-) patients awaiting  kidney transplant from  a CMV  seropositive  (+) 
living donor  will be enrolled into Groups [ADDRESS_684919] to the 
method of CMV prevention after transplant (either preemptive or prophylactic) as defined at study 
enrollment by [CONTACT_527558].  
• Group 1 -  The preemptive group will be randomized in a 2:1 ra tio (HB-101:placebo)  to receive 
either HB -[ADDRESS_684920] -transplant patients will be monitored per 
preemptive institutional standards.  
• Group 2 -  The prophylactic group will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio  (HB-101:placebo)  to 
receive either HB -[ADDRESS_684921] -transplant pa tients will receive 3  to 
6 months of anti -viral prophylaxis following institutional standards.  
Patients will be randomized via a centralized Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) system. 
Enrollment of Group 2 will be limited to no more than 54% of total p atients.   
The study is double  blind for Groups 1 and 2; patients and investigators will be blinded to treatment 
assignment.  
At each site, the pharmacy staff will include unblinded personnel. Based on the treatment 
assignment from the automated randomization system  (i.e., IRT), an unblinded pharmacist or 
designee at each  site will prepare the study drug injection syringe.  Syringes containing study drug

Version 6.0, [ADDRESS_684922] M anual, independent of 
clinical staff, and delivered to the clinical team for blinded administration.  
Syringes, syringe labels, and translucent colored tape are supplied with the study drug. The syringe 
labels are not translucent  and therefore, the syringe  label masks the color of the solution  (as the 
placebo and active vaccine differ slightly in color) in the syringe to avoid potential unblinding. Furthermore, the syringe with placebo is also stored at 2º C to 8 ºC (35.6 ºF to 46.4 ºF) to mimic 
HB-101 in syringes to avoid potential unblinding to the dose administrator (who is blinded).  
The syringe will be distributed to the blinded investigator  or their designee  with the syringe  label 
in place covering the entire volume of the drug to be administered. The labe l will not allow the 
blinded investigator  or their designee  to differentiate between the placebo or study drug liquid but 
still be able to see that the amount of liquid is 1 mL and safely administer it to the patient. The clinical monitoring team will also  be blinded to treatment assignment. An independent unblinded 
team will monitor drug accountability and protocol compliance at the pharmacy.  
5.4.2 Group 3  
Group 3 will be open  label . In Group 3, CMV seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant 
from a CM V seropositive (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) donor  will be enrolled to receive HB -101 
vaccin ation (s) prior to their transplant surgery.  
There will be no randomization or blinding for patients in Group 3. Enrollment of Group 3 will be 
a minimum of  15% of tota l patients.  
5.5 Breaking the Blind  (Groups 1 and 2 O nly) 
Unblinding by [CONTACT_527578] e vent of an emergency or adverse  
event for which it is necessary to know the treatment assignment of an individual patient. If the 
investigator  must identify the treatment assignment of an individual patient,  the investigator  or 
qualified designee should request the medication information from the I RT system and promptly 
contact [CONTACT_941] s ponsor or s ponsor designee.  The documentation from the IRT  system  indicating the 
code break must be ret ained with the patient ’s source  docume nts in a secure manner so as not  to 
unblind the treatment assignment  to other site or sponsor  personnel.  
Hookipa Biotech study team members will be unblinded after each patient receives their last dose 
of study drug and undergoes his/her kidney transplantation. Medpace , the investigator, and study 
site personnel will remain blinded for the entire study with the exception of the study site 
pharmacist or research nurse who prepares the study drug for administration.

The Screening P eriod starts after a patient has signed and dated the written  informed consent 
form  (ICF) to participate in the study  and concludes on the day of randomizati on (for Groups 1 
and 2) or dosing (for Group 3) . The Screening Period should be within 56  days of Day 0 . After 
56 days, if the patient has not withdrawn from the study, he/she  will be rescreened with s ponsor 
approval.  
The patient must sign and date the wr itten ICF prior to study  procedures.  
The following Screening assessments  can be conducted for up to 14 days pri or to Day 0 : 
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria reviewed.  
• Patient’s  relevant  medical history recorded.  
• Patient’s medication/vaccination history recorde d. 
• Safety blood collection ( complete blood count  with differential, liver function tests and 
enzymes, and renal function tests)  at the local or central laboratory . 
• Pregnancy test (serum or urine hCG test , urine testing limited to patients producing urine daily) 
(for females of childbearing potential).  
• Serum follicle -stimulating hormone  (for all females aged ≤ 50 years with 6 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea ).  
• Physical examination.  
The following Screening assessment  can be conducted for up t o 56 days  prior to Day 0:  
• Patient signs and dates written ICF.  
• Patient demographics recorded.  
• CMV serology sample.  
During Screening, in formation collected on screen  failures should be recorded on the eCRF.

6.1.1 Information to be Collected on Screen F ailures  
Patients who sign the study ICF but who fail to be started on study drug prior to transplant  for any 
reason will be considered screen failures. The reason for a patient no t being started on study drug 
will be entered on the Screen Fail  eCRF and every patient’s demographic information will be 
recorded on the Demogr aphy eCRF. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for 
patients who are screen failures.  
6.2 Pre-Transplant : Treatment Period  
During the study, t he pre-transplant Treatment Period starts on Day [ADDRESS_684932] dose of study drug ( Day 0 ) is scheduled when the patient in Groups 1 or  2 has a confirmed  
CMV seropositive  (+) kidney donor identified or when the patient in Group 3 has a confirmed 
CMV seropositiv e (+) or CMV seronegative ( -) kidney donor identified , and there is a plan and/or 
date to transplant.  
Prior to patients receiving first dose of study drug on Day 0, the patient’s inclusion/exclusion 
criteria should be reviewed  again . Patients in Groups 1 a nd 2 will be randomized  prior to or  on 
Day 0  pre-dose. 
Each study drug administration should be given 28 days ( ±7 days) apart. Dosing of study drug will 
occur according to the a dministration schedule as per  Table 2. 
A minimum of 7 days  (±2 days) must be planned between the last  dose of study drug and

this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfav orable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, i ncluding observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables,  will be monitored and recorded 
from the time of th e first injection  of study drug up through [ADDRESS_684947] after kidney transplant 
are gr aft rejection, CMV syndrome, and CMV  disease . Physical examination (general assessment 
based on the complaints of the patient and on the investigator’s judgment) and local assessment of 
the study drug injection site will be conducted during the  study. Results of the physical 
examination will be captured in study sources, clinically significant abnormalities will be reported as patient medical history prior to randomization  (for Groups 1 and 2)  or dosing (for Group 3) , and  
adverse events for worsening or emerging findings after randomization (for Groups  1 and  2) or 
dosing (for Group 3) . Patient s should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience 
to the investigator . From the time of first dose of study drug , investigator s should make an 
assessment for adverse events at each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event 
eCRF . 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_527583] . However, if an 
observed or reported s ign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_093] , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF . 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endos copy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical  condition alr eady present at Screening  should not be reported as an adver se event 
unless the medical condition or signs  or symptoms present at Day 0  changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it s hould be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings that are detected during the study or are present 
at Screening  and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as adverse event s. The 
investigator  will exercise his /her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal 
laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests 
return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is 
determined to be an error  does not require reporting as an adverse event .

All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considere d an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility,  
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_684948] information. For predecessor HB -101, the 
reference safety  information is included in the  Investigator ’s Brochure currently in force. T he 
reference safety inf ormation will be reviewed annu ally and the periodicity of the review will be 
harmonized with the reporting period of the De velopment Safety Update Report.  
10.1.3  Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_527584] (intensity) of each adverse event , and will  categorize each 
adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug using  the categories of yes or no . 
Assessment of Severity:  
The severity of all adverse events  except  reactogenicity  (see Section  10.6)  should be graded 
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 .  
For those adverse events not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading system should be used:  
• Mild (CTCAE Grade 1): Transient symptoms, awareness of sign/symptom, but easily tolerated and no interference with patient’s daily activities.  
• Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with patient’s usual 
activities, but still acceptable.  
• Severe (CTCAE Grade 3): Incapacitating signs/symptoms which cause considerable 
interference with the patient’s daily activities, unacceptable.  
• Life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4): Life -threatening or disabling adverse event.  
• Death (CTCAE Grade 5): Death -related adverse event.  
• For the assessment of local and systemic injection site reactions (reactogenicity), the  Food and 
Drug Administration  (FDA)  “Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” should be used. 
See Section  10.6. 
Causality Assessment : 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug  is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, no relation) –  The time course between the administration of study drug  
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Hookipa Biotech GmbH  
Clinical Study Protocol H -100-002 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  60 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occur rence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the stud y drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient  may have.  
• Concomitant drug-  
o The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient  receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug-  
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study drug-  
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered.  
Assessment of Outcomes:  
The outcome of any non- serious adverse event or any SAE is to be assessed as:  
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Not recovered/not resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.  
• Recovered with s equelae/resolved with sequelae.  
• Fatal (SAEs only).

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  61 10.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if,  in the view of either the investigator  
or sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adverse event . 
o NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of 
either the investigator  or sponsor , its occurrence places the patient  at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889] . 
o NOTE: Pre -planned, elective procedures for pre- existing condition(s) (such as biopsies or 
dialysis) leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527527].  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527528] (i .e., biopsy, endoscopy), are considered events of special interest and will be 
collected as SAEs.  
o NOTE : Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1  overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255594] a SAE  under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527529] y should be recorded as 
adverse event s and assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239608] ( i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will 
not be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• An important medical event.  
o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the  patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such m edical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the 
development of drug dependency.

Version 6.0, 09  December 2020  62 10.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting –  Procedures for Investigators  
Initial Reports  
Serious adverse events should be recorded during the entire study.  
All SAEs that occur  from the time of the first injection  of study drug up through the End of Study 
Visit must  be reported to  Medpace Clinical Safety within 24  hours of the knowledge of the 
occurrence (this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the aforementioned seri ous criteria) .  
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious cri teria and it is not possible to  
access the EDC system , send an email to Medpace Safety  and fax  or email the completed p aper 
SAE form to  Medpace within [ADDRESS_684949] continue to follow the patien t until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) , or the patient  
dies. 
Within [ADDRESS_684950] update  the SAE  form  
electronically in the EDC system for the study and subm it any supporting documentation  
(e.g., patient  discharge summary or autopsy reports)  to Medpace Clinical Safety via  fax or email.

A total sample size of approximately 150 patients is planned for the study. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 will be randomized with a 2:1 ratio for active versus placebo. Patients in Group 3 will be 
enrolled to receive open -label HB -101. The sample size has been set for an initial assessment of 
the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, which will provide for approximately 
100 patients  exposed to the HB -101 vaccine. No formal statistical assessment for sample size 
determination has been conducted. The sample size is considered adequate to provide t he 
necessary safety and immunogenicity data and help with the determination of point estimates of 
clinical efficacy endpoints (clinically significant CMV infection as defined by [CONTACT_1622] “Guidance 
for Industry: Cytomegalovirus in Transplantation: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_527532]”) 
to design and adequately statistically power Phase 3 trials.

1. After transplant, patients will be assessed per the study visits in Table  6 (all patients of the study who receive study drug). Remaining pre -transplant phone calls/study visits w ill 
occur post -transplant  and w ill not be protocol deviations.  
2. During the study, it is possible that the time windows of study visits and assessments will be redundant. If the time window is ±2 weeks, assessments should NOT be duplicated.  
3. If kidney transplant occurs prior to Day 34, the patient will be administered study drug (HB -101 or pla cebo) at Day 0 only. A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) must be planned 
between the last dose of study drug and transplantation.  
4. If kidney transplant occurs between Day 35 and Day 62, the patient will be administered study drug (HB -101 or placebo) at Day 0 and Day 28. A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) 
must be planned between the last dose of study drug and transplantation.  
5. If kidney transplant occurs between Day 63 and Day 90 or between Day 91 and Day 120, the patient will be administered study drug (HB -101 or plac ebo) at Day 0, Day 28, 
and Day 56 or Day 84. A minimum of 7 days ( ±2 days) must be planned between the last dose of study drug and transplantation.  
6. There is a ±3 day window on assessments during the pre -transplant Treatment Period, to take into account pu blic or religious holidays or weather, if not explicitly specified  
otherwise.   
7. During the study, the Screening Period should be within 56 days of Day 0.  
8. Time (window) from the last dose of study drug (HB -101 or placebo) is 3 days ( ±1 day).

the lesion is C4d -positive or C4d -negative, based on the criteria listed:  
1. Histologic evidence of chronic tissue injury, including one or more of the following:  
• TG (cg >0), if no evidence of chronic thrombotic microangiopathy; includes 
changes evident by [CONTACT_527600] (cg1a; se e Table 10) 
• Severe peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_527544] (requires EM)3 
• Arterial intimal fibrosis of new onset, excluding other causes; leukocytes within the 
sclerotic intima favor chronic  ABMR if there is no prior history of biopsy- proven

• No intimal arteritis (v  = 0) 
Category 4: TCMR  
Acute TCMR Grade  IA. Sign ificant interstitial inflammation (>25% of nonsclerotic cortical parenchyma, i2 , or i3) 
and foci of moderate tubulitis (t2)  
IB. Significant interstitial inflammation (>25% of nonsclerotic cortical parenchyma, i2, or i3) and foci of severe tubulitis (t3)  IIA. Mild to moderate intimal arteritis (v1) with or without interstitial inflammation and tubulitis  
IIB. Severe intimal art eritis comprising >25% of the luminal area (v2) with or without 
interstitial inflammation and tubulitis  
III. Transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle 
cells with accompanying lymphocytic inflammation (v3)  
Chronic active TCMR  Chronic allograft arteriopathy (arterial intimal fibrosis with mononuclear cell infiltration in 
fibrosis, formation of neointima); note that such lesions may represent chronic active ABMR 
as well as TCMR; the latter m ay also be manifest in the tubulointerstitial compartment  
Category 5: Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy  
Grade  I. Mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy ( ≤25% of cortical area)  
II. Moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (26 -50% of cortical area)

1. It should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of ABMR, TCMR, or mixed ABMR/TCMR. The v lesions are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with 2  or more smooth muscle layers.  
2. Lesions of chronic, active ABMR can range from pri marily active lesions with early TG evident only by [CONTACT_46107] (cg1a) to those 
with advanced TG and other chronic changes in addition to active microvascular inflammation. In the absence of evidence 
of current/recent antibody interaction with the endothelium, the term “active” should be omitted; in such cases, DSAs may be present at the time of biopsy or at any previous time after transplantation.  
3. Seven or more layers in 1 cortical peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_124054] 5  or more in 2 additional capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], avoiding portions cut 
tangentially.  
4. The clinical significance of these findings may be quite different in grafts exposed to anti -blood group antibodies 
(ABO- incompatible allografts), in which they do not appear to be injurious to the graft and may represent accommodation; 
however, with anti -HLA antibodies, such lesions may progress to chronic ABMR and more outcome data are needed.

 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
 
This is a phase  II study  of the small  molecule  inhibitor  perifosine  (NSC 639966,  
D21266,  KRX -0401)  in the treatment  of patients  with recurrent  glioblastoma  
multiforme  (GBM)  and other recurrent  malignant gliomas.  The sponsor of this study  
is Keryx,  as well as AOI pharmaceuticals  and OCOG,  which  are subsidiaries  of Keryx.  
The goal of  the phase  II study is  to determine  efficacy  as measured  by [CONTACT_696095] - 
free survival rate after [ADDRESS_944420]  of 
care at study  entry, patients  will be considered  for a “surgical arm.”    In this case,  
patients  will receive  perifosine  for 5-10 days before  surgery  during  which  tumor  will 
be aliquoted  both for diagnostic  purposes  and for molecular effects  of the drug in vivo  
and for analysis  of drug penetration  into tumor  tissue.   A schema  is shown  on the

 2.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
 
• Primary  aim: 
o Determine  the efficacy  of perifosine in patients with  recurrent/progressive  GBMs  
not taking  EIAEDs  as measured  by 6mPFS.  
 
• Secondary  aims  
o Determine  molecular effects  of perifosine  on AKT,  RAS,  and proliferation  in 
malignant  gliomas  by [CONTACT_696096].  
o Determine  metabolic  effects  of perifosine  on malignant  gliomas  by [CONTACT_7816].  
o Identify  molecular  features  that predict  perifosine response.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_944421]  common  cancer arising  from the brain  is the glioblastoma  multiforme  
(GBM).   It is also the most  aggressive  subtype among  the gliomas,  a collection  of 
tumors  including  astrocytomas  and oligodendrogliomas.   While  the extent of 
surgical  resection  is an important  prognostic  factor  [1, 2], malignant  gliomas  are 
diffusely  infiltrative  tumors;  hence,  all locally  directed  therapy  (surgery,  
radiotherapy)  inherently  palliative.   Such  tumors  are also relentlessly  progressive  
with the most  aggressive  forms  carrying  a dismal  prognosis.  For example,  the 
median  survival of  patients  with GBM  is approximately  1 year.  Chemotherapy,  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_696065],  is usually  given  either  during  radiotherapy  (and 
continued  afterward)  or following  radiotherapy,  and a recent multinational  study  
demonstrated  a modest  survival  benefit  of 2.5 months  relative to radiotherapy  
alone [2].  However,  only 10.7% of  patients  were  progression -free and only 
26.5% of  patients  were  alive  2 years following  diagnosis  [2].  Recurrent disease 
following  radiotherapy  is commonly  refractory  to treatment,  with a 6mPFS  
following  carmustine  (BCNU)  of only 17.5% in a  recent  study  [3]. Therefore,  
while  systemic  chemotherapy improves  the outcome  for some  patients,  long term 
disease  control  presently  remains  elusive.   Novel agents  that inhibit the key 
molecular  pathways  driving  glioma  growth  need  evaluation  in malignant gliomas.

 3.2 Perifosine  (NSC  639966,  D21266,  KRX -0401)  
 
Alkylphospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_696066]  a new class of  lipid-related  compounds  that exhibit  
promising  anticancer  activity  and a different  spectrum  of toxicity  than 
conventional  cytotoxic  agents.   Perifosine  (1,1-dimethyl -4 [[(octadecyloxy)  
hydroxyphosphinyl]oxy] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_177658]) is a synthetic,  substituted  
heterocyclic alkylphospholipid,  structurally  related  to miltefosine  (NSC [ZIP_CODE], D- 
[ZIP_CODE]).  The anti-tumor activity  of miltefosine  was initially  evaluated  in the 
1980s, and it is licensed  in Europe  as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_696067].  It is also used  in an oral  
formulation  to treat leishmaniasis.   Because the only major  toxicities  of 
miltefosine  are gastrointestinal  --and this was thought  be a local  rather  than a 
central  effect  of the drug,  numerous  analogues were  developed  to see  if a less  
toxic analogue  could be  identified.  Perifosine  was identified  as a potentially  
active  and better  tolerated  analog of  miltefosine.  Its spectrum of activity  across  
the NCI 60 cell  line screen  was very similar  to miltefosine (Pearson  correlation  
coefficient  = 0.817).  Both  miltefosine  and perifosine  had very unique patterns  of 
in vitro  cell growth  inhibition  that are distinctly  different  from  most  cytotoxic  
agents. Perifosine  has been shown  to be more  active  and better  tolerated  than 
miltefosine  in preclinical  models  [4]. Perifosine  exhibited  marked  activity  in 
animal  and human  tumor  cell lines resistant to standard  chemotherapeutic  agents  
with relative sparing of  normal  cells,  including  macrophages,  bone marrow cells 
and normal  glial cells in a glioblastoma  model.  
 
Alkylph ospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_696068],  differentiation,  
invasion,  and metastasis.  These  compounds  are absorbed  directly  into cell 
membranes  where  they accumulate  (reviewed  in [5]).  Although  there  is 
considerable evidence  that the plasma  membrane  is the primary  site of action,  
alkylphospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_696069].   [6, 7] 
 
3.3 Perifosine  Mechanism  of Action  
 
Perifosine  has been shown  to inhibit or otherwise  modify  signaling  through  a 
number  of different  signal  transduction  pathways including  PI3K/AKT,  
RAS/MAPK  which  are of particular interest  because  these pathways  are active in 
the majority  of malignant gliomas  and combined  activation  of these  pathways  
induce GBMs  in mice  [8].

 Figure 1: RAS and AKT cascades  are inhibited by [CONTACT_696097] . 
 
 
 
Approximately  70% of  GBMs  exhibit activated  AKT  [8, 9], typi[INVESTIGATOR_696070][10 -12] which  normally  represses  AKT activation  
(figure  1). Modeling by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Holland  here at MSKCC and others has also 
demonstrated  that PTEN loss is functionally  equivalent to AKT activation[13],  
and that  either  PTEN loss or activated  AKT can combine  with RAS activation  to 
induce GBMs[8,  13].  One downstream  effector  of AKT is the mammalian  target  
of rapamycin  (mTOR);  however,  treatment  with mTOR inhibitors  such as  with 
rapamycin  (sirolimus)  or CCI-779 (temsirolimus)  [14] for  recurrent  high grade  
gliomas  have not shown  response or survival  rates that are markedly  superior  to 
those observed  with traditional  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_696071][2,  15-17] 
or BCNU  [3].  One potential  explanation  is that mTOR inhibitors  affect  only a  
subset of  the pathways  activated  by [CONTACT_432368].   Therefore,  inhibition  of AKT  itself  
may be more  effective  as an anti-cancer  treatment.   In addition,  rapamycin  and its  
analogs also are associated  with severe  toxicity  in some  patients, including  
thrombocytopenia  and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035],  limiting  their use.   Other  direct inhibitors  
of AKT have been too  toxic  for clinical  use.  By [CONTACT_22242],  perifosine  has been  
used with limited  toxicity  in humans  (below).

 3.4 Pre-clinical  studies  
3.4.1  In vitro  
Prior  to stimulation  of the PI3K/AKT pathway,  AKT is localized  in the  
cellular cytoplasm.   Following  stimulation  and activation  of PI3K,  AKT is 
recruited  to the cell membrane,  where  it then localizes.  Since  the long  alkyl  
chain of  the alkylphosphocholines  can insert  into the outer  leaflet  of the 
plasma  membrane  and since  these  agents  use lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],  such as those  found  in 
cellular  membranes,  as substrates,  it seemed  plausible  that perifosine  might  
inhibit  a transduction  pathway  component known  to be dependent  for its 
activity  on membrane  localization.  
 
Investigators  at the US National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  first studied  the effects  
of perifosine on AKT using a prostate cell line, PC-3, which  is known  to have  
a mutated,  non-functional  PTEN and thus to have constitutively  activated  
AKT.  [7] Their results demonstrated  that very small  doses of  perifosine  
(5μM)  blocked  phosphorylation  of AKT but did not decrease the total amount  
of AKT present in  the cell.  These effects  occurred  within  30 minutes  of 
exposure to  perifosine,  suggesting  this was an initial  event  rather  than a 
secondary phenomenon  due to perifosine  effects elsewhere  in the cell. When  
perifosine  was removed,  substantial  recovery  of AKT phosphorylation began  
within  one hour,  also suggesting  that perifosine’s effects  are specific  and not 
the result  of general  detergent  effects.   Perifosine also blocked  the effects of 
insulin, EGF  (epi[INVESTIGATOR_61977]),  PDGF (platelet  derived  growth   
factor)  and other ligands  known  to stimulate  AKT activation.  By [CONTACT_22242],  
perifosine  did not affect  growth  factor -mediated  PI3K activation.  Finally,  the 
investigators showed  that perifosine  blocked  the localization  of AKT to the  
cell membrane,  consistent  with the observation  that PI3K activation  was not 
affected  but AKT phosphorylation was clearly  diminished,  and with the initial  
hypothesis  that led to the initiation  of these studies.  
 
Investigators  at the Netherlands  Cancer  Institute in Amsterd am obtained  
similar  results  using  the epi[INVESTIGATOR_696072] A431  and HeLa.  [6] Three  
alkylphosphocholines,  including  both miltefosine and perifosine,  were  
evaluated,  and all appeared  to inhibit  AKT in a dose-dependent  fashion.  The 
alkylphosphocholines  also blocked stimulation  of AKT activity  by [CONTACT_134755].  
 
These  effects  on AKT were accomplished  with perifosine levels  that inhibit  
the growth  of tumor  cells in vitro and that can be achieved  in the clinic.  
 
Preclinical  studies  undertaken  mainly  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Holland’s lab at MSKCC have  
also demonstrated  that perifosine is a potent  inhibitor  of AKT signaling  in glia 
in vitro.  In addition,  perifosine  (PRF)  inhibits the RAS cascade (reduced  
pERK)  in glia, an effect not achieved  by [CONTACT_696098] -Kettering  Cancer  Center

 (Rap).   The dual inhibition  of AKT and RAS signaling by [CONTACT_696099] a major  
theoretical  advantage  over agents  that inhibit  only one but not both cascades,  
especially  because these  cascades  are activated  in ~70%  and ~100%  of 
GBMs,  respectively.   Furthermore,  forced  activation  of both cascades  in mice  
is sufficient to induce GBMs  [8].  Therefore,  combined  inhibition  of both 
cascades  with one agent  such as PRF may offer  significant therapeutic  
advantage over mTOR inhibitors  and over agents  that inhibit only AKT or 
RAS.

The activity  of perifosine has been evaluated  in numerous  other  human  and 
murine  cell lines.   Cell lines  demonstrating  the greatest  sensitivity  to 
perifosine included  KB (larynx), LNCaP (prostate),  MAI -PaCa -2 (pancreas),  
DLD -1 (colon), and SK-HEP -1 (liver)  (IC50  1.0 – 4.9 µg/mL)  (Perifosine  
Investigator’s  Brochure  2003).   In a soft agar tumor  stem  cell assay, the  
human  KB (squamous)  and murine  L1210  (leukemia)  cell lines  were  the most  
sensitive.  In the methylene  blue exclusion  assay,  the five most  sensitive  lines 
were:   KB (squamous  mouth), LU 65A (lung), LNCaP (prostate),  PC-1 (lung)  
and Hep-2 (larynx)  with IC50  values  of 0.8 – 3.4 g/mL.   In the  
SRB/metabolic  capacity  assay, KM12  (colon), PC3 (prostate),  M14  
(melanoma),  HOP -92 (lung) and SF295  (CNS)  cancer cell lines  were  the most  
sensitive  with IC50  values  of 0.2 – 3.1 g/mL.   The majority  of cell lines (in 
all assays)  were  more  sensitive  to perifosine  than to miltefosine.   Compared  
with leukemic  cells,  normal  mouse  bone marrow  cells were  shown  to be  
relatively  insensitive to perifosine in vitro.  
 
3.4.2  Animal  studies  
 
The in vivo  activity  of perifosine  has been evaluated  via oral dosing in various  
schedules  in several  transplanted  tumors,  as well as in the 
dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)  induced mammary  tumor  model  of the rat.

 Two tumors  resistant  to conventional cytotoxics  but sensitive  to perifosine  
were  the KB tumor  (squamous  cell) and AsPC -1 (human  pancreatic  
carcinoma).   In vivo , single  oral doses  of 511 mg/kg  completely  inhibited  the 
growth  of subcutaneously  transplanted  KB squamous  cell tumors.  When  
smaller  doses  (203 or 300 mg/kg)  were  administered  twice  at 7 day intervals,  
complete  remissions  lasting  >[ADDRESS_944422] -8 colon tumor.  
Perifosine  was extremely  active  in the Sprague -Dawley  rat model  of 
dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)  induced mammary  tumors.  Daily  oral 
treatment  using 21.5 mg/kg  for 5 weeks  led to  complete  regre ssions  of tumors.  
Notably,  complete  regressions  over the entire  study  period were  also achieved  
by [CONTACT_106814]  a high initial  dose of  68.1 mg/kg  followed  by [CONTACT_696102] 2.15 mg/kg  over 20 days,  whereas neither  the loading  dose nor low  
maintenance  doses alone  exhibited  significant  ant-tumor  activity.   Even  large  
(4-8 grams),  established  DMBA induced mammary  tumors  responded to daily  
doses of  14.7 to 68.1 mg/kg  over [ADDRESS_944423]  for more  
than 20 days  after cessation  of treatment.  
 
Preclinical  studies  of perifosine  given  as a single oral dose  (10 mg/kg)  
demonstrated  near complete absorption,  with an absolute  bioavailability  of 
81% and 95% in male  and female  rats (Perifosine  Investigator’s  Brochure,  
2003).  For doses ranging  from  1 to 50  mg/kg,  maximum  plasma  
concentration (C max) values  ranged from  0.34 to  10.5 g/mL.   Time  to achieve  
Cmax was reached at a  median  of 16 to  32 hours following  administration  of 
perifosine.  It should be noted  however  that while there  was an approximately  
linear increase  in Cmax from  1 to 10 mg/kg,  a 5-fold increase in dose from 10 
to 50 mg/kg  led only  to a 3-fold increase  in Cmax.  The volume  of distribution  
(Vd) was  twice  the physical  body  volume,  and the terminal  half-life (t1/2) was 
120.5 – 171.4 hours.  
 
A study of  [14C] excretion (urine, feces)  in the rat after an oral dose of  [14C] 
perifosine at 10 and 50 mg/kg  revealed  the following  proportions  of renal  and 
fecal  excretion:

suggesting  a high binding  capacity  of the plasma  proteins  for perifos ine. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Activity  in mouse  gliomas  
 
Perifosine  has been shown  to cross the blood/brain  barrier  in the mouse  as 
the Holland  lab also demonstrated  that PRF also causes reductions  in 
mouse  glioma  cell proliferation  (p<0.005),  as measured  by [CONTACT_452245] -1 (Ki67)

 3.5.1  Clinical  Results:  European  Phase  I Trials  
 
Asta Medica/Zentaris  sponsored  three  European  phase I trials of perifosine  
evaluating  weekly  and daily dosing,  as well as an enteric -coated  formulation.  
 
Study D-[ZIP_CODE] -3040  
 
This was a phase  I study  of escalating  doses of  perifosine  given  on a weekly  
schedule.  Thirty -six patients  were  treated  in sequential  cohorts  at dose levels  
of 100, 200,  350, 450, 600 and 800 mg/week.   At [ADDRESS_944428] two patients.   These patients  responded  to 
antiemetic  prophylaxis with  tropi[INVESTIGATOR_14960],  alizaprid,  and dexamethasone,  and all  
subsequent  patients  received  antiemetic  prophylaxis.   Among  7 patients  
treated  at the maximum  dose of  800 mg/wk  all taken  together at one time,  
grade 2 nausea  and vomiting  of residual  perifosine  tablets  and grade 4  
diarrhea  occurred.   In addition  to nausea,  vomiting  and diarrhea  the following  
grade 1/2  events  were reported  to be  likely  caused  by [CONTACT_33641]:  gastritis,  
erythematous  rash, abdominal  pain, fatigue,  bradycardia,  increased  sweating  
and arthralgia.  Preliminary  data from  analyzed plasma  samples of  patients  
receiving  perifosine in the dose range of 100 to 600  mg indicated  a dose - 
linearity of Cmax and of  the area under  the concentration time  curve  (AUC)  in 
this dose range.  However, at 800 mg/week,  the dose-AUC and Cmax 
proportionality was  reduced.   Cmax  and t 1/2 values  ranged from  8 – 25 hours  
and 96 – 225 hours, respectively  (Perifosine Investigator’s  Brochure,  2003).  
After  repeated  dosing a  slight  accumulation  of perifosine  was seen, which  is 
in accordance  with the relatively prolonged  terminal  t1/2 of the agent.  
Perifosine  was not detectable  in the patients'  urine.

 3.5.2  Clinical  Results:  US Phase  I Trials  
 
The Division  of Cancer  Treatment  and Diagnosis,  National Cancer  Institute  
sponsored two phase I trials  of perifosine  evaluating  a loading  dose followed  
by [CONTACT_696106].  A loading dose/daily  maintenance  
schedule was proposed due to improved  efficacy  in several  preclinical cancer  
models  with this schedule  and the fact that daily  doses  alone  required  some  
days (and possible  more  than a week) to reach  steady  state plasma  levels.  A 
loading dose could potentially  achieve  active  anti-tumor  serum  concentrations  
followed  by [CONTACT_696107].  Since  both preclinical  
studies  and the earlier  phase  I studies had suggested  that increases  in plasma  
levels  were not linear  after a threshold  that might  be about [ADDRESS_944429]  frequently  observed toxicities in NCI sponsored  
phase I studies  were  gastrointestinal (nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea)  and fatigue.  
Chronic  nausea  among  patients  receiving  perifosine  appears  to resolve  
approximately  [ADDRESS_944430]  for weeks  after therapy  has ended.  
 
Phase  I evaluation  of the “Intermittent  Schedule” at the NCI 
 
The first trial examined  a loading dose on day 1 followed  by a maintenance  
dose schedule  for 20 days in patients with  solid  tumors  repeated  every 28  
days.  (Because  of the 7 day intervals  without  drug,  this has  been referred  to 
as the “intermittent  schedule.”)  In an attempt  to minimize  nausea, doses  
were  administered  with meals  or, with maintenance  doses, at bedtime.  In 
addition,  prior  to the initial loading dose,  patients were  given  granisetron,  
metoclopramide,  diphenhydramine,  and dexamethasone  as antiemetic  
prophylaxis.  Thirty -one patients  were  treated  on this study.  Gastrointestinal  
toxicities  were  dose limiting.  Dose  limiting  nausea and vomiting  despi[INVESTIGATOR_696075] 1200 -1500  mg.  Grade  
3 arthralgias and arthritis in the form of gout or pseudo -gout were  seen in two 
patients  taking  perifosine  200 mg/day.  One patient  with a history  of gout had 
reappearance  of gout and one patient  without a prior  history  had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_696076].  One patient with  a history  of hyperuricemia,  had grade 2  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_696077].  Persistent  grade  2 nausea and  vomiting  despi[INVESTIGATOR_696078] a maintenance  dose of  200 mg/day.  The maximum  
tolerated  dose (MTD)  and recommended  phase II dose (RP2D)  were  
established  as: Cycle  1: 900/150 mg loading/maintenance  dose and for

subsequent  cycles:  300/150  mg loading/maintenance  dose ([19]).   The day 1  
loading dose was  divided  into 2 equal doses of  450 mg taken with food,  6 
hours apart on day 1. Among  11 patients  treated  at the  MTD/RP2D,  no 
patients  experienced  grade  3-[ADDRESS_944431] cycle.  Only  one other grade  3 toxicity,  
infection  without  neutropenia,  felt to be probably  due to the drug was 
recorded  at dose level  III. Grade  1-2 fatigue  occurred  in 8/11 patients  and 
grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity  was intermittent and  tolerable.  
 
Gastrointestinal  toxicities  experienced  on this trial are summarized  in the

Phase  I evaluation  of the “Continuous  Schedule”  at the University  of 
Wisconsin  
 
The second  NCI sponsored phase I  trial evaluated  a loading dose followed  by 
a continuous  maintenance  dose schedule  in 42 patients  with advanced  cancer.  
The loading  dose was only given  in course  one, and maintenance  dosing  
continued without a scheduled  break  (hence  the name  “continuous schedule”).  
Cohorts  of patients  received  loading/maintenance  doses ranging  from  400/50  
– 1200/150 mg.  In this  study, loading  doses were  split into 4-8 equal doses

given at 6 hour intervals.   Patients  received  dexamethasone  and dolasetron  
mesylate  prior  to each dose during  the loading period  with lorazepam  and 
prochlorperazine  prn.  Reported  severe  toxicities  for this trial include  
anorexi a, fatigue,  dehydration,  nausea/vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhea,  
elevated  liver function  tests,  and decreased  hemoglobin.   The MTD and 
recommended  phase II dose for this schedule was 900 mg loading dose  
(divided  into 6 equal doses  of 150 mg taken with food q 6 hourly) followed  by 
100 mg daily  maintenance.   Among  14 patients  treated  at the MTD,  there  
were  4 grade  3 events  (fatigue in 2 patients,  nausea  in 1 and vomiting  in 1 
patient).   Subsequently  a review  of the pharmacokinetics  for this study  
revealed  that there  was only a minimal  increase  in plasma  concentration  
between  dose level  3 and  dose level  4.  For this reason  the actual  doses used in 
subsequent  phase II  studies  were a loading  dose of 600 mg (150 x 4) and  a 
maintenance  dose of  100 mg.  Among the 12 patients  treated  at dose  level  2 
there were  3 patients  who experienced  grade 3 fatigue  and 1 patient  with grade  
3 nausea.  There  were  no additional  grade  3 toxicities  recorded  as probably  
due to the drug.

regimen  in 23 patients  with soft tissue sarcomas.  The results were  reported  at 
the EORTC -NCI-AACR  meeting  on Molecular  Targets and Cancer  
Therapeutics.  The median  age of  the patients  was 53 (range 24-77). Eight  
were  male  and 15 female.  Thirteen  had an ECOG performance  status  of 0 and  
10 had a PS=1.  Twenty  patients  had received  prior  chemotherapy,  and 5  
patients  (22%)  had liver metastases.  Grade  3 toxicities  definitely  or probably  
related  to the drug include d fatigue  in 2 patients and diarrhea,  anorexia  and/or  
dehydration,  each in 1 patient.   One patient  had a  partial response  and five 
patients  were  stable  for 84-229 days.  The responder  was a 58-year-old man 
with an extra -skeletal  myxoid  chondrosarcoma.   The primary  lesion on  the 
thigh had been  treated  8 years previously,  and metastases to the lung and the 
lymph  nodes had been identified  22 months  prior  to starting  perifosine.  The 
patient  had previously  been  treated  with surgery,  radiother apy and 
chemotherapy  consisting  of gemcitabine  and cisplatin.  He had not responded  
to the chemotherapy.   The patient  received  10 months  of perifosine  therapy  
(600 mg loading dose and 100 mg/day  continuously).   He had grade 1 nausea  
and diarrhea on cycle 1 only and no toxicities  of any type after that point.  The 
primary  endpoint of  the study was 6 month  progression -free survival.   In 
addition  to the responder,  two other  patients  (one with a myxoid  sarcoma  and 
one with a desmoid  tumor) had disease  stabilization  for more  than six months.  
 
Nineteen  patients  with head and neck  cancers  were  enrolled  in a phase II trial 
conducted by a consortium  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304440],  and results  from  this study

This trial was presented  at the [ADDRESS_944436]  Cancer  Symposium  
before  the study  was officially  closed.   In this  trial the intermittent  regimen  
was used. The patients’ median  age was 52 (range  28-69). There  was 1 male  
patient.    The ECOG performance  status  was 0 for 10, 1 for 6, and 2 for 1 
patient.    Eight  patients  had tumors  that were  ER/PR positive,  but none had 
HER2/ neu positive  tumors.   This was a heavily  pre-treated  population.  
Sixteen  patients  had received  prior  systemic  therapy  including  neoadjuvant  or 
adjuvant  chemotherapy  in 11, a single  chemotherapy  regimen  for metastatic  
disease  in 5 patients,  and two prior chemotherapy  regimens  for metastases  in 
9.  Fifteen  patients  had previously  received  an anthracycline and 11 a prior  
taxane.   Drug  related  toxicities included  Grade 3 diarrhea  (2 patients),  
vomiting  (2 patients),  nausea  (1 patient)  and fatigue  (1 patient).  One patient  
had a mixed  response after 2 cycles  and 2 patients were  stable for  4 months.  
The mixed  response occurred  in a patient  with extensive  disease  involving  
multiple  organs.  At the end of 2 cycles some  lesions  had shrunk  while  others  
had remained  stable  or increased.   Although  this patient  had experienced  no 
major  toxicities,  she refused  further treatment  for unspecified  reasons.  
 
3.5.5  Description  of the responders  in previous  phase  I/II 
trials  
 
Three  patients  have had  clearly  documented  partial  responses on earlier  
perifosine trials.  
 
Patient  # 1 (D [ZIP_CODE] -3079) was a 66 year old with a chondrosarcoma  with a 
primary  in the Xiphoid.  The patient had local  recurrences  treated  surgically  at 
4 and 10 months.   At 10 months  distant  metastases  were  also documented.  
Previous  chemotherapy  included 2  cycles  of Adriamycin,  cisplatin  and 
ifosfamide.   The patient  received  24 weeks  of enteric -coated  perifosine at a 
dose of  350 mg per week  and was then taken off study due to  non-compliance.  
The plasma  perifosine levels  ranged  from  2.78 – 6.29 M. Only  minimal  
toxicity  was observed until week  22 when  the patient  had grade  3 nausea  and 
vomiting  along  with grade  2 fatigue  from weeks  20-24. The sum of products  
of lesions in  the lung and sternum  decreased  from 28.56 at on -study to 9.39 at 
the conclusion  of treatment.  
 
Patient  # 2 (Phase  I trial of continuous  regimen)  was a 50 year old with a 
leiomyosarcoma  with a primary  in the uterus.  She developed  distant  
metastases  at 4 years with lesions  in the scalp,  lung,  retroperitoneum  and 
bone.  She had previously  received  two cycles of  adriamycin  and dacarbazine  
as well as strontium  for bone metastases.   The patient  received  a loading  dose

 of 600 mg and then continuous  daily  perifosine at  50 mg/day  for 504 days.  
The patient was  taken off study at that time due to patient  refusal  for further  
therapy.  The patient  experienced  absolutely  no toxicity  while on study.  The 
patient  had disease  in both lungs as  well as an  infrasplenic  mass.  The 
measurements  on the patient’s  disease  were  scored  by 3 independent  
observers.  At the time the patient  went  off study the average decrease  in 
measurements  was scored  as 62% (range  53 – 70%).  The patient remains  in 
partial remission  after 3 years.  
 
Patient  # 3 (Mayo  Clinic phase II  trial)  was a 58 year old with an extra - 
skeletal  myxoid  chondrosarcoma  with a primary  on the thigh.  The patient’s  
disease was metastatic to the lung and the lymph  nodes.  The patient  was 
previously  treated  with surgery,  radiotherapy  and chemotherapy  consisting  of 
gemcitabine and cisplatin.   The patient  was treated  with 10 cycles  of therapy  
(600 mg loading dose and 100 mg/day  continuously)  and had  grade [ADDRESS_944437]  on metabolism  by [CONTACT_696111][INVESTIGATOR_207219]  (EIAEDs)  
 
There  is increasing  evidence  that brain  tumor  patients receiving  enzyme -inducing  
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_207219] (EIAEDs)  have  markedly  altered  pharmacokinetics,  resulting  
in accelerated  drug metabolism.  This may result  in decreased  levels  of certain  
chemotherapeutic agents  when  administered  at conventional doses. Failure  to 
achieve  adequate  plasma  levels  of such agents  may account for the lack  of 
efficacy  in past brain  tumor  trials.  
 
Perifosine is a potential substrate  for the cytochrome  P450  system,  and the  
escalating  concentrations  of perifosine  were  tested  for inhibition  of the liver 
microsomal  cytochrome  P450  system  in vitro  (table  10). Enzyme  activities  
associated  with CYPlA2  (7-ethoxyresorufin  0-deethylation),  CYP2A6  (coumarin  
7-hydroxylation),  CYP2B6  (S-mephenytoin  N-demethylation),  CYP2C9

(chlorzoxazone  6-hydroxylation)  and CYP3A415  (testosterone  6P-hydroxylation)  
were  determined  using  enzyme -specific  probe compounds  incubated with pooled  
human  liver microsomal  samples.  
 
In the presence  of perifosine,  a moderate inhibitory  effect  was observed on 
CYP2A6  activity  (50%),  and a slight inhibitory  effect  on CYP3A4  activity  (29%),  
in both cases  only at  the highest  concentration  (100 yM). No inhibitory  effect  was 
observed on  CYP2C19  activity  by [CONTACT_696112].

 arm” of the trial.    In this case, patients  will receive  perifosine  for 5-10 days  
before  surgery  during  which tumor  will be aliquoted both for diagnostic  
purposes  and for molecular  and pharmacokinetic  analyses.  Ideally,  tissue  
will be available  from a  prior  surgical  resection for intra -patient  comparison.  
Following  recovery from  surgery,  patients  will restart  perifosine  until either  
tumor  progression (as determined by  [CONTACT_696114] 2  
months)  or toxicity.   All patients  will be followed for overall  survival after  
discontinuing  perifosine.  
Biologic impact  will also be determined by  [CONTACT_696115] -PET imaging  (see 
below).

• All brain PET scans  must  be performed on MSKCC scanners  for adequate  
ability  to compare  scans  over time.  
• For patients with  histologically  documented  malignant  gliomas  who will receive  
perifosine  for their 2nd or greater relapse,  the date that the most  recent therapy  was 
started  will be recorded  and used to  calculate the time to the  prior  relapse for  
comparison  with time to progression  on perifosine  (intrapatient  comparison).  
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
Dosing  will be continuous,  and for the purpose of this trial a cycle will be defined  as 
[ADDRESS_944449] 3 doses  should  be given  with 
food in the adult  day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696081],  and 4th 
dose at bedtime  at home.  The interval between  doses  of perifosine  should  be no less  
than 4 hours.   On day 2, patients  will start  the maintenance  dose of 100 mg daily at 
bedtime  at home.  
 
9.3 Pharmacokinetics/drug  concentration in tumor tissue (all patients)  
In addition  to baseline  serum,  all patients  will have weekly  serum  drawn  during  
weeks  2-4. Patients  in surgical  arm of the trial will  have blood  drawn  at baseline  
and during surgery  to determine  the concentration  of perifosine  in serum  at the  
time of surgery.  Tissue will  also be collected  for determination  of the 
concentration  of perifosine  in tumor  tissue  relative  to simultaneously  collected  
serum.   The date and  time of blood collection  should  be recorded.  In addition,  the 
date and  time of the most  recent  dose of pre-surgical  perifosine  should be  
recorded.

 9.4 Treatment modifications  (all patients)  
 
For grade 1 perifosine related  adverse  events,  treatment  with perifosine  will not 
be interrupted.  
 
For grade 2 perifosine related  adverse  events  
 
For nausea,  vomiting  and diarrhea,  maintain  dosing with symptomatic  
treatment.   The dose of  perifosine  may be repeated  if emesis  occurs within  30 
minutes  of taking the  tablet(s)  OR all the tablets are seen in the emesis.  
 
For persistent  nausea, vomiting  or diarrhea,  or other  persistent  grade [ADDRESS_944450] weekly  until toxicity  
improves  to < grade 2 (grade  0 or 1). 
 
If the toxicity  resolves  in 7 days or less, maintenance  (daily)  perifosine  should  
be restarte d but the daily  dose will be reduced by  [ADDRESS_944451] 3 doses should  be 
given with food in the adult  day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696082],  and 4th dose at bedtime  at home.  The interval between  doses  of 
perifosine  should  be no  less than 4 hours.  
 
If toxicity  does not resolve  within  14 days, the patient  will be withdrawn  from  
the study.  
 
9.5 Treatment Schedule  for patients  participating  in the Pre-operative  study:  
 
Patients  who are candidates  for surgical resection  of recurrent  disease  will be 
considered  for a pre-operative  study  to evaluate  biological/tissue  correlates.  
Patients  who choose to  participate in  this component  of the study must  have a  
brain MRI (with  MR Perfusion  if possible)  performed  within  [ADDRESS_944452]  also be performed  within 14 days  of taking pre- 
operative  perifosine.   The drug will be administered  for 5-10 days prior  to the

treatment.  
 
Day of Surgery : Prior to the surgical procedure,  tissue  freezer vials should  be 
labeled  with the patient’s  protocol  study  identifier  number(s).  Additionally,  a 
thermos  with liquid nitrogen  (preferably),  or if not possible,  an ice bucket  with 
dry ice should  be prepared.  All attempts  will be made  to obtain  specimens  
immediately  adjacent  to the areas  of resection  taken  for “permanent  sections”  in 
order to optimize  the likelihood  that the tumor  seen on permanent  sections  is 
representative  of that taken  for analysis.   Once  the pathologist  has made  a 
diagnosis of  "tumor"  on frozen section  at the  time of surgical  resection,  the tumor  
tissue  should  be divided  into 50 – 100mg  pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928].  
 
At the time of surgery 10ml  of blood will be collected  for pharmacodynamic  
analysis.  
 
Following  surgery:  A post-operative MRI/CT scan  should be  done no later than 
[ADDRESS_944454] recovered  from  the effects  of surgery  
and demonstrated  wound  healing,  they will restart perifosine (load  and

can include (a) loose  stool,  (b) the occurrence  of 1 to 2 more  bowel  
movements  than usual  in 1 day, or (c) an unusually  high volume  of stool.  
 
Loperamide  should be dosed  in the following  manner:  [ADDRESS_944458] 12 hours.  Patients may  take 4 mg every 4 hours during  the night.  
 
Additional  antidiarrheal measures  may be used at the discretion  of the treating  
physician  as warranted  by [CONTACT_102]’s  condition.  
 
9.6.3 Hyperuricemia  Prophylaxis  
 
Prior  to beginning  perifosine,  all patients  should  be questioned  about a history  
of hyperuricemia  and/or gout.  Patients  with a known  history  of hyperuricemia  
and/or gout should receive  prophylactic treatment  with allopurinol  300 mg po 
daily.  If severe gout does occur or uric acid levels  increase,  the dose of  
allopurinol should  be increased  at physician  discretion.  
 
9.6.4 G-CSF Administration  
 
Routine  prophylactic  use of G-CSF is not permitted.  However,  therapeutic  
use in patients  with serious  neutropenic  complications,  such as sepsis,  may 
be considered  at the  investigator’s  discretion

Anti-seizure  medications  should be used as indicated.   However,  only patients  
not taking  EIAEDs  are eligible  to enroll  on this trial.  Patients who  were  
previously  on a non-EIAED and need to change  anticonvulsants  should be 
started  on another  non-EIAED if at all possible.  No delays  in treatment  would  
be required.  Patients  who were  previously  on no  anticonvulsants  should be 
treated  with non-EIAEDs  if at all possible.  If for unavoidable clinical reasons  
(severe  allergies,  toxicities  etc.) a patient is started  on an EIAED,  he/she  
should immediately  be started  on another  non-EIAED and the EIAED should  
be tapered  and discontinued  as quickly  as possible.  The patient  may continue  
the current treatment  dose while  a non- EIAED is re-started  because an  
EIAED will  likely  increase  metabolism of perifosine, reducing  rather  than 
increasing  any potential anti -tumor  effect  and therefore  any efficacy  bias 
introduced  would  be negative  rather than positive.  
 
Patients  who were  previously  on a non-EIAED and need to permanently  
change anticonvulsant,  but who cannot change  to another non-EIAED  may 
continue  the current  treatment  dose for the next [ADDRESS_944461]  BE DISCUSSED  WITH THE  PI [INVESTIGATOR_177639]-PI. Treatment  may be

 11.1 Toxicities/side  effects  
 
The most  common  toxicities  associate  with perifosine  are nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  
NCI CTC version 3.0 will be used  to grade all toxicity.  
 
Reported  Adverse  Events  and Potential  Risks:  
• Constitutional  Symptoms:  fatigue (lethargy,  malaise,  asthenia)  
• Gastrointestinal:  anorexia,  dehydration,  flatulence,  diarrhea,  nausea, vomiting  
 
The following  events were  reported  in two or fewer  of the patients  treated  on the  
NCI sponsored phase I  trial: 
• Pulmonary:  hiccoughs (hicc ups, singultus)  
• Renal/Genitourinary:  increased  creatinine  
• Hepatic:  increased  alkaline  phosphatase,  increased  GGT  
 
Also  reported  on the NCI phase I perifosine  trials and occurring  in two or fewer  
patients  with the relationship  to perifosine  still undetermined:  
• Blood/Bone  Marrow:  decreased  hemoglobin  
• Constitutional  Symptoms:  fever,  sweating,  weight  loss 
• Dermatology/Skin:  mild skin reaction  
• Gastrointestinal:  mucositis,  dyspepsia/heartburn  
• Neurology: lightheadedness  
• Ocular/Visual:  eye symptoms,  specif ically  blurred  vision, photophobia  and 
cataract  formation  
• Pain:  abdominal  pain,  headache,  arthritis,  arthralgia  
• Genitourinary:  hyperuricemia  
 
Also  from  animal  data:  
• Dose  dependent kidney  and eye events  (retinal  degeneration  and cataracts)  
 
If hematologic  toxicity  grade 3 or higher  occurs patients  may be treated  with appropriate  
growth  factors.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be progression  free survival  (PFS)  at six months  from  
registration.  For this and  for all other time  to event analyses,  if a patient  is NOT registered  
on the pre-operative  portion  of the study  (surgical  arm),  the start date for calculation  of 
time to event will be the date of  first study drug administration.  For this and for all other  
time to event analysis,  if a patient  IS enrolled  on the pre-operative  portion  of the study  
(surgical arm),  the start  date for calculation  of time to event will be the date of the first 
post-operative  study drug administration.

not clearly  defined.  
 
Non-Evaluable  Disease: Not Applicable  for response  evaluation  
 
Objective  Status, To  Be Recorded at Each Evaluation: If there  are too many  
measurable  lesions  to measure  at each evaluation,  choose the  largest  two to be 
followed  before  a patient is entered  on study.  The remaining  lesions will be 
considered  evaluable  for the purpose  of objective  status determination.  Unless  
progression  is observed,  objective  status  can only be determined  when  ALL  
measurable  and evaluable  sites and lesions  are assessed.  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):   Complete  disappearance  of all measurable  and 
evaluable  disease.   No new lesions.  No evidence  of non-evaluable  disease.  All 
measurable,  evaluable  and non-evaluable  lesions and sites must  be assessed  using  
the same  techniques  as baseline.   Patients  must  be on no steroids.  
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  Greater  than or equal  to 50% decrease  under baseline in 
the sum  of products of  perpendicular diameters  of all measurable  lesions.  No 
progression  of evaluable  disease.  No new lesions.  All measurable and evaluable  
lesions  and sites must  be assessed using  the same  techniques  as baseline.  The 
steroid dose at the  time of the scan evaluation  should  be no greater than the 
maximum dose used in  the first 8 weeks  from  initiation  of therapy.  
 
Partial  Response, Non -Measurable (PRNM):  Not applicable.  
 
Stable/No  Response:  Does  not qualify  for CR, PR, or progression.   All 
measurable  and evaluable  sites must  be assessed  using the same  techniques as  
baseline.   The steroid  dose at the time of the scan evaluation  should be  no greater  
than the maximum dose used in the first  8 weeks from  initiation  of therapy.  
 
Progression: 25% increase  in the sum of products of  all measurable lesions  over 
smallest  sum observed (over baseline  if no decrease)  using  the same  techniques as  
baseline,  OR clear worsening  of any evaluable  disease,  OR appearance  of any 
new lesion/site,  OR clear clinical  worsening  or failure to return  for evaluation  due 
to death or deteriorating  condition  (unless  clearly  unrelated  to this cancer).

Unknown:  Progression  has not been  documented  and one or  more  measurable  or 
evaluable  sites have not  been assessed.  
 
Best Response:  This will be calculated  from  the sequence of  objective  statuses.  
 
For patients with  all disease  sites assessed  every  evaluation  period,  the best response will  
be defined  as the best objective  status.   If the response  does not persist at the next  regular  
scheduled  MRI,  the response  will still be recorded  based on  the prior  scan,  but will be 
designated  as a non-sustained  response.   If the response  is sustained,  e. g. still present on 
the subsequent  MRI,  it will  be recorded  as a sustained  response,  lasting  until the time of 
tumor  progression.  Best response  is unknown  if the patient  does not qualify  for a best  
response or increasing  disease  and if all objective status determinations  before  progression  
are unknown.  
 
Criteria  permitting  uni-dimensional  response measurement  have recently  been adopted  and 
published by [CONTACT_696119],  Response  Evaluation  Criteria In Solid  
Tumors  Group  (RECIST).   In order  to ensure comparability  of data from this trial with 
data from  earlier  trials,  this trial will retain  the traditional  evaluation  definition  above  as 
primary.  However,  RECIST criteria  that can be  collected,  will be used for secondary  
evaluation.  
 
Neurological  Exam:  Although  not used for determining  response, it  is useful  to evaluate  
improvement  in the neurologic  exam,  (as compared  to the baseline assessment),  that 
should coincide  with objective  measurement  of tumor  size. 
 
+2 Definitely  better  
+1 Possibly  better

-1 Possibly  worse  
-2 Definitely  worse  
 
 
Performance  Status:  Patients  will be graded according  to Karnofsky  Performance  Status  
(see Appendix   20.1).  
 
Time  to Treatment  Failure:  From  the treatment  start date to the date of  first observation  of 
progressive disease, non-reversible  neurologic  progression  or permanently  increased  
steroid  requirement  (applies  to stable disease only),  death due to any cause,  or early  
discontinuation  of treatment.  If a patient  is NOT registered  on the pre-operative  portion  of

failure relative  to the most  recent  progression  may also suggest  clinical  activity  of the drug.  
 
Time  to Death: From  the treatment  start date to date of death  due to any cause.  If a patient  
is NOT registered  on the pre-operative  portion  of the study (surgical  arm),  the start date for

13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL FROM  STUDY  
 
All patients may  continue therapy  unless  disease progression,  death, or dose limiting  
toxicity  is documented.  The cause of death should be recorded.  
 
The following  events may be considered  sufficient  reason for discontinuing  treatment  
with the study  medication

• Unacceptable  toxicity  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_696086]  
• Personal  preference  by [CONTACT_696120]  
• Subject  non-compliance  with the defined  treatment  plan 
• Medical  or psychiatric  illness  or social  environment  which  in the 
investigator's  judgment  renders the patient  incapable  of further  therapy.  
• Any other situation  where,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  continued  
participation  in the study  would  not be in the best interest  of the patient  
• Treatment  delay due  to toxicity  greater  than 14 days 
• Pregnancy  
• Disease  progression

The historical  values  for comparison  are from  a database of  225 GBM  patients  enrolled  in 
8 previous phase  II studies  (in which  none of  the treatments  were  considered  particularly  
effective.[24]  In this database,  the 6 month  PFS was 15% for GBM.   The 6 month  PFS 
for patients  treated  with BCNU for  recurrence/progression  was 17.5%.[3]  Therefore,  we 
would  expect  6 month  PFS to be less  than 20%.  
 
We will utilize  a Simon  two-stage  design  in which  the primary  endpoint  is the 
progression  rate at 6 months.   All patients  will be followed  for 6 months  and progression  
or death due to disease will  be considered  an event.   Assuming  a 6 month  progression  
free survival rate of  20% is considered  promising,  a 6 month  progression free survival  
rate of  5% is considered  not promising,  and the probabilities  of a type I error  (falsely  
accepting  a non-promising  therapy) and type II error (falsely  rejecting  a promising  
therapy)  are set at 0.[ADDRESS_944470] 1 patient  with GBM  does not progress  at 
the 6 month  time among  these 12 patients,  then an additional  25 patients  with GBM  (for a 
total of 37) will be accrued  to the  second  stage,  otherwise the  trial will be terminated.  
Note  that enrollment  of patients  with both GBM  and non-GBM  malignant  gliomas  will 
continue while the first [ADDRESS_944471] 12 reach 6mPFS,  then enrollment  will terminate; in that event,  any patients  still 
on trial with any histology  may continue until progression  or death at the discretion  of the 
treating  physician.  At the end of  the trial, if [ADDRESS_944472] 20% and  yields  a 0.90 
probability  of a negative  result  if the true response  rate is 5%. 
 
Up to 20 patients  with anaplastic  glioma  and evaluable disease  at study  entry  (i.e., did not 
undergo gross  total resection  as the most  recent therapy prior  to registration)  will be 
accrued.  Endpoints  such as response,  one-year survival  probability,  overall  survival  and 
progression -free survival will  be computed  in order  to gain preliminary  data for these  
other malignant  glioma  subtypes.  However,  the historical  controls  for patients  with 
anaplastic  glioma  are less well defined  than for GBM;   therefore,  only patients  with GBM  
will be included  in analyses  of efficacy  and the  two-stage  design  will be applied only to 
the GBM  cohort.  
 
Surgical  arm 
In order  to obtain  specimens  for study  of the tissue  pharmacokinetics  of perifosine in 
tumors,  as well as the molecular  effects  of perifosine  in tumor  tissue, we plan to accrue  
subjects  to a preoperative  treatment  arm.  There  is no upper  bound on the number  of 
patients  that can be entered  into this substudy.   However,  if the study reaches  the total 
enrollment  and fewer  than [ADDRESS_944473] 10 surgical  arm patients.  Note,  the study  will only be kept open  if

 the drug  is considered  promising  (defined  above) after  either the  first stage enrolling  12 
patients  with GBM  or complete  accrual  of the total cohort  of 37 patients  with GBM.  
Any additional  patients enrolled  through  this mechanism  will be included  in the primary  
analysis  of efficacy  (6mPFS)  and the total cohort  will be increased  from 37 patients with  
GBM  to a maximum  of 47 patients  with GBM  (37 + 10 additional  surgical patients  in the 
unlikely  circumstance  that none of  the initial  37 patients  are enrolled  on the surgical  
arm).   Therefore,  the maximum enrollment  is up  to 57 patients  (37 with GBM,  not on  
surgical  substudy;  up to 10 additional  patients  with anaplastic glioma;  up to 10 additional  
patients  on surgical  stubstudy  if not already  accrued).  
 
Although  patients  on the  surgical  substudy  will have  resections  of tumor  at the  initiation  
of treatment,  the natural history of  recurrent  GBM  strongly  supports  the concept  that 
nearly  all patients  will have tumor  progression by  [ADDRESS_944474] relapse  or 
progression  of GBM.   There was no difference  in 6-month  PFS between  those  patients  
who had a gross total resection  at relapse  compared  with all other  patients.   Hence,  we 
plan to combine  data from patients on and not on  the surgical substudy in  efficacy  
analyses.  
 
Molecular  and Metabolic  Correlates  
Pre-treatment  tissue  will be used for exploration  of molecular predictors  of tumor  
sensitivity  to perifosine (all  patients).   Tissue  resected  during  perifosine treatment  
(surgical arm)  will be used to explore  effects  of the agent  on PI3K/AKT  and RAS/MAPK  
signaling  as well as proliferation  and other pathways.  
 
FDG -PET and MR  Perfusion  studies  will be used for clinical care with the exception  of 
the FDG -PET performed  after 1-[ADDRESS_944475]  recent  surgery  and initiation  of perifosine.  The 
nature of  the analyses  and the strength  of the conclusions from these laboratory  studies  
depend not  only on the  amount  of data available,  but also on  the nature  of patient  
response  to therapy.   If the response  is not favorable , the data may  be used  to better  
understand  the reason for the failure.  In addition,  new assays  may become  available  
between  the opening of  this study and the collection  and analysis  of tumor  tissue.   Thus,

during the course  of a study.   Adverse  events occurring  in association  with 
study drug administration,  whether  believed  by [CONTACT_696124].  
When  the investigator is confident  of the diagnosis,  he should  group  
together  as a single  illness  all related  signs, symptoms,  and abnormal  
laboratory  results,  e.g. cough;  rhinitis,  and sneezing  can be reported as 
"upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_23739]."  
 
Abnormal  laboratory  results  should  be noted on the case report  form  if 
they are associated  with an overdose,  require  or prolong inpatient

Wisconsin,  and will be used for this study.  The pharmacokinetic characteristics  of 
perifosine in patients  will be evaluated  using WinNonlin  modeling  software.  
 
Sample  processing  and handling  outline:  
 
1) A pharmacokinetic  sample  will be obtained  from  each patient,  at the times  outlined.  
One sodium  heparin 10cc green  top with >7ml  of blood will be obtained  and shipped  to 
the Jill M. Kolesar,  Pharm.D at the University  of Wisconsin  for further  analysis.  
 
2) Pharmacokinetic  samples  will be obtained  in association  with perifosine administration  
at pretreatment,  and weekly  during weeks  2-4. 
 
3) Peripheral  blood is  to be drawn  into heparinized  vacutainer (green  top) provided  in the 
sample  collection  kit.  The Patient’s initials,  time sample  obtained, date sample  was 
obtained  should  be recorded  on each  green top  tube.  
 
4) Within  20 minutes  of collection,  centrifuge  the blood samples  at 900g for 15 minutes  
(or use  the local  laboratory  Standard  Operating  Procedure)  to separate  plasma.  
 
5) For each sample  collected,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_696091],  2 ml each, in  
polypropylene  cryovials (Nunc)  provided  in the sample  collection  kit.  Aliquot  1 is the 
sample  and aliquot  2 is the duplicate.  
 
6) Place the appropriate labels,  included  in the  sample  collection  kit, onto the tubes  and 
freeze  at -70°C until shipped.  
 
7) Sample  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:

NAUSEA  AND  VOMITING  
Loading  dose schedule  
• Patients  should  divide  the loading  dose of perifosine  into 150mg  every  [ADDRESS_944492]  be taken  within  a 48-hour period.  
• 5HT3  antagonist —such as, but not limited  to, ondansetron  and granisetron —can be 
administered  every  12 hours  on the day of therapy  and every  12 hours  for 24 hours  after  
the day of  therapy.  
• Dexamethasone  4mg po in conjunction  with the 5HT3  antagonist  unless  otherwise  
contraindicated . 
If the above  steps are ineffective,  the frequency  of the 5HT3  antagonist  can be increased.  
• Metoclopramide  5mg Q.I.D.  can be  added if  needed.  
• If the nausea  could be related  to anticipation,  the use of  lorazepam  can be initiated.  
• Patients  should  have  some  medication  on hand  for breakthrough  nausea —such as 
promethazine  or prochlorperazine.  
If nausea  and/or  vomiting  remains  uncontrollable  after following  the recommendations  listed  
above,  the perifosine  dose can be reduced  as detailed  in the Dose  Modifications  section  of the 
relevant  perifosine  protocol(s).  
 
Daily  dosing  schedule  
• Patients  should  take medication  at bedtime  – with food and not on an empty  stomach.  
• Although  the use of prophylactic  antiemetics  should  not be necessary  for patients  on 
daily  dosing,  they should  have  antiemetics  on hand —such as promethazine  or 
prochlorperazine —if they do encounter  nausea  and/or  vomiting.  If these  antiemetics  
are not effective,  the treating  physician  may escalate  the antiemetics  to the ones listed  
above for the loading dose.  
If nausea  and/or  vomiting  continue  after following  the recommendations  above,  dose 
reductions  can be initiated  in accordance  to the Dose  Modifications  section  of the relevant  
perifosine  protocol(s).

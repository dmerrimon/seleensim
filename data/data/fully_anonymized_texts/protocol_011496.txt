RATIONA LE
Protocol CA42481 hasbeen amended in response to feedback from the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration .  Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, 
are summarized below:
The primary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint PD response to tocilizumab ( TCZ)
treatment, as measured by C -reactive protein (CRP) level at Day 7 has been
deleted.   In addition, t hesecondary clinical efficacy endpoints have been changed to 
exploratory endpoints (Section 2.4) .
Day 7 has been included as a timepoint to the exploratory endpoint of clinical status, 
assessed using a 7 -category ordinal scale in addition to Days 14 and 28
(Section 2.4).
The pharmacoki netic ( PK)endpoint of the association between TCZ 
pharmaco kinetics and CRP, interleukin -6, soluble IL -6 receptor, and ferritin has 
been moved from Section 2.2 and included as an exploratory biomarker endpoint in 
Section 2.5.
Figure 1, the study schema, ha s been revised to refl ect clinical outcomes at Day 28 , 
and reference to the primary efficacy endpoint was removed (Section 3.1.1). 
The rationale section for TCZ has been revised and text justify ingCRP levels as a 
biomarker surrogate for theprimary efficacy endpoint deleted (Section 3.2.2) .
The determination of sample size (Section 6.1) has been updated .  The figure 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_591500] (n) to declare the 4 -mg/kg dose non -inferio rto the 
8-mg/kg dose at Day 7 posttreatment has been deleted .
As a result of the efficacy endpoints being changed to exploratory endpoints, PD 
analyses (Section 6.4) specifying that model adjustments and sensitivity analyses of
different populations have deleted. 
The requirements for the scheduling of periodic safety r eviews ha vebeen clarified
(Section 6.9.1).  The planned optional interim analysis has been removed 
(Section 6.9.2). 
In addition, the following changes have been made:
The Protocol Synopsis was revised based on amended changes made to the 
protocol .
The b ackground section (Section 1.4) on thereal-world experience with TCZ 
treatment in the treatment of COVID -19 pneumonia has been revised and updated.
The inclusion criterion requiring patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591501] -19 pneumonia 
confirmed by a positive p olymerase chain reaction of any specimen (e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
blood, urine, stool, orother bodily fluids) and evidence of pneumonia on chest X- ray 
or computed tomography scan has been clarified, such that the onset of patient 
symptoms must be at least 3 days prior to enrollment (Section 4.1.1).

Reference to serum exploratory biomarkers samples has been corrected to include 
plasma samples (Section 4.5.6 and Appendices 1, 2, and 3).
The contact [CONTACT_591527]
(Section 5.4.1) .
References have been revised (Section 10).
Theschedule of activities to be performed on Days 1 and 2 (Appendix 1) has been 
corrected to remove assessments inadvertently repeated on Day 1 postinfusion 
(e.g., review of eligibility criteria, randomization, medical history).  In addition, the
Day [ADDRESS_779735] been revised to now include review ofadverse events and 
concomitant medications, hematology ,and chemistry panel, and ordinal scoring.
The schedule of activities to be performed on Days 2 and 3 (Appendix 2) has been 
revised to clarify study c ompletion assessments column is for early study or 
treatment discontinuation.  A serum PKsample has been added on Day 3 .  
The schedule of activities after Day 28 (Appendix 3) has been revised to include

supportive care .  Patients with moderate COVID- 19 pneumonia are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591506]- 19 pneumonia and with CRP  2the upper limit of 
normal (ULN).  For both patients with moderate and severe COVID -19, the onset of patient 
symptoms must be at least 3 days prior to enrollment.  
Patients who are on a mechanical ventilator 24 hours or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO) , in shock, or a combination thereof with other organ failure requiring 
treatment in anICUwill be excluded from the study.  Patients for whom, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_70053], progression to death is imminent and inev itable within the next 24 hours,
irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded from the study.  Patient s with active 
TB or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (other than COVID -19 
pneum onia) will be excluded from the study.  
Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
treatment with ei ther 8 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg IV TCZ.  Study treatment must be given in combination 
with SOC treatment.  
Patients assigned to the 8 -mg/kg TCZ arm will receive one IV infusion of 8 mg/kg, witha 
maximum dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the 4 -mg/kg TCZ ar m will receive one IV 
infusion of 4 mg/kg TCZ.  In addition, patients in both arms will receive SOC treatment.  
For patients in both arms, if a patient has a sustained fever or clinically significant worsening of signs 
or symptoms (e.g., an increased supp lemental oxygen requirement ), one additional infusion of TCZ at 
the same dose as the initial infusion can be given within 8 to 24 hours after the initial TCZ
infusion.
Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may qualify 
for one re -screening opportunity (for a total of two screenings per participant) at the 
investigator’s discretion.  Patients are not required to re -sign the consent form if they are 
re-screened within 7 days after previously signing the consent form.
The study assessments to be conducted include the following:  complete and limited physical 
examinations, measurement of vital signs and ox ygen saturation, assessment of consciousness, 
presence and absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y support, adverse events, con comitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical 
laborator y tests, and nasopharyngeal swabs.
Patients will be followed for a total of [ADDRESS_779747] weekly if 
possible; other follow -up visits may  be conducted by [CONTACT_591529].  Patients should 
return to the site for theDay [ADDRESS_779748] follow -up visits on 
Days35, 45, and 60; the Day [ADDRESS_779749] meet the following criteria for study entry:
Signed Informed Consent Form by  [CONTACT_591530], or, when the 
patient is not capable of giving consent, by [CONTACT_591531]
Age 18years at time of signing Informed Consent Form
Ability to comply with the study protocol

(e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y, blood, urine, stool, or other bodily fluids) and evidence of pneumonia on 
chest X -ray or computed tomography scan 
The onset of patient symptoms must be at lea st 3 days prior to enrollment.
For severe patients, SpO 293% or PaO 2/FiO 2300 mmHg   
If a patient is on supplemental oxygen with SpO 293%, but desaturation to 93% on 
lower supplemental oxygen or ambient air is documented during screening, the inclusion 
criterion is met.
For moderate patients (those who do not qualify as severe based oxygen requirements), 
CRP  2ULN is required
For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% 
per year during the treatment period and for [ADDRESS_779750] refrain from donating eggs during this same p eriod.
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surge ry 
(i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], and/or uterus) or another cause as determined 
by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential 
may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.
Exampl es of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, 
hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
not adequate methods of contraception.  If required per local guidelines or regulations, 
locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the 
reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.
For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a 
condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:
With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must 
remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for [ADDRESS_779751] refrain from donating sperm 
during this same period.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the du ration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure.  If required p er local guidelines or 
regulations, information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local 
Informed Consent Form.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:
Known severe allergic reactions to TCZ or other monoclonal antibodies
Active TB infection 
Suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides SARS -CoV-2)

whichever occurs later.  The end of the study is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_779752] s(Investigational Drug s)
Patients assigned to the 4 -mg/kg arm  will receive the 4 -mg/kg TCZ dose by [CONTACT_16228].  The 
dose of TCZ infusion will be calculated on the basis of body weight measured prior to infusion.  
One additional infusion of TCZ can be given within 8 to 24 hours af ter the initial infusion.
Comparator
Patients assigned to the 8 -mg/kg arm  will receive the 8- mg/kgTCZ dose by [CONTACT_16228].  The 
dose of TCZ infusion will be calculated on the basis of body weight measured prior to infusion.  
One additional infusion of TCZ can be given within [ADDRESS_779753] deviation (SD) , and 
coefficient of variation.
PK Analyses
The PK analysis population will consist of patients with sufficient data to enable estimation of key 
parameters (e.g., area under the concentration curve [AUC ], maximum serum concentration observed 
[Cmax]), with patients grouped according to treatment received.  
Non-linear mixed effects modeling will be used to analyze the serum TCZ concentration over time data 
collected in this study using existing population- PK models.  Individual and mean serum TCZ 
concentration versus time data will be tabulated and plotted by [CONTACT_15994].  The serum pharmacokinetics 
of TCZ will be summarized by [CONTACT_591532] (AUC), Cmax, total clearance, and volume of

variat ion, median, minimum, and maximum).  Interpatient variability will be evaluated.
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate.  The PK parameters derived from these analyses 
may be used for exploratory graphical analyses of the PD parameters.
Determination of Sample Size  
The purpose of this open -label study  is the comparison of TCZ pharmacokinetics and PK-PD
relationship between two doses of TCZ (8 and 4 mg/kg) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591507] -19 pneumonia.  The comparison will be assessed using modeling and evaluating the 
safety and efficacy measures between Day 1 and Day 28 postrandomization .  Data from the follow -up 
period from Days 28 to 60 may also be assessed.   Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled and
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 8 -mg/kg and 4- mg/kg IV TCZ arms in this study .  Disease severity 
type will also be stratified into moderate and severe COVID pneumonia, giving an overall equal four -way 
split between the two doses and type of disease sever ityandresulting in four groups of approximately 
25patients each.  Patients may receive a repeat dose within [ADDRESS_779754] TCZ dose if 
clinicians judge it is necessary (resulting in a TCZ dose range from 4 to 16 mg/kg, with a maximum
dose of 800 mg ).  Thevariability of PK parameters of TCZ in a heterogeneous COVID -19 population in 
an acute setting is unknown; however, 20to [ADDRESS_779755] variability in health volunteers and patients with RA provided by [CONTACT_66067] -PK 
modeling .  Data quality issues, patient dropouts, and early hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591508], especially in a pandemic setting; thus, enrolling 50 patients according to dose and disease severity 
type (25 per arm) m ay offset missing data and allow an adequate volume of PK and PD data to inform the 
population -PK m odel and allow a comparison of the 4 -and 8 -mg/kg doses .

1.1 BACKGROUND ON COVID -19 PNEUMONIA
Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive -stranded RNA viruses , named for thecrown -like 
appearance of their spi[INVESTIGATOR_249103] .  They are a large family 
of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases 
such as Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_591509] 
(SARS -CoV).
COVID -19, 
which is the acronym of “coronavirus disease 2019,” is caused by a novel
coronavirus strain (SARS -CoV- 2) and was newly named on 11 February 2020 by[CONTACT_38771] ( WHO).  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_591510] n,the largest metropolitan area in 
China ’s Hubei province, and was reported to the W HO Country Office in China on 
31 December 2019.   The W HO subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 .
According to the WHO, as of 2 April 2020 more than 896,000 cases of COVID -19 
infection were reported inmore than 200countries and territories worldwide, with more 
than 45,500 deaths (WHO 2020a) .  Up to approximately 20% of infected patients 
experience complicat ions related to a severe form of inte rstitial pneumonia, which may 
progress to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_44959] (ARDS) and/or multi ple-organ failure 
and death (WHO 2020b) .
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific anti -viral medicine shown to be effective in
prevent ingor treat ingCOVID -19. Most patients with mild cases of disease recover with
symptomatic treatment and supportive care.  However, patients with more severe illness 
frequently require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838] (WHO 2020b) .
1.2 BACKGROUND ON TOCILIZUMA B
Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humani zed anti human monoclonal antibody of the 
IgG1 sub class directed against soluble interleukin -6 receptor (sIL -6R) and 
membrane -bound IL -6R.  TCZ binds specifically to both sIL-6R and membrane -bound 
IL-6Rand has been shown to inhibit both soluble and membrane -bound IL -6Rmediated 
signaling.  Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory multifunctional cytokine 
produced by a variety of cell types andhas be en shown to be involved in diver se 
physi ologic processes, such as T -cell activation, induction of acute -phase proteins,
stimulation of hem atopoietic precursor cell growth and differentiation, proliferation of 
hepatic, dermal, and neural cells, bone metabolism, lipid metabol ism, hepatoprotection,
and fibrosis.  Elevated tissue and serum levels of IL- [ADDRESS_779758] been implicated in the 
disease pathology of several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders ,including 
rheuma toid arthritis (RA), Castleman disease, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), giant cell arteritis (GCA) , Takayasu 
arteritis (TAK), systemi c sclerosis (SSc), and cytokine -release syndrome (CRS).   
Inhibition of the biological activity of IL -6 or IL -6R has been effective in the treat ment of 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
21/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2these disorders, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell induced CRS, for 
which treatment with TCZ has been approved in many countries. 
TCZ has IV and SC formulations.  Some of the above -listed indications (RA, sJIA, and 
pJIA) have receiv ed approval for both the IV and SC formulations, whereas others have 
received approval exclusively for the IV (Castleman disease and CRS) or the SC (GCA 
and TAK) formulation .  
The estimated cumulative clinical trial exposure to TCZ from the Development 
International Birth Date (IBD) (28 April 1997) and until 10 April 2019 ( the data lock point
for the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report) was 24,826 patients ([ZIP_CODE].98 
patient -years [PY s]). Since the IBD (11 April 2005), the estimated cumul ative market 
exposure to TCZ until 10 April 2019 was1,301,050 patients (1,053,779 PY s). The 
combined cumulative post
marketing exposure of patients to IV TCZ is estimated to be 
896,672 patients (726,347 PY s). The combined cumulative postmarketing exposur e of 
patients to SC TCZ is 404,378 (327,432 PY s).

studies.
1.3 TOCILIZUMA B TREATMENT OF CYTOKIN E
-RELEA SE 
SYNDROME WITH CA R TCELL T HERA PY
CRS has been identified as a clin ically significant, on -target, off -tumor side effect of the 
CAR T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_591511]. Characteristics of CRS 
include fever, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy, hypotension, tachycardia, 
coagulopathy, nausea, capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], and multi ple-organ dysfunction. The reported 
incidence of CRS after CAR T cell therapy ranges from 50% to 100%, with 13% 48% of 
patients experiencing the severe or life -threatening form of CRS . Serum levels of 
inflammatory cytokines are elevated, p articularly IL- 6. The severity of symptoms may 
correlate with the serum cytokine concentrations and the duration of exposure to the 
inflammatory cytokines.
On [ADDRESS_779759] 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TCZ
(Actemra®)for the trea tment of severe or life -threatening CAR T cell induced CRS in 
adults and in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. The approved dose is 8 mg/kg 
for body weight 30 kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight [ADDRESS_779760] 8 hours.  
The approval of TCZ was based on a ret rospective analysis of data from patients treated 
with TCZ who developed CRS after treatm ent with tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®) or
axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta®) in prospective clinical trials (Le et al. 2018 ).  Of the 
45patients , 31 patients (69%) from the CTL019 series achieved a response (defined as 
being afebrile and off vasopressors for at least [ADDRESS_779761] dose 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
22/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2of TCZ for a maximum ofup to two doses and without use of additional treatment other 
than corticosteroids within [ADDRESS_779762] dose of TCZ), and the median t ime from 
the first dose to response was 4 days .  Eight of the 15 patients (53%) from the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel series achieved a response, and the median time to response 
was 4.[ADDRESS_779763] dose of TCZ, and 
duration of CRS prior to treatment with TCZ.  There were no reports of adverse reactions 
attributable to TCZ.
Pharmacokinetic ( PK)data were available for [ADDRESS_779764] dose of TCZ and 
for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ.  Based on 131 PK observations, the 
geometric mean (% CV) maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with 
CAR T cell induced, severe or life -threatening CRS was 99.5 g/mL (36.8%) af ter the 
first infusion and 160.7 g/mL (113.8%) after the second infusion. The PK modeling 
analysis show ed that patients with CRS had faster clearance of TCZ than healthy 
volunteers and other patient populations, and simulations showed that exposure was 
considered acceptable with up to four doses of TCZ administered at least 8 hours apart 
topatients with CRS.
TCZ is also approved for CAR Tcellinduced severe or life -threatening CRS in the
European Union and certain other countries .
1.4 REA L
-WORLD EXPERIENC EWITH TOCILIZUMA B IN
COVID -19PNEUMONIA
Physicians in China initiated the off -label use of TCZ in the treatment of COVID -19 
pneumonia.  Based on the results from an initial 21 -patient retrospective study in which 
patients with severe or critically ill patients with COVID -19 pneumonia were treated with 
TCZ (Xu et al. 2020). TCZ was included in the seventh updated diagnosis and treatment 
plan for COVID -19 issued by [CONTACT_591533] C OVID -19 pneumonia on 3 March 2020 .  The 
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention defined disease severity according 
to the following criteria :
Severe disease:  dyspnea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_249109] 30/min, blood oxygen saturation 
(SpO 2) 93%, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)to fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) 
ratio (the ratio of blood pressure of oxygen [PaO 2]to the percentage of oxygen 
supplied [FiO 2]) 300 mmHg, and/or lung infiltrates 50% within 24 to 48 hours ; this 
occurred in 14% o f cases
Critical disease: respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] , septic shock, and/or multiple -organ dysfunction 
or multiple- organ failure; this occurred in 5% of cases (Wu et al. 2020)
Because body weight measurement is not always feasible in urgent circumstances, the
dose regimen used in China is a single fixed dose of 400 mg TCZ administered to 
patients by [CONTACT_16228] (which equates to between 4 and 8 mg/kg based on the body 
weight range of the Chinese adult population), with the maximum single dose ofno more 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
23/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2than 800 mg.  Ifclinical signs and symptoms donot improve ,an additional dose can be 
administered after 12 hours. The guidance advise sthat no more than two doses should 
be given. TCZ treatment is not permitted for people with active infections ,including
tuber culosis ( TB), bacterial ,or fung al infections .  
Results from 21 Patients Treated with Tocilizumab in China
In February 2020, 21patients with severe or critical COVID -19 pneumonia were treated 
with IV TCZ (400 mg) plus standard of care ( SOC) .  The mean ( SD) age of patients 
was 56.8 16.5 years, ranging from 25 to 88 years.  Seventeen patients (81.0%) were 
assessed as having severe cases and 4 patients (19.0%) were critical.  Most patients 
(85%) presented with lymphopenia.  C -reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased in 
all 20 patients (mean SD, 75.06 66.80 mg/L).  The median procalcitonin value was 
0.330.78 ng/mL, and 2 of 20 patients (10.0%) presented with an abnormal value.  
Themeanstandard deviation (SD)IL-6 level before TCZ treatment was 132.38 278.54 
pg/mL (normal 7pg/mL).
SOC consisted of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], methylprednisolone, other symptom relievers, and oxygen 
therapy ,as recommended by [CONTACT_249157] ( sixth revised edition).  All [ADDRESS_779765] computed tomography (CT) scan .  
Eighteen patients (85 .7%) received TCZ once, and 3 patien ts (14.3%) had a second 
dose because of fever within 12 hours.  According to the authors, after TCZ treatment, 
fever returned to normal and all other symptoms improved remarkably.  Fifteen of the 
20patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake and 1patient needed no oxygen 
therap y.  CT scans showed significant remission of opacities in both lungs in 19 of 
20patients (90.5%) after treatment with TCZ.  The percentage of lymphocytes in 
peripheral blood, which was decreased in 85.0% of patients (17 of 20patients ) prior to 
treatment (mean SD, 15.52 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10 of 
19patients ) on the fifth day after treatment.  Abnormally elevated CRP levels decreased 
significantly in 84.2% of patients (16 of 19patients ).  No adverse drug reactions and no 
subsequent pulmonary infections were reported.  
Nineteen patients (90.5%) were discharged at the time of the report, including 2critical ly 
severe patients.  There were no deaths among the 21 treated patients.
The study ’sauthors concluded that TCZ is an effective treatment for patients with severe 
COVID -19pneumonia (Xu et al. 2020).   More recently, multiple prospective and retrospective 
studies have been conducted to describe the real -world experience with TCZ treatment of 
COVID -19 pneumonia (Alattar et al. 2020; Klopfenstein et al. 2020; Luo et al. 2020; Sciasci
etal. 2020; Toniati et al. 2020 ).

3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for Patient Population
The pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_4113] -19 can be classified into four types:  mild, common or 
moderate, severe, and critically severe (National Health Commission, trial Version 5 ).  
Based on the current knowledge of COVID -19, approximately 80% of patients infected 
with SARS -CoV- 2 (COVID -19) experience mild disease and can recover at home and 
require only simple symptomatic relief.  However, approximately 20% require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], owing to more severe disease (moderate, severe, or critically severe).  
Once hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190313], 5% 26% patients are transferred to an ICU, 2.3% are mechanically

3.3.[ADDRESS_779775] 2017, the U.S. FDA approved TCZ ( Actemra®)for the treatment of severe 
or life -threatening CAR T cellinduced CRS in adults and in pediatric patients 2 years of 
age and older. The approved TCZ dose is 8 mg/kg for body weight 30 kg and 
12mg/kg for body weight [ADDRESS_779776] 8 hours. 
This CRS label supported the selection of the dosing regimen in the ongoing COVACTA 
(WA42380) stud y, in which 8 mg/kg IV TCZ is administered topatients infected with 
severe COVID -19, with the possibility to repeat the dose within 8 to 24 hours after the 
initial infusion if clinically required. Nevertheless, the optimal dose and dosing frequency 
of TCZ in the treatment of CAR T cell induced CRS arenot known, and the dosing 
instructions provided in the current TCZ label provide only general recommendations for 
safe dosing (Leetal. 2018).
There is increasing evidence coming from real -world experience that lower doses of TCZ 
could show a similar efficacy in treating COVID -19 pneumonia as the one recommended 
in the CRS label.  Treating physicians in China used a single fixed dose of 400 mg IV 
TCZ, asbody weigh t measurement wa s not feasible (which equates to between 4 and 
8mg/kg based on the body weight range of the Chinese adult population ).
In February 2020, 21patients with severe or critical COVID -19 pneumonia were treated 
with IV TCZ (400 mg) in combination with SOC treatment . Nineteen patien ts (90.5%) 
were discharged at the time of the report, including 2critical ly severe patients.  No deaths
were reported among the 21 treated patients. The study ’sauthors concluded that TCZ
is an effective treatment for patients with severe COVID -19pneumonia (Xuet al. 2020) .
TCZcompetitively inhibits the binding of IL -6 to it s sIL-6Rsand membrane -expressed 
IL-6Rs (mIL-6Rs). Inhibiting the entire receptor complex prevents IL -6 signal 
transduction to inflammatory mediators , including CRP, and significantly improves the 
chronic inflammatory process of RA(Rueda et al. 2011 ).
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
30/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2After IVadministration, the observed concentrations of TCZ decline dslowly over time. 
Elimination of TCZ is assumed to be a combination of a linear elimination through the 
non-specific binding and a target -mediated elimination related to TCZ binding to both 
sIL-6R and mIL -6R and subsequent elimination of the drug target complex.
A PK/PD model (Gibiansky and Frey 2012) has been developed to describe the
relationship betw een the TCZ concentration time profile and the extent of target 
engagement as displayed by [CONTACT_591535] -6R time course. 
This model has been used to illustrate the expected decrease in estimated free sIL -6R 
levels achieved with different IV TCZ dosing regimens (Gibiansky and Frey 2012). It is 
worth highlighting that 8 -mg/kg IV (tested in P hase III COVACTA trial) and 4 -mg/kg IV 
dosing regimens elicit a similar onset and magnitude of the IL -[ADDRESS_779777] inhibition. The 
only difference lies with the duration of the inhibition as reflected by [CONTACT_591535]- 6R blockade 
over a defined period of time. These results sup port the choice of testing 4 mg/kg IV
TCZ in patients presenting with COVID -19 pneumonia based on the understanding of 
the PK PD relationship of TCZ and on pred ictions from a well -established model in RA .
The level of target IL-6Rsin patients has the greatest effect on both the exposure ofTCZ 
and the duration of the IL -[ADDRESS_779778] assuming IL -6R levels were 
similar to levels in patients with RA . For each of these two approaches, simulated free 
sIL-6R levels were predicted for patients with a low body weight (50 kg), an average 
body weight (75 kg), and a higher body weight (100 kg). Because all three profiles are 
ident ical, only the plots for patients weighing 
75kg are reported below .
In the case in which the levels of IL -6Rsare similar to levels observed in patients with RA, 
the 4 -mg/kg and 8 -mg/kg inhibiti on profiles overlap over [ADDRESS_779779] complete receptor blockade of up to 7 days following a single 
IV infusion of TCZ (see Figure 2).

IL-6Rinterleukin -6 receptor; RA rheumatoid arthritis; sIL -6Rsoluble interleukin -6 receptor.
Under the assumption that the level of IL- 6Rs in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia 
would be 10- fold higher than in patients with RA, the 4- mg/kg infusion results in the 
same inhibition level compared with 8 -mg/kg up to 4 days after the infu sion (see 
Figure 3); beyond that, a second infusion would be required to ensure maximal blockade 
for [ADDRESS_779780] of one single IV infus ion of 8 mg/kg (see Figure 4).

In RA, t here are sound scientific arguments supporting that 4 mg/kg IV TCZ can elicit a 
similar onset and magnitude of IL-[ADDRESS_779781] inhibition as8 mg/kg IV TCZ .Nevertheless, 
it is acknowledged that the model may not accurately predict the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of TCZ inpatients with COVID -[ADDRESS_779782] activation ( Xu et al. 2020 ).Therefore, all 
patients may not be equally likely to respond to TCZ treatment .  
PDbiomarkers (i.e.,IL-6, sIL -6R, CRP ,and ferritin) will be assessed to demonstrate 
evidence of pharmacological activity of TCZ in patients, to support selection of a 
recommended dose and dosing regimen, and to inform potential revisions to the PK 
sample co llection schedule. 
The exploratory biomarkers will be assessed to further characterize TCZ mechanism of 
action in relation to efficacy and exposure .

the inclusion criterion is met.
For moderate patients (those who do not qualify as severe based oxygen 
requirements), CRP 2ULN is required
For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 
1% per year during the treatmen t period and for [ADDRESS_779783] refrain from donating eggs during this same period.
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal , 
has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea 
with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile 
due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries , fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], and/or uterus) or another 
cause as determined by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., Müllerian agenesis) .  The
definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local 
guidelines or regulations .
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.  If required per local 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local 
Informed Consent Form.
For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use a condom, and agreement to refrain from do nating sperm, as defined below:
With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men 
must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 
60days after the final dose of TCZ to avoid exposing the embryo.  Men must 
refrain from donating sperm during this same period.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar , ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure.  
Ifrequired per local guidelines or regulations, information about the reliability of 
abstinence will be described in the local Info rmed Consent Form.

Concomitant therapy con sists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-
counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements , 
investigational anti -viral agents, blood products ) used by a patient in addition to 
protocol -mandated treatment from 7days prior to initiation of study drug to the study 
completion/discontinuation visit.   All such medications should be reported to the 
investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF ).
4.4.1 Permitted Therapy
All patients will receive SOC treatment per local practice for the treatment of COVID -19 
pneumonia.   SOC may include anti -viral treatment, low -dose steroids, and supportive 
care.
Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromyc in) is permitted as part of 
local practice. Chloroquine is recommended with a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_779791] the use of 
corticosteroids in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia.  However, regio n-specific 
guidelines recommend considering corticosteroids in some patients with COVID- 19 
pneumonia.  This protocol allows the use of low -dose steroids as part of local SOC.  
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
38/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2Ifsteroids are given, the Sponsor recommends a dose of no more than 1 mg/kg 
methylprednisolone or equivalent for no more than 5 days.
In general, investigators should manage a patient's care with supportive th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_591516].  Patients who experience 
infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine), 
or equivalent medications per local standard practice.  Serious infusion associated 
events manifested by , for example, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, 
tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_226800] (e.g., supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic 
agonists).
4.4.2 Cautionary  Therapy
[IP_ADDRESS] Medic ations Given w ith Precaution due to Effects Related to 
CYP Enzy mes
The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by [CONTACT_86618] 
(e.g., IL -6) during states of chronic inflammation.  Therefore, for molecules that 
antagonize cytokine ac tivity, such as TCZ, it is expected that the formation of CYP450 
enzymes could be normalized .  When starting TCZ therapy, patients taking medicat ions 
that are individually dose adjusted and metabolized by [CONTACT_249165]450, CYP3A4, 
CYP1A2, or CYP2C9 (e.g., a torvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, 
phenytoin, cyclosporine , or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) are recommended to be monitored as 
doses may need to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic effect.
The above list of med ications is not necess arily comprehensive.  The investigator should 
consult the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication 
can be safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_591538].
[IP_ADDRESS] Herbal Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_204719], safety profiles, and potential drug drug interact ions are generally 
unknown.
4.4.3 Prohibited Therapy

4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The sequence of assessments at each visit will be standardized as follows (at visits 
required in the schedules of activities ):
Efficacy assessments:  clinical status, clinical signs and symptoms, and 
oxygen saturation
Safety assessments:  recording of vital signs, review of adverse events, and 
concomitant medications
Laboratory samples:  On days when study drug is administered, a llsamples 
(including predose PK, safety, and biomarker samples ) must be obtained within 
6hours prior to study drug treatment, except for postdose samples for PK analyse s, 
which will be obtained after study drug treatment.  
IV infusion of TCZ (only at baseline and an additional dose if needed)
Safety assessments and recording of vital signs post-TCZ administration (if 
applicable)
If patients are discharged from thehospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] 28, follow -up visits should occur 
twice a week through Day 28.  Patients are encouraged to return for onsite visits at least 
once a week, if p ossible; other follow -up visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_756].  Patients 
should return to the site for theDay [ADDRESS_779792] 
follow -up visits on Days 35, 45, and 60; the Day [ADDRESS_779793] be obtained before 
performing any study -related procedures (including screening evaluations).  The Informed 
Consent Form m ust be signed and dated by [CONTACT_12718]'s legally authorized 
representative or where allowed, health care provider consent on behalf of the patient before his or 
her participation in the study.  Due to the pandemic situation and restricted ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_249144], 
where allowed, verbal consent may be given by [CONTACT_12718]’s legally authorized 
representative and this must be documented by [CONTACT_31594].  The case 
history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that 
informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.   Additional details concerning 
obtaining signed informed consent areavailable to sites and are based on the U.S. FDA ’supdated 
guidance on conduct of clinical trials of medical products during COVID -19 public health 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
40/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2emergency ( FDA 2020 ).  Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients 
who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before enrollment.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for
screening failure, as applicable.
4.5.2 Medical History , Baseline Conditions, Concomitant Medication, 
and Demographic Data
Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), r eproductive status, smoking history, 
home oxygen use, will be recorded at baseline.  In addition, all medications 
(e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic 
remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_591539] [ADDRESS_779794] 
dose of study drug will be recorded.  At the time of each follow -up physical examination, 
an interval medical history should be obtained and any changes in medications and 
allergies should be recorded.
Demographic data will inc lude age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination, performed at screening, should include an evaluation 
of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, 
musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations may be perform ed at unscheduled 
postbaseline visits as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should 
be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should 
be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.5.4 Vital Sign s and Oxy gen Saturation
Vital signs will include measurements of respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature. Peripheral oxygen saturation should 
also be measured at the same time as the vitals.  For patients requiring supplemental 
oxygen, the oxygen flow rate ( in liters per minute [ L/min ]) and/or FiO 2should be 
recorded. 
In order to allow assessment of the NE WS2 score (see Section 4.5.5 and Appendix 4),
all of the vital sign parameters and oxygen saturation should be recorded together twice
per day , with approximately 12 hours in between, for the duration of a patient’s
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16366] . This is toensure that the measurements reflect the 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
41/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2patient’s condition over the ent ire study day, whenever possible. If vital signs or oxygen 
saturation are measured more than once during a [ADDRESS_779795] values 
(highest temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate, lowest blood pressure, oxygen 
saturation, and consciousness level) during that period should be recorded on the eCRF.  
Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] ,these parameters should be recorded once at each return 
visit to the clinic. Vital signs and oxygen saturation will not be recorded if follow -up visits 
are conducted by [CONTACT_756]. 
Record abnormaliti es observed at baseline on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  At subsequent visits, record new or worsened clinically significant 
abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.5.5 Assessments Specific to National Early  Warning Score 2
In add ition to the vital measurements, the patient’s consciousness level and the 
presence or absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_249131].  The NE WS2 parameter 
for respi[INVESTIGATOR_95242] “oxygen” and can include other

4.5.6 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples
Local Labora tory Assessments
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be measured by [CONTACT_3452]'s local 
laboratory:
Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2, if arterial blood gases are performed during 
screening or follow -up)
Hematology : WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, 
differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes), and 
lymphocyte subsets (T cells, B cells,and natural killer cells; if the test is available at 
the site or if the site can ship the blood sample on the day of collection to the central 
laboratory for testing )
Chemistry panel (serum or plasma): bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (if 
considered standard of care for the region), sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, 
BUN or urea, creatini ne,total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, total bilirubin, 
ALP, ALT, and/or AST, uric acid, LDH , D-dimer, CRP ,and ferritin
Pregnancy test
All women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test at screening 
(urine or serum). If a urine preg nancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test .

Central Laboratory  Assessments
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to designated central laboratories 
or to the Sponsor or a designee for analysis:
Serum samples for PK analysis
Serum andplasma samples for PD analysis (IL- 6, sIL- 6R, and CRP) and exploratory 
biomarker research
Serum samples for SARS -CoV- 2 antibody titer
Nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL (if applicable) for SARS- CoV-2 virology tests 
(viral load and exploratory analysis)
Blood inPAXgene®tubes for RNA for sequencing or quantitative PCR
 Blood for cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell sisolation (for sites 
capable of sample collection or if the site can ship the blood sample on the day of 
collection to the central laboratory for isolation )
 Blood for testing T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells (if the site s hips the blood sample on 
the day of collection to the central lab oratory for testing )
Exploratory biomarker research may include, but will not be limited to, analysis of 
inflammatory mediators and/or cytokines, ARDS- related variables, serum viral load, and 
virus resistance and mutation analysis.
In countries where acceptable ,biomarker research may involve extraction of DNA, 
cell-free DNA, or RNA; analysis of mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and 
other genomic variants; and genomic profiling through use of next -generation 
sequencing (NGS) of a comprehensive panel of genes.
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.
Biological samples will be destroyed no later than the time of completion of the final 
Clinical Study Report, with the following exceptions:
Serum samples collected for PK analysis may be needed for additional PK assay 
development and validation , and biomarker research; therefore, these samples will 
be destroyed no later than 15years after the final Clinical Study Report has been 
completed.
Blood (serum , plasma ,and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ), blood RNA, and 
tissue -derived samples (nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL, if applicable) collected for 
PD analysis and biomarker research will be destroyed no later than 15 years after 
the final Clinical Study Report has been completed.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
43/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples.  However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.
Data arising from sample analysis , including data on genomic variants, will be subject to 
the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4.
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by [CONTACT_2371].  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the e ffective Sponsor policy on study data publication.
4.5.[ADDRESS_779796] X -rays wi ll be performed 
according to the schedules of activities (seeAppendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3).
Chest X -rayor CT scan findings should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF per the 
schedule of activities .  If additional chest X -rays or CT scans are performed per local 
practice, this information should be provided on the eCRF.
4.5.9 Electrocardiograms
Single ECG recordings will be obtained at screening , as outlined in the schedule of 
activities ( see Appendix 1)and may be obtained thereafter as needed at the
investigator’s discretion .  
All ECG recordings must be performed using a standard high -qualit y, high -fidelity digital 
electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements.

Assessment of clinical status using a 7 -category ordinal scale will be recorded at 
baseline on Day 1 and then again once a day every morning (between 8 a.m. and 
12p.m.) while a patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The ordinal scale categories are as follows:
1Discharged (or “ready for discharge” as evidenced by [CONTACT_249171][INVESTIGATOR_697], and stable oxygen saturation on ambient air or 2 L supplemental 
oxygen)
2Non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494] (or “ready for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494]”) not requiring supplementa l 
oxygen
3Non-ICU hospit al ward (or “ready for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494]”) requiring supplemental oxygen
[ADDRESS_779798], requiring non -invasive ventilation or high -flow oxygen
5ICU, requiring intubation and m echanical ventilation 
6ICU, requiring ECMO or mechanical ventilation a nd additional organ support 
(e.g., vasopressors, renal replacement therapy)
7Death
Patients who are ready to be discharged but are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (e.g., because of 
non-medical or administrative reasons) will be assigned an ordinal scale category of 1. 
Patients in a non -ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249133] 4.  
Patients in an ICU for administrative or non -medical reasons who are ready for a 
non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591517] 2 (if not requiring 
supplemental oxygen) , 3 (if requiring supplemental oxygen) , or 4 (if requiring 
non-invasive ventilation or high -flow oxygen).
In general, patients with oxygen saturation consistently 90% should be considered for 
escalation to a higher clinical status category, while patients with oxygen saturation 
consistently 96% should be considered for de -escalation to a lower category.  Patients 
on supplemental oxygen should be evaluated at least daily and considered for reduction 
or discontinuation of oxygen support. Actual changes in level of support will be at the 
discre tion of the clinician(s) treating the patient based on the patient’s overall condition 
and may be dictated by [CONTACT_591542] .

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with TCZ in 
clinical studies and postmarketing experience .  The important safety risks for TCZ are 
outlined below.  Please refer to the Tocilizumab Investigator's Brochure for a complete 
summary of safety information.
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study.  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  
Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the 
nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events .  In addition, guidelines for managing 
adverse events and laboratory abnormalities , including criteria for dosage modification 
and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below .
5.1.[ADDRESS_779801] of all identified or potential risks of TCZ therapy, 
please refer to the current version of the Tocilizumab Investigator’s Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity  Reactions, Including A naphylaxis
An infusion reaction is defined as any adverse event that occurs during or within 
24hours after the infusion.   This may include hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions.  
Stevens -Johnson syndrome has been reported during treatment with TCZ in the 
postmarketing setting.  Signs of a possible hypersensitivity reaction include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
Fever, chills, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and skin rash
Cardiopulmonary reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, or 
hypertension
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
47/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2TCZ infusions will be administered to patients at the site under close supervision.  Health 
care professionals administering TCZ infusions should be trained in the appropriate 
procedures for TCZ administration, should be able to recognize the symptoms 
associated with potential hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and should 
have the appropriate medication available for immediate use in case of hypersensitivity 
reaction such as anaphylaxis during or after administration of TCZ.  The patient should 
be treated according to the SOC for management of the hypersensitivity reaction. 
If a patient has symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, or 
requires an interrupti on of the study drug because of symptoms of hypersensitivity ,
including anaphylaxis, administration of TCZ must be discontinued permanently.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients at 
increased risk of infection, such as a history of recurring infections or with underlying 
condi tions (e.g., diabetes mellitus), that may predispose patients to serious infect ions 
and opportunistic infections such as TB and viral reactivations (e.g., hepatitis B virus).  
Vigilance for timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving 
biologic agents, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened 
because of suppression of the acute -phase reaction.  The effects of TCZ on CRP and 
neutrophils, and the signs and symptoms of infection, should be considered when 
evaluating a patient for a potential infection.  It is recommended that neutropenic 
patients (ANC 1000/ L) undergo weekly surveillance blood cultures during the study.
If a patient develops a serious infection, administration of TCZ should be discontinued.
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Perforations
Symptomatic diverticulosis, diverticulitis, or chronic ulcerative lower GI disease, such as 
Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or other chronic lower GI conditions, might predispose 
patients to GI perforations.   Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the 
potential for complications of di verticular disease and thus reduce the risk of GI 
perforations.  
Discontinuation of TCZ is required for patients who develop GI perforations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic A bnormalities
Decreases in neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels have been 
observed following treatment with TCZ for labeled indications.  Treatment -related 
neutropenia was not associated with serious infection in clinical trials in any indication ,
and no association between decreases in platelet counts and serious bleeding event s 
has been observed.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
48/Protocol CA42481 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Demy elinating Disorders
The effect of treatment with TCZ on demyelinating disorders is not known; events have 
been reported rarely.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of 
TCZ in patients with preexisting or rec ent-onset demyelinating disorders.  
Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of 
central demyelinating disorders.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Elevated Liver Enzymes
In clinical trials, mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases h ave been 
observed with TCZ treatment. 
Recommended TCZ dose modifications for elevated liver enzymes in those populations 
are not applicable to this study owing to single -dose therapy ( with possible additional 
infusion) with 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg TCZ.
Patients who develop elevated liver function test abnormalities during the study must 
have repeat tests performed as clinically indicated until levels return to baseline , even if 
they withdraw from the study. If the specialist deems a liver biopsy necessa ry, the 
prepared histologic slides will be requested by [CONTACT_249173] a third 
party, and the biopsy report should be forwarded to the Sponsor.

therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]
and5.3.5.8 for more information)
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of st udy treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to 
theSponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Results in persistent or significant d isability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient's ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medi cal event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe" and "serious" are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
50/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_779804] (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
are as follows:
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Serious and/or medically significant infections
Myocardial in farction or acute coronary syndrome
GI perforations
Anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions 
Stroke
Serious and/or medically significant bleeding events
Serious and/or medically significant hepatic events
Demyelinating disorders

SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
51/Protocol CA42481 , Version 25.3.[ADDRESS_779805].  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported during the 60-day
follow -up period.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event informat ion at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?" 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of Adverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 1 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

bExamples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by [CONTACT_25744].
cIf an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a seriou s

reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating " yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 2 }:
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug (as applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications kno wn to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
53/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2Table 2Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be r eadily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_779807] medical terminology/concepts when recording a dverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically character ized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be n ullified and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A re Secondary  to Other Events
In general, advers e events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separate d in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
54/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe GI hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear a s to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modi fication, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment 
Note:  For onco logy trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events.
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
55/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment disconti nuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be e xercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertens ion) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of COVID- 19 pneumonia .
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
56/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or cont ributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed solely to progression of COVID -19 pneumonia , "COVID -19 
pneumonia progression" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisti ng medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of COVID -19 Pneumonia
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should notbe recorded as adverse events (with the exception of 
death due to COVID -19 pneumonia progression as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  These 
data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only.  If there is any uncertainty as to 
whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse 
event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26663] (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse

An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33405] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25682]
[IP_ADDRESS] Cases of A ccidental Overdose or Medication Error
Accidental overdose and medication error hereafter collectively referred to as "special 
situations"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to ad ministration of 
the drug.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).  For TCZ, 
adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described 
below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated TCZ, regardless of whether they result in an 
adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
58/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_26669]) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Ac cidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.
Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the error in the additional case details.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two 
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entries .
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  Biomarker Data
Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by [CONTACT_1034],

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 3 months after the final
dose of study drug.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be 
completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_123565].  Pregnan cy 
should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should counsel 
the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  A ny serious 
adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in 
the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the 
child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the i nvestigator will 
submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the 
course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instructed through the Informe d Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
60days after the final dose of study drug.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_162492].  Attempts should be made to collect and repor t details of the course and 
outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.  W hen

pregnancy becomes available.  An investigator who is contact[CONTACT_249179], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the 
treating physician and/or obstetrician.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abortions
Aspontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
drug orthefemale partner of a mal e patient exposed to study d rugshould be classified

The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
A modified intent -to-treat (mIT T) population will be used to perform all statistical 
analyses.  All patients randomized and receiving at least one dose of TCZ will be 
included.  All reasons for exclusion will be properly documented and the criteria for them 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
63/Protocol CA42481 , Version 2set before database lock.  In tercurrent events like rescue therapy will be addressed with 
sensitivity analyses defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan and Data Analysis Plan.
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The purpose of this open- label study is the comparison of TCZ pharmacokinetics and PK-PD
relationship between two doses of TCZ (8 and 4 mg/kg) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591522] -19 pneumonia.  The comparison will be assessed using modeling 
and evaluating the safety and efficacy measures between Day 1 and Day 28 pos trandomization .  
Data from the follow -up period from Days 28 to 60 may also be assessed.   Approximately
100patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 8 -mg/kg and 4 -mg/kg 
IV TCZ arms in this study .  Disease severity type will also be st ratified into moderate and 
severe COVID pneumonia, giving an overall equal four -way split between the two doses and type 
of disease severity and resulting in four groups of approximately [ADDRESS_779815] TCZ dose if clinicians judge it is 
necessary (resulting in a TCZ dose range from 4 to 16 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 
800mg).  Thevariability of PK parameters of TCZ in a heterogeneous COVID -19 population in 
an acute setting is unknown ; however, 20to [ADDRESS_779816] variability in health volunteers and patients with RA provided by [CONTACT_66067] -PK 
modeling.  Data quality issues, patient dropouts, and early hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591523], especially in a pandemic setting; thus, enrolling 50 patients according to dose and 
disease severity type (25 per arm) may offset missing data and allow an adequate volume of PK 
and PD data to inform the population -PK model and allow a comparison of the 4 - and 8- mg/kg 
doses .
6.[ADDRESS_779817] OF STUDY
The number of patients who enroll, discontinue, or complete the study will be 
summarized.  Reasons for premature study discontinuation will be listed and

Non-linear mixed effects modeling will be used to analyze the serum TCZ concentration 
over time data collected in this study using existing population -PK models.  Individual 
and mean serum TCZ concentration versus time data will be tabulated and plotted by 
[CONTACT_15994].  The serum pharmacokinetics of TCZ will be summarized by [CONTACT_591544] (AUC), Cmax, total clearance, and volume of distribution.  Estimates for 
these parameters will be tabulated and summarized (mean, SD, co-efficient o f variation, 
median, minimum, and maximum).  Inter patient variability will be evaluated.
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate.  The PK parameters derived 
from these analyses may be used for exploratory graphical analyses of the PD

National Early  Warning Score 2 (NEWS2)
SpO 2oxygen saturation. 
Oxygen saturation (SpO 2) should be scored according to either the SpO 2Scale 1 or 2 
presented in the table above.  The SpO 2Scale 2 is for patients with a target oxygen 
saturation requirement of 88% 92% (e.g., in patients with hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_249149], such as chronic obstructive pulm onary disease).  
This should only be used in patients confirmed to have hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_249150] a prior or their current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
The decision to use the SpO 2Scale 2 should be made by [CONTACT_591555].  In all other circumstances, the SpO 2Scale 1 should be 
used.
For physiological parameter “Air or Oxygen?”:  Any patients requiring the use of oxygen 
or other forms of ventilation to maintain oxygen saturations and su pport respi[INVESTIGATOR_589963] a score of 2.
The consciousness level should be recorded according to the best clinical condition of 
the patient during the assessment.  Patients who are assessed as “Alert” (A) should be 
assigned a score of 0.  Patient s assessed as “New Confusion” (C), “Responsive to Voice” 
(V), “Responsive to Pain” (P), or “Unconscious” should be assigned a score of 3.

 1.0 Background   
 
1.1 Current status of radiotherapy ( RT) when elective pelvic nodal irradiation is considered 
for clinically localized, intermediate and high risk, prostate cancer  
 
Clinically localized prostate cance r is classified as ‘high’ risk, when there is a clinical 
stage T3 -4, Gleason score 8 -10, or Prostate Specific A ntigen (PSA) > 20 ng/mL , and as 
‘intermediate’ risk disease, when there is a clinical stage T2b -2c, Gleason score 7, or 
PSA 10 -20 ng/mL .  When su ch high or intermediate risk prostate carcinoma is treated 
with RT, elective pelvic nodal irradiation is often considered  (along with definitive RT to 
the prostate and seminal vesicles) , since there is concern that regional pelvic nodes may 
harbor occult m etastasis.  
 
When regional pelvic nodes are to be irradiated along with RT to the primary tumor in 
the prostate +/ - seminal vesicles, RT is usually delivered in two phases in the current 
clinical practice. The first phase is to irradiate  both regional pelv ic nodes and the primary 
tumor in the prostate +/ - seminal vesicles with a dose of [ADDRESS_747543] ate +/ - seminal 
vesicles and deliver ing an additional dose of 34.[ADDRESS_747544] ionation as dose escalation  
 
Dose escalation in RT can be achieved either adding more fractions (with the 
conventional dose fraction size of 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction daily) or altered fractionation 
schedule (with hypo - or hyper -fractionation). Hypofraction ation refers to an altered dose 
fractionation scheme in which the daily radiation dose is increased beyond the 
conventional 1.[ADDRESS_747545] suggested that prostate cancer has a relatively slow 
rate of proliferation, characterized by a low α/β value (1.5 to 3 Gy) in a linear quadratic 
model for cell survival after irradiation [1-4].  This implies that a larger radiation dose per 
fraction (i.e. hypofract ionation) is more effective in cell killing for prostate cancer than 
simply adding more fractions. Another major advantage of hypofractionation is its 
convenience and lower treatment cost , as it allows a shorter treatment duration with a 
reduced number of RT fractions.  
 
 1.3 Proton beam therapy  
 
Proton beam therapy delivers a radiation dose with positively charged atomic particles 
(protons), while conventional e xternal beam RT does with photons. Unlike photons, 
protons have a physical property to deposit m ost of their energy only when they reach 
their target. This allows protons to  deliver a radiation dose to a target more preferentially, 
 7  MC1651  
 
 
 
 while minimizing a dose to nearby [CONTACT_569878]. Thus, a delicate balance of delivering 
a high radiation dose to eradica te prostate cancer while largely sparing the nearby [CONTACT_569879] (such as rectum , bladder , and small bowel ) can be achieved much better with 
proton beam therapy tha n with conventional RT. A study of dose -volume histogram has 
shown in the treatment of pros tate cancer that proton beam therapy delivers less radiation 
dose to the dose -limiting no rmal organs , in comparison to conventional, photon -based, 
intensity modulated RT (IMRT) [5]. 
    
Several studies have reported that p roton  beam  therapy can provide a therapeutic gain by 
[CONTACT_569880] (or superior) tumor control while reducing the risk of 
radiation toxicity, in comparison with conventional photon -based external beam RT , for 
clinically localized prostate cance r[6-9]. In these studies, proton beam therapy achieved  
at least equivalent or b etter biochemic al relaps e-free rate s, while yielding  lower 
incidences of acute and late radiation toxicity,  in comparison with conventi onal RT. In a 
study compari ng patient -reported quality of life between the two prospectiv ely collected 
databases , Hoppe  suggest ed approximatel y 50% reduction in  significant bowel urgency 
and frequency in patients treated with proton  beam  therapy compared with IMRT [10].   
 
In the  current proton beam therapy of prostate cancer, the target volume  has been mostly 
limited to the prostate and the adjacent seminal vesicles. There has been no prospective 
study of proton beam therapy to treat both the primary tumor in the prostate and the 
regional pelvic nodes simult aneously using a hypofractionation regimen.    
 
1.4 Study proposal  
 
In the proposed study, the prostate +/ - seminal vesicles will be treated with a 
hypofractionation regimen using daily 2.7 Gy fractions to 67.5 Gy, while the regional 
pelvic lymph nodes wil l be simultaneously treated with daily 1.8 Gy fractions to 45 Gy, 
using proton beam therapy .  Assuming a α/β value of prostate carcinoma between 1.[ADDRESS_747546] 
conventional dose fractiona tion schedule (44 fractions over 8.8 weeks). A high precision 
RT technique using pencil beam proton therapy and daily on -line targeting of the prostate 
gland is employed to minimize  the dose to adjacent normal organs (bladder, rectum, and 
small bowel), whi ch will, in turn, reduce the risk of radiation toxicity.  
 
1.5   Biologic equivalent dose (BED) calculation for the proposed hypofractionation RT  
 
Using the linear quadratic model for cell survival after irradiation, a numeric value called 
biologic equival ent dose (BED) can be calculated.  BED is often used when different 
fractionation regimens are compared with respect to their radiobiologic effects on acute 
and late responding tissues [11]. A higher BED equates to better  tumoricidal effect and, at 
the same time, higher risk of normal tissue toxicity.    
 
  BED  = total dose x relative effectiveness  
   BED = (nd) x [1+ d / (α/β)]  
   n: number of fractions (treatments)  
   d: dose per fraction  
   α/β: numeric value reflecting  acute or late responding tissue  
 
 8  MC1651  
 
 
 
 Table 1 shows BEDs for prostate cancer with the proposed hypofractionation regimen 
(67.5 Gy at 2.7 Gy per fraction) versus with the conventional dose fractionation scheme 
(79.2 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction), when α/β ratio of  prostate cancer = 1.[ADDRESS_747547] a low rate of proliferation similar to  late responding tissues 
with a  α/β ratio ranging from 1.5 to 3 in the linear quadrantic model [1-4].  This means 
that prostate cancer is more sensitive to a fractionation size (dose per treatment) , with a 
higher dose per treatment resulting in more effective tumor control. As depi[INVESTIGATOR_569863] 1, the hypofracti onation regimen provides a higher BED, which means greater 
tumoricidal effect.

*Protocol dose  
 
To properly address a potential therapeutic gain of the proposed hypofractionation 
regimen, its impact on acute and late responding normal tissues needs to be also 
addressed . Table [ADDRESS_747548] to both acute and late responding 
normal tissues. The α/β value of acute responding normal tissues ( i.e. cells with high 
turnover) is estimated in the range of 10 (e.g. mucosal tissues), while late responding 
normal tissues (i.e. cells with low turnover) is considered to have a low α/β value in the 
range of 3 (e.g. parenchymal cells) [11].   
 
For acute responding normal tissues, BED of the hypofractionation regimen is slightly 
lower than that of the conventional dose fractionation scheme. This suggests that the 
likelihood of observing a higher incidence of acute radiatio n toxicity with the 
hypofractionation regimen is unlikely. In contrast, for late responding normal tissues , 
BED of  the hypofractionation regimen is slightly higher than that of the conventional 
dose fractionation scheme. This means that the hypofractionati on regimen has potentially 
a slightly higher probability of late radiation injury (such as radiation proctopathy or 
cystourethritis) , when  no other strategy to reduce the risk of radiation toxicity is 
integrated to the regimen. In order to counterbalance t his negative effect on the late 
responding normal tissues, the proposed study has incorporated high precision RT 
techniques (pencil beam proton therapy, and daily on -line targeting of the prostate using 
intraprostati c fiducial markers and  computed tomograp hy imaging ) that reduce the 
volume of normal tissues exposed to a high radiation dose. This reduction in the 
irradiated volume of normal tissues would, in turn, minimize the risk of late radiation 
toxicity.

 1.6  Other studies evaluating hypofractionation regimens in photon radio therapy setting  
 
The efficacy of the proposed hypofractionation regimen in a photon RT setting  has been 
recently reported by [CONTACT_14995]  [12, 13]. In this prospective study of 97 patients, a 
hypofractionation regimen of 67.5 Gy in 25 fractions was delivered to the prostate +/ - 
seminal vesicles, along with a simultaneous irradiation of regional pelvic nodes with 45  
Gy in 25 fractions, over 5 weeks. The prostate and seminal vesicles were irradiated with 
intensity -modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique, while the regional pelvic nodes 
were treated with either three -dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D -CRT; 67 patie nts) 
or IMRT (30  patients). The study targeted patients with high risk prostate carcinoma 
(clinical stage T3, Gleason score 8 -10, or PSA ≥ 20). Median age of the cohort was 71 
years. The patients received adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for median duration 
of 29.8 months

With median follow -up of 62 months, PSA relapse -free rate and survival was 83.7% and 
92.2%, respectively, at 5 years.  Of the 33 patients who underwent a 5 -year pro state 
biopsy, only 4 (12.1%) had a positivity  showing viable malignant cells.  
 
Pollack et al. reported a phase III study comparing 76 Gy in 38 fractions (2 Gy per 
fraction; conventional fractionation regimen) with 70.2 Gy in 26 fractions (2.7 Gy per 
fracti on; hypofractionation regimen) for low - to high -risk prostate cancer [14]. Clinical 
target volume of radiotherapy was limited to the prostate and seminal vesicles  for low - 
and intermediate -risk prostate cancer, while regional pelvic nodes were included, along 
with the prostate and seminal vesicles, for high -risk prostate cancer. Patients were treated 
with IMRT technique. Adjuvant androgen therapy was variable, depe nding on the risk 
category. There were a total of 307 patients randomized between the two fractionation 
regimens. With median follow -up of 68.4 months, there was no difference in the rate of 
PSA relapse and/or clinical disease recurrence at 5 years: 21.4% for the conventional 
fractionation arm vs. 23.3% for the hypofractionation arm. There were no statistically 
significant differences in acute and late toxicity between the two arms. Table 5 shows late   Table 3: Incidence of maximal acute GI and GU toxicity (%)

Another phase III study compared 80 Gy in 40 fractions (2 Gy per fraction over 8 weeks) 
with 62 Gy in 20 fractions (3.1 Gy per fraction over 5 weeks) for high -risk prostate 
cancer [15, 16]. Clinical target volume of radiotherapy was limited to the prostate and 
seminal vesicles. Patients were treated with 3D -CRT techn ique, and received 9 -month 
adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. A total of 168 patients were randomized between 
the two fractionation regimens. With median follow -up of 70 months, there was no 
statistical difference in the rate of PSA relapse (15% for 62  Gy/20 fractions vs. 26% for 
80 Gy/40 fractions, p = 0.065), local recurrence, and distant metastasis at 5 years. Table 6 
shows acute GI and GU toxicity, using the RTOG/EORTC scale. Table 7 shows late GI

1.7 High precision RT techniques in the proposed study  
 
Mayo Clinic conducted a prospective study to examine the motion of the prostate and the 
stability of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers, using  an electronic portal imaging 
devic e[17]. The study found that gold fiducial markers were stable within the prostate 
and that there was a significant prostate motion between radiation fractio ns (i.e. inter -
fraction motion). It demonstrated that fiducial markers in the prostate gland allowed a 
significant margin reduction for planning target volume (PTV) when used for on -line 
localization of the prostate. Margins of 5 -7.3 mm around the prostate  for inter -fraction 
prostate motion could be reduced to 3 mm by [CONTACT_569881] -line localization of the prostate 
using intraprostatic gold fiducial markers. As a result of this study, the implant of fiducial 
markers in the prostate gland, the application of a re duced margin for PTV, and the use of 
IMRT (to achieve better conformity around the prostate) have been a standard of care for  
photon RT  of prostate cancer at Mayo Clinic.  
 
 [ADDRESS_747549] group reported that in the absence of a signific ant 
systemic offset, there were negligible changes in dose coverage of the pelvic nodes or 
normal tissue sparing when prostate fiducial markers were used for daily localization in 
the IMRT setting [18]. In another study, Adamczyk retrospectively evaluated the impact 
of correcting inter -fraction prostate motion upon th e dose delivered to pelvic  nodes in 28 
patients, based on 253 cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) take n during the 
radiotherapy [19]. In this study, the target (prostate) was matched based on CBCT 
imaging, and there were no fiducial markers in the prostate. Shift ing treatment fields on 
CBCT prostate matching influenced minimum, maximum, and mean dose of pelvic nodes 
in the range of 0.17% - 2.63%. At our own center, there are currently two prostate cancer 
patients receiving pencil beam proton beam therapy to the pelvic nodes  as well as to  the 
prostate. In these patients, proton beam therapy was delivered after a treatment set -up 
was established by [CONTACT_569882]. 
During the course of proton beam therapy, they had verific ation CT scans in order to  
assess  whether clinical target volumes  including the pelvic nodes  were adequately 
covered. O ne patient  had three verification CT scans and the other had one. All of the 
verification scans showed that > 95% of the clinical target volume encompassing the 
pelvic nodes receiv ed the prescription dose (45 Gy), and that the standard deviation  in the 
volume covered by 45 Gy was 1.5%. These findings as well as the aforementioned 
studies indicate that setting up the RT field  using the fiduc ial markers in the prostate or 
CBCT matching of the prostate does not significantly jeopardize a dosimetric coverage of 
the pelvic nodes , and can be utilized for the simultaneous irradiation of the prostate and 
pelvic nodes.   
 
In the proposed study, high p recision RT techniques using pencil beam proton therapy  
and daily on -line targeting of the prostate and pelvic nodal region  are employed to ensure 
the accurate delivery of radiation to the intended targets, while minimizing the dose to the 
adjacent normal organs (such as bladder, rectum, and small bowel). The goal of these 
precision RT techniques is to minimize the risk of radiation toxicity as much as possible. 
Proton beam therapy  provides a dosimetric advantage, in comparison with photon RT, 
since it depo sits the bulk of its e nergy to the target  while delivering minimal dose to 
healthy tissues around the  target. The delivery of proton beam therapy  is further refined 
by [CONTACT_569883] e to the depth and contour of the tumor, thus further reducing unnecessary 
radiation to the surrounding healthy tissues. Daily on -line targeting of the intended 
targets is achieved with two independent methods: 1. Carbon fiducial markers implanted 
into the  prostate, which can be visualized on an onboard imaging. Using the carbon 
markers as a surrogate for prostate position, the treatment field is adjusted daily to be 
aligned with the  position of the carbon markers in order  to ensure that the prostate is in 
the proper treatment coord inates. 2. L imited computed tomography  imaging  to confirm 
that the prostate and pelvic nodal chains are within the planning target volume s. 
Computed tomography  imaging  allows a volumetric conformation that the prostate and 
pelvic nodes are within the planning target volume s.

cancer) . 
 
7.1. Proton beam therapy  
 
 7.1.1  Treatment planning  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS].  Preparation prior to sim ulation  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_747555] simulation, a total of four carbon 
markers are implanted into the prostate gland (two in the left and two i n the right 
lobe of the prostate gland) , via transperineal approach , under a transrectal 
ultrasoun d guidance  by a radiologist . These implanted carbon markers are used 
for daily image -guided proton beam therapy . 
 
Bladder preparation: A patient is to void one hour before simulation or treatment . 
Right after voiding, he  drinks 250 or 500 mL ( 8.5 or 16.9 o z) of water ov er the 
following [ADDRESS_747556] simulation 
or treatment. This systemic approach is to minimize day -to-day variation of 
bladder volume as much as possible.  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS].  Simulation  
A planni ng CT scan  will be  performed with a  patient in supin e position. A 
custom vacuum loc k bag is to be used for immobilization during simulation and 
treatment.  It should be built up around the patient’s feet to reduce the variation in 
foot rotation. An indexed knee cushion  may be added to the setup, if desired.   
 
An inflated endorectal balloon is  optional, and can be  used for prostate 
immobilization. An endorectal balloon is  to be  inflated with [ADDRESS_747557] (consisting of 5 mL Gastroview mixed with 95 mL norma l saline). At 
the time of CT simulation, the insertion depth of endorectal balloon will be  
recorded at the level of anal verge. The same insertion depth will be  applied 
when an endorectal balloon is inserted during the course of proton beam therapy .  
 
Blad der contrast may or may not be used at the time of CT simulation at the 
discretion of attending physician. When bladder contrast is to be used, the

 following steps are to be taken: (1) Insert a Foley catheter into the bladder, (2) 
Drain 40 -50 mL of urine, (3) Replace the drained amount of urine with the same 
volume of diluted contrast (made of 5 mL of Omnipaque mixed with 55 mL of 
sterile water) into the bladder via a Foley catheter, (4) Remove the Foley catheter 
thereafter .   
 
A bla dder scanner will be  used to measure  a bladder volume at the time of CT 
simulation.  The target bladder volume  to be achieved  at the time of MR 
simulation  and during the course of proton beam  therapy will be  the measured 
volume  at the time of CT simulation +/ - 25%.  
 
CT simulation scanning will be  performed from immediately above the iliac 
crests through at least th e ischial tuberosities with [ADDRESS_747558] simulation is completed, MRI  of the pelvis  (MR simulation) will 
be obtained with the same set -up described above. No contrast  should  be used for 
bladder or an  endorectal balloon. When an endorectal balloon is used, it should 
be inflated with n ormal saline  (100 mL) . MR imaging will be  fused with the 
planning CT imaging, using the implanted carbon marker s as references.   
  
  [IP_ADDRESS].  Target volumes  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS].1  Clinical target volume  (CTV)  
 
 There are two clinical target volumes : CTV1 and CTV2.  
 
 CTV1 is the prostate plus  a portion of or entire seminal vesicles. The 
 extent of seminal vesicles to be incl uded in CTV1 is at the judgement of 
 the attending physician and based on clinical and pathologic features of a 
 given malignancy.  
 
CTV2 is the regional pelvic nodes.  CTV2 includes the obturator,  external 
iliac, proximal internal iliac and common iliac n odes,  up to a level 
corresponding to the sacral promontory so that most of the common iliac 
nodes are included . Please refer to the pelvic nodal atlas  at the RTOG 
Web site (Pelvic Lymph  Node Volumes for Prostate Cancer Atlas;  
 The presacral nodes from the sacral promontory  to S3 may be 
included, depending on whether the  dose constraints to t he rectum are 
achievable . The inferior extent of the  external iliac lymph nodes is 
generally at the top of the femoral heads. The inferior extent of the  
obturator lymph nodes is generally at the top of t he symphysis pubis. 
CTV2  will include a  7 mm margin i n 3-dimensions to the  iliac vessels , 
and a 10 mm margin anteriorly fr om the anterior sacral bone for 
prescaral  nodes . Adjacent normal org ans (such as small bowel, large 
bowel, bladder, and rectum), pelvi c mu sculature, and bones are carved 
out from CTV 2. 
 
 [IP_ADDRESS].2.  Internal target volume (ITV)  

 16  MC1651  
 
 
 
  ITV is an additional margin around  CTV to ensure  proper dose coverage 
 of CTV, given changes in the dose distribution caused by [CONTACT_569884].  
  
 ITV1 : CTV 1 + 4-5 mm expan sion for superior, inferior, anterior , and 
 posterior  directions,  and 5-6 mm expansion i n the lateral direction.  
 
 ITV2: CTV2 + 5 mm expansion in all directions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Optimization target volume (O TV): A volume constructed by a    
  dosimetrist under the guidance of a physicist.  The OTV is a vo lume used 
  by [CONTACT_8235] -planning -dose-optimization algorithm to ensure that the  
  ITVs and CTV s are trea ted with a planned radiation  dose.  It includes  
  set-up and range uncertainties of 3 mm and 3 %, respectively. The OTV  
  is to provide a robust  coverage of CTV and ITV. The evaluation of a  
  proton plan is based on a robust coverage of CTV and ITV.  The OTV  
  should not be considered when evaluating the treatment plan.  
  [IP_ADDRESS]    Normal Critical Structures  
 
Normal critical structures to be de fined on the treatment planning CT scan 
include the  bladder, rectum,  large bowel, small bowel,  bilateral femora (to the 
level of ischial tuberosity), penile bulb, and skin. The structures  will be 
contoured and considered as solid organs. The bladder should  be contoured from 
its base to the dome, and the rectum from the anus (at the level of the ischia l 
tuberosity ) to the  rectosigmoid flexure. Any small bowel within the primary 
beam aperture should be def ined. Please refer to  the RTOG web site  
 view  the normal pelvis atlas for examples of target and normal tissue 
contours.  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]   Treatment planning for critical structures  
 
Plan quality and accepta bility will be assessed in ac cordance to  dose-volume 
histogram (DVH) parameters of target volumes and organs at risk (OAR)  using 
the constraints shown in the following Table .

For purposes of compliance, up to a 5% absolute increase in the volume of 
critical structure receiving a specified dose (or higher) will be considered 
acceptable and called “ minor deviation”. When there is a ≥ 5%  absolute increase 
in the volume of critical s tructure receiving a  specified dose  (or higher), it  will be 
consid ered unacceptable and called a “ major deviation”.  [Example: rectum 
V66Gy < 14% , but > 9%:  minor deviation; rectum V66Gy ≥ 14% major 
deviatio n]  
 
Of note, the penile bulb constraint is to be regarded as a guideline, and adherence 
to this should not, in any way, result in a reduction of the prescription dose or a 
compromised dose coverage of  the target volume.  
 
The deviations in dose constraints  described above are considered planning 
deviations only and will not constitute protocol deviations. Treatment plans that 
include minor planning deviations may be delivered as part of this protocol. 
Treatment plans that include major planning deviations m ay be delivered on this 
protocol with the  review and approval of  the attending physician  prior to 
treatment . All relevant DVH data regarding doses to critical structures  will be 
maintained in the study database for analysis.  
 
7.1.2  Target Dose  
 
 A prescrib ed dose of 67.5 Gy in 25 fractions (2.7 Gy per fraction per day, 5 days a week) 
 is delivered to ITV1, while ITV2 is concurrently treated to a dose of 45 Gy in 25 
 fractions (1.8 Gy per fraction).  
   
7.1.3   Treatment Administration  
 
  An optimal , pencil be am, proton therapy  plan is pr epared  to achieve proper dose   
  coverage of I TVs. Plan quality and acceptability is assessed, based on dose -volume  
  histogram parameters of target volumes and organs at risk.  
 
7.1.4 Treatment localization and verification   
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]   Patient set -up for daily proton beam therapy  is identical to the CT 
 simulation set -up, including bladder preparation and the application of 
 endorectal balloon , if used . An endorectal balloon is inflated  with 100 
 mL of normal saline  (or, if necessa ry, diluted contrast consisting of 10 
 mL Gastroview mixed with 90 mL normal saline).  
 
   [IP_ADDRESS]  On-line target localizati on and image -guided proton beam therapy : 
 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_747559] anted, intra -prostatic,   
 carbon  markers (from an on -board imager) should be used to   
 20  MC1651  
 
 
 
  confirm the treatment set -up and to account for inter -fraction   
 motion. A patient’s position should be adjusted, using the   
 fiducial markers as references.  
   
   [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_747560] 5 treatments and then t wice  
weekly (every Monday  and Thursday) thereafter.   
 
7.[ADDRESS_747561] of care, adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy is added to proton 
beam therapy  for 2 -3 years for high risk prostate cancer, and 4 -6 months  for intermediate 
risk pr ostate cancer. Androgen deprivation th erapy  usually starts  2 mo nths prior to the 
beginning of proton beam therapy . It consists of  bicalutamide 50 mg PO once daily for 2 -
16 weeks (given a t the start of androgen deprivation  therapy) and a LHRH agonist 
(gosereline or leuprolide). The first inje ction of a LHRH a gonist is usually given within 7  
days after the initiation of bicalutamide.  
 
8.0  Radiotherapy Dose  Modification s Based on Adverse Events   
With judicious use of ancillary treatment (see Section 9.0) and/or treatment interruption, it is 
anticipated that a dose reduction  should rarely be necessary. This study has no pre -specified dose 
reduction  due to adverse events.  However , if adverse event s are severe enough that 
administration of full dose is considered co ntraindicated by [CONTACT_569885], 
the study chair should be notified . 
Treatment interruption(s) are permitted only when radiation -related adverse event s are not 
reduced to an acceptable level with the use of ancillary treatment (see Section 9.0),  or when acute 
grade ≥3 AEs occur. The reason(s) for the interruption must be documented. The duration of 
treatment interrupti on should be minimized, but proton beam therapy  should not resume until AEs 
are grade <3.  
 
9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care  
 
Suppo rtive measures s uch as antiemetic or antidiarrheal medications, steroid -containing topi[INVESTIGATOR_85127], topi[INVESTIGATOR_569864] (e.g., phenazopyridine HCl) or anti -spasmodic (e.g., α -
adrenergic blockers) agents may be administered in accordance with man ufacturer 
recommendations as deemed necessary.  
 
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
10.[ADDRESS_747562] (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  - Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  
Serious problems/events can be well defined and include;  

 21  MC1651  
 
 
 
 • death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569865], RT s ide effects or 
problem due to prostate carcinoma  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant birth defect/anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events tha t in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_569866], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, 
or substantially compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be 
regarded as non-serious adverse events.   
 
Unanticipated Problems I nvolving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  - Any 
unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious  problems or events that result  in significant harm, 
(which may be physical, psychological, financial, soc ial, economic, or 
legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals 
who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life 
threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disabilit y/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth 
defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, 
events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim 
findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_569867], safety, or welfare of the 
subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not 
already described as potential risk s in the protocol, consent document,  or 
not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" 
when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at a n 
increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the 
research procedures.  
 
Preexisting Condition - A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of 
the study.  A preexisting conditio n should be recorded as an adverse event if the 
frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study 
period. At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as 
a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
 22  MC1651  
 
 
 
  10.2 Recording Adverse Events  
 
  CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales  
found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_747563] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the  
CTCAE ver sion 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site:  
 
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_747564] be reported as an 
expedited report (see Section 10.3 ). 
 
  10.2.2 Assessment of Attribution  
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment 
or procedure, the foll owing attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s).  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
  
10.[ADDRESS_747565] the study participant and then complete the Study 
Adverse Event Worksheet and log.  The sponsor -investigator will evaluate the 
event and determine the necessary follow -up and reporting required.  
 
Serious Adverse Event s will be reported as part of regular adverse event reporting 
mechanisms via the data capture system and lo gged for review reporting.  
 
10.3.1 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Mayo IRB:  
 
The IRB requirements reflect the guidance documents released by t he 
Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in early 2007 and are respectively entitled 
“Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems 
Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events” and  “Guidance 
for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs: Adverse Event Reporting – 
Improving Human Subject Protection.”  
 
10.3. 1.1 According to Mayo IRB Policy any serious adverse event 
(SAE) which the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_569868] 

 [ADDRESS_747566] learns of the problem/event.  
10.3.1 .2 Non-UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] – the investigator reports problems or 
events that do NOT meet criteria of an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_569869]. 
The investigator monitors the severity and frequency of 
subsequent non -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104].  
 
Consider the following information to collect when developi[INVESTIGATOR_569870].  
Example  
Information collected on the adverse event worksheet (and entered in the 
research database):  
• Subject’s name:  
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relationship  of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, 
or intervention):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity 
scale 1 -5) 
• If any intervention was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was the incident r esolved spontaneously, or after 
discontinuing treatment ?) 
• Date of Resolution:  
 
The investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if 
specific reports need to be made to the IRB and FDA.  The investigator 
will sign and date the adverse eve nt report when it is reviewed.  For this 
protocol, only directly related SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_569871].  
 
10.4 CTCAE v4.0 is used for the following AE s to be graded at each evaluation and

The trial will be reviewed by [CONTACT_569887] a bi -
annual or yearly basis , dependent on random study selection . Accrual, 
adverse events, and any endpoint problems  will be assessed . Any safety 
issues requ iring protocol changes will be communicated through protocol 
amendments.   
 
 
11.0 Treatment Evaluation  
 
11.1 No evidence of disease : No clinical evidence of tumor recurrence including the 
freedom from biochemical (PSA) failure  (Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
 
11.2.  Recurr ence of disease:  The site of recurrence will be collected , and classified as 
biochemical failure , local  recurrence, regional  recurrence and/or distant 
recurrence.   
 
11.2.1  Biochemical (PS A) failure: PSA nadir is  defined as the lowest PSA value reached 
after completion of treatment . Biochemical failure is defined as a PSA value that 
is ≥ PSA nadir + 2.0 ng/mL with the date of biochemical failure set at the date of 
the PSA value that meets this criterion.  
 
11.2.2  Local recurrence: Local recurrence is define d when  one or more  of the 
following s occur:  (1) ureteric obstruction at the level of the ureterovesical 
junction; urethral obstruction that r equires prostatic resection (with resected 
tissue demonstrating  prostatic adenocarcinoma) or urinary diversion; or  
hematuria due to prostate cancer progress ion, (2 ) positiv e prostate biopsy at ≥ 24 
months  from the completion of protocol treatment  (3) ≥ 20% increase in   the 
longest diameter of a target lesion in the prostate gla nd (for patients with a 
measurable  target lesion at baseline), or a new lesion measuring ≥ 1 cm sh ort axis 
during follow -up (for patients with non -measurable  lesion at baseline) in the 
setting of biochemical failure  
 
 26  MC1651  
 
 
 
 11.2.3  Regional recurrence: Development of  nodal metastasis in the pelvis which 
is defined as a new regional pelvic node that was normal  at baseline (< 1.0 
cm short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis during follow -up. 
Confirmation by [CONTACT_569888].   
 
11.2.4  Distant recurrence: D evelopment of nodal metastasis  outside  the pelvis,  
 or a hematogenous (e.g., osseous, hepatic, etc.) lesion. Confirmat ion by  
[CONTACT_569888] .  
 
11.2.5  Disease -free survival : Disease -free survival duration will be measured 
 from the date of registration to the date of biochemical, local , regional, or 
 distant recurrence  or the date of death from any cause.  
 
11.2.6  Disease -specific survival:  Disease-specific survival duration will be 
 measured from the date of registration to the date of death due to prostate 
 cancer. Death due to prostate cancer will be defined as:  
 
11.2.6 .1 Death attributed to carcinoma of the p rostate by [CONTACT_093], or  
11.2.6 .2 Death due to complications of treatment  
11.2.7  Overall survival: Survival duration will be measured from the date of 
 registration to th e date of death from any cause.  
 
12.0 Descriptive Factors  
 
12.1. Clinical tumor (T)  classification: ≤ T2 vs. ≥ T3   
12.2. Histologic  grade: Gleason score ≤  7 vs. ≥ 8  
12.3. Pre -treatment  serum PSA value: ≤  20 ng/mL vs. >20 ng/mL  
This is the PSA value obtained most immediately before the start of neoadjuvant 
androgen deprivation therapy  (see Section 7.2) .  
12.4. Patient  age: ≤70 years vs. >70 years.  
 
13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of Patient    
 
 Follow -up data  will be collected and entered in accordance to S ection 4.0. No follow -up data is 
required beyond [ADDRESS_747569] be submitted,  and collection of follow -up data will continue  in 
accordance to Section 4.0. Event monitoring will be required per Section 18.0 of 
the protocol.  
 
13.3 A patient is deemed a cancel  if he is removed from the study for any reason 
before any study treatment is given.  On -study material and the End of Active 
Treatment/Cancel Notification Form must be submitted.  No further data 
submission is necessary.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_747570] schedule until  further medical management  is implemented  at the 
discretion  of his physician.

16.1    Overview:  This Phase II study will utilize a one -stage binomial design to assess 
the rate of late grade 3 or higher GI and GU tox icities associated with a 
hypofractionation proton beam therapy  regimen for prostate cancer.   
 
16.1.1  Endpoint:   The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients 
who experience a late grade [ADDRESS_747571] begun treatment will be 
evaluable for late toxicity, with the exception of patients determined to be 
a major violation.  
 28  MC1651  
 
 
 
  
16.2  Statistical Design:  
 
16.2.1 Decision Rule: It is hy pothesized that ≤ 5% of patients will encounter  a 
late grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicity  between 3 months and 2 years  
from the completion of proton beam therapy . The proposed treatment 
strategy would be considered ineffective in this population if ≥15% o f 
patients experiences a late grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicity.  
Subsequent studies with the proposed treatment strategy may be 
considered in this patient population if ≤5% of patients experiences a late 
grade [ADDRESS_747572] the null hypothesis that the rate of 
late grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicity is ≥15%.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Final Decision Rule:  Enter [ADDRESS_747573] 51 evaluable patients experience late 
grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicity, we may recommend further 
testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this population.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are 
accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_569872].  Analyses 
involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.3 .4. 
 
16.2.2 Sample Size:  This study is expected to require a maximum of 51 
evaluable patients. We anticipate accruing 5 additional patients t o account 
for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. 
Therefore, this study is expected to accrue a maximum of 56 patients 
overall.  
 
16.2.3 Accrual Rate and Study Duration:  The anticipated accrual rate is 
approximately [ADDRESS_747574] patient has been observed for 2 
years, or at approximately 3.5 years after the study ope ns to accrual.  
 
16.2.4 Assuming that the number of late grade 3 or higher GI or GU toxicities is 
binomially distributed, with a significance level of 10%, the probability of 
declaring that the regimen warrants further studies (i.e., statistical power) 
unde r various toxicity proportions can be tabulated as a function of the 
true toxicity proportion as shown in the table below.  
 
If the true late toxicity rate is…  0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 
 29  MC1651  
 
 
 
 Then the probability of declaring 
that the regimen is promising and 
warrants  further study is…   
0.02 0.10 0.41 0.89 
 
16.2.5 Other considerations:  Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and 
patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific 
discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into  account in any 
decision to terminate the study  
 
16.3 Analysis Plan  
 
16.3.1 Primary Outcome Analyses:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition:   The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of 
patients who experience a late grade [ADDRESS_747575] begun treatment will be evaluable for late 
toxicity, with the exception of patients determined to be a major 
violation.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Estimation:   The proportion of grad e [ADDRESS_747576] binomial 95% confidence intervals for 
the toxicity proportion will be cal culated.    
 
16.3.2 Secondary Outcome Analyses:    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Disease -free survival  is defined as the time from registration until 
the time of the first occurrence of bioch emical failure (Section 
11.2. 1), local recurrence, regional recurrence , distant meta stases , 
or death due to any cause .  The distributi on of disease -free 
survival  will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier.  
The disease -free survival rate will be estimated  at 2 years and 5 
years . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Disease -specific survival is defined as th e time from registration  
until the date of death due to prostate cancer  (Section 11.2. 6). The 
distributi on of disease -specific  survival  will be estimated usi ng 
the method of Kaplan -Meier. The disease -specific  survival rate 
will be estimated at 2 years and 5 years . 
 
 30  MC1651  
 
 
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Overall survival  is defined as the time from registration until the 
death due to any cause  (Section 11.2. 7).  The distributi on of 
overall  survival  will be estimated usi ng the method of Kaplan -
Meier. The overall  survival rate will be esti mated at 2 years and 5 
years . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] An acute adverse event is defined as an adverse event that occurs 
any time between registration and 3 months after the completion of 
proton beam therapy .  The rate of  ≥ grade 3 GI or GU acute 
adverse events will be estimated by [CONTACT_328455] a ≥ 
grade [ADDRESS_747577] binomial 95% confidence intervals for 
the true rate of ≥ grade 3 GI or GU acute adverse events will be 
calculated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  A late adverse event is defined as an  adverse event that occurs 
any time between 3 months and 2 years after completion of proton 
beam therapy .   The rate of  ≥ grade 2 GI or GU late adverse events 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_328455] a ≥ grade [ADDRESS_747578] binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true rate 
of ≥ grade 2 GI or GU late adverse events will be calculated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events:  All eligible pati ents that have initiated treatment 
will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s).  
The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be 
recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to 
determine patterns.  Addition ally, the relationship of the adverse 
event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.  
Acute and late adverse events (as defined in sections 16.3 .2.2 and 
[IP_ADDRESS]) will be summarized separately.  
 
16.3.3  Correlative Analyses  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients will complete the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index 
Composite short form (EPIC -26) questionnaire at baseline and at 
the specified post-treatment  time points  as shown Section 4.0 .   
Subdomains for urinary, bowel, and sexual function will be 
evaluted at e ach time point and summarized descriptively.  
Changes across time will be evaluated to assess patient function 
and quality of life after study treatment.  
 
16.3.4 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_569873]; however, they will be included in final 
endpoint estimates and confidence intervals.  
 31  MC1651  
 
 
 
  
16.4 Data & Safety Monitoring:  
 
16.4.1 The principle investigator(s) and the stud y statistician will review the 
study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any 
endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Radiation 
Oncology Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for 
reviewing accrual a nd safety data for this trial at least once  a year, based 
on reports provided by [CONTACT_569889].  
 
16.4.2 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:   The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31920].  We note that the  
Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_569874](s) under investigation.  
The study team may choo se to suspend a ccrual if there are  unexpected 
adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporari ly suspended,  if at any time we observe events 
considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event wi th attribute specified as  “possible,” “probable,” or “definite”) that 
satisfy one of the following:  
 
• If [ADDRESS_747579] possibly related to 
treatment at any  time and after 3 months following completion of the 
protocol treatment  
 
• After the first [ADDRESS_747580] been treated: if ≥ 20% of all patients 
experience a grade [ADDRESS_747581] 
possibly related to treatment at any time  after 3 months following the 
completion of protocol treatment.  
 
In addition,  we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to 
monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatme nt-related 
adverse event.  
 
16.6   Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will be 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and Secondary 
Endpoints along with other required information for this study will be reported on 
ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of timing of the Results Reporting, the initial 
estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 3.5 years after 
the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Complet ion 
Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been 
followed for at least [ADDRESS_747582] based on 
racial groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], the sample size is not increased in order to provide 
additional power for subset analyses.  
 
16.7.3 The geographical region served by [CONTACT_569890] a 
population which includes approx imately 3% minorities.  Based on 
prior Mayo Clinic Cancer Center studies involving similar disease 
sites, we expect about 3 -5% of patients will be classified  as 
minorities by [CONTACT_277941]  100% of patients will be men. Expected sizes 
of racial by [CONTACT_569891]:

documents are kept in a secur e location that is locked and requires 
approved access.  
 
18.3. 3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection 
instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  
All missing data must be explain ed.  If a space on the CRF is left blank 
because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  
All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry e rror has 
been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the 
incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must 
be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.  For 
clarification of ill egible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above 
the item, then initial and date it.  If the reason for the correction is not 
clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include the details to justify 
the correction.

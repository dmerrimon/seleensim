Partnered 
InterventionThe partnered intervention consists of the following 4 evidence-based 
strategies: (1) written agreements of collaboration for dental screening at 
the site level; (2) culturally-tailored and language-specific adaptation of 
materials at the community and site levels; (3) demonstrations with role-
playing of proper brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing techniques 
at the site and provider levels; and (4) community health worker (CHW) 
follow-up with patients about oral health care receipt and dental hygiene 
behaviors at the family and patient levels.
Patient 
ParticipantsPatient participants refer to study participants who are also patients 
screened at the urban outreach centers. Patient participants are first 
enrolled as EHR patient participants as part of the feasibility and 
acceptability study of this form of patient tracking. A subset of the EHR 
patient participants also complete exit interviews after the intervention at 
urban outreach centers and are referred to as interview patient participants.

Title: Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention to Improve Asian 
American Health
Abstract: This feasibility and acceptability study will be conducted at [ADDRESS_114560] (EHR). The 
research staff will survey a sample of Chinese American patients 
screened at each center about their satisfaction with the partnered 
intervention and about their oral health behaviors. An additional 
sample selected from providers [dentists and community health 
workers (CHW)], research staff, [LOCATION_001] University (NYU) 
administrators, site directors, and community advisory board (CAB) 
members will participate in structured interviews about the partnered 
intervention. The remote EHR evaluation will include group adaptation 
sessions and workflow analyses via multiple recorded sessions with 
research staff, NYU administrators, outreach site directors, and 
providers (dentists and CHWs). The study will also model knowledge 
held by [CONTACT_103495]-patient participants (including CAB members) to 
evaluate and enhance the partnered intervention during and/or after 
the feasibility and acceptability study for use in future 
implementations. 
Objectives: The ultimate goal of this study is to provide information for the design 
and implementation of a larger, randomized, controlled trial of a 
participatory, multi-level, partnered intervention to improve the oral 
and general health of low-income Chinese American adults. Toward 
this end, this study has 3 objectives:
Primary:
To  evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of a 
partnered intervention designed to improve oral health for low-
income, urban Chinese American adults at 3 community sites
Secondary :
To  evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of 
using remote data entry features of electronic health record 
(EHR) software at the [LOCATION_001] University College of 
Dentistry (NYU Dentistry) to enter patient information at 3 
Chinese American community sites

_____________________________________________________________________________________________To  model knowledge held by [CONTACT_105]-patient participants about 
factors that influence access to oral health care and care-
seeking behaviors among low-income, urban Chinese 
American adults, in order to enhance the intervention during 
and/or after the study for use in future implementations
Population: For the entire study, we plan to enroll a total of 182 human subjects: 
150 patient participants and 32 non-patient participants.
As we are utilizing a community-based participatory research (CBPR) 
approach, several different populations/units of analysis are included 
in this feasibility and acceptability (F & A) study. 
In accordance with CBPR principles, we will establish a community 
advisory board (CAB) comprised of 8 members to guide all aspects of 
the study.
The research staff (n = 10) is comprised of the 3 Multiple Principal 
Investigators (MPIs) (Drs. Northridge, Trinh-Shevrin, and Metcalf), the 
3 Co-Investigators (Co-Is) at the [LOCATION_001] University School of 
Medicine (NYU Medicine) (Drs. Troxel, Islam, and Yi), [ADDRESS_114561] 
Coordinators (TBN), and 2 modelers ([CONTACT_103521] and TBN).
The NYU administrators (n = 3) include both Co-Is at NYU Dentistry 
(Drs.
 Schenkel and Wolff) and an IT Specialist ([CONTACT_103522]).
The providers (n = 8) include faculty dentists at NYU Dentistry who 
participate in local community outreach events (n = 6) and bilingual 
(English and Mandarin Chinese) CHWs (n = 2).
Outreach site directors at each of 3 participating community outreach 
centers (n = 3) serving low-income Chinese American populations in 
[LOCATION_001], NY.
EHR patient participants.  At least 50 low-income Chinese American 
adult patients will undergo a dental screening at each of 3 community 
outreach centers (n = 150) and have their data remotely entered into 
the NYU Dentistry EHR. 
Interview patient participants.  Approximately 30 Chinese American 
patients screened at each of 3 community outreach centers will be 
enrolled in the study as participants (n = 90) to complete interviews 
about their satisfaction with the partnered intervention and their use of 
dental services and evidence-based oral health behaviors.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________2 INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
2.[ADDRESS_114569] growing minority group in the [LOCATION_002], yet are 
rarely included in oral health care research. The Center for the Study of Asian American 
Health (CSAAH) at the [LOCATION_001] University School of Medicine (NYU Medicine) is the 
only National Institute for Minority Health & Health Disparities Center of Excellence in 
the [LOCATION_002] solely dedicated to research and evaluation on Asian American health 
and health disparities. A Chinese Community Health Resources and Needs 
Assessment conducted by [CONTACT_103497]. 
Chinese are the largest Asian ethnic group in [LOCATION_001], NY, with higher poverty rates 
for working age and older adults relative to all residents and a higher proportion of 
foreign-born residents. NYU College of Dentistry (NYU Dentistry) and NYU Medicine 
have partnered on community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiatives to 
improve oral health and health care in Sikh American community-based settings using 
CHW models. 
Interventions often fail or even worsen the problems they are intended to solve due to a 
lack of understanding of real world structures and dynamic complexity. In longstanding 
collaboration with the University at Buffalo Department of Geography (UB Geography), 
our research team has examined how factors at multiple levels contribute to oral health 
and care-seeking behaviors for racial and ethnic minority older adults. To improve our 
mental models of the real world, we have employed system science methodologies 
such as system dynamics, agent-based modeling, geographic information science, and 
social network simulation. 
The 2011 report by [CONTACT_103498], Improving Access to  Oral Health 
Care for Vulnerable and Underserved Populations is based on the following 2 well-
established and evidence-based principles: (1) Oral health is an integral part of overall 
health and, therefore, oral health care is an essential component of comprehensive 
health care. (2) Oral health promotion and disease prevention are essential to any 
strategies aimed at improving access to care. Our long-term goal is to improve Asian 
American health. 
2.2 Rationale

and the process of implementing remote EHR data entry and tracking in diverse 
Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention Version 1.0
9 December 2017
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________________Chinese American community outreach sites are guided by 2 complementary, multi-
level frameworks: Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and 
Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF). Specifically, CFIR provides a menu of 
constructs that have been associated with effective implementation and have been used 
in a range of applications, whereas IOF is clear in distinguishing implementation, 
service, and patient outcomes. In other words, while IOF provides an evaluation 
framework that organizes the multiple facets that affect implementation of new 
interventions, CFIR provides a framework for understanding the multiple domains that 
influence implementation and adoption of these interventions. Because our proposed 
intervention is both multi-level and dynamic with numerous involved constructs, we 
intend to model knowledge about factors at the community, site, provider, family, and 
patient levels to improve oral health using a participatory group modeling approach.
This feasibility and acceptability study will make a vital contribution by [CONTACT_103499]. This information 
may be used to inform the design and implementation of a larger, randomized, 
controlled trial of the intervention to improve the oral and general health of low-income 
Chinese American adults and to identify the mechanisms by [CONTACT_103500].  
2.3 Potential  Risks and Benefits
2.3.1 Potential  Risks
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103480] (see Section16), patient data may be at a 
higher risk for computer hacking, leading to a loss of medical record confidentiality.
2.3.2 Potential  Benefits
Outreach center clients/patients may benefit from the intervention, including the 
translated and culturally customized literature, by [CONTACT_103501]-daily dental hygiene using evidence-based products and procedures.  
Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention Version 1.[ADDRESS_114570] this end, this study has 3 objectives.
3.1 Study  Objectives
Primary:
To evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of a partnered 
intervention designed to improve oral health for low-income, urban Chinese 
American adults at 3 community sites
Secondary :
To evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of using remote entry 
features of electronic health record (EHR) software at NYU Dentistry to enter 
patient information at 3 Chinese American community sites. Note that the remote 
EHR referenced throughout this protocol will be set up and managed by [CONTACT_103502], under the direction of Drs. Wolff and 
Perelman.
To model knowledge held a priori by [CONTACT_105]-patient participants about factors that 
influence access to oral health care and care-seeking behaviors among low-
income, urban Chinese American adults, in order to enhance the intervention 
during and/or after the study for use in future implementations

simulations to represent dynamics at multiple levels (patient, family, provider, 
site, and community). 
The  simulation modeling platform is a research product of the study that will be 
used to experiment with strategies to promote preventive care through  regular 
dental visits and self-efficacy among Chinese Americans.
Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention Version 1.[ADDRESS_114571] (EHR). The evaluation will include 
group adaptation sessions and workflow analyses of the EHR implementation, involving 
multiple recorded sessions with NYU administrators, providers (dentists and CHWs), 
outreach site directors, and research staff. The study will also model a priori knowledge 
held by [CONTACT_105]-patient participants to evaluate and enhance the intervention during and/or 
after the study for use in future implementations.  
Approximately 50 patient participants who self-identify as Chinese American from each 
of 3 center (n = 150) will be consented to allow the entry of their data (e.g., demographic 
information, medical history, receipt of oral health care visits, dental hygiene behaviors, 
and health and health care measures) into the remote EHR by [CONTACT_103504] (EHR patient participants). Of these 150 EHR patient participants, 
research staff will survey approximately 30 Chinese American patient participants from 
each of 3 outreach centers (n = 90) regarding their satisfaction with the intervention 
components (interview patient participants). The study team will also evaluate feedback 
from approximately 32 non-patient participants selected from the following groups: 
research staff, CAB members, outreach site directors, NYU administrators, and 
providers (dentists and CHWs); these individuals will be interviewed about various 
aspects of the partnered intervention and/or the remote EHR implementation process 
and/or their a priori  knowledge of factors that influence access to oral health care and 
care-seeking behaviors among low-income, urban Chinese American adults.

6.1 Administration  of Intervention
Initially a CAB will be established to guide all aspects of the study. 
Partnered intervention:  Our partnering package of interventions builds upon the 
evidence-based practices of the NYU Dentistry Local Community Outreach Programs 
and the results of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_103481], and aligns with the 
implementation strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change 
(EPIC) project. We will work closely with the directors of [ADDRESS_114578] been found to be 
effective in providing dental education and counseling, leading interactive 
demonstrations of brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing, and improving access 
to dental care through dental coverage enrollment and linkage to local dentists.
Development of culturally-tailored and language-specific materials:  The  CAB will be 
responsible for reviewing existing program materials as an integral part of adapting 
them for the local Chinese American population. This will entail a multi-step process. 
Existing English and simplified Mandarin Chinese language materials will be presented 
to the CAB. [CONTACT_103529] will then lead a guided discussion structured around the 4 P’s of 
social marketing. For product, CAB members will be asked if the materials encourage 
prevention of oral conditions through regular dental visits and brushing with fluoride 
toothpaste. For price, CAB members will be asked how much it will cost a person to 
take on the desired behaviors in terms of time and effort, not merely dollars and cents. 
For place, CAB members will be asked to help compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] a list of local dental providers in 
addition to NYU Dentistry who provide culturally-tailored and language-specific oral 
health care to Chinese American families. For promotion, CAB members will be asked 
to identify other Chinese American community change agents to promote the program 
through word of mouth, social media, and neighborhood venues. CAB input will also be 
sought on incorporating appropriate imagery and cultural beliefs regarding oral health in 
the Chinese American community. This guidance will then be used to adapt both print 
and online materials. Finally, the adapted materials will be presented back to the CAB to 
ensure their input was accurately captured.

health promotion with the Chinese American community, and are bilingual in English 
and Mandarin Chinese (the primary dialect of participating community outreach sites). 
Specifically, the project CHWs were previously trained in a core competency program 
that employed diverse training methods, guided by [CONTACT_103508]. We will further train the project CHWs in the oral health 
promotion demonstration protocol and on oral health services and programs available at 
local clinics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. The investigative team and CAB members will also collect, 
assess, and deliver to the CHWs updated information regarding health and dental 
insurance and access to oral health programs available for low-income and immigrant 
communities. NYU Dentistry investigators and staff will train the CHWs using models on 
evidence-based oral health practices, stressing the importance of drinking fluoridated 
water and brushing teeth for [ADDRESS_114580] compliance.

affected by, their oral health (Yes / No checklist) and a brief 
questionnaire on self-reported receipt of a dental visit in the past 
year and dental hygiene behaviors (Oral Health Survey).  These 
questions
 will be based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Oral Health Questionnaire for Adults: (1) How often do you clean 
your teeth? (Never, Once a month, 2-3 times a month, Once a 
week, 2-6 times a week, Once a day, Twice or more a day); (2) Do 
you use any of the following to clean your teeth? (Toothbrush, 
Wooden toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_103483], Plastic toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_103483], Thread (dental floss), 
Charcoal, Chewstick / miswak, Other (Please specify); (3) For 
those who nominate Toothbrush: What type of toothbrush do you 
use? (Hard-bristled, Medium-bristled, Soft-bristled) (4) Do you use 
toothpaste to clean your teeth? (5) For those who nominate 
Toothpaste, Do you use a toothpaste that contains fluoride? 
Correct responses to all 5 questions will indicate that EHR patient 
participants are following the guidance of the American Dental 
Association (ADA) on brushing with fluoride toothpaste. These 
measures will be collected in person via self-report to ascertain 
baseline status at the beginning of each screening event and 
scanned directly into the NYU Dentistry remote EHR customized for 
community outreach events. 
oAn  NYU Dentistry faculty dentist will conduct a head and neck / oral 
examination on each EHR patient participant and directly enter the 
results into the customized EHR
The  dentist will review the examination results with the EHR patient 
participant using a customized walkout statement with screening results 
and follow-up notes and answer any questions regarding oral health 
concerns
CHW  Initial Intervention:  Trained CHWs will deliver a culturally-tailored 
and language-specific oral health promotion program focusing on 
demonstrations with role-playing of proper brushing with fluoride 
toothpaste and flossing techniques. They will also provide culturally 
customized literature to the patients.
Acceptability  Data Collection:  Research staff will conduct a  brief exit 
interview with each interview patient participant regarding acceptability of 
Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention Version 1.[ADDRESS_114582] her/his regular dental provider regarding receipt of a 
follow-up dental visit and providing a voucher worth $205.00 for oral health 
care at NYU Dentistry to cover her/his comprehensive oral examination, 
treatment plan, and prophylaxis at no charge and with no co-payment 
required.  The questions for this survey will be based on our previous oral 
health promotion program in the Sikh American community to assess 
acceptability. Prior to finalizing the survey for distribution to the interview 
patient participants, CAB members and research staff will adapt the 
questions as deemed appropriate for the Chinese American community 
and to be consistent with the ADA guidance on brushing with fluoride 
toothpaste.
Feasibility  Data Collection:  We will also develop a checklist  of 10 key 
components based on process (e.g., patient engagement) and the  
curriculum (e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722]) and ask if each one was covered. 
Endorsement of [ADDRESS_114583] items (80%) by [CONTACT_11339]-patient 
participants will be considered as the bar for success for feasibility. Finally, 
we will allow for open-ended collection of feedback on the feasibility of 
each of the partnered program components.

Data Collection)
CHW  follow-up of oral health care receipt and dental hygiene behaviors will occur 
at approximately 1 month (window of -7 days to +1 month) after the partnered 
intervention. This contact [CONTACT_103509]. 
Feasibility  Data Collection:  During this contact, the CHWs will assess whether or 
not each interview patient participant has received or  has scheduled a dental 
visit. The CHWs will also inquire about use of fluoride toothpaste and frequency 
of teeth brushing since the last visit in a modified Oral Health Survey.
If  no visit has occurred or been scheduled, the CHW will offer to help schedule a 
dental visit for the interview patient participant or her/his family members at NYU

8.1 Study  Procedures/Evaluations
8.1.[ADDRESS_114586] a workflow analysis, adapted from the Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality (AHRQ) recommendations on workflow assessments, which 
includes:
1. Direct  entry of patient demographic and appointment (site) information into 
the EHR by [CONTACT_103510] (PSRs) or other authorized users;
2. Ability  to scan patient medical history (plus baseline oral health measures of 
self-reported receipt of a dental visit in the past year and brushing with 
fluoride toothpaste as recommended) directly into a designated SCREENING 
folder, followed by [CONTACT_103511];
3. MiFi  (Wi-Fi hotspot) configuration to each specific laptop (electronic tablet) 
that will only allow EHR access to the matching laptop (tablet);
4. Multiple  layers of security embedded to comply with all applicable policies;
5. Dual  authentication process through Citrix via NYU active directory followed 
by [CONTACT_103512];
6. Direct  entry of screening results into the EHR by [CONTACT_103513]; and
7. Customized walkout statements for interview patient participants with 
screening results and follow-up notes.
A matrix  will be created with 3 categories: people, documents, and information content. 
The group adaptation session will be guided by a user-centered design facilitation 
protocol that sequentially leads the group through presentation of specific remote EHR 
use cases that include variations on the original EHR data entry screens adapted to the 
workflow characteristics of local community sites. For each presented use case, the 
group discussion will focus on the workflow at the site around the role responsibilities 
(people), documents, and information content (patient medical history, self-reported 
outcome measures, head and neck / oral examination results) with regard to reviewing 
customized EHR protocols based on the findings. The discussion will be digitally 
recorded and each non-patient participant will be given color-coded response sheets to 
record their perspectives on how to enhance the usefulness of the customized EHR 
protocols within the community outreach site setting. The digital recordings and 
response sheets will then be processed, summarized, and converted into adaptation 
recommendations by [CONTACT_3476]. Next, the study team will transform the 
recommendations into proposed revisions and document them in revised standard

adapted workflow integration approach.
8.1.2 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103484]-usability: In order to account for real world conditions, the 
intervention will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_103485] 3 Chinese American outreach sites. Early formative 
observations / short interviews will be conducted with dental teams at each of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_103486]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_103487], uncover any new usability problems, and identify any educational 
needs to be included before large-scale implementation. As providers at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_103488], live-usability testing will be conducted, consisting of direct 
observations by [CONTACT_5051]. Live usability is ideal for observing the impact of 
new tools on real setting workflows and for observing alternative workflows that can be 
missed during simulations.
8.1.3 Semi-structured  interviews regarding the remote EHR and partnered 
intervention
Semi-structured interviews will be conducted  with participating dentists, CHWs and 
other non-patient participants in administrative and technical roles after the intervention. 
We anticipate conducting approximately 20 interviews before obtaining data saturation. 
The interviews will be informed by [CONTACT_103514] (CFIR) and Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF) constructs and will 
assess specific barriers to sustaining the partnered intervention and strategies for 
addressing those barriers to facilitate integration of the intervention into the routine 
workflow of the NYU Dentistry Local Community Outreach Programs.
In addition  to survey questions, acceptability will also be assessed using open-ended 
questions, such as: 
• Please  tell us what you liked most about the program.
• Please  tell us what you did not like about the program.
• Please  tell us what changes can be made to improve the program.
• Overall program satisfaction (scale of 1-10 answer range)
• How  did you feel about the topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722]?

by [CONTACT_103515]. These simulation models will be designed using a multi-method 
approach, in which principles of system dynamics (SD) are used to incorporate 
feedback effects and delays through stocks that accumulate flows (rates of change over 
time). The SD approach will be integrated with an agent-based modeling (ABM) 
framework that is used to appropriately represent dynamics at the community, site,

Modeling to anticipate effects of interventions. The models in  this platform will simulate 
implications of hypotheses elicited a priori (before implementation of the partnered 
intervention) from non-patient participants. The a priori model platform will enable 
comparison to models that are later developed with hindsight from implementation of 
the remote EHR and partnered interventions. This model platform will therefore test the 
relative effectiveness of the interventions as anticipated under these a priori 
assumptions. Toward this end, this effort will involve design of scopi[INVESTIGATOR_103489] a baseline for simulating access at the community level and care-seeking 
behaviors at the individual level. 
A participatory  SD modeling process will be undertaken via a group model-building 
workshop held with non-patient participants as well as semi-structured interviews with 
individual non-patient participants to elicit targeted model input and feedback on 
assumptions. The UB Geography Systems Science Modeling Team will work closely 
with non-patient participants to devise indices for input parameters and indicators for 
outcomes of simulation experiments. In addition to informing the design of model 
structures, this participatory approach will enable non-patient participants to better

9.1 Specification  of Safety Parameters
Safety monitoring for this study will focus on unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects, including unanticipated problems that meet the definition of a serious adverse 
event. 
9.1.1 Unanticipated  Problems
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;
related  or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and
suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.
9.1.2 Unanticipated  Problem Reporting to IRB and NIDCR
Incidents or events  that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the 
creation and completion of an unanticipated problem report form. OHRP recommends 
that investigators include the following information when reporting an adverse event, or 
any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB:
appropriate  identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, 
investigator’s name, and the IRB project number;
a  detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
an  explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, 
experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem; 
a  description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have 
been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem.
Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention Version 1.0
9 December 2017
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________________To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported 
using the following timeline:  
Unanticipated  problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the 
IRB and to NIDCR within 1 week of the investigator becoming aware of the 
event. 
Any  other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and to NIDCR within 
2 weeks of the investigator becoming aware of the problem. 
All  unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials 
(as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting 
agency head (or designee), and OHRP within one month of the IRB’s receipt of 
the report of the problem from the investigator.

12.1 Study Hypotheses
Primary:  Based on exit interviews,  patient participants in the program will be satisfied 
with the partnered intervention components.  
12.2 Sample  Size Considerations
No formal sample size estimates were performed for this F & A study. The bar for 
success for both feasibility and acceptability is 80% of enrolled patient participants 
report being satisfied or very satisfied with the partnered intervention components.
12.3 Planned  Interim Analyses (if applicable)
Because this is a feasibility  study, there will be interim reviews of interview data in order 
to modify aspects of the partnered intervention and the remote EHR processes during 
the course of the study.
12.3.[ADDRESS_114590] retrospective 
evaluation design. In this format, all questions will be asked in a single exit interview, 
but where applicable, will use the phrasing, “Prior to the beginning of the program…” 
followed by, “At the present time…” Table 3 lists the questions/domains we will use, and 
expected % changes we hypothesize we will observe in the current study. The percent 
change from pre-post will be compared using t-tests for proportions. Given that many of 
the answer choices are non-binary, we will also compare the shift of responses from 
pre-post across the categories of response using chi-squared tests. Note that this is not 
an exhaustive list of questions that will be asked; we are simply highlighting those 
questions that we will use to quantify acceptability. The full planned questionnaire is 
attached.
Health care utilization  and oral health promotion measures:  Our  ultimate health care 
utilization measure of interest is receipt of a dental visit within the last 12 months. This 
will be measured using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) definition, where 
dental visit refers to care by [CONTACT_103516]. This will allow for 
Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention Version 1.[ADDRESS_114591] year. 
Our central oral health promotion measure is self-reported brushing of teeth for 2 
minutes twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste at the 
interview patient participant’s [ADDRESS_114592] 12 months.
Table 3 provides the measures and definitions of the oral health promotion, self-

The MPIs will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set 
forth in The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of 
Human Subjects of Research, as drafted by [CONTACT_103517] (April 18, 1979) 
and codified in 45 CFR Part 46 and/or the ICH E6.

The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all patient participant 
and non-patient participant materials will be submitted to the IRB for review and 
approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be obtained before 
any patient participant or non-patient participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the 
protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_87615].  
15.3 Informed  Consent Process
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to 
participate in the study and continues throughout study participation. Extensive 
discussion of risks and possible benefits of study participation will be provided to patient 
participants and their families, if applicable. A consent form describing in detail the study 
procedures and risks will be given to the patient participant in English or Mandarin 
Chinese (primary dialect of participating community sites). Consent forms will be IRB-
approved, and the patient participant is required to read and review the document or 
have the document read to him or her. The investigator or designee will explain the 
research study to the patient participant and answer any questions that may arise. The 
patient participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any study-related 
assessments or procedures. Patient participants will be given the opportunity to discuss 
the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. They may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the signed 
informed consent document will be given to patient participant for their records. The 
rights and welfare of the patient participants will be protected by [CONTACT_103518].
The consent process will be documented in the clinical or research record.  
Consent for non-patient  participant interviews for the knowledge modeling will take 
place where the interview happens, verbally over the telephone. [CONTACT_103523], the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_103491], will send the consent information sheet by e-
mail when scheduling the interview, which will be at least [ADDRESS_114595]. Metcalf will ask: Have you reviewed the 
information? Do you have any questions? If the non-patient participant answers “yes” to 
the first question and “no” to the second question, then she will ask: Is it OK if we start 
the interview now? and if tapi[INVESTIGATOR_103492]: Is it OK if I begin audio recording? 
After the participant answers “yes,” the interview will begin.
15.4 Exclusion  of Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)
The proposed study will enroll Chinese adults aged 21 years and older. No children will 
be included since there are separate and targeted NYU Dentistry programs for this age 
group. The study population is Chinese American adults living in any of the 5 boroughs 
of [LOCATION_001], NY. We estimate that approximately 60% of our enrolled patient 
participants will be women, based on our experience with conducting community-based 
screening events. All enrolled patient participants will be of self-reported Chinese 
ethnicity, to ensure that our partnerships and materials are culturally and linguistically 
relevant. Study sites will be concentrated in lower Manhattan (Chinatown and the Lower 
East Side) and the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn, which include dense ethnic enclaves 
of Chinese Americans.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________17 PUBLICATION/DATA SHARING POLICY
This study will comply with the NIH Public Access Policy, which ensures that the public 
has access to the published results of NIH funded research. It requires scientists to 
submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital 
archive PubMed Central  upon acceptance for publication.
The International Committee of  Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have 
adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE 
defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects 
to intervention or concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause-and-effect 
relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical 
interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, 
process-of-care changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or 
health-related measures obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic 
measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy requires that all clinical trials be 
registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_38082]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar 
policies. For interventional clinical trials performed under NIDCR grants and cooperative 
agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility to register the trial in an acceptable 
registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member 
journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration 
is necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions 
about the need to register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of 
the journal in which they wish to publish.
U.S. Public  Law 110-85 (Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 or 
FDAAA), Title VIII, Section 801 mandates that a "responsible party" (i.e., the sponsor or 
designated principal investigator) register and report results of certain "applicable 
clinical trials:" 
Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I 
investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation; and
Trials of Devices: Controlled trials with health outcomes of a product subject to FDA 
regulation (other than small feasibility studies) and pediatric postmarket surveillance 
studies.
NIH grantees must take specific steps to ensure compliance with NIH implementation of 
FDAAA.

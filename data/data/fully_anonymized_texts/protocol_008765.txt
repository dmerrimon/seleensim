  Background  (Include relevant experience, gaps in cu rrent knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):  
The Cardiopulmonary Management (CPM) System is intended for use in adults  undergoing monitoring for 
cardiopulmonary conditions unde r the direction of a licensed medical professional to measure, record, and 
periodically transmit physiol ogical data. One of the main challenges in  managing these patients’ care with the 
current standard of care lies in pr oviding health care providers with in sight on how patients are trending once 
diagnosed, and (post-discharge) identif ying patients who are at high risk for an adverse event, so that these 
patients can be treated prior to being ad mitted or re-admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 Studies such as MultiSENSE in [ADDRESS_1136353] clinical decompensation (in this case, related to heart failure) using a 
combination of relevant parameters that include heart sounds, thoracic impedance, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heart rate, and 
activity (Boehmer et al., 2017). Measurement and monitoring devices ar e important tools used to manage these 
at-risk populations; however, there are limited options that provide multi -parameter and noninvasive patient 
data collected and analyz ed within one device.  
 The ADI At-Home CPM System acquire s physiological data and derived m easurements associated with the 
presence and progression of cardiop ulmonary conditions, including diastolic  heart sounds ener gy, respi[INVESTIGATOR_820033], cha nges in thoracic impedance,  and electrocardiogram abnormalities. The end 
goal of the product is to colle ct, derive and transmit these measurements to the clinic al care team daily with 
high accuracy. These data enable the c linical care team to monitor their patients more closely, potentially 
resulting in more informed clinical management decisions and reducing the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]. This study 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/2017 
 
       P a g e  3 of 21 
 aims to validate the accuracy of several of these parame ters (respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], relativ e tidal volume) clinically, 
using healthy volunteers who will follow respi[INVESTIGATOR_820034] (changing rate and depth) mimicking those 
observed in patients with cardiopulmonary conditions. 
 Description of Investigational Device: The ADI At-Home CPM (Cardiopulmona ry Management) System is a non-i nvasive device that measures and 
trends a variety of physiological parameters. The device is battery-operated and bioc ompatible. The device is 
placed on the left chest area with one adhesive “island” on the sternum an d the other island under the left arm 
(near the mid-axillary line).  A round acoustic sensor falls near the apex  of the heart, and for those with breast 
tissue, it is located similarly to the u nderwire of a bra. The device uses this sensor as well as five electrodes, an 
accelerometer, and a temperature sensor.  The device uses adhesive patches to a dhere to the body. These use a gentle silicone adhesive wi th five hydrogel 
pads embedded (which align with the metal electrodes  on the device). The device-side of the adhesives are 
composed of hook and loop material (like baby [CONTACT_226747]) which allow the adhesives to be easily replaced when 
adhesion degrades.  During normal use, the device is  only worn for about [ADDRESS_1136354] ment position, the skin w ill be marked and the device 
will be placed in aligned with the skin markers every ti me adhesive is replaced to avoid changes in the device 
position throughout the visit.

Intended Use: The ADI CPM (Cardiopulmonary Manage ment) System is a wireless remote monitoring system intended for 
use by [CONTACT_820053] s pot checking of physiological data in home and healthcare settings.  
 
This can include: 
• ECG (including computer generated analysis of possible atrial fibr illation which must be confirmed 
by a physician with other releva nt clinical information) 
• Heart Ausculation Sounds 
• Skin Temperature 
• Thoracic Impedance (including Chan ges in Thoracic Impedance) 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_820035] 
• Heart Rate 
• Diastolic Heart Sounds Strength 
• Body Posture (including Tilt Angle) 
 The device is intended for use on ge neral care adult patients who are [ADDRESS_1136355] conti nuous monitoring capability. The device 
does not produce alarms and is not intende d for active patient monitoring (real-time). 
 The computer-generated analysis of ECG data displaye d by [CONTACT_820054]. The ECG waveform and analysis are meant to suppl ement currently used methods of rhtyhm classification 
for the purposes of discriminating at rial fibrillation from sinus rhythm and not intended to replace traditional 

Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/2017

 methods of diagnosis or tr eatment. The interpretation of ECG offere d by [CONTACT_820055] a physicia n overread as well as considerati on of all relevant  patient data. 
 The ADI At-Home CPM System is contraindicated for: 
• Those patients with life threatening arrhyt hmias requiring immediate medical intervention. 
 
CPM System Raw and Derived Measurements: The CPM Analytics Engine derives measurements such as  heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], relative tidal volume, 
thoracic impedance, body posture, di astolic heart sounds strength, and pos sible atrial fibr illation from raw 
measurement data acquired from the CP M device’s sensors and electrodes. The raw measurements taken by [CONTACT_820056] e illustrated in the graphic below. For this study, the fo cus will be on the 
impedance pneumography and the respective derived parameter measurements from each of these raw 
parameters.  
 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_820036]: 
Streaming of impedance is measured  across the left side of the ches t using 100kHz excita tion frequency and 
streamed/sampled at a rate of [ADDRESS_1136356] changes in impedance caused by 
[CONTACT_675853] (i.e., relative tidal volume). Similarly, the rate of these cha nges in thoracic impe dance is used to 
calculate the respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487].  Reference Devices: The metabolic cart that provides breath-by-breath tidal volume, su ch as MGC Diagnostics Ultima CPX 
metabolic cart, will be used as a reference device to measure referen ce tidal volume. The capnography device, 
such as Capnostream 20p Bedside Monitor, or mass spectrometry device will be used as a reference device to record a continuous waveform of par tial pressure or c oncentration of CO
2. This waveform will be annotated by 
[CONTACT_820057](s) to establish the re ference respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487].  
 

Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_1136357] the diagnostic 
quality ECG for cardio logists’ annotation. 
 Safety Equipment: A finger-worn or forehead SpO2 monitor will be used thr oughout the study exercises to ensure that subjects are 
receiving enough oxygen during the clinic visit for safety. 
 
Study Design and Methods 
 Methods:  Describe, in detail, the research activities  that will be conducted under this protocol :   
Study Design:  
This study is designed to be a clin ical validation study to ready the CP M System for FDA 510(k) submission. 
This study will be conducted as a prospective non-random ized. The study is non-significant risk since the CPM 
Device is noninterventional and noninvasive. The study is primarily designed to validate the accuracy of the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_820037]. All participants will be  fitted with both the CPM 
Device as well as reference devices.

 Study Population and Sample Size: The target population is healthy adul t volunteers who do not have preexisting he art or lung conditions or illness. 
The goal is to recruit a participant population with a range of body types a nd BMIs and an approximately even 
split of genders.  The minimum sample size for this study is [ADDRESS_1136358] who will all complete the entirety of one of the four 
procedure versions describe d in the study protocol.  
 Study Duration: The duration per participant will be one supervised session of approximate ly two hours. At least one safety 
follow-up call will occur within one  week of the in-clinic session.  
 
Device Training and Sy stem Configuration 
Prior to the enrollment of the first subject, the study sponsor (Analog Devi ces Inc.) will train the study team on 
the proper setup, fitting, placement , and use of the CPM System. The CPM System Web App will also be 
configured such that there is a separate  user “bucket” specifica lly for each cohort of this clinical study to ensure 
data privacy and organization.   

Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_1136359] Identification, Recruitment and Informed Consent: Screening of participants will take place based on the incl usion/exclusion criteria. If an individual meets all the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the i nvestigator or designated study coordi nator will approach the potential 
participant to discuss the details of the clinical study, including the risks and benefi ts of participating in the 
research study. Eligible healthy participants will be id entified by [CONTACT_458] (PI) and research 
team using the criteria specified in this protocol, initially from [CONTACT_94795]’s laborato ry database of potential 
participants and through the Mayo Clin ic Employee Classifieds. IRB approve d letters may also be used in 
recruitment for the pathologic cohorts. 
 
Enrollment in this study is completely  voluntary. At the time of recruitment , participants will be introduced to 
the study by [CONTACT_820058]. If the particip ant expresses interest , written consent will 
be obtained and documented at the time of the discussion by [CONTACT_771655]. Participant 
information and informed consent will be presented deta iling the exact nature of th e study as well as any risks 
involved in taking part. It will be clea rly stated that the participant is fr ee to withdraw from the study at any 
time for any reason without prejudice to  future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal. 
The participant will be allowed as much time as they wish to consider the inform ation and the opportunity to 
question the Investigator, their genera l practitioner or other independent pa rties to decide whether they will 
participate in the study.  Participants who have verbally consen ted will be asked to complete the in formed consent form and return it to 
the clinical staff before the start of  the study. Participants will be provide d a copy of the informed consent for 
their records. No patient data will be  collected prior to this. Once the form has been signed, the study can begin.  
 Written consent will be obtained, docume nted, and maintained as part of the research records. No identifiable 
patient information will be maintained, other than a ra ndomly assigned subject number and patient ID that is 
generated by [CONTACT_771650].  Pre-Screening: Before signing the Informed  Consent form, subject will be screened  by [CONTACT_820059]. 
 Baseline Evaluation: The following evaluations are required at  the time of subject enrollment: 
1. Medical history and current status – skin disorders; 
2. Medical history and current  status – allergies; 
3. Medical history and current st atus – electronic implants; 
4. Medical history and current status  – cardiopulmonary disorders or i llnesses including date of onset, 
recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or trea tments, and medications taken; 
5. Evaluation of device application site for br oken, damaged, or irritated skin or rashes; 
6. Demographics information: Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Race, Ethnicity, Occupation 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/2017 
 
       P a g e  9 of 21 
 7. Other information: smoking histor y, alcohol use (self-re ported), recreational dr ug use (self-reported), 
Caffeinate intake, exercise habits 
8. Body temperature via ty mpanic thermometer. 
 These assessments will be recorded in the CRF. Subject s who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria for either of the cohorts will then be able to proceed with the study and will be considered enrolled once 
measurement capability of the device on the subject has been verified.  Risks and Benefits: Participating in this study poses min imal risk to participants. The ADI CPM Device is a non-significant risk, 
noninvasive medical monitoring device.  The device is IEC [ADDRESS_1136360] udies, and there are no excessive risks 
of using these devices.   Finally, there is a slight possibility that performing the breathing exercise s outlined in this protocol for the 
healthy cohort will cause participants to experience shortness of breath, dizzine ss, or syncope. An SpO2 
monitor will be used as a backup safety mechanism in ad dition to constant supervision of study activities by [CONTACT_771657].   There is always a risk for disclosure of electronic data. The data collected  from the devices will be stored on an 
internal secure server and secure cloud platform. If tran sport of electronic data is  necessary for any reason an 
encrypted storage device will be used. The research team  will be responsible for any data entry. Access to the 
data will be restricted to only re search personnel approved on the IRB application, and the study sponsor. The 
research team will complete the institution’s IRB educat ion requirements for staff assisting with research data. 
Additionally, the devices used in the study store no identifiable patien t information other th an Patient ID and 
upload data to the cloud securely. Sm artphones used in the study as well as the cloud repository are password 
protected and store Patient ID  with no patient identifiable information. In other words, all patient data will 
undergo HIPAA-compliant de-identification.    By [CONTACT_96428], participan ts will have a chance to ai d in the validation of this novel device that will 
eventually have an impact on those living with cardiopulmonary disease. 
 Setting: All study activities will take place at the Mayo Clin ic in [COMPANY_002]ster, MN in  [CONTACT_94795]’s laboratory. 
 Study Procedures: Subjects will be recruited and begi n the study as they are identified a nd consent to the study. Recruiting will 
pause when [ADDRESS_1136361] 
initiated the study. Otherwise, the recr uiting may end at 40 subjects. One part icipant will participate in the study

       P a g e  10 of 21 
 at a time, with the duration of the single study visit la sting approximately two hours (the total commitment for 
any given participant being approxima tely half a day at the most). 
 Upon arrival to the clinic on th e day of the study visit, prior to the applic ation of the referenc e and test devices, 
skin inspection of the application site will be co nducted. The CPM Device will then be applied to the 
participant’s chest as described in the IFU materials supplied with the de vice (the study team will also have 
received training on the proper placement of the device prior to the initiation of the study). This device will be 
worn for the entirety of the clinic visit (without rem oval and replacement). The reference device will also be 
used for each measurement taken during the visit, conc urrently. On the CRF, the time that the CPM Device is 
placed on the chest will be denoted.  A Baseline measurement will then be initiated using the CPM Mobile Application in order to assign a system-
generated patient ID to the participant as well as to establish the tilt angle for the following measurements. The 
first half of the measurement should  be in the Fowler, sitting-upright position, and the second position should be 
in a Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lying-flat positi on. The reference device will also be used dur ing this time to es tablish a respi[INVESTIGATOR_771631].  The exercises below will then be followed, with the time of the start of each exercise  recorded in the CRF. Four 
different versions of the exercises (Procedures A-D) w ill be available that differ only in the sequence of the 
measurements. The study staff will randomly select a procedure version, using the EDC. Only one procedure 
version per subject is used. The selected ve rsion for each subject will be recorded.  
 Each exercise will last approximately 4 minutes, or the time that it takes to  complete one full measurement with 
the CPM device in measurement mode (initiated by [CONTACT_771659]). Within each measurement, 
participants will move through two positions, both upright and supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Reference respir ation data will be taken 
concurrently with the CPM device measurement. For each me asurement, it is ensured that the reference device 
recordings are stabilized before in itiating the CPM measurement sequence. 
 For items 1-17, capnography waveform and breath-by-breath  reference tidal volume from a metabolic cart will 
be simultaneously recorded  for comparison. For item 18, a diagnosti c ECG and clinical grade temperature 
sensor data will be collected simultaneously.   <Procedure A>

To ensure synchronization between re ference device’s time and CPM system ’s time, timestamps from each 
device will be recorded at the beginn ing of each CPM readin g. Additionally, a pre-determined maneuver can be 
performed on or before item #1, a nd on or after item #18 during upright position, and corresponding clock time 
in the reference devices will also be logged.   
 A single metered breathing app or metronome will be us ed to pace respi[INVESTIGATOR_820039]. The 
same breathing pacing method will be used across all pati ents. It is assumed that actual respi[INVESTIGATOR_820040]. Higher and lower respir ation rates may be tailored slightly 
to accommodate the abilities of participants. During both pha ses of varying respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (items 1-9 in above 
table) and varying tidal vol ume (items 10-17 in above ta ble), both respi[INVESTIGATOR_820041].    Readings will not be considered “suc cessful” or “complete” unless all CPM de vice errors are resolved prior to 
the device streaming mode. In the case that a contact [CONTACT_820060], the measurement must be 
repeated until the data quality is deemed sufficient. If the device begins peeling off of the skin during a 
measurement (as noted by a participant or by a study staf f) and the streaming data quality looks questionable, 
the measurement must be repeated and the adhesives replaced to ensure good c ontact. It is recommended that if 
the electrode contact [CONTACT_820061], adhesives must be replaced to restore 
good device attachment to the body. The IFU can be follow ed for troubleshooting tips regarding issues with 
data quality. The device may have to be replaced, the sk in moisturized, or the adhesive on the device replaced. 
Any note regarding measurement issues and steps taken to resolve these issu es must be noted in the CRF. If the 
above actions were not taken, the relevant readings should be excluded based on the deviation of the study 
protocol.  The recorded capnography waveforms, simultaneously acq uired with the CPM readin gs for Items 1-17, will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_267202] a blinded fashion to provide the measured respi[INVESTIGATOR_820042] a reference. After time 
synchronization between the capnography and the CPM syst em, the sponsor will provide the clinicians with 
segments in the continuous capnogra phy waveform corresponding to the dura tion of the CPM system readings. 
Clinician(s) will then be asked to annotate and provide the reference respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487].  
 Discontinuation/withdrawal of pa rticipants from the study: 
Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at  any time.  In addition, the investigator may 
discontinue a participant from the stu dy at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason 
including: 
• Pregnancy 
• Ineligibility (either arising duri ng the study or retrospective having been overlooked at screening) 
• Significant protocol deviation 
• An adverse event which requires disc ontinuation of the use of the study de vice or results in an inability 
to continue to comply with study pro cedures (e.g. severe  skin irritation) 
• Consent withdrawn 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_1136366] ed. Some data may be excluded from participants who withdraw from the 
study, at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_38107]. If the part icipant is withdrawn due to  an adverse event, the 
investigator will arrange for follow- up visits or telephone calls until th e adverse event has been resolved. 
 Malfunctioning or Broken Investigational Devices: In the case that the study device ma lfunctions or breaks for any reason befo re the completion of the baseline, a 
new device will be fitted and assigned to the participant, the old device will be replaced by [CONTACT_771661], and the full 
procedure will be followed as written. In the case that  a CPM device malfunctions or breaks for any reason after 
the baseline measurement has been taken, the procedure below will be followed: 
1) Markings are made using skin-compatible marker to relocate a new device af ter the malfunctioning one 
is removed; 
2) Malfunctioning device is removed from the skin; 
3) New device is fitted, placed accordin g to markings, and a new baseline reading is taken (a new patient 
ID will be assigned in the app); 
4) Protocol continues as normal,  starting from the dataset on which the device malfunctioned; 
5) A note is made in the CRF of: 
a. the exact nature of device malfunction; 
b. the time that the device was replaced; 
c. the measurement on which the device malfunc tioned (e.g. metered breathing at 30BPM); 
d. and the new device ID and patient ID.

HIPAA Identifiers and Protected  Health Information (PHI) 
 
Protected health information is medical  data that can be linked to the subj ect directly or through a combination 
of indirect identifiers.   Recording identifiers (including a c ode) during the conduct of the study allo ws you to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplic ate subjects, check a missing or quest ionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De-identified data is me dical information that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifiers so  that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De-identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.    Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if a pplicable, check the box next to each HIPAA identifier 
being recorded at the time of data collection or abstraction.   Identifiers apply to an y subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff, patients a nd their relatives and household members.  
 Internal  refers to the subject’s identi fier that will be recorded at  Mayo Clinic by [CONTACT_5984].

Data Anal ysis 
  Power analyses may not be appropriate if  this is a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_39400], but end-point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory . Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the information.   Power Statement:  Population Justification:  
We have determined that healthy vol unteers should be sufficient to valid ate the metrics of tidal volume and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], due largely to the fa ct that healthy volunteers are able to  breathe through a ra nge of respi[INVESTIGATOR_820044]. Using th e intended use populati on, who are generally 
ailing, struggling to breathe normally, and elderly, we would likely not be  able to cover the full range of 
measured values with as much  standardization as we would like to in this protocol. The m ode of operation of 
the device and its use does not change whether a subject is healthy or part  of our intended use population, and 
thus we believe that whether this data comes from h ealthy or ill volunteers does not matter in this case. 
 Sample Size Justification:  Based on prior studies data, the mean  error (e.g., bias) of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_820045] [ADDRESS_1136369] deviation of the erro r ranges between 1.74 and 3.31 bpm. To 
demonstrate the mean error is less th an ±[ADDRESS_1136370] deviation of 3.31 bpm. For tw o-sided hypothesis testing with significance level 
(alpha=0.05) and with 90% power (bet a=10%), the minimum samp le needed across 6-40 bpm is 202. Given that 
9 readings will be collected per each partic ipant, the minimum number of subjects is 23.  
 In addition, based on the prior study, the root mean squared residual relative errors after linear fitting ranges 
between 25.2 and 30.4%. To demonstrate that  the root mean squared residual erro rs after liner fitting is less than 
35% based on the hypothesis testing Chi-squared test with significan ce level (alpha=0.05)  and 95% power 
(beta=5%), the minimum sample needed is 136. Given that [ADDRESS_1136371] a broader patient population and since we might be under- estimating our error, we 
plan to enroll 40 subjects ( up to 60 subjects, if necessary).

 A table will be constructed with counts and percentages of the number of  subjects who were screen failures, the 
number of subjects enrolled in th e study, the number of subjects wi thdrawn from the study before study 
completion, and the number who comple ted the study. For those subjects w ho withdrew before completion of 
the study, counts and percentages of th e reasons for withdrawal will be tabulated. The continuous demographic 
characteristics at screening will be summarized for all subjects enrolled in the study using descriptive statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, media n, minimum, maximum, and number of  non-missing observations). The 
categorical baseline characteristics will be summarized for the study participants using frequency counts and 
percentages.  Effectiveness and Endpoint Analyses: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_820046], and the equiva lent parameters and study data  will be recorded from the 
reference device output. The reference respi[INVESTIGATOR_820047].   For pairs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_820048], Bland-Altman  analysis will be conducted 
to evaluate the accuracy of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. 
 For pairs of relative tidal volume (rTV) calculated by [CONTACT_820063], the correlation coefficient and R
2 value for the tidal calculate d. In addition, the root mean 
squared of the residual errors after linear fitting will be calculated to characterize the relative errors of the 
relative tidal volume.   Endpoints : 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_771647] 
• 85% respi[INVESTIGATOR_820049] ≤ ±[ADDRESS_1136372] device at 6-40 BPM 
Relative Tidal Volume Relative Accuracy 
• Root Mean Squared (RMS) of resi dual error after linear fitting ≤ 35% 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_820050] a one (1) minute period. The CP Analytics Engine performs a quality  control (QC) check for at least 
[ADDRESS_1136373] 
30 seconds results in a maximum comput ational accuracy of 2 BP M for the respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487].  Consequently, an 
accuracy of 2 BPM is deemed sufficient  for the CPM Device’s intended use. 
 Relative Tidal Volume Endpoint Justification Relative Tidal Volume as measured by [CONTACT_820064]- to-day variability ranges 
between 10% and 14% in terms of coeffi cient of variation (Boehmer et al., Journal of Cardiac Failure , vol. 18, 
no. 8S, Aug, 2012). In addition, breath-to-breath tidal volume variability ranges from 18% to 43% depending on 
the underlying pulmonary disease conditions (Kuratomi et al. Japanese Journal of Medicine , vol. 24, no. 2, 
May, 1985), which further supports that day-to-day variab ility can be as high as 14% . Given this physiological 
day-to-day variability, it is  considered that as high as 35% (about 2.58 times, Z
99.5%, of 14%) of change can be

       P a g e  21 of 21 
 considered physiologic unless other clin ical information strongly indicates ot herwise. To correctly indicate the 
change greater than 35%, the relative  error less than 35% is deemed suffic ient to trend and indicate clinically 
significant change of rTV.

Background:  Syphilis  rates  have  been  increasing  both in  the US and internationally  with  [ADDRESS_980273]- sex-with-men and people  living  with  human 13 
immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) infection. Currently, benzathine  penicillin  is the recommended  [ADDRESS_980274] increases  in benzathine  penicillin  15 
call for alternative  treatment options. This  study evaluates  the efficacy  of oral cefixime  for the  16 
treatment  of early  syphilis.  17 
Method s: We are conducting a  randomized, multisite,  open- label,  non- comparative clinical  trial 18 
in Los Angeles  and Oakland , [LOCATION_004].  Eligible  participants  are ≥18 years  old, with  primary,  19 
secondary  or early  latent  syphilis  (Rapid  Plasma  Reagin  [RPR]  titer ≥1:8).  Patients  with  HIV  [ADDRESS_980275]  a viral  load  ≤200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  and CD4+  T cell count  ≥350 cells/μl during the  [ADDRESS_980276] -treatment  for follow -up RPR serological  testing.  The primary  outcome  is the 24 
proportion of  participants  who  achieve ≥[ADDRESS_980277] - 25

Background  and rationale  {6a}  [ADDRESS_980278]- sex-with-men and people  living  with  human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) 42 
infection  (2-4). Currently, benzathine  penicillin  is the recommended  treatment  for syphilis  in all 43 
patients,  including those  living  with  HIV  infection. Doxycycline  and tetracycline are available 44 
alternative  treatments  for non- pregnant  patients  who  are allergic  to peni cillin  (5-8).  Injectable  daily  45 
ceftriaxone is  another  alternative  treatment  that may  be considered and  is safe in  pregnancy, as a 46 
recent  review  from  our team  showed (9).  47 
Existing  alternative  treatment  recommendations  are based  on clinical  experience,  a limited  number  48 
of small clinical  trials,  and case series  (5-7, 10). However,  each regimen  poses  clinical  challenges.  49 
Doxycycline/tetracycline  require  [ADDRESS_980279] like penicillin,  but it requires  daily  51 
injections  for 10-14 days, making adherence potentially  problematic.  In pregnancy, only benzathine  52 
penicillin  is recommended  due to potential  toxic  effects  of the alternatives  or due to insufficient  53 
efficacy  data (WHO).  Shortages  of benzathine  penicillin  worldwide  have  led to the use of unproven  54 
non-penicillin  alternatives  (10-12).  [ADDRESS_980280] and time required  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_718482] 56 
treat syphilis  in patients  with and without  HIV infection, a new approach  for identifying new, safe, 57 
and efficacious  antibiotic  treatments  for syphilis  is necessary.  Previously Food and Drug  58 
Administration  (FDA) -approved antibiotics,  that are safe and efficacious  in other  infections  and have [ADDRESS_980281] -generation  cephalosporin with spectrum  of 62 
activity  and pharm acokinetic  profile  similar  to that of ceftriaxone,  a drug which  has been  used for the 63 
Page 6 of 20 treatment  for syphilis  (13). Cefixime  is clinically  used for uncomplicated urinary  tract infections,  [ADDRESS_980282] bacterial  infections  and in the treatment  of uncomplicated  Neisseria  65 
gonorrhoeae  genital  infection  (14).  To  our knowledge, it has never  been  studied as a treatment  for 66 
early  syphilis.  67 
Cefixime  has a well-studied pharmacokinetic  profile  (14-19). Unlike  other  alternatives  for syphilis, 68 
adverse event  profiles  are favorable  with cefixime in non-pregnant  as well as pregnant  patients  (20, 69 
21) . Nearly  40-50% of the dose is absorbe d when  it is given orally, whether  administered  with or 70 
without  food. Peak  concentrations  occur  between  2 and 6 hours  following oral administration  of a 71 
single  400mg tablet.  A single  400mg tablet  produces  an average  peak  concentration  of approximately  72 
3.7μg/mL  (range  1.3-7.7μg/mL). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_718483] a single  dose of cefixime  400 73 
mg by [CONTACT_718488] 4.84 μg/ml maximum at 4 hours  and above  1.0 μg/ml at 12 hours. Serum  protein  74 
binding is concentration  independent  with a bound fraction  of approximately  65%. Cefixime  is 75 
moderately  distributed  into extracellular  water/tissue  pools.  Its  half-life averages  to 3-4 hours  but 76 
may range  up to 9 hours  in healthy  volunteers. Approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is excreted  77 
unmodified in  the urine  within 24 hours  and nearly  10%  is excreted  in bile (10) .  78 
We therefore  believe that cefixime’s  pharm acokinetic  similarity  to ceftriaxo ne and its safety  in the 79 
treatment  of pregnant  women  could potentially  make it a viable  option in the treatment  of early  80 
syphil is.  81 
 82 
Objective {7}  83 
The primary  objective  of our study is to determine  the efficacy  of cefixime  400mg, taken  orally  two 84 
times  a day (BID)  for 10 consecutive  days. Our hypothesis  is that cefixime would be an efficacious  85 
treatment  for early  syphilis.   86 
 87 
Trial  design  {8} 88 
Page 7 of 20 This is a randomized, open- label,  non- comparative pi[INVESTIGATOR_718484]. Participants  will be randomly 89 
assigned  (1:1 allocation)  to receive either  the standard  of care benzathine penicillin  injection  or 10- 90 
days of oral cefixime.  The study will require  2 years  to be completed  and each participant  will be part 91 
of the study for one year.  92

Explanation  for the choice of  comparators  {6b} [ADDRESS_980288]  preliminary  efficacy  data.  It 132 
includes  an “experimental  arm” of  participants  receiving cefixime  and a contemporaneous  “control  133 
arm” of  participants  receiving  benzathine  penicillin.  The study was  not designed to  be adequately  134 
powered  to show  a statistically  significant  difference in  the efficacy  between  the penicillin  and 135

Outcomes  {12}  180 
The primary  outcome  is the successful  treatment  of early  syphilis  by [CONTACT_941]  3-, or 6-month follow -up. 181 
The participants’  RPR titer  will be  used  as the primary  measure of  outcome. Successful  treatment  is 182 
defined  as an equal  or greater  than  4-fold RPR titer  decrease, from  baseline to  3 or 6 months  after  183 
treatment .  184

Sample  size {14}  193 

Page 12 of 20 The primary analysis will compute the proportion of subjects with a 4- fold decrease (from study 194 
entry RPR) in RPR titer from baseline at 6 months in the per protocol analysis population. If we 195 
assume a sample size of 40 and the proportion of subjects with a 4 -fold decrease in RPR from 196 
baseline at 6 months to be 0.9 (90%), we would have a 95% confidence interval of ( 0.76, 0.97) . To 197 
calculate the number of subjects required to enroll to reach 40 evaluable subjects in the PP analysis 198 
population, the assumptions that 20% of subjects will be excluded from the PP analysis population 199 
(due to loss to follow -up or non- compliance with study medication schedule). Under that 200 
assumption, enrolling 50 subjects will provide 40 subjects in the PP analysis population.  201 
 202 
Recruitment  {15}  203 
Participant  recruitment will occur  in 4 AID S Healthcare Foundation (AHF)  Clinics  based  in Los 204 
Angeles,  [LOCATION_004]  and Oakland, [LOCATION_004] . Study clinicians  will review  the medical  and 205 
laboratory records  of syphilis  cases  returning for treatment  before  the scheduled clinical  visit and  if 206 
the participant  fulfil s the eligibility  criteria,  they  will be  invited  to participate  in the study.  207 
 208 
Assignment  of interventions:  randomization  209 
Sequence  generation  {16a}  210 
After  consent, participants  are randomly assigned  to the study arms  with  a 1:[ADDRESS_980296]  212 
with the assigned  treatment. The  cards  are created  before  the enrollment  period and  distributed  to 213 
each of the study sites.   No other  factors  will be  taken  into consideration  for randomization.  214 
Concealment  mechanism  {16b}  215 
The envelope s containing the  randomization cards  are sealed,  thus  the team  member  conducting 216 
enrollment  does  not know  the content  of the envelope. 217 
Page 13 of 20 Implementation  {16c}  [ADDRESS_980297]  a sealed  envelope  from  the shuffled  deck.  After 219 
selecting  the envelope,  the participant  will reveal  the treatment  to themselves  and the study staff.   220 
 221 
Assignment  of interventions:  Blinding  222 
Who will be  blinded {17a}  223 
This is an open label  clinical  trial,  while  neither  the participants  nor the study staff  will be  blinded 224

Data  collection  and management  229 
Plans  for assessment  and collection  of outcomes  {18a}  230 
A venipuncture  blood sample  will be  collected  at 3, 6, and  12 month visits  and it will be  tested  for 231 
RPR titer. . Study data collected  on baseline include  basic demographic  information , sexual  history, 232 
laboratory tests  (CD4  count, viral  load, RPR titer ). On each  follow  up visit,  sexual  history, 233 
antibiotic  use, symptoms  and the RPR titer  will be  collected.  Data will be  collected  on paper  data 234 
collection  forms  and will be entered  into Research  Electronic  Data Capture  (REDCap ) (23, 24) .   235 
Plans  to promote  participant  retention  and complete follow -up {18b}  236 
Study follow -up visits  are scheduled  to coincide with routine  clinic  appointments  within  AHF.  237 
Study staff  will send  participants  a 1 month, 2 week,  and 1 day  notification  prior  to their  follow -up 238 
appointment.  239 
Data  management  {19}  240

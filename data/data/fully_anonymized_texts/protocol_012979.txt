Amendment 5: October 1, [ADDRESS_811621] Injection into the  Bladder 
Wall In Female Participants With Idiopathic (Non -neurogenic) Overactive  Bladder 
Syndrome and Detrusor Overactivity: Double Blind, Imbalanced  Placebo  Controlled 
Design Within 2 Sequential Active Treatment  Groups  
Study  No. ION 03-OAB  
Study  Phase  Phase  1 
No. of  Sites  Up to six clinical sites in  [LOCATION_003]  
Study  
Objectives  The primary  objective  of this study  is to evaluate occurrence  of Adverse  Events  and 
their relationship to hMaxi -K following  multiple  intramuscular (IM)  injections  into 
the bladder wall.  Two dose levels  ([ZIP_CODE] µg and [ZIP_CODE] µg by [CONTACT_612224])  in females  with moderate  OAB/DO of ≥ six months  duration  are 
initially planned . Pending safety and efficacy results for the 2 doses that are  
planned,  the protocol  may be amended to investigate  additional  doses in this 
study.  
 
The secondary  objectives  of this study  are to evaluate  the following  safety  
parameters:  
 
• Clinical laboratory tests - changes from  baseline  
• Electrocardiogram change from  baseline  
• Physical Examination - changes from  baseline  
 
These  changes  will be evaluated  primarily  at the individual  level,  through clinical 
assessment of outliers supported by [CONTACT_271296].  
In addition  efficacy  parameters  will be evaluated  (change  from  baseline  compared 
to placebo), including number of micturitions per day, volume per micturition, 
incontinence  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  pad weight,  uninhibited  contractions  during  cystoscopy, and 
general and bladder specific quality of life  assessments.  
Study  
Design This study is a double blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, sequential   active  
dose, phase  1 study  in females  with moderate  OAB/DO of ≥ six months  duration. 
The proposed study period is approximately 6 months following a single  
administration of study drug by [CONTACT_612225].  The protocol sample size of this phase I study i s not intended   to 
support  the statistical significance  of the primary  endpoint  as outlined in the study  
objectives.  Rather, the sample  size takes  into account  clinical  safety  considerations.  
Nine participants per dose level are planned: [6 assigned active treatment and 3  
assigned  placebo  (PBS -20%  sucrose  only control  group)]. Therefore  a total of up to 
9 participants  will be enrolled in each dose group. Each  arm of participants  will be 
enrolled sequentially and enrollment into the next higher dose level will be  
dependent on assessment of safety. The participants chosen will be assigned in   a

randomized fashion to either  placebo or an active  treatment  group within  each 
group.  
 
Study  
Population  The study  population is women  ≥ 18 years  old of non-child  bearing  potential1 with 
overactive bladder (OAB) and detrusor overactivity who are otherwise in good 
health.  
The target population is women with idiopathic (non -neurogenic) OAB   and 
detrusor overactivity (DO) who have been unable to tolerate, do not wish to 
continue, or have  had unsuccessful  results  with,  prior therapy  for OAB/DO.  OAB  is 
characterized by a decreased bladder capacity, frequent voiding,    frequent   
sensations  of a strong  urge to void, and in some  patients, epi[INVESTIGATOR_612181]. 
DO is one or more  uncontrolled  phasic  contraction(s) of the detrusor of at least 5 
cm/H 20 pressure that are observed during urodynamic testing with or without  
urinary  leakage.  
Inclusion criteria will include clinical symptoms of overactive bladder of  ≥  [ADDRESS_811622] one of the  following:  
a. Frequent micturition (≥  8/24hrs)  
b. Symptoms  of urinary  urgency  (the complaint  of sudden compelling  
desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer) or nocturia  (the 
complaint of waking at night two or more times to void) 
c. Urge  urinary  incontinence  (average of 5 per week  – Urge  urinary  
incontinence is defined as: the complaint of involuntary  leakage  
accompanied by [CONTACT_612226])  
Participants  must  also have a bladder  scan at screening  demonstrating  a residual  
volume of ≤ 200 ml and detrusor overactivity documented during  baseline  
urodynamic  testing  of ≥1 uncontrolled contraction(s) of the detrusor of at least 5 
cm/ H20. 
[ADDRESS_811623]  be of non- childbearing potential  (e.g., hysterectomy,  tubal  ligation  or post 
menopausal  defined as last menstrual  cycle  >12 months  prior  to study enrollment,  or serum  FSH  >40 mIU/L).

Study  
Procedures  There will be a total of 9 visits (V) and a [ADDRESS_811624]  with the patient  to evaluate for any new complaints.  Following  screening  
(V1, V1A)  and study  drug administration  at week  0 (V2), eligible  participants  
will be evaluated  for safety  post dosing  with study  drug at weeks  1 (V3), 2 (V4), 
4 (V5), 8 (V6), 12 (V7), and 24  (V8).  
At Screening  (V1), Baseline  (prior to dosing) and 1 (V3), 2 (V4), 4 (V5), 8 (V6), 
12 (V7) and 24 (V8) weeks post dosing participants will have a   complete  
physical exam including urogenital examination. (ECG) will be performed at  
Screening  (V1), at Baseline  (V2 prior to dosing  and at [ADDRESS_811625] dosing), at 
one week post dosing (V3), [ADDRESS_811626] dosing (V5),  and at the final visit   (V8). 
Laboratory evaluations including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be  
performed at Screening (Week -2 (V1), Baseline (prior to dosing; V2) and  Weeks  
1 (V3), 2(V4), 4 (V5), 12 (V7) and 24 (V8) weeks  post dosing. At Baseline  (V2) 
no chemistries  required.  At V1A and prior to dosing  at V2, urinalysis  will be 
done  by [CONTACT_612227].  No chemistry  or hematology  required at V1A.  No chemistry,  
hematology, urinalysis or urine culture required at V6. Urine cultures will   be 
done  at V1 (by [CONTACT_612228] a urodynamic  catheter), at V3 (clean  void), at 
V1A,  V2, V5 and V8 prior to cystometry  or cystoscopy  (by [CONTACT_612229]) and before discharge by [CONTACT_612230] (at V2 it will be the first clean  voided urine  after study  drug 
dosing). 
At Screening (V1) and at 2 (V4), 8 (V6), and 24 (V8) weeks post  dosing  
participants  will have  a bladder scan to evaluate  for residual  volume. Participants  
will be assessed for study drug effects on incontinence at Screening (V1A),   and 
at Week  4 (V5) and Week  24 (V8) by [CONTACT_612231].  Participants  will complete  a 
daily  diary  at home  for 7 days prior to the baseline  (prior to V2). Prior  to V1A  
they should complete  diaries  as well which  may be less than 7 days,  but can be 
used to evaluate for compliance and inclusion criteria such as   incontinence.  
Diaries  will capture  number  of micturitions,  volume  of micturitions,  number of 
urge incontinence  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  and rating  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865],  and the number of pads used 
every 72 hours. The participants will continue to complete this daily diary  during  
the course of the trial and the diary will be evaluated at each follow -up   visit.  
Diaries  will be assessed  at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks  after treatment.  
Micturition  diaries  will be completed daily  for 7 days  prior  to treatment and 7 
days  prior  to each  visit after  treatment. Pads will collected  for up to 72 hours  
prior to V1A, prior to V2 and prior to all visits  thereafter.  
The participants'  perception of their bladder condition will be rated  at Baseline 
(prior to dosing) and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_811627] dosing and their   opi[INVESTIGATOR_612182] 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks following  the 
study drug administration. QoL will be assessed with the Kings Health 
Questionnaire  (KHQ) and SF-12 at Baseline  (prior to dosing) and thereafter  at 
weeks 4, 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_811628]  dosing.1 
All participants will be administered the International Consultation  on 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015

Incontinence  Questionnaire  – Short  Form  (ICIQ -SF) at Baseline  and at 4, 8, 12, 
and 24 weeks following administration of study  drug.  
 
In all participants,  urine  and blood  specimens  will be collected  to assay  for the 
presence  of hSlo DNA by [CONTACT_954]. If they are positive, for the hSlo after 6 months, 
urine and/or blood specimens will be collected monthly thereafter (post study)  
until [ADDRESS_811629]-dosing.  
Primary  
Outcome  Safety  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_612232],  clinical  laboratory  
tests, electrocardiogram, and physical  examinations.  
Secondary  
Outcomes  The mean  number  of micturitions  per 24 hours  will be evaluated  at all visits  and 
changes compared to baseline and  placebo.  
The mean volume per micturition will be evaluated at all visits and  changes  
compared to baseline and  placebo.  
The change in the mean number of urge incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_11629] 7 day  
collection  period and the urgency  epi[INVESTIGATOR_612183] 24 hours  will be evaluated  at all 
visits and compared to baseline and  placebo.  
The change  in detrusor overactivity  at week  4 and 24 will be evaluated  and 
compared to baseline and  placebo.  
Urgency will be rated with a 4 point validated urgency scale included in the 
voiding  diary.  
Participants  will rate their perceived  bladder  condition severity  using  a validated  
6-point  scale  and assess their response  to treatment.  Improvement  will be defined  
as a decrease of 1 point  or more  from  baseline.  Participants'  assessment  of 
Quality of Life (QoL) will be evaluated using the Kings Health Questionnaire  
algorithm and changes compared to baseline and  placebo.  
Changes from baseline at the final visit (24 weeks) in bladder capacity will  be 
evaluated and compared to baseline and  placebo.  
Study  
Duration  6 months (24 weeks) per participant with an additional 18 month safety  follow - 
up. 
Study  Start  November, 2013  
Sample  Size Maximum of 18 participants. 
Statistical  
Analysis Both the safety  data and data to assess activity  will be analyzed  using summary  
descriptive  statistics  for the four cohorts  and the total study  population.  The 
group sample sizes of 6 per arm achieve 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in 
frequency of voiding to placebo assuming a standard deviation of 2.[ADDRESS_811630]. Total number of active  
treatment  participants  (N=12) will also be compared  to total number  of placebo  
participants  (N=6).

1.1 Introduction  
 
1.2 Overview  
 
Overactive Bladder Syndrome  (OAB)  resulting  in urinary  incontinence  is a common and 
significant problem that affects millions of men and women in the United   States.  
Although both age and disease  (e.g.,  benign prostatic  hyperplasia, stroke, and diabetes  mellitus)  
contribute to the multifa ctorial nature of urinary incontinence, bladder overactivity, or 
involuntary, uncontrolled, spontaneous detrusor contractions, often leading to urge urinary  
incontinence  (UUI)  is a particularly  prominent  manifestation.2, [ADDRESS_811635]  this condition. However,  OAB  affects  men and 
women  at approximately  the same  rate (prevalence  is 16.9% for women  and 16.0% for men6), 
although the symptoms  of urge incontinence  are more  prevalent  among  women  (9.3%)  than men 
(2.6%).[ADDRESS_811636] higher rates  of “dry”  OAB  including  symptoms  of frequency  and 
urgency. The National  Overactive  Bladder Evaluation  (NOBLE)  Program, a survey  in over 5000 
patients, supports  these  findings. In this study  the overall  prevalence  of OAB  did not differ  by 
[CONTACT_4321]; however, the severity  and nature  of symptom  expression did differ.  Sex-specific  anatomic  
differences may increase the probability that OAB is expressed as urge incontinence among  
women compared with men. Even so, OAB, with and without incontinence, has a clinically  
significant impact on quality  of life, quality  of sleep,  and mental health, in both men and women.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_612184], as many  as 40% of the people  with OAB  do not discuss it 
with their physician or healthcare professional. Of those  that do mention  it, only 25% may 
receive pharmacological  therapy.7 
 
OAB  is characterized  by a decreased  bladder capacity,  frequent  voiding, frequent  sensations  of a 
strong  urge to void, and in some  patients, epi[INVESTIGATOR_612185]. According to the International Continence Society these  
symptoms are defined as  follows8: 
 Urgency: the sudden, compelling desire to urinate. This symptom can occur with and  
without  urge incontinence  (leakage). Sufferers  experience  strong, sudden urges  to urinate, 
even if their bladder is not  full. 
 Frequency: urinating 8 or more times per 24- hour period.  
 Urge  Incontinence:  an involuntary, accidental  loss of urine, also called  “leakage” or 
“incontinence.”  
Standardization  of terminology  in lower  urinary  tract function based  on the report  from  the 
standardization  sub-committee  of the International  Continence  Society  states  that the term 
"overactive  bladder"  has replaced  the previously  used term "unstable  bladder".  "Detrusor 
overactivity" is the corresponding urodynamic term, replacing "detrusor instability"   and 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
14  
  
"detrusor hyperreflexia". Knowledge  regarding  the epi[INVESTIGATOR_612186]. The myogenic and neurogenic theories of pathophys iology require further   evidence.9 
The parasympathetic nervous  system  provides  the major  control  of bladder  contractility  mainly  
through muscarinic receptors (M 2 and M 3) and is a key target for presently administered 
pharmacological therapy for patients with OAB/UUI and detrusor   overactivity.  
The current treatment of choice for OAB/UUI remains the non-selective muscarinic receptor  
antagonists  (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine) that are associated  with an increased  incide nce of dry 
mouth  and other  side effects.  Newer  more  selective  agents  also display  these  adverse  events.  It is 
also established  that 5-HT [ADDRESS_811637]  and smooth  muscle  relaxer, was approved by [CONTACT_13632] 2012. The reported adverse  
effects  were  similar  to antimuscarinics, but with a lower  incidence  of dry mouth  compared  with 
tolterodine.11. 
Overall,  the mechanistic  basis for increased  detrusor overactivity  is not fully  understood, but the 
general  importance  of ion channel  activity  to bladder smooth  muscle  function  is well established  
2, 3,  12,  13 , 14   The loss of smooth muscle control is likely to be a basic cause of urge   incontinence.  
 
pVAX/hSlo (hMaxi -K is the name  [CONTACT_612299]) consists of the gene  
for the α −pore subunit of the maxi -K channel, hSlo, inserted into a plasmid   vector.  
Administration  of this gene into the corpora  increases  expression of the maxi -K channel  in the 
smooth muscle cells and an increased efflux of K+  across the cell membrane resulting in  
decreased  entry  of Ca++ ions.  A single  instillation  of 100 µg of pVAX/hSlo  into the bladder  has 
been  shown to restore normal bladder function in rats with documented overactivity in an 
obstructed female rat model.  [ADDRESS_811638](s)  on smooth muscle  for 
OAB/UUI are likely to be very similar to those previously proposed mechanisms that  
ameliorated  erectile dysfunction in the rat model. (See Figure  1 below  depi[INVESTIGATOR_612187].)

However  efficacy  over time may vary in different  tissues,  and moreover, in the bladder, it is 
conceivable  that different  cell types  (urothelium  and perhaps  nerves, etc.) may participate  in the 
therapeutic  effect.15 It is proposed that intravesical  injections  of Maxi -K channel  DNA into the 
bladder of incontinent patients could reduce painful bladder spasm and improve bladder   control.  
 
 
1.2 Preclinical Data on Urinary Incontinence and  pVAX/hSlo  
 
The pathophysiology of partial urinary outlet obstruction in the rat model recapi[INVESTIGATOR_612188]. 17, 18, [ADDRESS_811640] some aspects of human bladder 
physiology and dysfunction. 
Because  the physiology  of the rat bladder  parallels  many  aspects  of the human bladder20, 21 
studies examined the potential utility of bladder instilled K channel gene therapy with   hSlo 
cDNA (i.e., the maxi -K channel) to ameliorate bladder overactivity in a rat model of partial   
urinary  outlet  obstruction.  In one study  twenty -two female Sprague -Dawley  rats were  subjected 
to partial urethral (i.e., outlet, PUO) obstruction, with 17 sham -operated control rats run in  
parallel. After  6 weeks  of obstruction, suprapubic  catheters  were  surgically  placed  in the dome  of 
the bladder in all rats. Twelve obstructed rats received bladder instillation of 100 µg of  
hSlo/pcDNA in 1 ml PBS -20% sucrose during catheterization and another 10 obstructed rats  
received  1 ml PBS-20% sucrose  (7 rats) or 1 ml PBS-20% sucrose  containing  pcDNA only (3 
rats). Two days after surgery cystometry was performed on all animals to examine the  
characteristics of the micturition reflex in conscious and unrestrained rats. Obstruction was  
associated  with a three  to fourfold increase in bladder weight  and alterations  in virtually  every  
micturition parameter estimate (see Table 2 below). Obstructed rats injected with PBS -20% 
sucrose  routinely  displayed spontaneous  bladder  contractions  between  micturitions.  In contrast, 
hSlo injection eliminated the obstruction- associated bladder hyperactivity, without detectably  
affecting any other cystometric parameter. Presumably, expression of hSlo in rat bladder functionally  antagonizes  the increased  contractility  normally  observed in obstructed animals  and 
thereby  [CONTACT_612239].  These initial observations  indicate  a potential  utility  of 
gene therapy for urinary incontinence. In fact, the dramatic bladder hypertrophy and detrusor 
overactivity  associated  with this in vivo rat model  recapi[INVESTIGATOR_612189]  
18, 22, 23, 24 and thus provides  an excellent  opportunity  to further 
explore  the utility  of K channel  gene  therapy  for the treatment  of this condition and other smooth 
muscle disorders (i.e., erectile dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome, and   asthma).

Another study examined the ability of hSlo gene transfer to alter and/or ameliorate the  
intermicturition  pressure  fluctuations  observed in an obstructed male  rat model. For these  studies  
rats were  obstructed for 2 weeks  using  a perineal  approach.25 Following  2 weeks  of obstruction, 
the rats were  catheterized  for cystometric  investigations  as previously  described15, 25 and placed  
into 1 of 2 treatment groups. Age -Matched Control rats were subjected to a sham obstruction and 
run in parallel.  
 
The mean  values  for the micturition  parameters  in all experimental  animals  are summarized  in 
Table 3, and the salient features  of these  findings  are graphically  depi[INVESTIGATOR_612190]  2 and 3. 
Importantly, as with the study in the 6-week obstructed female rat, a single intravesical  
instillation  of 100 µg hSlo/pVAX was associated  with statistically  significant  changes  in several  
micturition parameters of major physiological  relevance.

As illustrated, 2 weeks of obstruction produces a general increase in bladder pressure.  
Specifically,  BP, TP, MP, IMP and SA are all increased  in the 2-week  obstructed male  rat, 
relative  to the Age-Matched  Control  Sham -operated  rat. The elevated  bladder  pressures  observed 
in this rat model may well represent the clinical correlates of symptomatic urgency, and furthermore, if left unabated, may well predispose  one to urge incontinence.  More  importantly,  a 
single  intravesical injection  of 100 µg of hSlo/pVAX was associated  with a statistically  
significant decline  in the mean  BP, TP, MP and IMP observed in pVAX-treated  obstructed rats. 
Of note, the micturition  pressure  values  observed after gene  transfer  were  indistinguishable  from  
those observed in the Sham rats. This is a clear indication of the potentially beneficial effect  such 
therapy might be expected to have on patients experiencing urgency as a result of similar elevations in bladder pressure. 
 
Interest ingly, the pathophysiological manifestations observed in the 2-week male rat model of  
bladder overactivity  (as judged by [CONTACT_612240]) are 
apparently more severe than, and thus, at least in some respects, differ from our previous  
observations in the 6-week obstructed female rat model. Nonetheless, both models produce a  
consistent  increase in inter-micturition  pressures,  which  are the presumptive  clinical correlates  of 
urgency. As such, these  data may indicate  that hSlo gene  transfer  has therapeutic  utility  in more  
than one “type” of urgency and/or urge  incontinence.

Amendment 5: October 1, [ADDRESS_811643] study evaluated  the effects  of hSlo gene  transfer following 2 weeks  of partial urethral  
outlet obstruction in female  rats. In order to create  a partial urethral outlet obstruction (PUO),  a 
ligature  was placed  on the urethra of female Sprague-Dawley  rats weighing 200-250g (Christ  et 
al., 2001) as described  above.  Two weeks  after placement  of the ligature, the rats were  subjected  
to surgery for placement  of a suprapubic catheter.  Two days later,  bladder function  studies  (i.e., 
cystometry)  were  performed on conscious, unrestrained rats in metabolic  cages.  As illustrated  in 
Table 4 and Figure 4 following the 2 weeks  of partial urethral outlet obstruction, female rats 
exhibit significant changes  in bladder function, as evidenced  by [CONTACT_612241] 2-fold  increase in 
bladder capacity and the appearance of significant spontaneous bladder  contractions.  The 
increased  spontaneous bladder contractions were  observed as pressure fluctuations between  
micturitions  (see Figure 4), and can be quantified  as shown in Table 4 by [CONTACT_612242].  A single  intraluminal bladder injection  of 300 µg 
and 1000 µg of pVAX/ hSlo (in 1 ml PBS-20% sucrose) resulted in a nearly  complete  ablation  of 
detrusor overactivity.  This effect  is reflected  by [CONTACT_612243] t he 
hSlo-treated,  obstructed rats when  compared  with the rats treated  with pVAX vector  only (see 
Table 4). Although, a true DO effect  relationship for hSlo gene  transfer was not shown in this 
model, this study  did demonstrate that over a 1- log unit variation in DO (from 100 to 1000 µg), 
there is a statistically  significant,  and moreover, physiologically  relevant,  diminution  in DO, in 
the absence of any detectable  effect  on the ability  of the bladder to empty.  That is, in this animal 
model, pVAX/ hSlo is able to ameliorate  the pathophysiological effects  of outflow obstruction- 
related  DO, without having any detrimental effect  on bladder function. Similar  effects  were  
observed after instillation  of 100 µg pVAX/hSlo  in the 6-week  obstructed female Sprague  Dawley  
rats, which are shown below.

A rabbit  study  to evaluate the distribution  of different  volumes  of gene  transfer injected  into the 
bladder wall was performed  prior to initiation  of the clinical  trial in women with OAB  using  
direct  intravesicular  injections.  Nine  female Adult  New Zealand  white  rabbits  weighing  an 
average of [ADDRESS_811644]  
volume  of carrier  (4, 8, or 10 sites x 0.15 ml). The plasmids  were  in solution at a concentration  
of 4000 µg/ml. One week later the animals were euthanized and the bladders  excised  and 
weighed. Areas  with blue color  were  prepared  for histological examination  and molecular  
analysis.  Molecular  analysis  of hslo expression tissue  was done  with RNA  extraction and real 
time PCR. In addition, histopathology was performed on the various rabbit   tissues.

the 0.05 ml injection.  Six rabbits  had 0.1 ml at 4, 8, and 10 sites (3 from  inside  the bladder;  3 
from  outside  the bladder).  Three  rabbits  had 0.15 ml at 4, 8, and 10 sites.  Results  indicated  that 
those  rabbits  with a greater  number  of injections  (8-10 injections)  had less expression than some  
animals  with the smallest  number  of injections  (4 injections).  The overall  conclusion is that the 
direct  injection  into the bladder wall results  in expression of the gene,  however, it seems  to work 
best with wider  dispersion  of the injections  perhaps  [ADDRESS_811646] treatment.  There  were  granulomatous  lesions  observed due to the 
sutures (a common artifact in the rabbit  model).  
 
1.3 Preclinical Toxicology of pVAX/hSlo following  Intravesical  
Administration  
 
Tolerance and biodistribution data were evaluated after intracavernous (i.e.,   intravenous) 
injection of 1000 µg of pVAX/hSlo in a Sprague -Dawley retired breeder rat mode l of erectile  
dysfunction. Importantly,  signal  was not detected  in either  the testis  or the heart  beyond the 24 
hour time point. A positive  signal  in the heart  was never  detected  after the 1-hour time point;  a 
time that surmised  to be related  to plasmid  in the blood, since  the kinetics  of disappearance  of the 
plasmid  from  the plasma  was previously  determined  to be less than 0.[ADDRESS_811647] systemic, in particular, cardiac  effects.  
 
For the OAB  indication  it is not technically  possible  to simulate  the same  transurethral  route  of 
intravesical administration  of pVAX/hSlo  in rats as will be used in the human  trials.  Therefore,  in 
the toxicology  and biodistribution studies  evaluating intravesical injection  of pVAX/hSlo, animals  
underwent  surgical  exposure  of the bladder and study  material  was injected  directly  into the 
bladder using a  needle.  
 
The effect  of pVAX/hSlo  on hematological and chemical  parameters  were  assessed  in fifteen  275- 
300 gm normal female Sprague - Dawley rats.   1000 µg of either pVAX/hSlo  (8 animals) or  
pVAX vector  (7 animals)  was injected  directly  into the lumen  of the bladder  following  surgical  
exposure. Blood samples were collected via a heart stick immediately af ter the animals were  
euthanized by [INVESTIGATOR_609] [ADDRESS_811648]  
material.  Samples were analyzed for glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein,   total 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, [ADDRESS_811649],  cholesterol, sodium, potassium,  chloride, A/G ratio, 
BUN/creatinine ratio, globulin, lipase, amylase, triglycerides, CPK, GTP, magnesium and 
osmolality.  The laboratory  parameters  were  similar  between  pVAX/hSlo and controls  at the four 
timepoints.  
 
The effect  of pVAX/hSlo on the histopathology  in female  Sprague -Dawley  rats (275 to 300 gm) 
was evaluated  in two studies.  In the first study,  four rats underwent  partial bladder obstruction  
surgery  and 2 weeks  later 100 µg pVAX/hSlo in 1000 µL PBS-20% sucrose  was administered  
directly  into the lumen  of the bladder with surgical  exposure  of the bladder.  A single  animal  was 
euthanized at 1, 8, and 24 hours, and at one week  after injection  of pVAX/hSlo. The tissues of 47 
organs  were  immediately  fixed  in 10% formalin  and processed  for routine  histopathological  
examination. Histopathological changes were noted only in  the  bladder  and  consisted  of  
serositis,  edema,  hemorrhage,  and fibrosis. These changes  were  consistent  with those  expected  
with partial urethral obstruction and were not considered related to injection of   pVAX/hSlo.  
 
Because  of the histopathological  changes  in the bladder  of rats with PUO  administered  
pVAX/hSlo,  the effect  of pVAX/hSlo compared  to vector  (pVAX)  and PBS-20% sucrose  on 
histology of the bladder was evaluated in normal rats.  Following  surgical  exposure,  the 
following  test material was injected  directly  into the bladder lumen:  1) 0.6 ml PBS–20% sucrose, 
2) 1000 µg pVAX in 0.6 ml PBS–20% sucrose, or 3) 1000 µg pVAX/hSlo  in 0.6 ml PBS–20% 
sucrose. Animals  were  euthanized  with CO 2 72 hours  after instillation  and the bladders  removed  
and immediately  fixed  in 10% formalin  solution. The 72 hour time point  was chosen to limit the 
mechanical  effects  of the needle  puncture  on the bladder wall and minimize  any potential  effects  
of inflammation that might be caused by [CONTACT_612244]/hSlo , vector, or   diluent.  
 
There were  no gross  findings  on examination  of the bladder.  Overall,  there  were  no treatment - 
related  differences  between  pVAX/hSlo  and either  the vehicle  or pVAX.  No treatment -related  
alterations in the urothelium were noted. The lesions seen on histological examination were  
consistent with trauma from the needle used for injection  since  they  were  focal  rather  than 
diffuse or multifocal in  distribution.  
 
In the biodistribution  study,  test material  was injected  directly  into the lumen  of  exposed  
bladders  in 275-300 g normal  Sprague -Dawley  rats. 1000 µg pVAX/hSlo in 0.6 ml of PBS-20%  
sucrose  was administered  to 12 animals  and 0.6 ml PBS-20% sucrose  administered  to [ADDRESS_811650] 
material.  Tissue  samples  were  collected  in the specified  order as follows:  heart,  liver,  brain, 
kidney, spleen, lung, aorta, trachea, lymph node, eye, biceps, colon, vagina, and   uterus.  
 
Genomic  DNA samples  were  analyzed  for the kanamycin  gene  with a validated  QPCR  method. 
The results  indicate  that after injection  of 1000 µg pVAX/hSlo, the plasmid  could be detected  
after 24 hours  in the aorta,  uterus, bladder,  and urethra. At 1 week,  approximately  13 million  
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/µg total DNA were measured in the bladder and pVAX/hSlo could also be detected  
slightly in the biceps. The results are displayed in graphical format in Figure 5   (below).  
 
Although these results differ from findings after intracavernous injection, the detection of 13 
million  copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ µg total DNA  is still lower  than the <30 copi[INVESTIGATOR_612191]/[ADDRESS_811651]

surgically  exposed bladder in animals  may explain  the ability  to detect  plasmid  in tissue  other

ranging  from  500 µg up to 7500 µg (Stage  1 of study)  and 8000 µg to [ZIP_CODE] µg (Stage  2 of 
study)  in men with recalcitrant  ED. Eleven  participants  received  study  drug in Stage  [ADDRESS_811653]. In Stage  1 of the study  three  men received  the 500 µg dose, 
three men received the 1000 µg dose, three men received the 5000µg dose, and two men  
received  the 7500 µg dose. In Stage  2 of the study, three  men received  8000 µg, three  men 
received [ZIP_CODE] µg and three men received [ZIP_CODE]  µg). 
 
In Stage 1, none of the reported adverse events occurred sooner than [ADDRESS_811654]. No 
patients reported any discomfort from the injection and no local physi cal events related to the  
injections were observed. No clinically significant changes were seen in the general or 
genitourinary  physical  examinations  during  the study.  ECGs  were  monitored  at one and three  
hours  immediately  following  gene  transfer and at one, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks  thereafter.  No 
gene  transfer related  cardiac events  were  noted  or reported during  the study  and no significant  
changes in electrocardiograms as determined by [CONTACT_612245] (no normal to abnormal  occurrences) were observed w ith the exception of the reoccurrence of atrial flutter in the one  
patient  with the prior history  of intermittent spontaneous  atrial flutter. As noted above, this event  
was considered unrelated  to treatment.  In addition, the two unrelated serious  adverse  events  in 
this trial were reported at the lowest dose of 500 µg dose.  No serious adverse events were  reported at the higher doses  evaluated  (1000,  5000,  and 7500 µg) suggesting no increased  risk 
for serious  adverse  events  with increasing  doses  of hMaxi -K administered  intracorporally. No 
residual hSlo DNA has been detected in  semen.
27 
In Stage  2 of the study  only 7 of the 9 men completed  the trial.28 Two participants  had early  
discontinuation;  one was a voluntary  withdrawal  in 8000 µg group and one was for lack of 
efficacy  in the [ZIP_CODE] µg group. In Stage  2 of the study  there  was only one possibly  related  
adverse event in one man in the [ZIP_CODE] µg dose group who reported tingling in the glans   penis.  
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
26  
  
Other  adverse  events  were  considered unrelated to study  drug. They  included  borderline  QTc 
prolongation  in one participant  in the 8000 µg group, flu like symptoms  in one participant  in the 
8000 µg group, allergic  reaction in one participant in the [ZIP_CODE] µg group, right  hand pain, penile  
pain and platelets =570 in one participant in the [ZIP_CODE] µg, and common cold in another  
participant in the [ZIP_CODE] µg  group.  
 
Although the primary  objective  of the study  was evaluation of safety  in participants  with 
overall  severe  recalcitrant  ED, efficacy  was assessed  using  change  from  baseline  in the 
International  Index of Erectile  Function (IIEF  score  – Erectile  Function [EF] Domain). In 
this study, positive  changes  from  baseline  for most  individual  subjects  were  small  and did 
not indicate  improvement  by [CONTACT_612246].  However  descriptive  analysis  showed the following  
efficacy conclusions from a very small number of participants at each dose (without  
placebo  control).  
• Mean IIEF -EF domain scores for the two lower dose groups (500 and 1000 μg) 
fluctuated around the baseline score throughout the 24 weeks of the  study.  
• Improvements  in the mean  IIEF-EF domain  scores  observed for the 5000, 7500  and 
[ZIP_CODE] μ g higher dose groups beginning two weeks after transfer.  
• Improvements were maintained in the 3 groups throughout the 24 weeks of  study.  
• Individual  subjects  given  the 5000, 7500 and [ZIP_CODE]  μg hMaxi -K doses  had apparent  
sustained  improvements  in IIEF-EF domain over the length  of the study  which  was 
corroborated by [CONTACT_612247].  
• Improvements  in the mean  IIEF-EF sub domain scores  (items  3 and 4) observed  for the 
5000 and 7500 μg dose groups beginning two weeks after transfer  
• Improvements were maintained in the 3 groups through the 24 weeks of  study  
• Individual subjects given the 5000 and 7500 μg hMaxi -K doses had apparent  sustained  
improvements of the IIEF -EF sub -domain over the length of the  study  
• Partner responses to Items [ADDRESS_811655] at each  visit.  
• Rigiscan also improved in one subject given 7500 μg. 
 
 
1.4. 2 Overactive Bladder 
 
Female  patients  with moderate  OAB  and detrusor overactivity  (DO)  were  evaluated  for safety  
following administration of a single intravesical instillation of hMaxi -K at three dose levels  
compared  to placebo  in a double  blind  increasing  dose tolerance study . In this study  hMaxi -K 
5000 µg/90  ml, [ZIP_CODE] µg/90  ml, and [ZIP_CODE] µg/ 90 ml were  to be evaluated,  however only the 
5000 and [ZIP_CODE] µg/90  ml doses  groups  were  administered.  The study  was discontinued due to 
financial  issues prior to administration of the [ZIP_CODE] µg/90  ml dose. There were  13 participants  
per dose level: 10 assigned  to active treatment  and 3 assigned  to placebo (PBS  saline  = control  
group).  Participants  included  women  ≥ 18 years  old of non-child  bearing  potential  with OAB  
and detrusor overactivity  who were  otherwise  in good health  but unable  to tolerate,  did not wish  
to continue, or had unsuccessful  results  with,  prior therapy  for OAB/DH.  They  were  to have  
clinical symptoms  of overactive bladder of ≥ [ADDRESS_811656] one of the 
following:  
• Frequent micturition (≥  8/24hrs) 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
27  
  
• Symptoms of urinary  urgency  
• Complaint  of sudden compelling  desire  to pass urine, which  is difficult to defer  or 
nocturia (the complaint of waking > 2 x at night to  void)  
• Urge urinary incontinence (average of 5 per week)  
• Urge  urinary  incontinence  is defined as involuntary  leakage accompanied  by [CONTACT_612248]  
• Residual volume of ≤ 200 ml by [CONTACT_612249] 
• DH [detrusor overactivity] during baseline urodynamic testing of ≥1 uncontrolled 
contraction(s) of the detrusor of at least 5 cm/  H20.  
 
Participants completed cystometry testing at baseline (prior to dosing) and at Week 4   after 
dosing, a daily  diary  at home  for 7 days prior to baseline  to capture  the number of incontinence  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_612193],  number of micturitions  every  24 hours, volume  voided, number of pads used 
every 24 hours. Micturition diaries were completed daily for 3 days prior to each visit aft er 
instillation  and quality  of life assessments done.   Ten participants  received  the 5000 µg/90  ml 
dose (7 in this group completed  the study;  3 discontinued early  seeking  other treatment  for their 
OAB),  6 participants  received  the [ZIP_CODE] µg/90  ml dose and 5 participants  received  placebo (all 
participants completed in the [ZIP_CODE] µg/90 ml and placebo groups). There were no   serious  
adverse  events  reported  or a withdrawal  for an adverse  event.  In the 5000 µg/[ADDRESS_811657] infection

Unrelated events  for placebo that were  reported  in one participant  each included slight irritation 
at vulva, fractured pelvis (left side) and wrist fracture (left); 4 unrelated   UTIs  were reported in 2 
participants.  
 
The study was designed as a safety study in a moderate to severe OAB patient population;  
howe ver secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  evaluated  in the small number of subjects  enrolled 
per dose. Overall  findings  showed no significant  changes  for the mean  number of voids  or urge 
incontinence  epi[INVESTIGATOR_612196]. However,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_612197],  there  were  some  positive  findings. There was a trend  of mean

detrusor contractions  at Week  24 (p<0.0508) (>80% reduction vs. baseline  in contractions  in the 
5000 µg group at Week 24).  There was also a decrease in mean pad w eight indicative of   less

incontinence  in the 10,000 µg/90  ml group vs. placebo  which  was a significant mean  change  
from  baseline  (p = 0.0089) at Week  24. Quality  of life parameters  (King  Health  Questionnaire) 
showed some clinically significant mean changes for active treatment vs. placebo and across  
treatment  groups  at Week  24; this included  the General  Health  Perception (p = 0.0272, 5000 µg 
vs. placebo) and Impact on Life (p = 0.0032, 5000 µg vs.   placebo).  
 
 
2.1 Objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate occurrence of adverse events and their 
relationship to a single  treatment  of approximately  20 to 30 bladder wall intramuscular  injections  
of hMaxi -K compared to placebo (PBS -20% sucrose).  Two dose levels ([ZIP_CODE] µg and   [ZIP_CODE] 
µg) in females  with moderate  OAB/DO of ≥ six months  duration are initially  planned. In each 
dose level,  6 participants  will receive  hMaxi -K and 3 will receive  placebo. Pending  safety and 
efficacy results for the 2 doses that are planned, the protocol may be amended to  investigate additional doses in this  study.  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the following safety   parameters:  
• Clinical laboratory tests - changes from  baseline  
• Electrocardiogram change from  baseline  
• Physical Examination - changes from  baseline  
These changes  will be evaluated  primarily  at the individual  level,  through clinical  assessment  of 
outliers supported by [CONTACT_271296].  
Additional secondary efficacy objectives focus on the potential activity of intramuscular 
injections  into the bladder  wall of hMaxi -K compared  to placebo. Two dose levels  ([ZIP_CODE] µg, 
and 24000µg) in female part icipants with moderate OAB/DO of ≥ six months duration are  
initially  planned. Individual  efficacy  parameters  that will be evaluated  as secondary  endpoints  
are: 
• Mean number of micturitions per 24 hours –change from  baseline  
• Mean volume per micturition – change from  baseline  
• Mean number of Urge Incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] –change from  baseline  
• Overall bladder capacity – change from baseline (as defined in section 6.1) 
 
3.1 Study  Design  
 
This study  is a double  blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter,  sequential  active  dose, phase  1 
study in females with moderate OAB/DO of ≥ six months  duration.  
The proposed study  period is approximately  6 months  following  a single  administration  of study  
drug per participant. The protocol sample size of this phase I trial is not intended to find 
statistically  significant  differences  between  placebo  and treatment for the primary  endpoint  as 
outlined in 2.0. Rather, the sample size takes into account clinica l safety   considerations.  
However, the study is designed to observe a 30% reduction in the number of voids  following 
gene  transfer using  the following  calculations  with NCSS/PASS program  (NCSS,  Kaysville,  
Utah,  [ZIP_CODE]).

Up to 9 female  participants  (6 participants  on active  treatment  and 3 on placebo)  will be enrolled  
per dose level  “arm”.  The 2 active  doses  to be evaluated  sequentially  are [ZIP_CODE] µg and 24000µg 
compared  to intramuscular injections  into the bladder  wall of PBS-20% sucrose  (control  group). 
Additional  participants  may be enrolled for evaluating  the tolerability  to a given  dose. Each  arm 
of [ADDRESS_811663] 5 participants  in each cohort  will be managed  directly  by [CONTACT_456] (or 
their designee) with a [ADDRESS_811664] review will occur as soon as possible after the 5th participant’s 3-Day Post -visit [ADDRESS_811665] dosing cohort may proceed. This process will be repeated  
through the 5th  participant in each cohort before the balance of the cohort (4 additional  
participants) is  enrolled.  If a clinically s erious sign or symptom is reported the medical   monitor 
will contact [CONTACT_612250].  In addition, enrollment  into the next cohort  or arm in the series  (at the 
next highest  dose) will be dependent  on safety  dose-limiting  toxicity  assessments as per Section  
5.2.

184 days;  however each participant  on active  treatment will be required  to be followed for an 
additional 18 months (every 6 months) for safety evaluations only (see Section   7.12).

The study  population includes  women  (of non-childbearing  potential) with OAB/DO who are 
otherwise in good health.  
 
The study  population, if they meet  the criteria  for eligibility,  will be selected  from  the urology  
practice of 1 to 6 participating  sites.

Sharp Clinical  Services,  Inc. will maintain  a randomization schedule  generated  by a Statistical 
Group (Section 5.3.1). Following notification by [CONTACT_612257], Sharp Clinical Services.  Inc. will ship a sequentially  labeled  study  drug participant  
kit following  the central  randomization schedule  by [CONTACT_612258].  The sites will store  the participant kit at -20oC in a 
locked freezer  prior to use. Vials  can be kept at -20oC for up to 360 days.  Participant kits will be 
retained at the site until study  completion  when  they will either  be returned to the sponsor or 
destroyed.  
If there  is a single  site, then Sharp will be allowed  to ship all kits to that site to be distributed by 
[CONTACT_779]’s  local  pharmacy  in a sequential  fashion. Prior to dosing  each participant,  the site will 
confirm which kit number they will be using with the clinical research monitor to minimize  
errors.  
If a kit is damaged, a replacement  kit will be made  available.  Prior to using  a replacement  kit 
(which will be shipped to the site from  Einstein  where  will it be stored),  the site will contact  [CONTACT_612259] a substitute  for 
a damaged  kit. The replacement  kit number will be provided by [CONTACT_63539].  If 
there  is an additional  site included, then the drug supply  may be shipped to Einstein  from  the 
single  site, where  it will be stored and distributed in a sequential  and blinded  fashion to the sites 
by [CONTACT_612260].  
 
The individual  participants’ double  blind patient  drug kit will contain  a two-part (tear-off) label.  
The duplicate  portion of this label  will be detached  and affixed  to a label  page  (to be retrieved at 
study  close  out by [CONTACT_612261]) at the time of randomization and 
test drug administration.  There will be central  randomization. The sites will be instructed to call 
the Sponsor or designee  for the assigned  subject  number after each participant’s  screening  visit 
allowing ample time prior to Visit 2 for shipment of the  drug. 
The duplicate  label  from  each patient  drug kit will be affixed  to a separate  log in the source

The lot # for hMaxi -K used in this study  is FIN0400 and the lot # for PBS-20% sucrose  is FP- 
012-092906.  
 
The gene  product  or PBS- 20% sucrose  will be prepared and administered in the same  manner  as 
Botox®  is administered  in the office.  The participant  kit will be taken  from  the freezer  and the 
vials  warmed  to room  temperature  and the cap of the vial will be wiped  with alcohol. The 2 or 3 
vials  in the kit will be administered  sequentially.  This sequential  administration  of vials  for a 
total of 4 ml or 6 ml volume  maintains  the study  blind while  minimizing  the risk for bacterial  
contamination that could occur if the vials were mixed prior to   administration. 
 
To minimize the possibility of dehydration and/or a vasovagal response after required blood  
collections  or the hMaxi -K administration, participants  will be instructed  to eat breakfast  and 
abstain from any alcohol products on that  morning. 
 
The investigator (or designee) should administer the drug and must remain blinded. The  
investigator’s pharmacy or a designee will be responsible for dispensing the drug in a timely  
fashion for use on the day of the participant’s  Visit  2 and accounting  of all drug provided by [CONTACT_103]. Records of document control numbers and dates received will be kept on a Drug  
Inventory  Form  provided by [CONTACT_612262]. Under  no circumstances  will 
the investigator  supply  study  drug to other investigators,  allow  study  drug to be used other than 
directed by [CONTACT_3181], or destroy  or dispose  of study  drug in any other manner without  prior 
written authorization from the  sponsor. 
All partially  used clinical trial kits will be accounted for and destroyed at the investigative  site 
according to IBC guidance. The investigator or designee, upon completion of the drug  
accounting  process, will send all unused clinical materials  back  to the Sponsor or designee  for 
disposition.  
 
5.3 Dose Selection and  Admin istration  
 
Two doses of hMaxi -K will be evaluated: [ZIP_CODE] µg and [ZIP_CODE]  µg. 
Up to 9 female participants (6 participants on active treatment and 3 on placebo) will be  enrolled 
per dose level  “arm”.  The [ADDRESS_811672] intramuscular injection into the bladder wall of PBS -20% sucrose (control  
group).  Additional participants may be enrolled for evaluating the tolerability to a given   dose. 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, [ADDRESS_811673] 4 participants  in each cohort  will be managed  directly  by [CONTACT_103] (or their designee)  with a 2-day  waiting  period following  each participants  dosing. The 
next participant  will be enrolled  only after the site has contact[CONTACT_612263] [ADDRESS_811674] review  will occur  as soon as possible  after the 5th participant’s  3-Day  Post-visit [ADDRESS_811675] dosing  cohort  may proceed. This process  will be repeated  
through the 5th participant in each cohort before the balance of the cohort (4 additional  
participants) is  enrolled.  
If a clinically  serious  sign or symptom  is reported the medical  monitor will contact  [CONTACT_612264]. In 
addition, enrollment  into the next cohort  or arm in the series  (at the next highest  dose) will be 
dependent on safety dose -limiting toxicity assessments as per Section 5.2 There has been no 
toxicity  observed at any dose level  in any of the preclinical or clinical trials  at any dose to date,  
including multiple dosing in the ED rat model. In the completed clinical study evaluating  
intracorporal  administration  of up to [ZIP_CODE] µg hMaxi -K in participants  with ED, there  was only 
one adverse event considered possibly related to hMaxi -K (“tingling warmth in the   glans”).  
In the previous  OAB  trial there  were  several  events  considered possibly  related:  UTI;  AV block 
Mobitz type II (possibly related; mild severity, [ADDRESS_811676] treatment); fatigue, headache, 
shaking chills, and insomnia (all possibly related; mild -moderate severity; 13-[ADDRESS_811677]  
treatment). In the placebo  group heart  palpi[INVESTIGATOR_612199] (possibly  related, mild severity,  
occurred [ADDRESS_811678]  treatment).  
The obstructed bladder  pre-clinical  studies  in the rat evaluated  single  doses  of up to 1000 µg 
based on surface area of the bladder. In the rat ED model, doses of up to 1000 µg were  
administered by [CONTACT_612265]. In men with ED, doses of up to [ZIP_CODE] µg were  
administered  by [CONTACT_612266]  (similar  to iv). For ease of administration  
(based upon manufacture and storage of the hMaxi -K), during this OAB trial 16,[ADDRESS_811679]  been  chosen  for bladder  wall injection. These concentrations  of drug are 
well within  the doses  used in the preclinical studies. The doses  evaluated  in this trial will be 
equivalent to 240 and 480 µg used in the rat  studies.  
In addition to preclinical toxicology  data,  selection  of dose was also based  upon activity  seen in 
the preclinical pharmacology studies. In the Partial  Urethral  Obstruction  (PUO)  studies  in 
female  rats, [ADDRESS_811680]  volume  of carrier  (4, 8, or 10 sites x 0.15

ml). The plasmids  were  in solution at a concentration of 4000 microgr/ml.  One week  later the 
animals  were  euthanized  and the bladders  excised  and weighed. Areas  with blue color  were  
prepared for histological  examination  and molecular  analysis.  Molecular  analysis  of hslo 
expression tissue was done with RNA extraction and real time  PCR.  
One rabbit  was given  the 0.05 ml injection. Six rabbits  had 0.1 ml at 4, 8, and 10 sites (3 from  
inside  the bladder;  3 from  outside  the bladder).  Three  rabbits  had 0.15 ml at 4, 8, and 10 sites.  
Results  indicated  that those  rabbits  with a greater  number of injections  (8-10  injections)  had less 
expression  than some  animals  with the smallest  number  of injections  (4 injections). The overall  
conclusion is that the direct injection into the bladder wall results in expression of the gene  
however, it seems to work best with wider dispersion of the injections perhaps 1 cm   apart.  
 
 
5.2.1 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612200] 1000 µg (approximately  1500 µg/kg in the rat). Potential  toxicities  would  be those  that 
could occur  (1) because of enhanced efflux of K+  with resultant decreased intracellular   Ca++ 
concentration,  thus altering  smooth muscle  function  in diverse  organ systems;  (2) reaction to the 
naked DNA.  
 
In the event that any participant experiences one of the following events, no additional  
participants  will be accrued  and no further doses  of hMaxi -K will be administered  until the 
DSMB  and FDA  have  reviewed  the case and have  provided their recommendation  to the 
sponsor. 
 
1) Urinary  retention, i.e., the inability  to micturate  for more  than 12 hours  with a urine  
bladder volume  (greater  than 400 ml established  by [CONTACT_325780])  that requires  placement  
of a bladder drainage  catheter.  
2) Any adverse event  of Grade  [ADDRESS_811681] longer than 96 hours  or Grade  3 or higher in the 
blood chemistry, completed blood count  or urine  categories  of  adverse  event  criteria  
listed in Appendix A. 
3) In the event  of a clinically  significant  sign or symptom  reported by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_612201].  
4) Bladder pain and /or irritation  that persists  for four hours  or more  after gene  transfer  that 
is thought by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_612202], direct bladder muscle injections, and catheterization.  
 
Clinical  data regarding  the event  will be collected,  reviewed,  and discussed  with DSMB  and 
FDA.  After  review  of these  data with FDA  the clinical study  may resume  only with concurrence  
of FDA.  
 
5.2.2 Dose Escalation  
 
The DSMB will review participant’s eligibility data and all unblinded safety data at [ADDRESS_811682] participant enrolled into each dose cohort,   in 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
37  
  
order to assess the need  for modifications  in safety  monitoring  and/or  dosing. Following  their 
review  of the safety  data for the last participant  in the cohort  at the 4th week  post-dosing, the 
DSMB  will recommend whether or not enrollment  into the next dosing  cohort  may proceed 
(Section 11.2).  
 
The DSMB will inform the sponsor or designee of their decision to dose escalate in   writing. 
The DSMB  will also review  all safety  data following  the occurrence  of any event  throughout  the 
study that would stop the clinical study (section 5.2.1) within a reasonable period of time  
following  the occurrence  of the event.  Additional  meetings  may be schedule  if requested by [CONTACT_40746].  
The DSMB  will review  the unblinded safety  data from  the partici pants  in all the cohorts  at the 
six month timepoint following the final  dose.  
 
5.3 Randomization and description of blinding  methods  
 
Sites  will be provided blinded treatment code  identities.  For each participant  there  is supplied a 
tear off label  which  should be kept in the participant’s  source  records,  affixed  to a study  
treatment  label  page.  This removable  panel  contains  a scratch  off laminate  which  would  serve  to 
unblind the treatment if necessary.  The DSMB  will receive the blinded codes  from  unblinded 
statistician.  
 
The treatment code must not be broken by [CONTACT_612267]. Every attempt must be made to contact [CONTACT_612268]’s treatment  code.  
 
5.3.1 Assigning participants to treatment  group  
 
The study  is a randomized study  with an imbalanced -block  design  (e.g., 6 active  and 3 placebo  
participants  per treatment group). As each participant  signs  a consent  form, they will receive a 
sequential  participant  number according  to their chronological  order of screening  within  each 
site.  This will be their Screening number.  The schedule of randomization numbers and  sequence will be generated centrally by [CONTACT_46924]3 Inc. Statistical group. This code will be  
provided to the packaging  group (Sharp Clinical Services  Inc.) who will package  the study  drug 
and blind the random number with a corresponding kit  number.  
 
When a participant is qualified for randomization and meets all of the inclusion criteria and none  
of the exclusion criteria,  the site requests  a shipment  of a study  kit from  the Clinical  Supplies  
Manager  who assigns and ships  the next available numbered  kit as per the assignment  schedule  
to the site.  The kit number allocated will be documented in the participant’s electronic case  
report  form  (E-CRF) and source  notes. This will be the participant’s  assigned  kit number which  
will be their random number provided by [INVESTIGATOR_21785]3 Inc. Statistical  group.

38  
  
5.3.2 Packaging and  labeling  
 
Each  participant’s  assigned  kit will contain  a two-part  (tear-off),  label.  The label  will contain  
appropriate information including the study number, contents, dosing directions, name [CONTACT_612300], storage conditions, packaging lot number, treatment number, visit number. The  
duplicate  portion of this label  will be detached  and affixed to a page  in the source documents  as 
outlined in section 5.1. 
 
5.4 Concomitant  Medications/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612203]. All medications taken by  
[CONTACT_117442] 2 months of study entry (including over-the -counter preparations) will be  
recorded on the Concomitant Medication Form. Any changes in concomitant m edication,  
including additions, discontinuations, and dose changes, occurring during the study will be  
recorded on the concomitant medication form. If participants are receiving hormone  replacement  
therapy, dosing should be stable for at least 2 months prior to enrollment and remain stable  
throughout the  study.  
 
Participants  are not allowed  to concomitantly  use any approved, unapproved,  or investigational 
medications  or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612204]/UUI.  Anticholinergic  or antimuscarinic  agents  
are not permitted.  These medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430], but are not exclusively limited to  
Detrol  (tolterodine), Ditropan  (oxybutynin), Enablex  (darifenacin), 
VESicare   (solifenacin), SancturaTM  (trospi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]), ddAVP.   In addition, Botox ® (Botulinium 
Toxin A)  or 
related products are not permitted.  Use of Myrbetriq®  (mirebegron) is also an exclusion.    Agents  
known to affect urine production output or detrusor function should also be avoided or kept  
constant throughout the study (if permitted by [CONTACT_89365]), including: adrenoreceptor (alpha1a  
subtype) antagonists; adrenoreceptor agonists (beta2 and beta3 subtypes); phosphodiesterase -1 
inhibitors;  adenyl  cyclase stimulators; neurokinin receptor antagonists  (NK-1,  NK-2 subtypes);  
potassium  channel  activators;  calcium  channel  blockers;  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (serotonin- 
noradrenalin uptake inhibitors); cyclooxygenase -2 inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics alone or in 
combination with antihypertensive medications are acceptable if the dose and dose regimen is  
kept constant  throughout  the study. All other diuretics  will be excluded, unless  approved by [CONTACT_612269]’s  entry  into the study.  The investigator  should 
consult  the Trial  Monitor for any specific  questions  related  to concomitant  medication  initiation  
or change.   Participants should not take any antiplatelet including over the counter NSAIDs  
and/or anticoagulant drugs for at least 10 days prior to the treatment   visit.  
 
6.1 Outcome Assessments and  Procedures  
 
6.2 OAB / DO Objective Assessment:  Cystometry  
 
Clinical assessment of the efficacy hypothesis that h Maxi -K will reduce detrusor overactivity. 
Detrusor overactivity  will be assessed  with two standardized, sitting  position, saline  cystometries  
followed by [CONTACT_612270]  (see Appendix  D). Every  attempt should  be made  to perform  
the studies  at the same  time of day and in the same  way for each participant.  Studies  are to be 
completed at V1A (screening), V5 ([ADDRESS_811683] dosing with study drug) and V8 (or Final   Visit).

6.3 Clinical Evaluation of OAB / DO 
 
6.3.1 Voiding  Diary  
Clinical signs and symptoms of OAB / DO will be determined by a daily voiding diary. The  
participants  must  complete  the diaries  for the 7 days prior to the Baseline  visit (visit 2), and for [ADDRESS_811688]  the participant  7-8 days 
prior to the scheduled visit (V2-8) to remind the participant to complete the diary. The daily  
voiding  diary  will collect  standard bladder function and frequency  parameters  including  frequency 
of micturitions, volume voided and urgency epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The urgency questionnaire is a  [ADDRESS_811689] their use of any pads/panty  liners  (e.g., Poise  pads or Depends , 
etc.) in their diary. The participant  will bring  in pads/diapers  worn prior to Visit  1A and for the 
three  days  prior to Visit  2 (as well as a new pad/diaper  to use as a baseline)  and for the 3 days 
prior to all subsequent visits (V3 to V8).  Used pads/diapers will be stored in a plastic   bag 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015

provided by [CONTACT_612276]. All pads/diapers  
used by [CONTACT_612277] 7 days prior to each visit,  will be counted by [CONTACT_612278].  
 
6.3.3 King Health Questionnaire and Assessment of Disease State/Treatment  
 
Patients  will also complete  a disease -specific  quality  of life tool, the King’s  Health  Questionnaire  
(KHQ)  at Baseline  (V2 prior to dosing), V5, V6, V7, and end of study  (V8). See Appendix  B. 
Patients  will also be queried on subjective  assessment  of their disease state at Baseline  (V2), and 
subsequent  visits.  Participants  will also be asked  to evaluate their response  to treatment  at Visits  
3 to 8. Participants  will rate their perceived  bladder  condition severity  at Baseline  (V2)  and 
Visits  3 to 8 using  a 6-validated  point  rating  scale  (1, no problems;  2, very minor problems;  3, 
minor problems; 4, moderate problems; 5, severe problems; and 6, many severe   problems).  
Participants' assessment of their response to treatment will be measured by [CONTACT_7939] "Has the  
treatment  been  of benefit  to you?"  with possible  responses  of no benefit;  yes, a little benefit;  and 
yes, very much benefit. See Appendix  C. 
 
6.3.4 International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire -Short  From  
 
The International  Consultation  on Incontinence  Questionnaire - Short  Form  will be completed  in 
this study by [CONTACT_612279] V2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Please refer to Appendix   E. 
 
6.2. 5  SF-12 
 
The SF-12 which  includes  12 questions  evaluating  general  quality  of life will be completed  in 
this study by [CONTACT_612280] V2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Please refer to Appendix   G. 
 
6.4 Bladder Scan  
 
Residual  volume  will be measured  using  a scan of the bladder. This examination  will be carried  
out at the Screening visit (V1) and V4, 6, and 8. At Visit [ADDRESS_811690]  be appended to the patients’  
source  documents.  
 
6.5 Physical Evaluation  
 
6.5.1 Physical  Examination  
A complete  physical  examination,  including  a complete  urogenital  exam,  and review  of body  
systems  will be performed at V1 to V8 (excluding  V1A).  Vital signs  (pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], oral 
body  temperature,  and blood pressure) will be performed  at all visits  as below (except  V1A) . 
Height  will be obtained at Screening  V1 only. Weight  will be obtained at Screening  V1 and V8. 
Any untoward clinically  significant change  from  Screening  will be recorded  on the E-CRF  as an 
adverse  event.  
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
44  
  
 
6.5.2 ECG  
A 12-lead  ECG  will be performed at Screening  (V1)  Baseline  (V2 -prior to treatment  and [ADDRESS_811691] treatment),  V3, V5 and V8. These ECGs  obtained at the study  centers,  will be forwarded to 
a central reader for final interpretation by a board-certified cardiologist or physician board  
certified  in ECG  interpretation.  The over reader  will return the results  to the study  center  within  
48 hours. This does not negate the responsibility of the staff conducting the study to initially  
review the ECG and to take appropriate clinical actions. The following param eters will be  
assessed:  heart  rate, rhythm, PR interval,  RR interval, QT interval,  QTcF,  QTcB,  QRS  duration, 
and overall  evaluation.  For the Visit  2 pre-dose  ECG,  if abnormalities  or clinically  significant  
changes are noted from V1 screening ECG, then the investigator in conversation with    the 
Sponsor and/or designee will determine the participant’s eligibility to proceed with   dosing. 
 
6.5.3 Vital  Signs  
 
Vital signs  will be performed at all visits  as above  (excluding  V1A).  Vital signs  should include  
an api[INVESTIGATOR_612206] 5 minutes resting in the 
sitting  position (standard sphygmomanometry). For all blood pressure  measurements,  the same  
arm should be used throughout the study and whether the right or left arm is used should be  
specified. O ral body temperature will be obtained at all visits (except V1A). Any clinically  
significant changes from screening will be recorded on the E -CRF as an adverse   event.  
Following administration of study drug at V2, BP and pulse will be measured and recorded  every  
15 minutes for 2 hours. 
 
6.6 Laboratory Safety  Tests 
 
Laboratory  safety  tests will be performed at Screening  (V1), Baseline  (V2) and 1 (V3), 2 (V4), 4 
(V5), 12 (V7), and 24 (V8) weeks post dosing with study  drug.  
 
The laboratory safety tests  include:  
• Hematology: V1, V2-V5, V7 -V8; Complete blood count (CBC) with differential,  platelet  
count, sedimentation rate (sed. rate), PT and PTT (no PT and PTT a t V2 and V4). 
 
• Fasting chemistry: V1,V3 -V5, V7 -V8; Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, 
electrolytes  (Na+, K+, Mg++ , Ca++, CO 2, Cl), albumin,  alkaline  phosphatase, ALT,  AST,  
GGT, LDH, CPK, total bilirubin, total protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), antinuclear 
antibody (ANA), and glucose. V4 chemistry testing: Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), 
creatinine, electrolytes (Na+, K+), C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, and ANA  only.  
• At screening, participants of child bearing years must have a serum pregnancy test for 
beta- HCG if they have  not had a hysterectomy.  In addition,  they must  have  either  a 
serum FSH >40 IU/L or a history of no menses for more than [ADDRESS_811692]- 
menopausal status if a hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation has not been done.  
• At screening only, participants must have a serum hemoglobin A1c  performed  
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
45  
  
• Urine  analysis;  Conducted at V1, V1A (by [CONTACT_5230]), V2 (by [CONTACT_5230]), V3-V5, V7-V8; 
microscopic  RBC  and WBC, protein,  glucose, nitrites,  pH, and specific  gravity.  Dipstick  
will measure blood, leukocyte esterase and  nitrites.  
 
• Urine  culture:  At Screening  Visit 1 and 1A (collect  by [CONTACT_612281])  and at V3. At Visit 
1A, Visit 5 and Visit 8, prior to cystometry (collect using urodynamic catheter) and 
repeated  with clean  void prior to discharge.  At Visit  2, collect  using  urodynamic  catheter  
prior to cystoscopy  and first clean  voided urine  after study  drug dosing. If V1A 
cystometry  performed at V1 then urine  cultures  pre-and post-cystometry  should be done  
using urodynamic catheter before cystometry and repeated with clean void prior to 
discharge.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_811693] 2 months  with special  
attention  given  to treatment  with anticholinergics, antispasmodics  or antimuscarinic  medications  
(including  mirebegron and Botox) will be completed. At subsequent  visits,  assessments of any 
changes in medication for all prescription or nonprescription medications will be   performed.  
 
6.8 Pharmacokinetics 
 
Urine  and blood specimens  will be obtained at Visit 2 (pre-dosing  and 2-hour post dosing) and 
Visits  3-8 for analysis  of hSlo cDNA with PCR. If DSMB  states  specimens  are still positive  after 
6 months, then the participant  will be required  to return monthly  until 2 consecutive  specimens  
are negative and this may unblind this  participant.  
Instructions for collection of urine and blood for DNA  testing: 
Blood  
• Collect specimen in heparinized tube 
• Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm 
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_612207], freeze immediately and store in labeled plastic vial at -20 (or 
colder)  
Urine  
• Collect urine sample in sterile container, label and freeze immediately at -20 (or 
colder)  
 
6.9 Laboratory Evaluations  
 
A local safety laboratory (for example Quest) will perform analysis of all blood and urine  
specimens.  The blood samples  for the safety  laboratories  evaluations  should  be taken  when  the 
participant  is fasting  if possible. In addition, the participant  should be asked  to not perform  any 
strenuous exercise or activities prior to blood  sampling. 
 
The urine analysis done immediately prior to cystometry and drug administration will be  
performed by [CONTACT_978] [CONTACT_4490] a Dipstick™ to see if the Dipstick™ is positive for leucocytes   and

7.1 Schedule of  Evaluations  
 
The schedule of evaluations is summarized in Table 1 and described in detail   below.  
 
7.2 Visit 1 (Study Week - 2: Screening)  
 
The following evaluations and tests will be  performed:  
• Preliminary Screening:  
• Obtain written informed consent process for study  participant;  
• A sequential  participant  enrollment  Screening  number will be assigned  to each patient  
who signs an informed consent;  
• Review  inclusion/exclusion criteria,  medical  history  including  history  of OAB/DO and 
prior/concomitant medications to assess eligibility for study  treatment;  
• Determine proof of surgical sterilization or  menopause;  
• Physical  examination including  urogenital  examination  and vital signs  (with  height  and 
weight);  
• Complete screening i f entry criteria are met on preliminary  screening:  
• Bladder scan for residual  volume  and bladder  capacity  (prior to catheterization  for urine  
culture);  
• Obtain  urine  for routine  urine  analysis:  microscopic  RBC and WBC, protein, glucose, 
nitrites, pH, and specific  gravity;  
• Obtain a catheterized urine specimen for culture (after bladder  scan);  
• Electrocardiogram;  
• Blood specimens for the following laboratory  determinations:  
o Hematology:  Complete  Blood Count  (CBC)  with differential,  platelet  count, 
sedimentation rate (sed rate), PTT and  PT. 
o Fasting  chemistry: Blood Urea  Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,  electrolytes  (Na+, 
K+, Ca++, Mg++, CO 2, Cl), albumin, alkaline  phosphatase, ALT,  AST,  GGT,  
LDH,  CPK,  total bilirubin, total protein, C-reactive  protein (CRP), antinuclear  
antibody (ANA), and glucose  
o Serum  pregnancy  test; FSH > 40 IU/L  if last menstrual  cycle not > 12 months  
prior to study enrollment and no hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation 
documented.  
o Blood hemoglobin A1c  
• Provide patient with diary  materials;  
• Instruct  the participant  to complete  daily  voiding  diaries  for 7 days prior to next visit (if 
Visit 1A is scheduled  within  less than [ADDRESS_811701] about diary completion, and 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
49  
  
review inclusion criteria such as incontinence) and return with results at next visit  
including pads used for 72 hours prior to that visit (and clean pad t o be used as   baseline);  
• Inform  the participants  that they should not take any antiplatelet drugs  including  over the 
counter NSAIDS and/or anticoagulant drugs, for at least 10 consecutive days prior to  
Visit 2. 
• Schedule next study visit for Screening cystometry when Screening laboratory results  are 
available (within at least 1  week).  
• Depending  on the screening  results  some  participants  may be allowed  to rescreen,  if they 
are unable to be dosed in a timely fashion due to some unforeseen factors (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_612208],  etc.).  In this circumstance the same participant will be  
assigned a different screening  number.  
• If a participant  meets  all inclusion/exclusion criteria,  but has a positive  urine  culture  at 
screening,  then all screening  evaluations  performed  at V1 (and V1A)  may be accepted  
after the participant  is treated  with appropriate  antibiotics  and the urine  cultures  come  
back  negative.  The maximum  time frame  would be approximately  up to 4 weeks  after 
screening  V1A for acceptance  of these  screening  evaluations  after discussion  with the 
sponsor or designee.  
• If necessary due to scheduling issues, Visit 1A (i.e., screening cystoscopy) can overlap 
with Visit 1. In this case Visit 1A procedures  not already  performed at Visit 1 will be 
completed  at Visit  1 (pads  and diaries  will not be available in this case).  If V1A coincides  
with V1, then pad collection  and diaries  will not be completed  prior  to V1A and these  
must be checked for compliance at  V2. 
 
7.3 Visit 1A (Study Day -  14 to - 8): Screening  Cystometry  
 
• Review  medical  history  and results  of ECG  and lab tests for eligibility  and for any events  
which  occurred  after  informed consent  was signed  at the screening  visit.  These  events  
should be recorded on Medical History  page;  
• Review concomitant meds since last  visit;  
• Review voiding diaries and check compliance with completion (do not enroll  
participant who is not compliant) and for inclusion criteria such as  incontinence;  
• Collect and weigh pads used for 72 hours (check for participant  compliance ); 
• Collect  urine  for urine  culture  prior to (using  urodynamic  catheter)  and post cystometry  
(clean void). Also prior to cystometry, test sample of this urine by [CONTACT_612284] k™ in office  to 
ensure there is no increase in leucocytes and  nitrites;  
• Have  participant  empty  bladder and then perform  baseline  cystometry  using  preferably  7 
or 8 French catheter (detrusor overactivity with  ≥1 uncontrolled contraction(s) of  the 
detrusor of at least 5 cm/ H [ADDRESS_811702] be documented during this  Screening  
urodynamic testing) (see Appendix D); 
• If participant  is eligible,  schedule  Visit [ADDRESS_811703] 8 days (+2 days)  after Visit 1A (they  
must complete 7 consecutive days of diaries prior to V2). 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
50  
  
• Remind  the participants  that they should not take any antiplatelet/anticoagulant  drugs  
including over the counter NSAIDS prior to the next  visit.  
 
7.4 Visit 2 (Study Week 0: Baseline -  Administration of study  drug)  
 
Based  on the participant  fulfilling  all eligibility  criteria  following  the screening  procedures  (Visit  
1 and Visit 1A) the participant  will be considered  eligible  to receive  study  drug.  If a participant  
is unable  to receive  test material because a clinically  significant  condition  has evolved  which,  in 
the investigator's  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],  represents  a potential  safety  risk, the participant  will be considered a 
screen  failure. 
 
The following tests and evaluations will be performed on eligible   participants: 
 
• Review  medical  history, results  of ECG,  cystometry  and lab tests for eligibility  and for 
any events  which  occurred after  informed  consent  was signed  at the screening  visits  until 
prior to dosing  at this visit.  These  events  should be recorded on Medical  History  page.  
New events or changes reported after dosing must be recorded on the Adverse Event  log; 
• Review concomitant meds since last  visit;  
• Review  voiding  diaries  and check  compliance with completion (do not enroll  
participant who is not compliant) and inclusion criteria;  
• Participants  complete  KHQ,  SF-12 (QoL  questionnaires) and global  assessment  of 
disease state prior to cystoscopy and study drug administration (Baseline  
questionnaires);  
• Participants  complete  the ICIQ -SF (Baseline) prior to cystoscopy  and study  drug 
administration;  
• Physical  examination  including  urogenital  exam  and vital signs  for changes  since  the 
screening visit prior to cystoscopy and study drug  administration;  
• ECG  prior  to cystoscopy  and study  drug administration  (and [ADDRESS_811704] administration  
of study drug). If abnormalities or clinically significant changes are noted from V1 
screening ECG, then the investigator in conversation the Sponsor or designee will  
determine the participant’s eligibility to proceed with  dosing.  
• Blood specimens  for the following  laboratory  determinations  prior  to cystoscopy  and 
study drug  administration:  
o Hematology:  Complete  Blood Count  (CBC)  with differential,  platelet  count, 
sedimentation rate (sed rate). No chemistry testing required this  visit.

• Request (kit should be at the site at least 24 hours prior to drug administration)  and 
Assign participant kit number; 
• Drain the participant’s bladder through the transurethral catheter. Administer local 
anesthesia  through the 7 or 8 French catheter  using an instillation  of 40 ml of 2% 
lidocaine  and 2 % xylocaine gel in the urethra  before  insertion  of the cystoscope.  Once  
the catheter  is removed administer  the assigned  randomized dose of study  drug by [CONTACT_612285].  Approximately 10- [ADDRESS_811706] intravesically into the detrusor muscle, under cystoscopic control, 4 ml (for [ZIP_CODE] µg group) or 6 ml (for [ZIP_CODE] µg group) of randomized selected drug.  The randomized drug is injected into   the detrusor muscle  via a rigid cystoscope (preferably 18 to 21 French), avoiding the trigone 
(see Figure 6 below). The bladder should be instilled with enough saline to achieve adequate visualization for the injections, but over-distension should be avoided. The injection  needle should be filled  (primed) with approximately  1 mL of study  drug prior to 
the start of injections (depending on the needle length) to remove any air. The needle should be inserted approximately  2 mm into the detrusor, and 20 injections of either  0.2 
ml (for [ZIP_CODE] ug dose) or 30 injections of 0.2 mL (for the [ZIP_CODE] µg dose) each (total 
volume of 4 or 6 mL, respectively)  should be spaced  approximately 1 cm apart (see 
Figure 6, below). For the final 5 injections of each dose, PBS 20% sucrose should be 
used in the injection syringe so that the product in the needle is delivered. After the injections are given, the bladder should be  drained.

• The time of voiding following drug administration will be recorded. The participant will 
be observed in the clinic  for two hours after the bladder injections are completed.  During 
that time blood pressure and pulse will be measured and recorded by [CONTACT_612286]  15 
minutes. The participant will be asked if there is any persistent pain/irritation in the bladder/urethra and will be treated symptomatically, if needed. The participant will be asked if they have experienced any new symptoms or problems they want to report to the investigator or study personnel. Emergency equipment for resuscitation will be immediately available in the event of an unexpected serious reaction to the study drug; 
• P
articipants  are required to stay at the study site for at least 2 to 3 hours after dosing.

Those  participants  who do not complete  the study  for any reason will be considered  a premature  
termination.  The procedures  for the Visit 8 should  be completed  when  a participant discontinues  
the study.  
• Adverse  Events: 
Participants with adverse events, severe enough to necessitate discontinuation of  study  
drug administration as judged by [CONTACT_11168].  
The treating  physician  should take appropriate  clinical  action.  The condition should be 
treated according to routines of the clinic. The participant should be  followed  up 
regarding the safety measurements stated in the  protocol.  
• Consent  Withdrawn:  participant  decided  to  withdraw  from  the  study  for non-
medical  reasons  that the investigator/patient  deemed  sufficient  to warrant  premature  
termination.  
• Lost to Follow -up: participant failed  to return  for required visits  and cannot  be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Reasonable  effort  should be made  by [CONTACT_612289] a scheduled  visit in order to complete  assessments and 
retrieve any outstanding data. All such efforts should be documented in the source  notes. 
• Sponsor/Investigator Decision: A participant may be withdrawn at any time at  the 
discretion of the  investigator. 
 
If a participant  discontinues  from  the  study, she  should  always  be contact[CONTACT_612290](s) for discontinuation and any adverse  events.  
Whenever possible, the patient should return for a clinic visit at the time of or soon after 
discontinuation. Any outstanding  data or study  medication  should  be collected.  Adverse  events  
should be followed up. 
 
8.3 Reasons for  withdrawal  
 
The participants may withdraw from the study if they decide to do so, at  any  time  and 
irrespective  of the reason, or at the Investigator’s  decision. Participants  who have  been  
withdrawn from the study cannot be re -included in the study. Their  inclusion  and treatment

9.1 Adverse Events Definitions and  Monitoring  
 
9.2 Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an 
abnormal  laboratory  finding), syndrome  or disease  which  either  occurs  during  the study,  having 
been  absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to  worsen.  
 
9.3 Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious  adverse  event  (experience)  is defined  (21 CFR  312.32) as any adverse  experience  that 
suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or untoward medical occurrence   that: 
• Results in  death,  
• Is life threatening,  
Note:  The term  "life-threatening"  in the definition of "serious"  refers  to an event  in which  the participant  was at 
risk of death  at the time of the event;  it does  not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have  caused  
death  if it were  more  severe.  
 
 
• Requires (or prolongs) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], including emergency room  care,  
• Causes persistent or significant  disability/incapacity,  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or 
• Other conditions which in the judgment of the investigators represent significant  hazards.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting  is 
appropriate  in other  situations, such as important  medical  events  that may not be immediately  
life-threatening  or result  in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_612209]. 
These should also usually be considered  serious.  
Note:  Examples  of such  events  are intensive  treatment  in an emergency  room  or at home  for allergic  
bronchospasm,  blood  dyscrasias,  convulsions  or asymptomatic  ALT  increase > [ADDRESS_811716] estimate  of the principal  
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_612210].  
The following study drug relationships will be used for this clinical   trial: 
 
Unrelated : There is no temporal  relationship between  the event  and the administration  
of the study  drug or the event  is clearly  due to the participant’s  medical  condition,  other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.  
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
61  
  
Possibly Related: There is some temporal relationship between the event and  the 
administration  of the study drug and the event  is unlikely  to be explained  by [CONTACT_2416]’s medical condition or other  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Probably  Related :  The temporal  relationship  between  the event  and the administration  
of the study  drug is compelling, and the participant’s  medical condition  or other  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612211].  
Definitely Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  
administration  of the medication  or follows  a known or suspected  response  pattern  to the 
medication.  
The categories  of “Certainly”, “Probably”  and “Possibly  Related” are considered  study  drug 
related.  
 
9.5 Severity of Adverse  Event  
 
Adverse  events  included in the toxicity  table  (Appendix A) will be graded  according  to the 
definitions  provided. For adverse  events  not listed  in the toxicity  table,  assignment  of grade  
based on intensity of symptoms, degree of limitation of usual daily activities, or level of  
abnormality  of objective  clinical  signs  or laboratory  parameters  will be according  to severity  
using the following  criteria:  
• Grade  1: transient  or minimal symptoms; not interfering  in function or ability  to perform  
activity  of daily  living  or require  a medication  change.  No medical intervention required.  
 
• Grade 2: symptoms interfering in function but not with activities of daily  living.  
Minimal or no medical intervention  required.  
 
• Grade  3: incapacitating  symptoms  that interfere  with function  and activities  of daily  
living; required bed rest and/or resulted in loss of work or cancellation of social  
activities. Medical intervention required. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_612212].  
 
• Grade  4: Medical  intervention is required  to prevent  permanent  impairment  or death;  OR 
Permanently  Disabling:  bed-ridden or disabling, significant  medical intervention/therapy  
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_612213].

All Adverse  Events  regardless  of seriousness  or relationship  to study  drug, including  those  
occurring during the Screening period (where applicable), are to be recorded on the  
corresponding page(s) in the E -CRF. Whenever possible, symptoms should be grouped as  a 
single  syndrome  or diagnosis.  The Investigator  should specify  the date of onset,  maximal  
intensity, corrective therapy given, outcome, and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a  
reasonable possibility that the Adverse Event was caused by [CONTACT_612291].

The Sponsor or designee  will report  all serious  adverse  events  to the IRB, FDA,  OBA,  and NIH 
according  to regulatory  requirements. Any adverse  event  that is not resolved  by [CONTACT_209565]  
(or early termination) visit and considered to be potentially related to study drug, or was   the 
cause for participant  withdrawal  will be followed as clinically  indicated  until its resolution, or if 
non-resolving, until considered  stable.  
In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must   immediately:  
• SEND  (within  1 working  day if possible) the signed  and dated  corresponding  page(s) in 
the SAE  Report  Form  to the Sponsor (as above) or designee.  The date of receipt  of this 
form  by [CONTACT_612292] “Day  1” for expedited reporting  to the 
regulatory agencies as is  required.  
 
• ATTACH the photocopy  of all examinations  carried  out and the dates  on which  these  
examinations were performed. For laboratory results, include  the  laboratory  normal  
ranges. 
 
• All additional data or corrections are to be reported on a follow -up SAE  form. 
 
• A blinded code  must  be broken only in exceptional  circumstances  when  knowledge  of the 
study medication is essential for treating the  participant.  
 
Follow -up Procedures  
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, 2015 
63  
  
• The Investigator  should take all appropriate  measures  to ensure  the safety  of the 
participants, notably  he/she  should follow -up the outcome  of any Adverse  Events  (clinical  
signs,  laboratory  values  or other, etc.) until the return to normal  or until stabilization  of the 
participant  condition.

detrusor overactivity  (DO)  including  peak  amplitude,  volume  at which  DO appears  and presence  
or absence of DO. The participants' perception of their bladder condition and response to  
treatment will be assessed at baseline (Week 0) and after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24   weeks.  
Improvement  will be defined as a decrease  of 1 point  or more  from  baseline.  Quality  of Life 
(QoL)  will be evaluated  using the Kings  Health  Questionnaire  (see Appendix  B for algorithm). 
Change  in maximum  bladder capacity  (difference  of pre-treatment  to post-treatment  volume) as 
determined  by [CONTACT_612293] -K versus  pool of placebo participants  from  each treatment  
level.  
Participants will be assessed for changes from baseline in urinary symptoms following  
administration of hMaxi -K using the questions of the ICIQ -SF form and the urgency rating   scale.  
Participants will also be pooled across treatment groups (all active vs. all   placebo).  
 
10.4 Analysis of Endpoints  
 
The methods  described  in this section  will be updated during  the course  of the study.  The final 
version of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued before the treatment code is   broken.  
 
This double  blind, phase  1 study  is designed to evaluate the safety  of a single  bladder injections  
of 2 different doses of hMaxi -K in individual participants.  Both the safety data and data to  
assess efficacy  will be analyzed  using  summary  descriptive  statistics  for the two cohorts  and the 
total study  population.  Associations  between  study  therapy  and the outcomes  will be assessed  
using -repeated measures analyses, and explored in multivariate models, as   needed.  
 
11.1 Monitoring of Participant  Safety  
 
11.2 Informed Consent  
 
The investigator  will be responsible  for obtaining  from  every  participant  prior to the participant’s  
participation in the study a written  Informed Consent  signed  and dated  in accordance  with U.S. 
federal regulations (21 CFR 50 and 21 CFR 312.60). The written Informed Consent will be  
obtained after the investigator  has provided  a full explanation,  both verbally  and in writing,  of 
the purpose, risks  and discomforts  involved  and potential  benefits  of the study  to the participant. 
The original signed and dated copy of the Informed Consent must be maintained in the  
institution’s  records. The names  of the participants  enrolled during  this study  will be considered 
confidential.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_811722]  (DSMB)  
 
In order to monitor the safety  of participants  participating  in this study,  the sponsor will establish  
an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The members will have training in 
medicine and/or gene therapy.  All members will be independent of the study   conduct.  
The DSMB  will review  eligibility  and all available safety  data after the 5th participant has been  
administered  study  drug in the first dosing  cohort. This first review  will occur  as soon as possible  
after the 5th  participant’s [ADDRESS_811723].  Following their review of   the 
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB 
Amendment 5: October 1, [ADDRESS_811724] dosing  cohort  may 
proceed.  
The DSMB  will review  participant’s  eligibility  data and all safety  data at [ADDRESS_811725] participant  enrolled into each dose cohort, in order to 
assess the need  for modifications  in safety  monitoring  and/or dosing. Following  their review  of 
the safety  data for the last participant  in the cohort  at the 4th week  post-dosing,  the DSMB  will 
recommend whether or not enrollment into the next dosing cohort may proceed (Section   5.2). 
The DSMB  will also review  the clinical safety  data from  the participants  in all the dosing  cohorts  
at the six month timepoint following the final  dose.  
 
12.1 Regulatory  Standards  
 
12.2 Electronic case report  forms  
 
An electronic  case report  form  (E-CRF) will be completed  for every  participant  who signed  a 
written  Informed Consent  form  and receives  study  drug. Any correction of data recorded  onto 
the E-CRF  will be entered  in to the E-CRF  which  will create an electronic  audit  trail of the 
corrections  and electronic  signature  [CONTACT_612301].  For the long 
term follow -up period paper CRFs will be  used.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_612214]. This signature  [CONTACT_612302] [CONTACT_612294].  
The investigator or institution will retain all original source documentation (e.g., laboratory  
results,  treatment records, audit  queries, etc.) unless  specified  otherwise  by [CONTACT_760].  The 
results as they become available will be entered on the appropriate electronic case report   forms. 
Electronic  case report  forms  will be reviewed  at the study  site by a clinical monitor  who will 
make  a decision as to their acceptability  in regard to completeness  and accuracy  of the data.  
Audit queries will be generated for omissions, corrections, and   clarifications.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_811726] (Site) 
 
Ion Channel  Innovations  will have  an independent  monitor, knowledgeable  in GCP  guidelines  
and regulations, monitor the clinical study. This representative  of the sponsor (CE3 Inc.) will 
visit the institution prior to initiating the study and periodically thereafter to monitor  
acceptability of facilities, the agreement between E- CRF entries and original source  
documentation, adherence to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to a pplicable  FDA  
regulations  and the maintenance of adequate  clinical  records. The monitor  will have  access  to 
participant records, medication sheets, laboratory data, and other source   documentation.  
Ion Channel Innovations Protocol I0N 03 –OAB

In addition to the initiation  visit,  the clinical sites will be audited  after enrollment  into each 
cohort  has been  completed.  Once  the study  has been  completed  or terminated,  a close -out or 
termination visit will be made.  The Investigator and/or Study Coordinator will   receive 
reasonable  notification  before  each monitoring  visit during  the course  of the study. At each visit,  
the Investigator will cooperate with the Sponsor's representative(s) for the review    and 
verification of all E -CRFs, drug supply and inventory records, and any addit ional records  
requested for review.  The monitor will ensure  that all safety  reports  are submitted  to the sponsor 
who is responsible  for reporting  required safety  reports  to the IRB, FDA,  and OBA (see Section  
12.2.2).  
All information contained in a participant's E -CRF must have corresponding source  
documentation. This source documentation includes, but is not limited to, notes taken at  
participant  visits  recording  the date of the visit,  vital signs,  physical  findings, adverse  events,  or 
concomitant  medications;  laboratory  reports;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20112];  and clinic  records. Any correction 
of errors  in the E-CRF  will be first reviewed  with the investigator  prior to correction.  The reason 
for any correction to the E-CRF  will be noted along with the date and electronic  signature  [CONTACT_612303].  
The records  of the study  may be participant  to audit  by [CONTACT_56509]  (Clinical Quality  
Assurance or designee) or by [CONTACT_64376] (e.g. U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration).  The Investigator agrees  to allow  access  to the required  participant  records  in the 
event of such an audit.  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_811727] an independent  monitor, knowledgeable  in GCP  guidelines  
and regulations, monitor  adherence  to the reporting  requirements. This designee  will ensure  that 
the sponsor submitted  any modifications  to the protocol  to the IRB and FDA.  They  will also 
review  all safety  reports  submitted  to the sponsor and ensure  that those  safety  events  requiring  
expedited reporting are submitted to the IRB, FDA, and OBA2  within the required   timeframes.  
Within  a reasonable  time following  completion of the study, a final study  report  will be written, 
reviewed by [CONTACT_456]’s designee/CRO, and submitted to  FDA.

Calculation of KHQ –QoL domain  scores  
KHQ–QoL domain scores were calculated using the following  formulae.  
1. General health  perceptions:  
Score= ((score to Q1 - 1)/4) x  [ADDRESS_811778] on  life: 
Score = ((score to Q2 - 1)/3) x  100 
3. Role  limitations:  
Score= (((score to Q3a + Q3b) - 2)/6) x 100 
4. Physical  limitations: 
Score = (((score to Q4a + Q4b) - 2 /6) x  100 
5. Social  limitations:  
if score Q5c >  1, 
Score = (((score to Q4c + Q4d + Q5c) - 3)/9) x 100 
if score Q5c =  0, 
Score= (((score t o Q4c + Q4d) - 2)/6) x 100 
6. Personal  Realtionships:  
if score Q5a + Q5b >  2, 
Score = (((score to Q5a + Q5b) - 2)/6) x 100 
if score Q5a +Q5b =  1, 
Score = (((score to Q5a + Q5b) - 1)/3) x  100 
if score Q5a + Q5b = 0, treat as missing value (not  applicable),  
7. Emotions:  
Score = (((score to Q6a + Q6b + Q6c) - 3)/9) x  100 
8. Sleep/energy:  
Score = (((score to Q7a + Q7b) - 2)/6) x  100 
9. Incontinence severity  measure:

1. Participant Assessment of  Disease  
Participants  will rate their perceived  bladder condition severity  as follows:  
Using validated 6-point rating scale participants will be asked the   following. 
 
“How bothersome do you consider your bladder problems?  “ 
1- No  problems  
2 - Very minor problems  
3 - Minor problems  
4 - Moderate  problems  
5 - Severe problems  
6 - Many severe problems  
Improvement will be defined as a decrease of 1 point or more from   baseline.  
 
 
2. Participant Assessment of Response to  Treatment  
Participants'  assessment  of their response  to treatment will be measured  by [CONTACT_7939]:  
"Has the treatment been of benefit to  you?"  
1. No benefit  
2. Yes, a little benefit  
3. Yes, very much  benefit  
Improvement will be defined as a decrease of 1 point or more from   baseline.

APPENDIX D. Cystometry Procedure  Guidance  
The importance  of performing  well-controlled cystometries  cannot  be over-emphasized. The 
methodology  advocated  by [CONTACT_612298] 21:261 -274, 2002 should be  followed.  
Minimally,  patients  should be positioned  in the sitting  position.  Using  sterile  aseptic techniques, 
a 7 or 8 Fr double -lumen  transurethral  catheter  will be inserted into the urethra  and a 9 Fr balloon  
catheter  will be placed  in the rectum  to measure  abdominal  pressure. Room -temperature  saline  
will be used at a filling  rate of 50 ml/min.  Either  fluid  filled  catheters  connected to pressure  
transducers  or solid -state catheters  should be used to help minimize  artifact.  The same  system  
must  be used for pre and post transfer studies  on each patient.  Participants  should be instructed 
to neither void nor to try to inhibit micturition, but to simply report their sensations to the 
examiner.  Participants  should be instructed  to indicate  first desire  to void, strong  urge to void,  
and/or  when  they can longer  tolerate  infusion (i.e. no longer delay  micturition). Bladder filling  
should be discontinued  as soon  as the participant  experiences  a strong  desire  to void, 
uncomfortable fullness or pain.  
Digitized  recordings  should be captured and stored  for each participant. Waveforms  from  filling  
cystometries  and pressure  flow studies  should be interpreted by a trained professional  for each 
parameter  noted in the following  Table A. A cystometry  overreader as well as the investigator  
will be required to interpret  the results.  The central  overreader’s  interpretation will take priority. 
Printed waveforms  should be kept with the patient’s  source  records,  with items  such as artifacts  
and peak  pressure  measurements  clearly  identified. Digitized  pressure  recordings  will be 
analyzed for the following  parameters:

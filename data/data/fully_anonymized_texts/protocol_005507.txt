Clinical Protocol CA209459
BMS -936558 nivolumab
Study Population: Adult (18 years) male and female subjects with advanced HCC. Subjects must not be amenable 
for management with surgery or loco-regional therapy  or have progressed after surgery or loco-regional therapy . 
Surgical and/or locoregional therapy to reduce overall tumo r burden prior to study entry is not allowed. Subjects must 
not have received prior systemic therapy for advanced HCC in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_198209] -line setting of this study.
Eligibility criteria are defined in the protocol.
Study Drug: includes both Investi gational [Medicinal] Products (IP/IMP) and Non -investigational [Medicinal] 
Products (Non -IP/Non -IMP) as listed:
Study Drug for CA209459
Medication Potency IP/Non -IP 
Nivolumab Solution for Injection 100 mg (10 mg/mL) IP
Sorafenib Tablets 200 mg IP
Study Assessments : On treatment visits will occur at Day 1  a nd every 2 weeks thereafter. Tumo r imaging 
assessments will occur 8 weeks from the date of randomization (+/ -1 wk), then every 8 weeks (+/ -1 wk) thereafter up 
to 48 weeks, then it will be every 12 weeks (+/-1 week) until disease progression or treatment is discontinued 
(whichever occurs later). Subjects will be treated until unacceptable toxicity  or disease progression. Following 
discontinuation of therapy , safety will be assessed through post-treatment Follow Up visit 2 (~[ADDRESS_235811] 
dose). Survival status will be assessed every 3 months after follow up visits are completed, and may be completed via 
telepho ne or in person visits.
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: 
The sample size determination of this study is based on OS comparison between subjects randomized to receive 
nivolumab and sorafenib. With a total of 726 subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio, approximately 91.5% power will be 
achieved with an overall type I error 0.[ADDRESS_235812] 520 OS events to ensure approximate ly 91.5% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.74 with an 
overall ty pe I error of 0.05 (two -sided) for OS. The HR of 0.74 corresponds to a 35% increase in the median OS for 
both non-HCV infected subjects and HCV infected subjects, assuming a median OS of 10 months for non-HCV 
infected subjects and a median OS of 14 months for HCV infected subjects in the sorafenib arm. One formal interim 
analy sis will be conducted with 80% OS events observed. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_198210] d erived based on the exact number of deaths using Lan -DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien -Fleming 
boundaries. Assuming a pi[INVESTIGATOR_198211], it will take approximately  33 months to obtain the required 
number of deaths for the final OS analysis (13 months for randomization and 20 months for follow -up) and 
approximately 25 months (13 months for randomization and 12 months for follow -up) for the OS interim analysis.

Secondary Endpoints
Objective Response Rate (ORR)
ORR, as determined based on BICR -assessed tumor response according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the 
proportion of all randomized subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is either a CR or PR. BOR is determined 
by [CONTACT_198229] y 
documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. For subjects 
without documented progr ession or subsequent anti-cancer therapy, all available response designations will 
contribute to the BOR determination. For a BOR of CR or PR, the initial response assessment must be confirmed 
by a consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks (28 days) later.
Progression -Free Survival (PFS)
PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomiz ation to the date of the first objectively documented tumor 
progression as assessed by [CONTACT_198230] 1.[ADDRESS_235813] t umor assessment prior to subsequent anti -cancer therapy.
PD-L1 expression
The objective of evaluating the relationship between PD -L1 expression and efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_198231] -L1 expression. Definition of PD -L1 expression will be desc ribed in the SAP.
Explo ratory  endpoints are described in detail in the protocol.
Analyses:   
Additional analyses are described in detail in the protocol.
Analy sis of OS
A group sequential testing procedure will be applied to OS to control the overall type I error for interim and final 
analy ses (overall alpha=0.05). The distribution of OS will be compared in the two randomized arms at the interim 
and final analyses via a two -sided, log- rank test stratified by [CONTACT_198232] -DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien and Fleming type of boundary.. The hazard ratio (HR) and 
the corresponding 100x (1-adjusted alpha)% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated in a stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model using ra ndomized arm as a single covariate. The OS curves for each randomized arm 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product limit method. Median OS and the corresponding two -
sided 95% CIs will be computed using the log-log transformation. Survival rates at select milestones will be 
computed as well as the corresponding two -sided 95% CIs using the log-log transformation.
Analy sis of ORR
ORR based on BICR assessment per RECIST 1.1 between the two randomized arms in all randomized subjects 
will be compared using a two -sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_83353]. 
The associated odds ratio and CI will also be calculated. ORR along with its 95% exact CI using the Clopper -
Pearson method will be provided for each randomizat ion arm. Hierarchical testing of ORR will be performed 
upon demonstration of superiority in OS at OS interim or final analyses for all randomized subjects.
Analy sis of PFS
Hierarchical testing of PFS will be performed upon demonstration of superiority in ORRat OS interim orfinal 
analy sis for all randomized subjects. Details of timing for the analy sis and alpha allocated will be described in 
the SAP.
PFS will be compared using a two-sided stratified log-rank test. The HR and the corresponding two-sided 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model using treatment as a single 
covariate, stratified by [CONTACT_83353]. PFS curves will be estimated using the KM product -limit method. 
Median PFS and the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs will be computed using the log-log transformation. In

1 INTRODUCTION AND STU DY RATIONALE
1.1 Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most commo n cancer worldwide and the second 
leading cause of cancer -related death . The incidence of HCC varies geographically largely due to 
variat ions in hepat itis B and C virus infect ion. The majorit y (> 80%) of cases occur in sub -Saharan 
Africa and eastern Asia. China alone accounts for 55% of cases worldwide . In almost all 
popul ations, m ales have hi gher rates of liver cancer than females with an overall sex rat io around 
2.41.
HCC has the highest mortalit y-to-incidence rate ratio of 0.98 followed by [CONTACT_198233] (0.85) and 
esophageal (0.83) cancers2. The numbers of deaths is close to the number of new cases because 
most HCCs are detected at an advanced stage and occur in patients with underlying liver 
dysfunct ion, making HCC a highly  lethal cancer. The prognosis is also poor because of the low 
effect iveness of available treatments. The 5-year HCC survival rate is approximately 5%-6% 
compared wi th 72% and 22% for breast cancer stages III and IV respectively3,4,5.
Treatment of HCC is challenging because the disease is highly  heterogeneous with different 
etiologies, varying approaches to diagnosis and treatm ent, and variat ions in responses to therapy6.
In contrast to other high -incidence cancers, treatment decisio ns in HCC are hampered by [CONTACT_198234]-quali ty evidence across all clinical scenari os.As with other tumors, treatm ent selection 
depends on disease stage, the tumor extent, and thepatient’s performance status. However, the 
patient’s underlying liver funct ion has an important influence on HCC treatm ent decisio ns.A total 
of 90% of HCC patients have an underlying cirrhosis requi ringmanagement of both the
malignancy and the cirrhosis. Addit ionally , many patients require ongoing support for concomitant 
underlying disease such as hepat itis B virus (HBV) or hepatit is C virus (H CV) or non -viral r elated 
liver disease, eg, non-alcoho lic steatohepatit is (NASH ). Treatment strategies are therefore 
complex and best served by a mult idisci plinary team7.
Relatively few patients are eligible for curative treatm ent because of the late appearance of 
symptoms .7In the W est, only around 30% of all patients are diagnosed early enough to be eligible 
for potenti ally curative treatm ent such as resecti on, transpl antati on and radiofrequency ablat ion. 
Approximately  20% are diagnosed in the intermediate stage and can gain survival benefit s of up 
to 20 months from transarteri al chemoembo lization (TACE). The majo rity of patients, however, 
are diagnose d in the advanced stages of the disease when the disease is beyo nd resect ion and 
locoregi onal treatm ents are ineffect ive.The prognosis for these patients is poor8.
The multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, is the only systemic agent proven to provid e a 
survival benefit in patients who are not expected to benefit from surgery or locoregi onal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
However, the prognosi s of patients with advanced HCC has not been radically improved.9The 
survival improvement with sorafenib over placebo is modest, at 2.[ADDRESS_235822] real -life study  conducted 
on the use of  sorafenib, reported sorafenib -related adverse events (AEs) in 64% of  patients, 23%

of which were Grade 3 or 4 AEs. In 28% of  patients, AEs resul ted in permanent discont inuat ion 
of sorafenib.12In the 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_198212], dose reductions were commo n.Hand -foot-skin 
reacti ons (HFSR) (10% -11% of patients) and diarrhea (5 %-7% of patients) were the most commo n
significant AEs leading to dose reduction.10,11Asians experience more HFSR than other 
popul ations with a  reported rate of 45% for any Grade in the sorafenib Asia-Pacific study 
compared with 21% in the West. The landmark sorafenib trials also failed to demonstr ate 
symptom atic improvement or improvement in quali ty of life.7Post-marketing clinical studi es 
showed that although sorafenib treatm ent has shown a significant increase in mean overall surviva l 
in different studies, only a porti on of patients show real benefits, while the incidence of drug related 
significant adverse effects and the econo mic costs are relatively high.13Finally , predi ctive 
biomarkers for sorafenib benefit that could refine the risk-benefit ratio for therapy  have not yet 
been validated.7,8All other drugs tested for HCC in recent years have failed in both the first and 
second line settings.14,15There therefore is a need f or new treatm ent opti ons for advanced HCC.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is an open -label, two-arm, rando mized, Phase 3 study  in adult (18 years) male and female 
subjects with advanced HCC. Subjects must not be amenable for management with surgery  or 
loco-regional therapy or have progressed after surgery or loco -regional therapy. Subjects must not 
have received prior systemic therapy  for advanced HCC in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_198209]-line setting of 
this study .
After screening for eligibilit y and signing of inform ed consent, qualified subjects will be 
rando mized in a 1:1 rati o to receive nivo lumab or so rafenib .It is expected that approximately 908 
subjects will be screened for the study  with approximately 726 subjects entering the treatm ent 
phase. Approximately  363 subjects will be randomized to each study arm . Stratification will occur

3.1.5 Review of Safety
The subjects’ safet y will be monitored on an ongoing basis as described fully in Section 6. In 
addition, a BMS medical surveillance team (MST) routinely reviews safet y signals across the 
entire nivolumab program .A Data Moni toring Committee (DMC) will also be established to 
provi de oversi ght and safet y and efficacy  considerati ons in protocol  CA209459 (see Section 7.1).
3.1.[ADDRESS_235832] ive responses and/or stable disease (see Secti on 1.2.6 ).This pheno menon was 
observed in the Phase I study of nivo lumab, CA209003 and confirmed in mult iple phase 3 studie s 
(ie, lung CA20901745; melano ma CA20903747, CA20906647, and CA20906748).Two hypotheses 
explain this pheno menon. First, enhanced inflammation withi n tum ors coul d lead to an increase in 
tumor size which woul d appear as enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non-index 
lesions. Over time, both the malignant and inflammatory  porti ons of  the mass may then decrease 
leading to overt si gns of  clinical improvement. Al ternat ively, in some individuals, the kinetics of 
tumor growth may initially outpace anti-tumor immune activity. With sufficient time, the anti-
tumor activit y will dominate and become clinically apparent. 
Similarly there are data to suggest that sorafenib administration beyo nd fir st radio logical PD could 
continuously suppress HCC growth and may  have survival benefit (See Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
Therefore, subjects will be allowed to continue study therapy after an init ial invest igator-assessed 
RECIST 1.1-defined progression (Appendix 1) as long as they  meet the following criteria:
Invest igator assessed clinical benefit, and
Subject is tolerat ing the study  drug ( nivolumab or sorafenib)
These criteria aim to ensure the risk/benefit for continuing treatm ent will continue to favor the 
subjects. The assessment of clinical benefit shoul d take into account whether the subject is 
clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from cont inued treatment. Palliat ive 
local therapy  for isolated lesi ons may be permitted if the pati ent is consi dered to have progressed 
and is discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor .All decisi ons to continue treatment beyond init ial 
progression must be discussed with the BMS Medi cal Moni tor and documented in the study 
records. Subjects will be re -consented wi th an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or 
discomforts.
Subjects should discontinue study  therapy upon evidence of further progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden from time of initial progressi on (including all 
target l esions and new measurable lesio ns). New lesi ons are consi dered measurable if the longest  
diameter i s at l east 10 mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes, which m ust have a short axi s of 
at least 15 mm). Any new lesio n consi dered non-measurable may become measurable and 
therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter increases to at least

10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short axis to at least

For statistical analyses that include the invest igator -assessed progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment beyond initial invest igator -assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressi on will be 
considered to have invest igator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progressi on 
event.

Eligibilit y criteria for this study  have been carefully considered to en sure the safety  of the study 
subjects andthat the resul ts of the study  can be used. It is imperat ive that subjects fully meet all 
eligibilit y criteria.
3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilizat ion (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy ) and is not postm enopausal . Menopause is defined as [ADDRESS_235850] imulat ing horm one, (FSH) l evel > 
40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their judgment
in checking serum  FSH levels. If the serum  FSH level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the 
washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal produc ts
8 week minimum for oral products

It is the local imaging facilit y’s responsibilit y to determine, based on subject attributes (eg, allerg y 
history , diabetic history  and renal  status), the appropri ate imaging modality and contrast regimen 
for each subject. Imaging contr aindicat ions and contrast risks shoul d be considered in this 
assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether or not they  should 
receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. Specific to MRI, subje cts 
with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
< 30 mL/min/1.73m2) are at increased risk o f nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this subject populat ion. In addition, subj ects are excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.
The ultimate decisio n to perform MRI in an individual subject in this study  rests with the site 
radiologist, the invest igator and the standard set by [CONTACT_61857].

Disease progressi on unless the subject is eligible for treatm ent beyond progressi on 
(Secti on4.5.1.6 for nivo lumab and Section [IP_ADDRESS] for sorafenib)
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of  this event. In most cases, the study  drug will  be permanent ly discont inued in 
an appropri ate manner. If the invest igator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuat ion of study druga discussion between the invest igator and the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee m ust occur.
All subjects who discont inue study  drug should comply with protocol  specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the

For statistical analyses that include the invest igator -assessed progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment beyond initial invest igator -assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressi on will be 
considered to have invest igator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progress ion 
event. 
For subjects discont inuing treatm ent because of global deteri oration of health status without 
objective evidence of disease progressi on at that time, progressi on shoul d be reported as 
“symptomat ic deteri oration”. Every  effort should be made to document objective progressi on 
(ie,radiographic confirmat ion) even after discontinuat ion of treatment .

[IP_ADDRESS] Sorafenib Dose and Schedule
Subjects rando mized to sorafenib will receive treatment with soraf enib. Sorafenib (Nexavar®) will 
be self -administered orally  at the recommended dose of 400 mg sorafenib (two tablets of 200 mg) 
twice daily without food or with a lo w or moderate fat meal. I f the subject intends to have a high-fat 
meal, sorafenib tabl ets should be taken at least [ADDRESS_235885].Provisions for treatm ent beyo nd progressi on are detailed in 
Section4.5.3.4.
Trained personnel will dispense a 2 week supply of sorafenib to subjects on Day 1 of each new 
cycle (every two weeks) .Each time study  drug is dispensed, compliance will be evaluated and 
encouraged. Treatment compliance will also be mo nitored by  [CONTACT_53973] y and recorded in 
the subject’s medical record and eCRF . If the number of tablets returned does not agree with the 
expected numb er, the subject should be counseled and proper dosing reinforced.
Missed doses shoul d be taken as soon as the subject remembers. However, if it is alm ost time for 
the next dose, the missed dose shoul d be ski pped and the subject shoul d take hi s/her next do se as 
scheduled. A double dose shoul d not be administered to make up for missed individual doses.
Refer to the sorafenib SmPC for addi tional details.52
Subjects shoul dbe monitored continuously for adverse events while receiving study  therapy  and 
will be instructed to notify their physician immediately for any and all adverse events .
Managem entof suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary  interrupti on and/or dose 
reducti on of  sorafenib therapy (Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] ).Dose modificat ions or delays may occur in the 
setting of a lower grade adverse event if the Investi gator, in consultat ion with the Medi cal 
Moni tor/sponsor, believes that it is in the interest of a subject’s safety .
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reductions for Sorafenib 
When dose reduction is necessary during the treatment of HCC, the sorafenib dose should initially
be reduced to two tablets of [ADDRESS_235886] label for addi tional details.52
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Interruption or Discontinuation Criteria for Sorafenib 
The decisi on to i nterrupt o rdiscont inue sorafenib should follow local standards of care as gui ded 
by [CONTACT_941] l ocally approved product label or applicable SmPC .52
For any  dose interrupti ons, re -initiation o f study  drugs therapy  may be delayed for a maximum of 
30 days to allow recovery  from any adverse event. In except ional cases where subjects are 
responding, re -initiation of therapy  after missing > 30 consecut ive d ays of treatment may  be done 
on a case by  [CONTACT_198250] h the BMS medical mo nitor. 
Tumor assessments for all subjects should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Beyond Progression for Sorafenib
Subjects will be permi tted to continue with sorafenib treatm ent beyo nd init ial RECIST 1.1-defined 
progressive disease as lo ng as they  meet the following criteria:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
Subject is tolerat ing sorafenib treatment
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases)
Subject provides written informed consent , at the next clinic visit, prior to receivin g any 
additional sorafenib treatm ent, using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternat ive treatment options.
The assessment of clinical benefit shoul d take into account whether the subject is clinically 
deteri orating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatm ent.The decisio n to 
continue treatm ent beyo nd initial invest igator -assessed progressi on shoul d be discussed with the 
BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study  records.
If the decisio n is taken to continue sorafenib treatment beyo nd pro gression, the subject will remain 
on the tri al and continue to be treated and monitored according to the Time and Events Schedule 
onTable 5.1 -3.
Subjects shoul d discontinue study  therapy upon evidence of further progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden (SLD : sum o f the lo ngest diameters )from t ime 
of initial progressi on (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).New lesions are 
considered measurable if the longest diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymp h 
nodes, which must have a short axis o f at least 15 mm). Any new lesio n considered non-measurable 
may beco me measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest 
diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an 
increase in short axis to at least 15 mm). Sorafenib treatment should be discontinued permane ntly 
upon docum entati on of  further progressi on.
For statistical analyses that include the invest igator -assessed progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment beyond initial invest igator -assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressi on will be 
considered to hav e invest igator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progressi on 
event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Sorafenib Adverse Events 
Toxicit ies attributable to sorafenib shoul d be managed according to the locally approved product 
label or applicable SmPC .52Dose reductions are discussed in Sect ion4.5.3.2 .

Retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening period 
will be permitted (in addition to any  parameters that require a confirmatory  value).
Any new result will override the previous resul t (ie, the mo st current result prior to Randomizat ion) 
and is the value by [CONTACT_53962] n will be assessed, as it represents the subject’s most 
current, clinical state.
Laboratory  param eters and/or assessment sthat are included in Table 5.1 -1, Screening Pro cedural 
Outline may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well -qualified subjects. Consultation with

CT/MRI
Contrast -enhanced Com puted Tomography  (CT) scans acqui red on dedicated CT equipment is
preferred for this study. The CT with contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis including contrast -
enha nced triphasic CT of the abdo men isto be perform edfor tumor assessments until disease 
progression is documented or treatment is discontinued (whichever occurs later). CT scans should 
be acquired with 5 mm slices wit h no intervening gap (con tiguous).
Shou ld a subject have a contraindicat ion for IV contrast, a non-contrast CT of the chest and a
contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained. MRI s should be acquired with 
slice thi ckness of < 5 mm wit h no gap (contiguous).
Every  attem pt shoul d be made to image each subject using an ident ical acquisit ion protocol on the 
same scanner for all imaging t ime points.
Note: Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner:
Combined modalit y scanning such as with FDG -PET/CT i s increasingly used in clinical care, 
and is a modality/technol ogy that is in rapid evolution; therefore, therecommendations 
outlined here may change rather quickly with time. At present, lowdose or attenuation 
correcti on CT porti ons of  a combined FDG -PET/CT are of limited use in anatomically based 
efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggested that theyshoul d not be subst ituted for

5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
Subjects will be asked to complete the EQ-5D-3L and Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy -Hepatobiliary  (FACT -Hep) questionnair e, before any clinical activities are performed 
during on-study  clinic visits and at designated visits during the follow-up phase. The 
questionnaires will be provi ded in the subject’s preferred language and may be administered by 
[CONTACT_198263]-up phase. A standardized script will be used to facilitate telephone 
administration of the EQ-5D.A similar script does not exist for the FACT -Hep, thou gh subjects 
will be provi ded with a hard copy  of the FACT -Hep to take home and use as a visual aid during 
telephone interviews. Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2, Table 5.1-3and Table 5.1-4provi de informat ion 
regarding the timing of pat ient-reported outcomes assessments.
Subjects’ reports of general  health status will be measured using the EQ-5D.These data will be 
collected to assess the impact of nivolumab on generic health status and may be used to inform 
economic evaluat ions of nivo lumab for the treatment of HCC.

to society of his or her current health. Such preference -weight ing systems have been devel oped 
for the [LOCATION_006], US, Spain, [LOCATION_013] , and numerous other popul ations.In addition, the EQ-5D includes 
a visual analog scale that allows respondents to rate their own current health on a 101 -point scale 
ranging from “best imaginable” t o “worst imaginable” healt h.
The FACT -Hep questionnaire will be used to assess the effects of HCC and its treatm ent on 
healt h-related qualit y of life (HRQL). As a generic cancer -related core, the quest ionnaire includes 
the FACT -General (FACT -G) to assess symptom s and treatm ent-related effects impact ing 
physical well -being (PWB; seven items), social/family well -being (SWB; seven items), emotional 
well-being (EWB; six items), and functional well-being (FWB; seven items). In addit ion, the 
FACT -Hep includes an 18-item disease- specific hepatobiliary cancer subscale (HCS) that assesses 
back and stomach pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, anorexia, weight loss, and jaundice. Each item 
israted on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4(very much). Scores for the PWB, 
FWB, SWB, and EWB subscales can be combined to produce a FACT -G total score, which 
provi des an overall indicant of generic HRQL, while the FACT -G and HCS scores can be 
combined to produce a total score for the FACT -Hep, which provi des a compos ite measure of 
general and targeted HRQL. Higher scores indicate better HRQL.
Minimally important differences (MIDs) have been estimated to be 2-3 points for the PWB, FWB, 
SWB, and EWB subscales; 5-6 points for the HCS subscale; 6-[ADDRESS_235920] -G total score; 
and [ADDRESS_235921] -Hep total  score.
Health care resource utilizat ion data will be collected forall rando mized subjects using an interna l 
measure developed for use in previous trials. The questionnaire records informat ion about medica l 
care encounters, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198221], outpati ent visits, diagnostic tests 
and procedures, concomitant medicat ions, and reasons for encounters.
5.8 Other Assessments 
Blood samples for immunogenicit y analyses of nivolumab will be collected according to the 
schedule given in Table 5.5.1 -1. Samples will be evaluated for development of Anti-Drug 
Antibody  (ADA) for nivolumab by [CONTACT_143941]. Samples may also be analyzed for 
neutralizing ADA response to nivo lumab.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical co ndition in aclinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date:  15-Jan-[ADDRESS_235922] a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnorm allaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The ca usal relati onsh ip can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent repor ting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198222] (see NOTE
below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such event s include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an impor tant 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathog enic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, second cancer, and potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) are 
not always serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled as SAEs.
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng pregnancies).

Inform ation to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -

The investigator mustreport any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report mustbe completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship mustbe specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS

7.2 Blinded Radiology Review Committee
In addit ion to local tumor assessments, images from this study will undergo a blinded, independent  
central  review (BICR) to assess response based on the RECIST 1.1 assessment criteria. The 
centrally  reviewed response data will be used in the analyses of ORR, PFS, durati on of  objective 
response, and time to response. All final determinat ions on centrally  reviewed image- based

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The sample size determinat ion of this study  is based on OS comparison between subjects 
rando mized to receive nivo lumab and sorafenib. Wit h a total  of 726 subjects randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to receive nivolumab or sorafenib, approximately  91.5% power will be achieved with an 
overall type I error 0.05. The sample size determinati on is based on simulat ion using R v3.2. Below 
are details of the sample size determinat ion.
General assumptions:
There are assumed 39% HCV- infected subjects among all ra ndomized subjects.
In the sorafenib arm, median OS is 10 months for non -HCV infected and 14 months for HCV 
infected.
Exponential distribut ion is assumed for OS in each randomized arm.
Estimated c umulated enro llment of rando mized su bjects i s available in t he SAP.  
Sample size determination for OS
Based on simulat ions under the assumpt ions stated above, approximately  [ADDRESS_235934] 520 OS events are observed in order to provide 91.5% 
power for a hazard ratio of 0.74 with a two-sided type I error of  0.05. This accounts for a group 
sequent ial testing procedure with one interim analysis and one final analysis. 
The interim analysis will be conducted when 80% OS events are observed. The alpha allocatio n 
for the interim and final analyses is based on the Lan -DeMets alpha spending funct ion approach 
using an O’Brien -Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_198223] a two-sided overall type 1 error of 
5%. The stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_198224]. However, if the interim analysis is performed exact ly when 80% 
OS events are observed, then 0.[ADDRESS_235935] ically significant 
improvement of nivo lumab at the interim analysis of OS; and an observed hazard rati o of 0.84 or

OS.  
Analysis Timing Projections
As stated above, approximately 726 subjects will be rando mized to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 
ratio.
It will take approximately  13 m onths to com plete the randomization.
OS interim analysis is projected to occur when there are at least 416 deaths (80% of target 
events) among approximately  [ADDRESS_235936]’s randomization date (13 months for rando mizat ion and 12 months for surviva l 
follow-up).
OS final analysis is projected t o occur when there are at least [ADDRESS_235937]’s rando mizat ion date 
(13 m onths for randomization and 20 months for survival fo llow-up).
8.2 Populations for Analyses
All analyses will  be perf ormed using the treatm ent group as randomized (intent -to-treat) wi th the 
exception of extent of exposure (dosing) and safety , for whi ch the treatm ent group as treated will 
be used. If a subject is rando mized to nivo lumab and receives a t least [ADDRESS_235938]’s treatm ent group is consi dered nivolumab. Similarly, if a subject is 
rando mized to sorafenib and receives at least [ADDRESS_235939]’s treatm ent

Enrolled Subjects: Subjects who signed an informed consent form and were registered into 
the IVRS.
Randomized Subjects: Subjects who were randomized to any treatm ent group in the study . 
This is the da taset for analyses of study  conduct, study  populati on and efficacy.
Treated Subjects: Subjects who received at least one dose of nivo lumab or sorafenib. This is 
the dataset for analyses of exposure and safet y.
PK Subjects: Subjects with available serum  time-concentrati on data from rando mized 
subjects dosed with nivo lumab.
PD-L1 Measurable Subjects: Randomized subjects with a measurable PD-L1 expressio n 
resul t (ie, excludes indeterminate and unknown)

8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of OS
A group sequential testing procedure will be applied to OS to control the overall type I error for 
interim and final analyses (overall alpha=0.0 5). The distribut ion of OS will be compared in the 
two randomized arms at the interim and final analyses via a two -sided, log-rank test stratified by 
[CONTACT_198268] -DeMets al pha spending function wit h 
O’Brien and Fleming ty pe of  boundary. The hazard rati o and the corresponding 100x (1-adjusted 
alpha)% CI will be est imated in a stratified Cox proportional hazards model using rando mized arm 
as a single covariate. The OS curves for each randomized arm will be estimated using the KM 
product limit method. The two-sided 95% CIs for median OS will be computed by [CONTACT_198269] (using log-log transform ation). In additional, survival  rates at select 
milestones will be computed as well as the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs using the log-log 
transformation .
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of ORR
ORR based on BICR assessment per RECIST 1.1 between the two randomized arms will be 
compared using a two-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_198270]. The associated odds ratio and CI will also be calculated. ORR along with its 95% exact CI

1.1 Measurability of Tumor
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed measurable or non-measurable as 
follows. All baseline evaluat ions shoul d be performed as close as possible to th e treatm ent start 
and never more than [ADDRESS_235957] one dimensio n (longest diameter in 
the plane of the measurement to be record ed) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_235958] scan -(CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461]  (lesio ns which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers shoul d be recorded as non -measurable)
[ADDRESS_235959] x -ray
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologi cally enlarged and measurable, a lymp h 
node must be [ADDRESS_235960] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and fo llowed.
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.
Speci al considerat ions regarding lesio n measurabilit y
Bone lesions:
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure 
bone lesio ns. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesio ns.
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed lyt ic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h ident ifiable so ft tissue co mponents, that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_198277] y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.

Cystic lesions:
Lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts shoul d not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_154020], simple cysts.
‘Cyst ic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesio ns, 
if they meet the definit ion of measurabili ty described above. However, if non-cystic lesions 
are present in the same pat ient, these are preferred for selection as target lesio ns.
Lesions with prior local treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco 
regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesio n.
Non-measurable lesions are all other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (longest diameter < 10 mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as non -measurable lesions. 
Lesio ns considered non -measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardia l 
effusio n, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung, abdo minal 
masses/abdo minal organomegaly  identified by [CONTACT_54038].
1.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
ident ified and reported l esion at baseline and during follow-up. Im aging based evaluat ion shoul d 
always be performed rather than clinical examinatio n unless the lesio n(s) being followed cannot 
be imaged b ut are assessable by [CONTACT_198278].
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to m easure lesions selected 
for response assessment. Measurabilit y of lesions on CT scan is based on the assum ption that CT 
slice thickness is [ADDRESS_235961] x -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest x -ray, particularly when progression is an important 
endpo int, since CT is m ore sensit ive than x -ray, parti cularly in ident ifying new lesio ns. However, 
lesions on chest x-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly  defined and surrounded 
by [CONTACT_92387] l ung.
Clinical lesio ns: Clinical lesio ns will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
[ADDRESS_235962] ive and may be reviewed at the end of the study.

Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a 
method of measurement. If new lesio ns are identified by [CONTACT_12153] , 
confirmat ion by [CONTACT_462] i s advised.
Endoscopy , laparoscopy : The utilizat ion of these techniques for obj ective tumor evaluat ion is not 
advised.
Tumor markers: Tum or m arkers al one cannot be used to assess object ive tumor response.
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS
Target lesions: When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesio ns total (and amaximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all 
involved organs shoul d be ident ified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at 
baseline.
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of 
15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. All 
other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but< 15 mm) should be considered non -
target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathol ogical and shoul d 
not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis fornodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will  be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any object ive tumor regression in the measurable 
dimensio n of the disease.
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathol ogical  lymph nodes 
shoul d be ident ified as non-target l esions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements 
are not required and these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’ , ‘absent’, or ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg,‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver m etastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION AND RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of Target L esions
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Parti al Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum o f diameters of target lesio ns, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.

Clinical Pro tocol CA209459
BMS -936558 nivolumab
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study ). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.
Stabl e Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage from the baseline study  to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes ident ified as target lesio ns shoul d always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded and shoul d be measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examinat ion, even if the nodes regress to below 10mm on study . This means that 
when lymph nodes are included as target lesio ns, the ‘sum’ o f lesio ns may not be zero even if 
complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis 
of <10 mm.
Target lesions that become ‘too small to meas ure’: All lesions (nodal  and non-nodal ) 
recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual  measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluat ion, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radio logist is able to provide an actual 
measure, that should be recorded, ev en if it is below [ADDRESS_235963] measure to then:
(i)if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_198228], the measurement 
shoul d be recorded as 0 mm.
(ii)if the lesion isbelieved to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default  
value of 5 mm shoul d be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5  m m shoul d be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This defaul t value is derived from the [ADDRESS_235964] slice thickness 
(but should not be changed wit h varying CT slice thickness).
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters o f the fragmented portions should be added together to cal culate the target l esion sum . 
Similarly, as lesio ns coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that woul d aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesio ns have coalesced such that 
they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance shoul d be the 
maximal lo ngest di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesio n’.
3.2 Evaluation of Non-target L esions
While so me non -target lesio ns may actually be m easurable, they need not be measured and instead 
shoul d be assessed only qualitat ively at the time points specified in the protocol.
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alizat ion of tumor 
marker l evel. All lymph nodes mu st be non -patho logical in size (< 10 mm short axis).

Non-CR/Non -PD: Persi stence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progressio n of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progression).
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
When the patient also has measurable disease : To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the 
basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substant ial worsening in 
non-target di sease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor 
burden has increased sufficient ly to merit disconti nuation of therapy . A modest ‘increase’ in 
the size of one or m ore non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivo cal 
progression status.
When the patient has only non -measurable disease : To achi eve ‘unequivocal progression’ on 
the bas is of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level o f substant ial worsening such 
that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy . A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
qualify  for unequivocal progression status. Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be 
easily  quantified (by [CONTACT_154020]: if all lesio ns are non-measurable) a useful test that can be 
applied when assessing patients for unequiv ocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in 
overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in 
magnitude to the increase that would be requi red to decl are PD f or m easurable disease: ie, an 
increase in tumor burden represent ing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is 
equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase 
in a pleural effusio n fro m ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangit ic disease fro m localized 
to widespread, or may  be described in protocol s as ‘sufficient to requi re a change in therapy’. 
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the pati ent shoul d be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point.
3.3 New L esions
The appearance o f new malignant lesio ns denotes disease progression. The finding of a new lesio n 
shoul d be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply  healing or flare of pre -exist ing lesions). Thi s is particularly important 
when the pat ient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a 
liver l esion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cy stic lesion, which i t is not.
A lesio n ident ified on a follow -up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the pat ient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be constituted PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.

4.2 Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable 
(NE) at that time po int. If only a subset of lesio n measurements are made at an assessment, usually 
the case is also consi dered NE at that tim e point, unless a convincing argum ent can be made that 
the contribut ion of the individual missing lesio n(s) woul d not change the assigned time point 
response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.

aIf a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
4.4 Special notes on response assessment
When nodal  disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are norm al in order not to overstate progression shoul d it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may  not 
have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).
Patients wi th a global deteri oration of  heal th status requi ring di scont inuat ion of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progressi on at that time shoul d be reported as ‘symptomatic 
deteri oration’. Every effort shoul d be made to docum ent objective progressi on even after 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent. Symptomatic deteriorat ion is not a descriptor of an object ive 
response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_45806] . The obj ective response status of such pati ents

is to be determi ned by [CONTACT_198279] -target disease as shown in Appendix Table 1 
and Table 2.
For equivocal findings of progression (eg. very small and uncertain new lesio ns; cyst ic changes or 
necrosis in exist ing lesions), treatm ent may  cont inue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the 
next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier 
date when progression was suspected.
5 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
5.1 Duration of response
Duration of overall response: The durati on of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement cri teria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is object ively docum ented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest m easurements recorded on study ).
The duration of overall co mplete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is object ively documented.
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatm ent 
(inrando mized trials, from date of rando mizat ion) unt il the criteria for progression are met, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the refer ence for 
calculat ion of PD).
5.2 Lesions that Disappear and Reappear
If a lesi on disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should cont inue to be measured. 
However, the patient’s response at the point in time when the lesio n reappears will depend upon 
the status of his/her other lesio ns. For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR status 
and the lesio n reappeared, then the pat ient would be considered PD at the time of reappearance. In 
contrast, if the tumour status was a PR or SD and one l esion which had disappeared then reappears, 
its maximal diameter shoul d be added to the sum of the remaining lesio ns for a calculated response: 
in other words, the reappearance of an apparent ly ‘disappeared’ single lesio n amongst many which 
remain is not i n itself enough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum o f all lesio ns to meet the PD 
criteria. The rati onale for such a categori zation is based upon the realizati on that most lesions do 
not actually ‘disappear’ but are not visualized because they are bey ond the resol ving power of the 
imaging modalit y emplo yed.

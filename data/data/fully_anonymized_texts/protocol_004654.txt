Protocol Title: An Open-Label Safety Study of Retinal Gene Therapy for Choroideremia with 
Bilateral, Sequential Administration of Adeno-Associated Viral Vector (AAV2) Encoding Rab 
Escort Protein 1 (REP1)
Protocol Number: NSR-REP-02
Study centres: The study will be conducted at approximately 5 study centres in Europe and 
[LOCATION_002].
Study period (years): 
Estimated overall study duration: 12 months of follow-up 
for each eyePhase of development: Phase 2
Study Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of bilateral, sequential sub-
retinal administration of a single dose of AAV2-REP1 in adult male subjects with choroideremia 
(CHM).
Primary Endpoint: The safety of bilateral administration of AAV2-REP1 will be evaluated 
with the following safety measures:
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as measured by [CONTACT_319752] (ETDRS) chart
Ophthalmic examination assessments (including intraocular pressure [IOP], slit lamp 
examination, lens opacity grading and dilated ophthalmoscopy)
Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
Fundus autofluorescence (AF)
Fundus photography
Microperimetry
Adverse event (AE) reporting 
Vector shedding post-treatment
Immunogenicity sampling post-treatment 
Vital signs
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints will include:
Change from Baseline in BCVA as measured by [CONTACT_319753] 
Change from Baseline in AF
Change from Baseline in SD-OCT
Change from Baseline in microperimetry
Study Design: This is a multi-centre, open-label, prospective, 2-period, bilateral interventional 
safety study of AAV2-REP1 in adult male subjects with genetically confirmed CHM.  The study 
will consist of a Screening Period followed by 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2) with up 
to 9 visits per period.  During the Screening Period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility of both 
eyes.  The Investigator will assign the order in which the eyes are treated (i.e., study eye 1 [SE1]-
Period 1 and study eye 2 [SE2]- Period 2, respectively) with a number assigned to each eye.  This 
will be done in collaboration with the subject; however, the worse eye will generally be selected 
for first treatment. Study eye selection and eligibility for surgery will then be confirmed 
collectively by [CONTACT_319754], which includes the Investigator, a 
consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). The estimated 
target interval between the surgical procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be determined at the 
Screening Visit.
Each study eye will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_394556]-treatment, for up to 9 visits per 
treatment period: Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit); Visit 2 (Day 1, post-operative follow-up 
visit); Visit 3 (Day 3 + [ADDRESS_394557]-operative follow-up visit); Visit 4 (Day 7 -1/+2 days); Visit 5

6(Day 14 ± 3 days); Visit 6 (Month 1 ± 7 days); Visit 7 (Month 3 ± 14 days); Visit 8 (Month 6 ± 14 
days) and Visit 9 (Month 12 ± 14 days; end of study visit).
At Period 1, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE1), subjects will undergo a vitrectomy with 
retinal detachment and receive a sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in SE1.  Visits 2-9 will then 
be conducted according to the Schedule of Study Procedures, unless Period 2 commences during 
this time, in which case, the study visits will follow the schedule for SE2.  Ophthalmic 
assessments during Period 1, Visits 2-9 will be performed on both eyes. 
The interval between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to vary among subjects from weeks to 
many months.  While the interval will be decided on a case-by-case basis, an effort will be made 
to schedule varying treatment intervals in order to better characterise the immunological and 
safety profile of sequential treatment administration.  Thus, approximately 20 subjects each will 
be treated with a short (<6 month), medium (6-12 months), or long (>12 month) surgery window 
between treatment of the first and second eye.  Because the timing of the second surgery visit 
(Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among subjects, the duration of study Period [ADDRESS_394558] be conducted within 10 weeks prior to SE2 surgery 
(Period 2, Visit 1).  Eligibility for SE2 surgery will then be confirmed collectively by [CONTACT_319755], which includes the Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the 
Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). If, at that time, the BCVA in SE2 is <34 
ETDRS letters, surgery may be performed when, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_319713]: 1) the subject is found eligible by [CONTACT_319756], and 2) the 
subject is considered an appropriate candidate who has potentially modifiable disease. 
At Period 2, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE2), subjects will undergo a vitrectomy with 
retinal detachment and sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in the contralateral, untreated eye 
(SE2).  Post-treatment, subjects will no longer follow the Period 1 visit schedule, but will instead 
attend Period 2, Visits 2-9 according to the Schedule of Study Procedures. Ophthalmic 
assessments scheduled for Period 2, Visits 2-9 will be performed on both eyes. 
Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study; assessments are outlined in 
the Schedule of Study Procedures.  Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery 
if deemed clinically necessary.  If cataract surgery is performed, it should be carried out at least 
4 weeks before Month 12 (Visit 9) for the respective eye.  The cataract surgery timing must be 
discussed with the medical monitor prior to the procedure.
Number of Subjects (Planned): Approximately 60 subjects are planned for the study.
Inclusion Criteria: During the Screening Period, subjects will be found eligible for study 
participation if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria. 
1. Are willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study to have both 
eyes treated
2. Are male and ≥[ADDRESS_394559] a BCVA of ≥34 ETDRS letters (20/200 or better Snellen acuity) in both eyes, or in 
the untreated eye, if the other eye was previously treated with AAV2-REP1*
*If previously treated with AAV2-REP1 in an antecedent study, subjects may be eligible 
for participation following Sponsor approval. 
6. For subjects who received treatment with AAV2-REP1 in an antecedent study, have 
biological samples available to complete an adequate immunology profile
Exclusion Criteria: At the Screening Visit, subjects will be found not eligible for study 
participation if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria. 
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394560] any other significant ocular or non-ocular disease/disorder which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_319714], may either put the subjects at 
risk because of participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the 
subject’s ability to participate in the study.  This includes but is not limited to a potential 
subject:
with a contraindication to oral corticosteroid (e.g. prednisolone/prednisone)
with clinically significant cataract in either eye
who, in the clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_319715], is not an appropriate candidate for sub-retinal surgery (see the 
Patient Eligibility Review Plan)
5. Have participated in another research study involving an investigational product in the 
past 12 weeks or received a gene/cell-based therapy at any time previously, except if 
treated within in an antecedent study with AAV2-REP1.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration: For each eye, subjects will undergo 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment and receive a sub-retinal injection of up to 0.1 mL of study 
drug containing 1×10^11 AAV2-REP1 genome particles (gp).  
Reference Therapy (Comparator), Dosage, and Mode of Administration: Not Applicable.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Safety: The safety evaluation will be based on BCVA (as measured by [CONTACT_319753]); full 
ophthalmic examination (including IOP, slit lamp examination, lens opacity grading and dilated 
ophthalmoscopy); SD-OCT; fundus AF; fundus photography; microperimetry; AE reporting; 
vector shedding and immunogenicity; and vital signs.
Efficacy: The efficacy evaluation will be based on BCVA (as measured by [CONTACT_319753]); 
fundus AF; SD-OCT and microperimetry.
Statistical Methodology: No formal sample size calculation will be performed.
Continuous variables will be summarised over time using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, 
standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals [CI], median, first and third quartiles, fifth and 
ninety-fifth percentiles, minimum, and maximum).  Categorical variables will be described over 
time using counts, percentages, and 95% CIs.  Summaries will be tabulated by [CONTACT_319757].  No 
formal statistical testing will be performed. 
AEs will be summarised by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and eye.  The number of eyes with 
an AE, as well as the number of events, will be summarised, by [CONTACT_319758].    Similar 
summaries will be produced for study drug/procedure-related AEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and serious AEs.  AEs will also be summarised by [CONTACT_764], 
relationship to study drug/procedure, and time to onset and resolution.  Vector shedding and 
immune response profiles will be described.
The remaining safety evaluations will be analysed using descriptive statistics.

125 INTRODUCTION
5.1 Choroideremia
Choroideremia (CHM) is a rare, bilateral, untreatable retinal degeneration that begins in 
childhood with loss of night vision, and gradually progresses to blindness by [CONTACT_319759].  
CHM is caused by [CONTACT_319760] 1 (REP1), which 
is located on the X-chromosome (Cremers, van de Pol et al. 1990, Seabra, Brown et al. 1993).  
The disease has an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance, affects approximately 1 in 50,000 
people, and is mostly caused by [CONTACT_319761] (null) mutations (Sankila, Tolvanen et al. 
1992, MacDonald, Russell et al. 2009).
5.2 Gene Therapy with Adeno-Ass
ociated Viral (AAV) Vectors
Gene therapy is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_319716] a promising approach for the treatment of incurable 
retinal diseases ( Bryant, Duker et al. 2012, Boye, Boye et al. 2013).  Gene therapy medicinal 
products (GTMPs) are a type of advanced therapy medicinal product defined as medicines 
derived from genes and cells (EMA 2015).  GTMPs contain or consist of recombinant nucleic 
acid delivered via a viral vector to targeted cells.  The central goal of gene therapy is to 
replace non-functional or defective genes with new genes that are fully functional so that the 
level of genetic expression can return to normal.
The eye is particularly well suited for gene therapy because of its accessibility, relative 
immune privilege status, small size, compartmentalisation and the presence of a fellow 
control eye (Boye, Boye et al. 2013).  The eye is one of the few relatively immunologically-
privileged sites in the body, so vectors used in gene therapy are unlikely to cause a significant 
systemic immune response.  It has long been established that to maintain the transparent 
structures required for vision, the eye has conserved a number of adaptations that selectively 
diminish the immune response (Streilein 2003).  For example, complement-fixing antibodies, 
neutrophils and macrophages are generally excluded from mitigation of an inflammatory 
response to limit the formation of opacities.  Anatomically, the retina is protected by [CONTACT_319762]-retinal barrier to minimise the circulation of immune cells (Streilein 2003).  Studies 
have demonstrated that antigens introduced to the vitreous and sub-retinal space exhibit a 
reduced immune response due to the varied cytokine environment and the presence of 
molecules that suppress the immune system (Stein-Strelein and Watte 2007). 
Given the defined volume of the eye, the amount of viral vector needed to achieve a 
therapeutic effect will likely be small, reducing the risk of toxicity and increasing the 
likelihood of being able to manufacture quantities of vector sufficient to treat the retina.  The 
eye also allows for localised treatment without intravenous delivery, thus decreasing the 
chance of systemic absorption and toxicity.  Finally, the effects of localised ocular treatments 
can be easily observed and monitored for efficacy and safety, something that cannot be 
readily done with systemic conditions (Bryant, Duker et al. 2012).
The most commonly used deli
very system for retinal gene therapy is the adeno-associated 
virus (AAV), and numerous early phase clinical trials using AAV vectors are currently 
underway for potential treatment of various retinal diseases (Boye, Boye et al. 2013, 
MacLaren, Groppe et al. 2014, Edwards, Jolly et al. 2016).  AAVs remain in the nucleus as 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_319717], thereby [CONTACT_319763].  AAVs allow for stable and long term transgene expression in 
different retinal cells, including photoreceptors, retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_319718], ganglion 
and Müller cells (Vanderberghe and Auricchio 2012, Day, By[CONTACT_129120]. 2014).  Lastly, AAVs

13elicit a minimal immune response as supported by [CONTACT_319764]-clinical and 
clinical studies.  
One non-clinical study evaluated immunological and functional consequences of adeno-
associated viral vector type 2 (AAV2) vector re-administration to the contralateral eye in 
dogs and non-human primates ( Amado, Mingozzi et al. 2010).  In this study, rAAV2-
hRPE65v2 administered to the untreated, contralateral eye [ADDRESS_394568] injection 
was found to be both efficacious and safe.  The study demonstrated that cell-mediated 
immune responses were benign, with only 1 of 10 animals in the study developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
persistent T cell immune response to AAV2, a response that was mediated by [CONTACT_398]4+ T cells.  
Sequential bilateral injection caused minimal inflammation and improved visual function in 
affected animals.  The authors concluded that sub-retinal re-administration of AAV2 is safe 
even in the setting of pre-existing immunity to the vector, a parameter that has been used to 
exclude patients from gene therapy trials.  In another non-clinical study in rats, lack of 
apparent immunogenicity was observed following same-day bilateral administration of 
6×10^9 genome particles (gp)/eye of adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2) encoding Rab 
escort protein 1 (AAV2-REP1) (CharlesRiverLabs 2015).  This total antigen exposure 
following bilateral dosing is comparable to a unilateral dose of 1.2×10^10 gp, which equates 
to a 1.2×10^12 gp dose in humans. This provides a 12-fold immunogenic safety margin 
compared to the planned clinical dose of 1×10^11 gp.
In the clinical setting, repeat administration of AAV2-RPE65 to the contralateral eye of 
children and adults was also shown to be safe, irrespective of baseline immune status 
(Bennett, Wellman et al. 2016). In this study, 11 children and adults with Leber’s congenital 
amaurosis received a single sub-retinal administration of AAV2-RPE65 at a dose of 
1.5×10^11 gp (1.7-4.6 years after initial sub-retinal injection) to the contralateral, previously 
untreated eye.  No adverse events (AEs) related to AAV2 vector were reported, and humoral 
and cell-mediated responses to AAV2 capsid and RPE65 transgene were benign in all 
patients.  Two individuals who had high pre-existing neutralizing AAV2-antibodies did not 
experience an inflammatory response in either eye following contralateral eye administration.  
AAV2-RPE65, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (LUXTURNA™, Spark Therapeutics, Inc), has 
been approved in the US and the EU as the first adeno-associated virus vector type 2 
(AAV2)-based gene therapy indicated for the treatment of patients with confirmed bi-allelic 
RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.
5.[ADDRESS_394569].  NightstaRx is developi[INVESTIGATOR_319719]2-REP1 
as a potential GTMP for the treatment of CHM.  AAV2-REP1 is a recombinant  AAV2 
particle encapsulating 1.962kB complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of the wild-
type human REP1 gene.  Non-clinical studies with AAV2-REP1 have been very promising 
(Tolmachova, Tolmachov et al. 2013).  AAV2-REP1 expresses high levels of human REP1 
protein, res
tores REP1 to human CHM fibroblasts, provides functional rescue of human 
CHM cells, expresses protein in the retina of CHM mice in vivo, and is non-toxic when over-
expressed by [CONTACT_319765].  Further, over-expression of the human REP1 protein does not 
significantly affect retinal function (Tolmachova, Tolmachov et al. 2013).
In 2011, an investigator-sponsored, first-in-human study of AAV2-REP1 was initiated in 
adult male patients with CHM.  The first 6 patients were treated with a single sub-retinal 
injection of 1×10^10 gp in 1 eye (MacLaren, Groppe et al. 2014).  Six months after receiving 
AAV2-REP1, [ADDRESS_394570] corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (i.e., >4 and >2 lines of vision, respectively).  All other 
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394571]-treatment.  From 
a safety perspective, the GTMP and surgical application method appeared to be generally 
well tolerated.  A second cohort of 8 patients was treated with a single sub-retinal injection of 
1×10^11 gp in 1 eye.  Following favorable results, 3 other investigator-sponsored studies 
were then initiated in which a total of 26 adult male CHM patients received a single sub-
retinal injection of 1×10^[ADDRESS_394572] visual acuity (VA), considering both maintenance and 
stabilization of vision in the majority of subjects, as well as improvement of vision in subsets 
of CHM subjects for up to [ADDRESS_394573] of AAV2-REP1 for treating CHM.  
These findings lend support to further assessment of AAV2 gene therapy in the treatment of 
CHM.  NightstaRx is currently sponsoring a multi-centre, global Phase 3 study of a single 
subretinal administration of AAV2-REP1 for the treatment of CHM  (NSR-REP-01, the 
STAR study, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
Considering that CHM affects both eyes, exploration of bilateral AAV2-REP1 administration 
is desirable.  As noted, emerging data from non-clinical and clinical studies with AAV2 
vectors demonstrate that these vectors illicit a minimal immune response, including after 
bilateral administration.  The aim of this study is to provide important insight into the safety 
and tolerability of sequential, bilateral treatment with AAV2-REP1.
5.4 Risk / Benefit Assessment
No treatment currently exists for CHM.
The non-clinical studies conducted with AAV2-REP1 showed that it provides efficient and 
functional transgene expression in CHM mouse and human cells, as well as in mouse and 
human RPE and photoreceptors, without overt toxicity.  Results from the 26-week single-
dose combined toxicity/biodistribution study conducted in rats indicate that administration of 
AAV2-REP1 by [CONTACT_319766]-retinal injection to both eyes is well tolerated at dose levels of 
1×10^9 and 6×10^9 gp/eye (equal to 1×10^11 and 6×10^11 gp/eye in humans) when 
evaluated 4 and 26 weeks after injection.  Minor reductions in some ERG parameters, ocular 
inflammation, and microscopic signs of retinal/corneal degeneration were observed and were 
considered procedure-related or not biologically significant.
In humans, application of AAV2-REP1 to the surface of the retina requires retinal 
detachment via vitrectomy.  The 2-step procedure employed in delivering AAV2-REP1 sub-
retinally (see Section 9.4), allows the management of unexpected surgical complications of 
retinal detachment before the AAV2-REP1 is applied. Furthermore, since the volume of fluid 
required to detach the fovea is variable, by [CONTACT_319767], and 
administering the vector after successful retinal detachment has been achieved, a precise, 
consistent dose in terms of genome particles can be applied into the sub-retinal space.  
Nevertheless, sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 carries the risks associated with 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment, which include intra-operative and post-operative 
complications; infection (most notably infectious endophthalmitis); low and elevated IOP; 
choroidal detachment; persistent retinal detachment, retinal tears, holes and breaks; macular 
hole and macular oedema; vitreous haemorrhage; visual impairment; metamorphopsia; and 
photopsia (Park, Marcus et al. 1995, Thompson, Sjaarda et al. 1996, Banker, Freeman et al.

Recchia, Scott et al. 2010).  Post-operative intraocular inflammation caused by [CONTACT_319768].  Another 
complication of vitrectomy is cataract formation, which may require an additional surgical 
procedure (cataract extraction) (Park, Marcus et al. 1995, Cheng, Azen et al. 2001, Recchia, 
Scott et al. 2010).  In addition, the surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia, 
which includes the risks of dizziness, confusion, nausea and vomiting.
Loss of VA has been observed post-treatment with AAV2-REP1.  This VA loss was 
determined by [CONTACT_319769]2-REP1, 
however without definitively attributing the cause to either the study procedure or the GTMP.  
Complications from the surgical procedure are expected and are not considered reportable as 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) unless also assessed to be at least 
possibly related to AAV2-REP1.  The Reference Safety Information described in the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure for AAV2-REP1 defines visual acuity reduced  as an 
expected serious adverse drug reaction, with a frequency of 4/79 (5.1%), defined as common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10).  Loss of VA is considered an identified risk of AAV2-REP1. 
Inflammation is a potential risk of AAV2-REP1. 
See the Investigator’s Brochure for further details.
Thus, although there are risks associated with the administration of the study treatment via 
vitrectomy and retinal detachment, the potential for benefit in the form of improved VA that 
may be provided to subjects with CHM following treatment with AAV2-REP1 provides an 
acceptable risk-benefit profile for participation in this study.

Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394574] of a Screening Period followed by 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2) with up 
to 9 visits per treatment period.  A second baseline visit prior to surgery of SE2 (Period 2, 
Visit 1) may be required.  A study schematic is presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Overall Study Schematic
During the Screening Period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility of both eyes.  The 
Investigator will assign the order in which the eyes are treated (i.e., study eye 1 [SE1]-Period 
1 and study eye 2 [SE2]-Period 2, respectively) with a number assigned to each eye.  This 
will be done in collaboration with the subject; however, the worse eye will generally be 
selected for first treatment.  Study eye selection and eligibility for surgery will then be 
confirmed collectively by [CONTACT_319754], which includes the 
Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). 
The estimated target interval between the surgical procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be 
determined at the Screening Visit.
Each study eye will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_394575]-treatment, for up to 9 visits per 
treatment period: Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit); Visit 2 (Day 1, post-operative follow-
up visit); Visit 3 (Day 3 + 2 Days); Visit 4 (Day 7 -1/+2 Days); Visit 5 (Day 14 ± 3 Days); 
Visit 6 (Month 1 ± 7 Days); Visit 7 (Month 3 ± 14 Days); Visit 8 (Month 6 ±14 Days) and 
Visit 9 (Month 12 ± 14 Days; end of study visit).
At Period 1, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE1), subjects will undergo a vitrectomy 
with retinal detachment and receive a sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in SE1.  Visits 2-9 
will then be conducted according to the Schedule of Study Procedures, unless Period 2 
commences during the time of follow-up for SE; in which case, the study visits will continue 
following the schedule for SE2.  Ophthalmic assessments during Period 1, Visits 2-9 will be 
performed on both eyes.
The interval between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to vary among subjects from  weeks 
to many months.  While the interval will be decided on a case-by-case basis, an effort will be 
made to schedule varying treatment intervals in order to better characterise the 
immunological and safety profile of sequential treatment administration.  Thus, 
approximately 20 subjects each will be treated with a short- (<6 month), medium- (6-12 
months), or long- (>12 month) surgery window between treatment of the first and second

18eye.  Because the timing of the second surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among 
subjects, the duration of study Period [ADDRESS_394576] be conducted within 10 weeks prior to SE2 surgery 
(Period 2, Visit 1).  If these assessments are not available within the required timeframe, a 
Baseline Visit must be added to collect current baseline data on SE2.  Study eye selection and 
eligibility for surgery will then be confirmed collectively by [CONTACT_319771], which includes the Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the 
Patient Eligibility Review Plan).  If, at that time, BCVA in SE2 is <34 ETDRS letters, 
surgery may be performed when, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_319720]: 
1) the subject is found eligible by [CONTACT_319756], and 2) the subject 
is considered an appropriate candidate who has potentially modfiable disease.
At Period 2, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit for SE2) subjects will undergo a vitrectomy 
with retinal detachment and sub-retinal injection of AAV2-REP1 in the contralateral, 
untreated eye (SE2).  Post-treatment, subjects will no longer follow the Period 1 visit 
schedule, but will instead attend Period 2, Visits 2-9 according to the Schedule of Study 
Procedures.  Ophthalmic assessments scheduled for Period 2, Visits 2-9 will be performed on 
both eyes. 
Study data will thus be collected for both eyes.  Subjects will be assessed for safety and 
efficacy throughout the study, as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures (Table 1).  
The safety evaluation will be based on a full ophthalmic examination (indirect 
ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, IOP, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation 
grading and lens opacities classification system [LOCS] III cataract grading); fundus 
photography; AE reporting; vector shedding and immunogenicity assessment and vital signs.  
The efficacy evaluation will be based on BCVA (as measured by [CONTACT_319753]), AF, SD-
OCT and microperimetry.  Any safety information collected as a result of the efficacy 
assessments (e.g., BCVA) will also be used in the overall safety evaluation, as applicable.
Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery if deemed clinically necessary.  
If cataract surgery is performed, it should be carried out at least 4 weeks before Month 12 
(Visit 9) for the respective eye.  The cataract surgery timing must be discussed with the 
medical monitor prior to the procedure.
A subject is considered to have completed the study if he completes Period 2, Visit 9 
(Month 12).  The end of the trial is the date the last subject completes Period 2, Visit 9 
(Month 12) assessments (or early termination [ET] assessments in the event of premature 
discontinuation) or the date of last data collection if the last subject is lost to follow-up.  After 
study completion, subjects will be invited to participate in a long-term safety follow-up study 
that will permit continued safety and efficacy monitoring over an extended period of time 
post-treatment.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394577]’s untreated eye will be assessed for eligibility per 
Section  8.  Following the Screening Visit and determination of eligibility, the subject will 
move directly into Period [ADDRESS_394578] eye in the 
previous study.  These subjects will require Sponsor approval before being enrolled into the 
study.
7.2 Discussion of Design
Since CHM is a bilateral disease, this open-label study is being conducted to assess the safety 
of AAV2-REP1 administered to both eyes of subjects with CHM.  All enrolled subjects will 
receive treatment with AAV2-REP1 at a dose of 1×10^11 AAV2-REP1 gp/eye. Bilateral sub-
retinal administration of AAV2-REP1 was explored in a pre-clinical toxicology study in rats 
and was found to be well tolerated and not associated with drug-related AEs.  Furthermore, 
sequential sub-retinal administration of an AAV2 vector to the contralateral eye in children 
and adults with Leber's congenital amaurosis was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, 
irrespective of baseline immune status (Bennett, Wellman et al. 2016).
The planned sample size (approximately 60 subjects, with a total of 120 treated eyes) is 
considered sufficient to characterise the immunological, vector shedding, and safety profiles 
of bilateral retinal gene therapy with AAV2-REP1.  A prospective trial period of at least 
12 months following the administration of AAV2-REP1 in each eye is considered a sufficient 
period of time to observe any treatment related safety concerns.  
The dose of vector being employed in this study is based on previous clinical trials using the 
AAV2 vector with a chicken β actin (CBA) promoter (Maguire, High et al. 2009, MacLaren, 
Groppe et al. 2014), and the Phase 1 / 2 investigator-sponsored clinical studies in which 
AAV2-REP1 was administered to subjects with CHM (MacLaren, Groppe et al. 2014) 
(Dimopolous, Hoang et al. 2018, Fischer, Ochakovski et al. 2018, Lam, Davis et al. 2019).
Application of AA
V2-REP1 to the retina requires retinal detachment following vitrectomy.  
The risks of vitrectomy and retinal detachment are summarized in Section 5.4.
In line with guidance from regulatory agencies, the treatment intervals were chosen to 
comprehensively characterise the immunological profile following bilateral, sequential 
AAV2-REP1 treatment, and to reflect real-world application of gene therapy.  As noted, both 
preclinical data with AAV2-REP1, and clinical data with sub-retinal administration of an 
AAV2 vector in subjects with Leber's congenital amaurosis, support bilateral administration 
of AAV2-REP1 in humans.
To minimise inflammation resulting from surgery, and potential or unexpected immune 
responses to vector/transgene, all subjects will be given a course of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone, initiated 2 days prior to surgery on both SE1 and SE2.  The regimen 
has been modified from the 17-day protocol established in the Philadelphia AAV gene 
therapy clinical trial (Maguire, Simonelli et al. 2008), with the allowance of an extra 4 days 
for tapering the dose at the end of the course.  The corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day (for 
a maximum of 80 mg/daily) prednisone/prednisolone for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days 
before the vector injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7 days); followed by

withdrawn due to an AE, the Investigator will arrange for follow-up until the event has 
resolved, subsided, stabilised, or the subject withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up.  For 
subjects who withdraw consent, data will be collected through their last available study visit.  
Subjects withdrawn from the study may possibly be replaced.  Subjects who withdraw from 
the study must undergo the ET Visit assessments. See Table 1.
Withdrawal from the study will not result in the exclusion of a subject’s data acquired up to 
the point of withdrawal.

239 STUDY TREATMENT
9.1 Treatments Administered
Eligible subjects will undergo vitrectomy and retinal detachment in each eye.  At Period 1, 
Visit 1 (Day 0, the Injection Day Visit for SE1), subjects will receive in SE1 a sub-retinal 
injection of up to 0.1 mL of study drug containing 1×10^11 AAV2-REP1 gp.  At Period 2, 
Visit 1 (Day 0, the Injection Day Visit for SE2), subjects will receive in SE2 up to 0.1 mL of 
AAV2-REP1 via sub-retinal injection.
9.2 Description of Study Drug
The AAV2 vector contains recombinant human cDNA encoding REP1 (AAV2-REP1).  The 
vector genome (AAV2-CBA-hREP1-WPRE-BGH) is comprised of a strong constitutive 
expression cassette, a hybrid CBA promoter, the human cDNA encoding REP1, a modified 
woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) sequence, and a bovine 
growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH-polyA) sequence flanked by [CONTACT_134356]2 inverted 
terminal repeats.  The cDNA fragment was originally isolated from a human retinal cDNA 
library from unaffected individuals.
The AAV2-REP1 drug product is formulated in a sterile, 20 mM Tris-buffered solution, 
pH 8.0, and contains 1 mM MgCl 2, 200 mM NaCl and 0.001% PF68.  The drug product is a 
clear to slightly opalescent, colourless, sterile-filtered suspension with a target concentration 
of 1×10^12 gp/mL.
9.[ADDRESS_394584] is to be stored at 
<−60oC (<−76oF) in a controlled access, temperature monitored freezer.
The GTMP will be labeled in compliance with regulatory standards.

applied into the sub-retinal space.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394586] vitrectomy and detachment of the posterior hyaloid 
in the respective study eye (Figure 2).  All surgeries will be conducted using the standard 
BIOM vitrectomy system.  A 23-gauge sutured approach is usually favored to avoid any 
potential risks of wound leakage.  The retina will be detached with 0.1-0.5 mL of balanced 
salt solution (BSS) injected through a 41-gauge sub-retinal cannula connected to a vitreous 
injection set.
In the second step of the procedure, the BSS cannula is removed from the eye and AAV2-
REP1 is prepared for injection.  A dose of up to 1.0×10^11 gp of AAV2-REP1 is injected 
into the sub-retinal space through the same entry site.  To improve visualization of the vector 
and facilitate dosing, surgeons are given the option of adding a minute quantity of trypan blue 
ophthalmic solution (~6 µL) to the vector solution.  See the GEMINI Surgical Manual for 
further details.
Prior to administration, the vector needs to be primed in the 1-mL syringe to avoid formation 
of air bubbles, and a connector is used so that the 1-mL syringe can be connected to the 
constant pressure line of the vitrectomy machine.  The sub-retinal injection will target any 
area of the macula, but also include the fovea, if possible.  In each case, the vector is injected 
so that the sub-retinal fluid overlies all edge boundaries of the central region that has yet to 
undergo chorioretinal degeneration, as identified by [CONTACT_319772].  After wound closure, care 
will be taken to dispose of all irrigating fluids that may have passed through the eye to limit 
potential vector spread.  See the GEMINI Surgical Manual for further details.
Subjects will be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs peri- and post-operatively.  
All AEs, irrespective of relationship to the study drug and/or the surgical procedure, will be 
captured in the subject’s medical record and reported in the eCRF.
Air fluid exchange during pars plana vitrectomy is not required for this surgical procedure.  
However, if an air fluid exchange is considered necessary, patients must be instructed to 
avoid air travel, travelling to high elevations or scuba diving until the air bubble has 
completely dissipated from the eye.  It may take one week or more following injection for the 
air bubble to dissipate.  A change in altitude while the air bubble is still present can result in 
irreversible vision loss.  The dissipation of the air bubble should be verified through 
meticulous ophthalmic examination.

except if treated within another study with AAV2-REP1.
Throughout the study, subjects may be prescribed any concomitant medications, procedures, 
or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care.  Details of concomitant 
medications, procedures and/or treatments will be collected during the Screening Period and 
updated at every study visit (including the ET Visit, if applicable).  Concomitant medications 
(including oral corticosteroid), procedures and/or treatments taken during the study are to be 
recorded in the subject’s medical records and eCRF; an exception to this is any medication 
used in the course of conducting study assessments (e.g., ophthalmic dyes, topi[INVESTIGATOR_319722], dilating eye drops).
In addition, all subjects will be prescribed a course of oral corticosteroids. 
The oral prednisone / prednisolone regimen has been modified from the 17-day protocol 
established in the Philadelphia voretigene neparvovec-rzyl gene therapy clinical trial for 
treatment of patients with confirmed bi-allelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy 
(Maguire, Simonelli et al. 2008), with the allowance of an extra 4 days for tapering the dose 
at the end of the course.  The
 corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone 
(not to exceed 80 mg/daily) for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector 
injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 
0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 0.125 mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total; Study Day (SD)

If inflammation is observed in the study eye, and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_319723], corticosteroid therapy may be increased 
during the taper period (to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/day), may be reinitiated following 
completion of the taper, and/or may be supplemented by [CONTACT_319776].  
9.9 Treatment Compliance
This study involves a single sub-retinal injection of a volume of up to 0.1 mL AAV2-REP1 in 
each eye.  Measure of treatment compliance with AAV2-REP1 is therefore not necessary.
Compliance with the use of prednisone/prednisolone will be captured in the eCRF; subject 
diary cards will be provided to participants prior to each surgery.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394589]'s willingness and ability to meet the protocol 
requirements will be determined.
Prior to any study-specific procedure, written informed consent will be obtained.  The subject 
will sign and date 1 copy of the consent form in the presence of the Investigator or his/her 
designee.  The original signed form will be retained at the study site and an additional copy 
will remain in the subject’s medical records; a copy will also be given to the subject.
After informed consent has been obtained, the subject will be allocated a subject identifier 
and evaluated to determine study eligibility.  
Screening procedures will consist of the following (all ophthalmic assessments will be 
conducted on both eyes):
Demography, medical and ocular history
Vital signs
Weight
Vector shedding sampling – blood, tears (both eyes), urine, saliva
Immunogenicity sampling
BCVA 
Microperimetry
Full ophthalmic examination, including IOP, a slit-lamp examination, lens opacity, 
and dilated fundus examination
SD-OCT 
AF
7-field colour fundus photography (including stereo photographs for fields 1, 2, and 3)
AE and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring
Concomitant medication, procedures, and treatment review
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
assigned a subject number and will be enrolled into the study.  The Investigator will assign 
the order in which the eyes are treated (i.e., SE1 and SE2, respectively).  This will be done in 
collaboration with the subject; however, the worse eye will generally be selected for 
treatment first.  Study eye selection and eligibility for surgery will then be confirmed 
collectively by [CONTACT_319754], which includes the Investigator, a 
consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor (see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). The target 
interval between the surgical procedures of SE1 and SE2 will be determined at this visit.
For each subject, the interval between SE1 and SE2 treatment is expected to range from  
weeks to months.  While this interval will be decided on a case-by-case basis, an effort will

anticipated real-world application of the study drug.  Thus, approximately 20 subjects will be 
treated with a short- (<6 month), medium- (6-12 months), or long- (>12 month) duration 
surgery window between treatment of the first and second eye.   Because the timing of the

visit. 
The next study visit (i.e., surgery and dosing, Period 1, Visit 1) is to be scheduled within 
10 weeks of the Screening Period.  Subjects will attend Period 1, Visits 2-9 unless the second 
surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) begins, which will mark the start of study Period 2.  Because 
the timing of the second surgery visit (Period 2, Visit 1) will vary among subjects, the 
duration of study Period 1 will also be variable.
Subjects will be treated with oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone / prednisone) during the 
peri-operative period for each eye.  They will be instructed to start taking the drug [ADDRESS_394592] to capture corticosteroid compliance.  Subjects will also 
be instructed to use barrier contraception or abstain from sexual intercourse for a period of 
3 months from the time they are treated.
The schedule of procedures is identical for Periods 1 and 2; during each period, procedures 
are to be conducted in both SE1 and SE2.
If a subject has previously participated in a clinical trial of AAV2-REP1 for the treatment of 
CHM and has received AAV2-REP1 in one eye, the untreated eye will be assigned as SE2 at 
the Screening Visit and the subject will immediately enter Period 2.

SD-OCT 
AF
7-field colour fundus photography (including stereo photographs for fields 1, 2, and 3)
AE and SAE monitoring
Concomitant medication, procedures and treatment review
Eligibility for SE2 surgery will then be confirmed collectively by [CONTACT_319777], which includes the Investigator, a consulting surgeon, and the Sponsor 
(see the Patient Eligibility Review Plan). 
If BCVA in SE2 is <34 ETDRS letters, surgery may be performed when, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_319724]: 
1. the subject is found eligible by [CONTACT_319756], and
2. the subject is considered an appropriate candidate who has potentially modifiable 
disease.
10.2 Period 1 and 2, Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit)
At Visit 1 (Day 0, Injection Day Visit), the following assessments will be performed:
Full ophthalmic examination, including IOP, a slit-lamp examination, lens opacity, 
and dilated fundus examination 
AE/SAE monitoring
Concomitant medication, procedures, and treatment review (including review of the 
corticosteroid diary card)
It may be necessary for subjects to undergo a pre-surgical workup according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319725] (e.g., blood draw for anesthetist) which are outside of the protocol-defined 
assessments.  Any assessments performed outside of the protocol will not be collected as part 
of the study analysis.
Subjects will then undergo vitrectomy and receive a volume of up to 0.1 mL sub-retinal 
injection of AAV2-REP1, containing 1×10^11 gp (see Section 9.4 for details).  Subjects will 
be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs during the procedure.  Subjects will return 
to the site 1, 3, [ADDRESS_394594]-operative follow-up (Visit 2 [Day 1], 
Visit 3 [Day 3 + 2 Days], Visit 4 [Day 7 -1/+2 Days] and Visit 5 [Day 14 ±  3 Days], 
respectively).
The post-operative outcome and visual function of SE1 will inform the scheduling of 
Period 2.  Significant signs of post-operative inflammation or other post-operative sequelae, 
as judged by [CONTACT_737], should be resolved in SE1 for the subject to continue to 
Period 2.  After a comprehensive evaluation of all safety assessments and visual functional 
tests of SE1 and SE2, the Investigator will decide the appropriate time to schedule SE2, 
Visit 1. If severe ocular inflammation or any other post-operative sequela that is unresponsive 
to treatment occurs in SE1, the second eye should not be treated. However, Period 1 should 
be continued for monitoring of safety for the duration of the study.

3411 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
11.1 Evaluation, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events
11.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug/surgical procedure.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug/surgical 
procedure, whether or not related to the investigational product or with the surgical procedure 
described in this protocol.
AEs are to also include any pre-existing condition (other than CHM) or illness that worsens 
during the study (i.e., increases in frequency or intensity).
Worsening of the signs, symptoms and visual function related to CHM is not to be considered 
an AE unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the changes are not consistent with the 
natural progression of the disease. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Results in vision loss or is vision threatening
Is another important medical event(s)
The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the 
subject is at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319726]-scheduled prior to obtaining the consent to participate in the 
study or for an elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment for a pre-existing 
condition which has not worsened, does not constitute an SAE.
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be 
considered an SAE, even if the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The study site must document all of 
the following:
The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s 
consent to participate in the study.
The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204884]’s consent to participate in the study and the time of 
the procedure or treatment.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.0
12 Nov2020
CONFIDENTIAL
35The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221920], 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319727] [IP_ADDRESS] is met.
Other events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above.
Vision Loss to be Reported as Serious Adverse Events
Vision Loss not to be Reported as an SAE:
Surgery-related BCVA decrease of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart occurring within 1 
day of surgery, but recovering / resolving at post-operative Days 7 and 14. 
Vision Loss or Vision-Threatening Event to be Reported as an SAE:
Surgery-related BCVA decrease of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 1 
day of surgery and that has not recovered* by [CONTACT_941] 1-Month Visit.
A decrease in BCVA of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 1 day of 
surgery, however, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]:
oHas an evolution not consistent with the expected post-operative course; 
oMay be attributable to a complication that occurred during surgery, or another 
untoward event, or the study drug; 
oActually or potentially requires any surgical or medical intervention to prevent 
permanent loss of vision.
Non-surgery-related, sustained (>48 hours duration) decrease from baseline in BCVA 
of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart.
*Recovery / Resolution of BCVA is defined as a return to baseline BCVA within 5 letters on 
the ETDRS chart.
11.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs/SAEs will be collected from the time the subject provides written informed consent 
(Screening Visit) through Period 2, Visit 9 (Month 12 ± 14 Days or ET Visit, if applicable). 
Subjects will be questioned on the occurrence of an AE at every visit including any 
unscheduled visit, by [CONTACT_216138]-leading questioning such as ‘How have you been since the 
last visit?’  
All AEs occurring during the study observed by [CONTACT_19007], 
whether or not attributed to study drug or the surgical procedure, will be recorded in the 
subject’s medical records and in the eCRF.  Any clinically significant changes in laboratory 
results or vital sign measurements (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) are to be recorded as an 
AE.
Ocular AEs are to be recorded on a per-eye basis.
AAV2-REP1 
Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.0

CONFIDENTIAL
36The following information will be recorded in the eCRF for each AE: description, date of 
onset and end date, outcome, severity, assessment of relatedness to study drug/study 
procedure, the action taken and confirmation of whether the event is considered serious (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for the definition of seriousness).  Follow-up information should be provided 
as necessary (see Section 11.1.3 for specifics on follow-up procedures).
AE severity and relationship to the study drug or the surgical procedure will be assessed at 
the site by [CONTACT_29517] a medically qualified designee.
AE Severity
The severity of events will be assessed on the following scale:
1 = mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
2 = moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
3 = severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).
AE Relationship
When assigning relatedness of the AE, consideration will be given to whether there is a 
plausible relationship to either the study drug or the surgical procedure.  The following are 
definitions of relatedness that will be used in this study: 
Unrelated: The event is not reasonably related in time to the administration 
of the study drug/surgical procedure, or exposure of the study 
drug/surgical procedure has not yet occurred, or biologic 
plausibility does not exist
Related: A reasonable possibility exists that the study drug / study 
procedure caused the AE. A suspected AE can be further 
defined by:
[CONTACT_319778]: a relationship is clinically or biologically 
reasonable relative to the administration of the study 
drug/surgical procedure, but the event could have been due to 
another equally likely cause
Probably related: a relationship is clinically/biologically 
reasonable relative to the administration of the study 
drug/surgical procedure, and the event is more likely explained 
by [CONTACT_27178]/administration of the study drug/surgical 
procedure than by [CONTACT_319779]: there is a causal relationship of the onset 
of the event, relative to administration of the study 
drug/surgical procedure and there is no other cause to explain 
the event.
When a relationship is determined to exist, the Investigator or medical designee will further 
define if that relationship is to the study drug, the study procedure, both, or unknown .

Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394598] to follow-up.  The Sponsor (or designee) will follow up on SAE reports to 
completion.  Investigators are expected to provide the requested additional information for a 
complete assessment and documentation of the SAE reports in a timely manner.
11.1.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The Investigator shall immediately (within 24 hours of learning of the event) report any SAE 
to the Sponsor (or its designee) by [CONTACT_319780].  For reporting 
purposes, the date of SAE form submission by [CONTACT_319781] 0.. The initial report shall be promptly followed up with a more detailed 
report providing specifics about the subject and the event.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_243222], autopsy 
reports, and other documents should be provided (if applicable).
The Sponsor will report SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs to investigative sites, the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and regulatory authorities in compliance 
with current regulations.  All cases that are fatal or life-threatening will be reported 
immediately after the Sponsor received the initial report from the Investigator.  All non-fatal 
or non-life-threatening cases will be reported within a maximum of 15 days after the initial 
Investigator’s report.  The Sponsor will also provide periodic safety reports to IRBs/IECs and 
regulatory authorities, as applicable.  Follow-up SAE reports will be submitted within [ADDRESS_394599] information.
11.1.5 Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be used in this study to safeguard 
the safety and interests of study subjects and assess the safety and risk/benefit of the gene 
therapy intervention during the trial.
At regular intervals during the study, the DMC will review the progress and accrued study 
data and provide advice to the Sponsor on the efficacy and safety aspects of the study.  The 
DMC will also inform the Sponsor if there is a consensus that the ongoing data show that the 
gene therapy, its method of administration, and/or the study design are no longer in the best 
interests of study subjects.  Details of DMC organisation and responsibilities are included 
within a DMC charter.

3811.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]
Severe ocular inflammation (e.g. endophthalmitis) that is unresponsive to treatment 
should result in the affected subject not being treated in the second eye. However, the 
subject will continue to be followed for safety for the duration of the study. 
At the request of the DMC, the trial may be stopped based on specific safety concerns 
(i.e., S[LOCATION_003]Rs), not defined in the Investigator’s Brochure (Section 6.3).
The study may be discontinued if the Sponsor deems it necessary for medical, safety, 
regulatory, business, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws or regulations.
11.4 Laboratory Assessments
11.4.1 Vector Shedding
Blood, tears (both eyes), urine and saliva samples will be collected at the times indicated in 
Table [ADDRESS_394601] AAV2-REP1.  Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays will be used for the 
assessment of T-cell-mediated immune responses to transgene product (REP1) and the 
capsid.  Antibody responses against the capsid and transgene product will be measured using 
a cell-based neutralization assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 
respectively.
Refer to the Study Operations Manual for details on the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_319728].
Remaining samples may be stored for up to 15 years or per local regulations. 
11.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs (pulse and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) will be taken at the times 
indicated in Table 1.  Vital signs should be taken after the subject is seated for at least 
[ADDRESS_394602] should be performed prior to pupil dilation, and distance refraction should be 
carried out before BCVA is measured.  Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 metres from

4213 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Sample Size
Approximately 60 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study.  A total of 120 treated 
eyes is considered sufficient to characterise the immunological profile of bilateral AAV2-
REP1 administration, which is the key concern of gene therapy re-administration.
13.2 Procedure for Accounting for Missing Data
All reasonable efforts will be made to obtain complete data for both eyes on all subjects.  
However, missing observations may occur.  Management of dropout and missing 
observations will depend on their nature and frequency and will be discussed as part of the 
Data Review meeting before database lock.
Safety data will be analysed on observed data (missing data will not be imputed).  The 
analysis of efficacy endpoints will be performed using the last observation carried forward 
approach for imputation of missing data.
13.3 Analysis Sets
The ‘All Treated Subjects’ Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who attend the ‘Day of 
Surgery’ visit of Period 1 (or, of Period 2, for subjects who received AAV2-REP1 treatment 
in SE1 in an antecedent study).  The All Treated Subjects Analysis Set will be the primary 
population for demographics, baseline characteristics, and safety and efficacy analyses.
13.4 Descriptive Statistics and Conventions
Detailed specifications of the planned analyses will be included in a separate Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).
Continuous variables (including changes from Baseline) will be summarised over time using 
descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval [CI], median, 
first and third quartiles, fifth and ninety-fifth percentiles, minimum, and maximum).  
Categorical variables (including shifts from Baseline) will be described over time using 
counts, percentages, and 95% CIs.
Baseline is defined, for each eye and each period, as the last non-missing value prior to 
treatment of the respective period, in the respective eye.
13.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics will be summarised for all subjects combined. Age at the date of the Period 1 
informed consent will be calculated. Baseline ocular characteristics will be summarised by

Protocol: NSR-REP-02Version 6.[ADDRESS_394609] IEC / IRB approved version of the 
informed consent form before any study-specific procedures are performed.
Written and verbal versions of the subject information and informed consent will be 
presented to the subjects detailing no less than: the exact nature of the study; the implications 
and constraints of the protocol; and the known side effects and any risks involved in taking 
part.  It will be clearly stated that the subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time 
for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for 
withdrawal.
The subject will be allowed as much time as needed to consider the information and the 
opportunity to question the Investigator, their primary care physician/general practitioner or 
other independent parties to decide whether they will participate in the study.  Written 
informed consent will then be obtained by [CONTACT_319792].  The person who 
obtained the consent must be suitably qualified and experienced and have been authorised to 
do so by [CONTACT_737].  A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to each 
subject.  The original signed form will be retained at the study site and an additional copy 
will remain in the subject’s medical records.
14.2 Ethical/Regulatory Review
The protocol, informed consent form, subject information sheet and any proposed advertising 
material will be submitted to an appropriate Research Ethics Committee (IEC or IRB), 
regulatory authorities and host institution(s) for written approval.  If there are any changes to 
the approved protocol (with the exception of emergency modifications required for the 
subject’s safety), a protocol amendment will be issued by [CONTACT_1034].  When required by 
[CONTACT_1769], the IEC/IRB and Competent Authority must give written approval of any 
amendments likely to affect the safety of subjects or study conduct.  Each site must maintain 
accurate and updated records of all correspondence with the IEC/IRB.

assessment of T-cell-mediated immune responses to transgene product (REP1) and the capsid.  Antibody responses against the capsid and transgene product will be measured 
using a cell-based neutralization assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. All immunogenicity samples will be sent to a central laboratory for 
analysis.
jThe ophthalmic examination will include IOP, slit lamp examination, lens opacity grading, and dilated ophthalmoscopy. The same slit lamp machine and lighting conditions 
should be used across the study for each subject.
kStereo photos for fields 1, 2, 3.
lAEs/SAEs will be collected from the time the subject provides written informed consent (Screening Visit) through Period 2, Visit 9 (or ET Visit, if applicable). 
mSubjects will be given a course of oral corticosteroid before each surgical visit, and instructed to start taking the drug 2 days prior to SE1/SE2 treatment, unless the SE2 surgical 
treatment coincides with the SE1 steroid treatment period, when an extended course of steroid can cover both surgical treatments.  This regimen is outlined in detail in Section 9.8.

2PRIMARY REASON FOR AMENDMENT
The primary reason for this amendment to Protocol 273CH203 (NSR-REP-02) is for safety of 
participants: a maximum dose of 80 mg daily of corticosteroid has been added to the 
corticosteroid regimen.
New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough.
The synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.
Section 7.2 Discussion of Design
Now reads:
The corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day (for a maximum of 80 mg/daily) 
prednisone/prednisolone for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector injection, on 
the day of injection, and then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 0.25 mg/kg/day 
for 2 days; and 0.125 mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total).
Rationale: A maximum dose of 80 mg daily of corticosteroid has been added to the 
corticosteroid regimen.
This change also affects:
Section 9.8, Concomitant Therapy
The corticosteroid regimen is 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone (not to exceed 80 mg/daily) 
for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector injection, on the day of injection, and 
then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 0.125 
mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total; Study Day (SD) -2 through SD18).

Process.  The protocol now clearly describes that  the Investigator as well as the Sponsor and a 
surgical consultant through a collective decision-making process outlined in the Patient Eligibility Review Plan (version 2.0, dated 03 Ap ril 2020) ultimately determine the subject’s 
eligibility for surgery.  This process takes places subsequent to the subject’s eligibility determination based on meeting inclusion and exclusi on criteria and undergoing baseline 
assessments.  The aim of the Patient Eligibility Review is to determine if the subject is an appropriate candidate for surger y through examination of baselin e imaging (optical coherence 
tomography, fundus autofluorescence, fundus phot ography), best-corrected visual acuity, and 
microperimetry data, as well as genetic test resu lts, taking into consideration disease progression 
and the status of the choroideremic retina.  Both the Data Monitoring Committee for the GEMINI study, and the principal investigators have  been consulted regarding this amendment, 
and both parties did not recommend further amending the protocol to include  specific surgical 
eligibility criteria, preferring the current collaborative Patient Eligibility Review process.   
The Patient Eligibility Review Plan and each subject’s signed GEMINI surgery authorization 
form lie within the Trial Master File for the GEMINI study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 42 
 Overview / Rationale of Major Changes :  
This protocol amendment was triggered primarily by [CONTACT_319805] 2018. Five key revisions were made:  1) the sample size 
was increased from 15 to 60; 2) specific language was added  regarding the allocation of these [ADDRESS_394643] safety profile available on subjects treated  with short, medium and long time periods  
between surgeries ; 3) the corticosteroid regimen was revised  to clarify administration  required 
with bilateral treatment  performed with very short windows between surgeries; 4) the visual 
acuity inclusion criterion was revised to allow for the eligibility of subjects with more significant 
visual impairment; and lastly, 5) new requirements have been added to mandate baseline assessments prior to treating the second eye in the case of long surgery windows, to assure that the second eye remains  eligible and that the investigator still recommends treatment based on 
safety assessments and the visual function of both eyes at that time , as well as to establish 
accurate baseline values . In addition, a new inclusion criterion has been adde d mandating that 
subjects who enter this study from an antecedent study must have biological samples available to complete an adequate immunogenicity profile, if needed.  
A new benefit -risk assessment section has also been added to the Introduction, based on 
information collected  from ong oing safety  reporting of the Phase [ADDRESS_394644]-
treatment . The definition of vision loss as a serious adverse event was clarified, without changing 
the original meaning. Adverse event reporting was also modified to a binary system that still allowed the investigator to choose 3 levels of relatedness under “related to study drug or procedure”.  
Minor changes were made solely  for clarification.

Each site will work with the

of 1×10^11 gp in 1 eye with 
AAV2 -REP1 (the

these trials are consistent with improved rod and cone function 
that overcome  any

Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Page 14   5.4 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
No treatment currently exists for 
CHM.  
The non- clinical studies conducted 
with AAV2 -REP1 showed that it 
provides efficient and functional transgene expression in CHM mouse and human cells, as well as in mouse and human RPE and 
photoreceptors, without overt 
toxicity.  R esults from the 26 -week 
single -dose combined 
toxicity/biodistribution study conducted in rats indicate that administration of AAV2 -REP1 by 
[CONTACT_319766] -retinal injection to both 
eyes is well tolerated at dose levels of 1×10^9 and 6×10^9 gp/eye (equal to 1×10^11 and 6×10^11 gp/eye in humans) when evaluated 4 and 26 weeks after injection.  Minor 
reductions in some ERG 
parameters, ocular inflammation, and microscopic signs of retinal/corneal degeneration were observed and were considered 
procedure -related or not  
biologically significant.  
In humans, application of AAV2-
REP1 to the surface of the retina requires retinal detachment via vitrectomy.  The 2 -step procedure 
employed in delivering AAV2 -
REP1 sub -retinally  (see Section 
9.4), allows the management of unexpected surgical complications of retinal detachment before the AAV2 -REP1 is applied. 
Furthermore, since the volume of fluid required to detach the fovea is variable, by [CONTACT_319813], and Added section for

(Added Text Shown as Red)  Rationale  
administering the vector after 
successful retinal detachment has 
been achieved, a precise, consistent dose in terms of genome particles can be applied into the sub -retinal 
space.  Nevertheless, sub -retinal 
injection of AAV2 -REP1 carries the 
risks a ssociated with vitrectomy and 
retinal detachment, which include intra-operative and post -operative 
complications; infection (most 
notably infectious endophthalmitis); 
low and elevated IOP; choroidal detachment; persistent retinal detachment, retinal tears,  holes and 
breaks; macular hole and macular 
oedema; vitreous haemorrhage; 
visual impairment; metamorphopsia; and photopsia (Park et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1996; Banker et al., 1997; Cheng et al., 2001; Anderson et al., 2006; 
Stein et al., 2009; Recchi a et al., 
2010).  Post -operative intraocular 
inflammation caused by [CONTACT_319815].  Another complication 
of vitrectomy is cataract formation, 
which may require an additional surgical procedure (cataract 
extraction) (Park et al., 1995; Cheng et al., 2001; Recchia et al., 2010).  In addition, the surgical procedure 
is performed under general 
anesthesia, which includes the risks of dizziness, confusion, nausea and vomiting.  Loss of visual  acuity has 
been observed post -treatment with 
AAV2 -REP1.; this visual acuity 
loss was determined by [CONTACT_319816]2 -
REP1, however without definitively attributing the cause  to either the 
study procedu re or the GTMP.  Loss 
of visual acuity is, therefore, considered a Potential Risk of AAV2 -REP1 treatment, in addition

Thus,  although there are risks 
associated with the administration 
of the study treatment via

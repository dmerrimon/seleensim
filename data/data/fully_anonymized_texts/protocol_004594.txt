invasive study  assessment s such as bronchoscopy , bronchial biopsy ,bronchial brushing
and bronchoalveo lar lavage (BAL).” This change is to correct an oversight in the previous 
wording as bronchial brushing is also considered an invasive procedure with potential 
associ ated risks.

*Order of assessments at V3a would be ACQ -6, vital signs, FeNO, AO, physical exam. A compliance check for background medication and paper diary completion to be comple ted. 
** Order of assessments at V3b would be vital signs, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (if performed), blood draw, bronchoscopy (biopsy, brushing th en BAL), then IP administration. Per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], the IP can be 
administered on the day after V3b if there is any safety concern. Visit 3a and 3b should be performed within 7 days of each other. 
*** During the COVID -[ADDRESS_106674] dose of IP at either we ek 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 or 48 (as needed) unt il

1PI [INVESTIGATOR_96622].
2Visits 4, 12 and 13 are phone visits. 
3Based on investigator’s judgement and site resources, EOT assessments (V11) will be performed over more than one day, within a 7 -day window. The sequence of assessments during Visit 11 
should be performed in the same order as completed at Visits 3a, 3b (except for spi[INVESTIGATOR_96623] -BD at V11). Proposed order of assessmen ts as follows: Visit 11 Day 1 -
ACQ -6, paper diary completion, vital signs, ECG, FeNO, AO, physical exam, and AHR; Visit 11 Day 2 -vitals signs, pre -BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], blood draw, and bronchoscopy (biopsy, brushing, 
then BAL). Pre -BD spi[INVESTIGATOR_96609] [ADDRESS_106675] dose of IP at either week 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 or 48(as needed) until the sites are able to resume the EOT assessments.
4All visits are to be scheduled from the date of randomization, not from the date of the previous visit. 
5FSH will be done only for women < [ADDRESS_106676] been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following ces sation of exogenous hormonal treatment.
6Blood and BAL samples for PK and blood samples for ADA and nAb, biomarker and transcriptomics evaluations will be collected b efore the administration of IP. Samples with confirmed 
positive ADAs will be archived for p ossible testing for nAb.
7Asthma specific resource utilization (e.g. unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled phone calls to physicians, use of other asthma medications).
8Paper diary will capture rescue medication, night time awakening, and use of maintena nce medications from the evening of V2 to the morning of V14. The morning diary will include: 
questions about rescue medications, night -time awakening, and use of maintenance medications. The evening diary will include: questions about rescue medications. Paper diary will be 
distributed at V2 to V11 (sufficient paper diaries will be distributed at V11) and collected at V3 to V11 and V14. The diary dispensed at V2 will be re -used for both V3a and V3b. Diary and 
background medications compliance for inclusion criteria numbers 14 and 15 will be performed at V3a .During the COVID -19 pandemic, recording, collecting and dispensing will continue 
once administration of extra dosing is implemented .
9ACQ -6 will be performed at Visit 2 only if the eligibility criterion is not met at Visit 1.

11RNA samples will be obtained from the peripheral blood and bronchial brushings. RNA may also be collected from lung biopsies and BAL cells if sufficient sample remains after the other 
assessments on these cells are completed. 
12At EOT visit, AO, BAL, brushi ngs, CT, and AHR will be performed only if baseline assessment is performed successfully, as confirmed by [CONTACT_1697]. EOT b iopsy will only be performed if 
baseline biopsy meets pathology QC.

16In case of repeat of spi[INVESTIGATOR_91398] V2, the AHR will be rescheduled to be done within 3 days of V2.
17ADA sample should be collected in case of any suspected immunologically -related AEs
18During the COVID -19 pandem ic an additional 1 to 6 IP doses may be administered to subjects during unscheduled visits at weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48 (as needed) until the sites are able to 
resume performing all EOT study assessments, including bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .All assessments dur ing the unscheduled visit may not be necessarily be completed. Please refer to Appendix J.
CHANGES REQUIRED DURING COVID- 19 PANDEMIC
Please Note: Changes below sho uld only be implemented during the COVID -[ADDRESS_106679] ices, and to minimize risks to trial integrit y. Where allowable by  [CONTACT_96727], ethics 
committees and healt hcare provider guidelines (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96626]), these changes include:
● The option of providing ho me-administrati on of  Invest igational Product (IP) performed by  a site qualified Heal th Care Professio nal 
(HCP) or HCP provided by a third-party vendor (TPV), if possible. More informat ion related to the visit can be obtained via ph one 
call and/or virtual visits. The rationale for this change is to ensure that subjects are not missing any scheduled visit s due to 
inabilit y/unwillingness to visit the site during COVID- 19 pandemic. 
●Adding 1 -6 extra IP doses every  4 weeks after week 24 (possibly through weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48)   The rationale for this 
change i s to ensure that the duration between the last IP dose and end of treatment assessments is wit hin the protocol specif ied 
durati on. Adding addit ional doses will give the su bject a chance to resume bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_96627].

necessary . The rati onale for this change is to ensure that we collect the safet y informat ion if the last follow up cannot be done at the 
site. 
●Re-consent will be obtained verbally if allo wed by  [CONTACT_96728]. The rati onale is to ensure that the subject agrees to 
the changes implemented to the COVID- 19 pandemic.

Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Rando mized, Double -Blind, Parallel Group, Placebo Controlled 
Study  to Eval uate the Effect of Tezepelumab on Airway  Inflammat ion in Adult s with 
Inadequately Controlled Asthma on Inhaled Corticosteroids an d at l east One Addit ional 
Asthma Controller (CASCADE)
Short Title: 
Bronchoscopy Mechanistic Study
Rationale: 
Tezepel umab has been shown to significant ly reduce exacerbat ion rates in severe asthma.  It is 
assumed that this effect was achieved by [CONTACT_96729], but this has not been previously  confi rmed. This study  is inten ded to expl ore 
the mechanism of a tezepelumab airway ant i-inflammatory effect in improving asthma 
outcom es. Of particular interest in this study , is the acti on of  tezepel umab across the spectrum 
of Type 2 (T2) activit y, including the effect of tezepelumab in the T2 low populat ion. The 
primary  object ive of this study  is to direct ly explore the airway ant i-inflammatory effect of 
tezepel umab. The secondary  object ives will explore whether tezepelumab treatment (1) 
reduces reticular basement membrane (RBM) thick ness, (2) improves airway epit helial 
integrity, (3) benefits subjects across the spectrum of T2 airway inflammat ion. In addit ion, 
this study  will address several exploratory  quest ions. First, it will explore the effect of 
tezepel umab on large airway remodeling and small airway  obstructi on. Second, i t will expl ore 
the effect of tezepelumab on various bio markers in the lung, bronchoalveo lar lavage (BAL), 
blood, and urine. Third, the relat ionship between improvement in airway inflammat ion, lung 
funct ion and br onchial  hyper -responsiveness will also be assessed. Fourth, the relationship 
between tezepelumab and the effect on different inflammatory cells in the blood will be 
explored. Finally , the effect of tezepelumab on the pulmonary  vasculature will be assessed.

Study period:
Estimated date of first patient enro lled: Q4 [ADDRESS_106681] patient completed : Q1 2021
Number of subjects:
Approximately  110 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to the following groups: 
Tezepel umab 210 m g administered SC Q4W or
Matching placebo administered SC Q4W
The study  aims to randomize subjects across the spectrum of T2 low and high activat ion. 
Approximatel y 30% of  rando mized subjects will have < 150 blood eosinophils/μL, 
approximately  30% of  subjects wi th 150 –<300 blood eosinophils/μL and approximately 40% 
of subjects wi th ≥ 300 blood eosinophils/ μL. When the target percentage of subjects for each 
eosinop hil subgroup in the study  is reached, consideration will be given to closing the 
IWRS/IVRS rando mizat ion for that subgroup, which may  be done on the study  level 
irrespect ive of the region. Once a subgroup is closed, subjects in the screening/run -in period in 
the closed subgroup will not be allowed to be randomized and will be screen failed.
Treatments and treatment duration:
After init ial enro lment and confirmat ion of entry  criteria (Visi t 1) subjects will  proceed to a 
screening/run -in period of 4 weeks dur ing which their suitabilit y for randomizat ion will be 
confirmed. The subjects’ currently prescribed ICS and addit ional asthma controller medicat ion

pandemic). A safet y follow-up peri od for all subjects will be for 12 weeks fro m EOT. 
Please note : During the COVID -19 pandemic, the treatment period may  be extended a nd 
therefore subjects may  be given 1 to 6 doses (as needed) every  4 weeks for a l onger peri od

DSMB will perio dically review unblinded safet y summary  tables and list ings and evaluate for 
subject safety  and make appropri ate recommendations. 
DSMB will have access to the individual treatment codes and will be able to merge these with 
the collected study  data while t he study  is ongoing if and as required. The personnel invo lved 
in the clinical study  at [COMPANY_008] will remain blinded to these analyses and will have no

The study  is sized to explore reductions in airway submucosal inflammat ion, from  baseline to

continuum. 
The sample size is based on the primary endpo int: change from bas eline to EOT in number of 
airway submucosal inflammatory  cells. Given the assumed standard deviat ion of the log 
values of change in number of eosinophils in the two treatment groups are 1.87 and 2.06, it is 
estimated that 50 subjects in each treatment arm will be sufficient to achi eve 80% power to 
detect a 2.[ADDRESS_106683] at

Progressive patho logic airway rem odeling and scarring may occur in persistent asthma 
resul ting in only  parti ally reversible or i rreversible ai rway obstructi on (Pascual and Peters 
2005). The eti ology of asthma is thought to be multi -factorial, influenced by [CONTACT_96735]. The majorit y of cases ari se when a person beco mes 
hypersensit ive to allerge ns. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of mult iple therapeut ic options, asthma 
continues to be a major healt h probl em. Worl dwide, asthm a current ly affects approximately 
[ADDRESS_106687] e (Partri dge 2007 ). 
Each year in the US, asthma accounts for an estimated 8.9 millio n outpati ent vi sits, 1.9 millio n 
emergency room  visits, 479,000 hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24509] (Corren et al 20 17), and 3,400 deaths 
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion 2017 ). 
Approximately  5% to 10% of asthma patients have severe asthma, which may be inadequately  
controlled by [CONTACT_96736][INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(Brightling et al 2008 ). These pati ents are at ri sk of asthma exacerbat ions (Tough et al 1998 , 
Turner et al 1998 ) and have the greatest medical need among the asthmatic populat ion today . 
Patients wi th severe asthma represent the greatest economic cost (>50% of total asthm a
-
related healt h care costs) ( Antonicelli et al 2004 , Serra Batlles et al 1998 , Barnes and Kuitert 
1996).
2.1 Study rationale
Tezepel umab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di
rected 
against thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) . It binds to human TSLP and prevents its 
interact ion with thymic strom al lymphopoi etin receptor (TSLPR). A Phase 1b study 
(Gauvreau et al 2014) provi ded indi rect evi dence that tezepelumab acts as an airway  anti-
inflammatory  by [CONTACT_96737] (LAR) and the early 
asthmatic response (EAR) after allergen chall enge; tezepel umab also reduced the expected 
increases in blood and sputum eosinophilia after this allergen challenge. A Phase 2b study  
(CD- RI-MEDI9929- 1146) showed doses of 70 mg and 210 mg administered every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) and 280 mg of tezepelumab adminis tered every  2 weeks resul ted in reducti on of  
annualized asthma exacerbation rates (AAER) by 61%, 71% and 66% respectively in the all -
comer popul ation (Corren et al 20 17).  Analysis of subgroups in the Phase 2b study  also 
showed that tezepelumab benefited subjects with low and high baseline eosinophil counts and 
Clinical Study Protocol -4.[ADDRESS_106688] been shown to reduce the AAER in severe 
asthma patients who are uncontrolled with medium -to-high dose IC S and additional asthma 
controller medicat ions. Omalizumab provided benefit for a subgroup of patients with proven 
reactivit y to an aeroallergen and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels who remain 
inadequately controlled with ICS plus LABA ( XOLAIR US PI 2016 ). Three addit ional 
biologics, m epolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab have recently been approved for 
severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenoty pe (XOLAIR US PI 2016 ; CINQAIR US PI 2016; 
FASENRA US PI 2017 ). Benralizumab is indicated for the add -on m aintenance treatm ent of  
patients wi th severe asthma aged 12 y ears and ol der, and wi th an eosinoph ilic phenoty pe 
(FASENRA US PI 2017 ).  Bio logics targeting IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional 
treatment gui delines ( GINA 2018 ) as an add- on treatment to patients uncontrolled with 
ICS/LABA treatment. However, when using the currently available bio logics, substant ial 
proporti ons of  patients continue to experience exacerbat ions and may benefit from agents that 
target different mo lecular pathways ( Wenzel 2016 , Froidure et al 2016 , Swedin et al 2017). 
These approved bio logic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_96632] T2 hi gh subpopul ation, but 
there are no current biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_96633] T2 low patients.
Tezepel umab is the first biologic that has shown promising data in a Phase 2b study  for both 
T2 hi gh and T2 l ow popul ation (Corren et al  2017). This m echanist ic study  is designed to 
understand how tezepelumab works in the T2 low populat ion. Therefore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_96634] c opti ons, there is st ill a clear unmet medical need among pat ients with 
severe asthma, independent ly of IgE status or eosinophil level, who are unable to gain 
complete asthm a control  using currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that acts as a 
danger signal and i s produced in response to numerous proinflammatory  stimuli (e.g., 
infect ious, allergic and environmental agents) and trauma. TSLP has a central role in the 
initiation of immune responses and can act ivate a broad range of cell t ypes including 
eosinoph ils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, ILC -2 cells and basophils ( Watson and 
Gauvreau 2014). Cl assically , TSLP i s believed to be a crit ical component in the init iation and 
perpetuation of the T2 response and the result ing cascade of cytokines associated with T2 
driven asthma ( Kaur and Bright ling 2012 ). Asthm a is recogni zed as a heterogeneous disease. 
There are subsets of patients that do not exhibit T2- associ ated disease ( Wenzel 2012 ), and 
there is exist ing data that TSLP may also mediate non -allergic (non -T hel per cell  2)

serpin family B member 2 (SERPIN B2), has been demonstrated as a surrogate marker of T2 -

that tezepelumab will be efficacious in both T2 low and T2 high subjects (based on the Phase
2b data) so the effect of tezeplumab across the T2 spectrum as determined by [CONTACT_96738], will be explored.
Tezepel umab is a fully  human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) 
directed against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with 
TSLP receptor (TSLPR). Owing to t he central role of TSLP in init iating and maintaining a T2 
response, ant i-TSLP therapy  may provi de an opportuni ty to treat the upstream underlying
mechanisms of asthma by [CONTACT_96739].
Results of a co mpleted inhaled allergen challenge study  in 31 adult subjects with mild atopic
asthma (Study  20101183) dem onstrated that tezepelumab attenuated the LAR and EAR to 
allergen challenge, as measured by [CONTACT_96740] (AUC) for the percent fall in 
FEV 1and the maximum percent fall in FEV 1. Tezepelumab also attenuated the expected 
increase in FeNO value as well as sputum and blood eosinophils on the post -allergen day 
compared wi th the pre -allergen day . Mul tiple doses of [ADDRESS_106689] of 3 
dose l evels o f tezepel umab on the AAER in adult subjects with inadequately  controlled, 
severe asthma. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dose levels o f SC

treatm ent arm s and 13 subjects in placebo arm) was performed for the primary  and selected 
secondary  endpoints. Resul ts from the post -hoc analysis showed that reduction s in AAER at 
Week 52 of 62% (p<0.001), 71% (p<0.001), and 66% (p<0.001) for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg 
Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W doses, respectively, compared with placebo were observed. These 
resul ts are similar to those observed in the overall ITT population (AAERR of 61%, 71%, and

treatm ent subjects. The ADA incidences were 9.4%, 3.7%, 0.8%, and 2.3% for placebo, [ADDRESS_106691] of ADA on tezepelumab PK. The results of this 
study  did not i dentify safet y concerns associated wit h tezepelumab for any  dosing regimen. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs were similar between the placebo (65.9%) and the 
tezepel umab (66.0%) dose groups. A majorit y of subjects had TEAEs that were Grade 1 
(mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severit y and not related to IP. TEAEs that resulted in 
perm anent discont inuat ion of IP occurred in few subjects , and at a similar incidence between 
the tezepelumab (5 subjects [1.2%] overall) and placebo ([ADDRESS_106692] [0.7%]) groups. Overall, 
tezepel umab was well- tolerated wi th an acceptable safet y profile and no ident ified safet y risks 
were noted.
2.3 Benefit/risk assess ment
In order to evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for tezepelumab, preclinical and clinical 
data have been taken into considerat ion, as well as a review of the available informat ion for
monoclonal antibodies that are approved for and are in development for the treatment of 
severe asthma. Benefits for tezepelumab over placebo include a clinically meaningful 
reducti on in asthma exacerbat ions, as well as improvements in lung function and asthma 
control  metrics.
Tezepel umab has been well tolerate d with noidentified ri sks in the clinical studies to date. No 
serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic react ions considered related to tezepelumab were
reported in the Phase [ADDRESS_106693] been detected to date in the tezepelumab program.
The p otenti al benefi ts of the study  are expected to be Category  IIB as described in the 
guidance docum ent aimed di rectly at the diagnosis, cure, or prevent ion of disease.
Biopsies will be perform ed by [CONTACT_96741], and all due precaut ions will be taken to minimize the risk to subjects. Risks 
of the study  include those associated with invasive study  assessments such as bronchoscopy , 
bronchial biopsy , bronchial brushing and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  Although rare, 
complicat ions of bronchoscopy and bi opsy include pneum othorax and the ri sks associ ated 
with anesthesia. BAL has so me possible co mplicatio ns like cough, transient fever, transient 
chills and myalgias, bronchospasm, or transient decrease of lung functi on. Also, there is a 
minor risk of exposure to radiat ion by [CONTACT_96742], the use of CT may cause an increase in 
the risk of radiogenic tumors in subjects.

reached, considerat ion will be given to closing the IWRS/IVRS rando mizat ion for that 
subgroup, which may  be done on the st udy level irrespective of region. Once a subgroup is 
closed, subjects in the screening/run -in peri od in the cl osed subgroup will not be allowed to be

These cells have been chosen as they are the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_96638] T2 and non -T2 driven inflammatory cell t ypes. Published literature supports a 
potenti al role for TSLP, and therefore tezepelumab, on all of these cell t ypes; eosinophils 
(Wong et al 2010, Cook et al 2012), neutrophils ( Li et al  2018 ), T cells ( Soum elis et al  2002 , 
Torii et al 2008 , Tanaka et al 2009 , Rochm an et al  2007 ) and m ast cells ( Allakhverdi et al 
2007). This m echanist ic study  is desi gned to i nvestigate the efficacy of tezepelumab in T2 
high and T2 low subjects, hence we will examine the ant i
-inflammatory effects of 
tezepel umab on a broad array  of airway  inflammatory  cells. Bronchoscopic biopsies will be 
also use d to assess the effect of tezepelumab on airway  epi[INVESTIGATOR_96639]. As an epit helia l barrier alarmin, TSLP is predicted to be 
involved in epit helial ho meostasis and wound healing. TSLP has also been reported to p lay a 
role in ai rway  smooth m uscle proliferat ion (Redhu et al 2013). Therefore, we believe the 
remodeling end po ints of ai rway  epi[INVESTIGATOR_96640] .
The BAL will be used to assess different bio markers and tezepelumab PK. The study  is also 
assessing the effect of tezepelumab on large airways using CT and the effect of tezepelumab 
on the small airways using AO and CT. 
Bronchial epit helial brushings will be used to assess the T2 status of the subjects using the

4.3 Justification for dose
A 210 m g Q4W dosing regimen was selected for the Phase 3 studies based on efficacy data 
and an exposure -response analysis fro m the Phase 2b Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 using 
popul ation PK/PD methodology . The populati on PK m odel of tezepel umab was developed 
based on all available data from 5 Phase 1 studies (Study  20070620, Study 20080390, Study  
2010118, Study  D5180C00003, Study  D5180C00002), and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study  
D5240C00001 and Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146). The exposure -response analysis was 
based on the Phase 2b Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146.
Analysis of data fro m the Phase 2b study  identified a stati stically significant exposure -
response against the primary  efficacy  endpoint of AAER and the pharmacodynamic (PD) 
endpo int of FeNO. These relationships indicate that the dose of [ADDRESS_106700] expected visit/contact [CONTACT_96747] .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66of 1665.4 Screen failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who signed the informed consent form to participate in 
the clinical study  but are not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure 
inform ation is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the 
Conso lidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory  authori ties. Minimal information includes demography , 
screen failure details, eligibilit y criteria, and any  adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse 
events (SAEs).
These subjects should have the reason for study  withdrawal  recorded as ‘ Screen Failure’ (i.e., 
subject does not meet the required inclusio n/exclusio n criteria) in the eCRF. This reason for 
study  withdrawal  is only  valid for screen failures, and not randomized subjects. 
Re-screening is allowed only  once under the follo wing circumstances:
Subjects with respi[INVESTIGATOR_96651] 
14 day s prior to the screening/run -in peri od may  be re -screened 14 days after recovery, 
i.e., com pletion of the therapy . 
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbat ion during run -in period may be re -
screened after 14 days of complet e resol ution of the asthma exacerbat ion, and when 
the subjects return to their baseline at Investigator discretion.
If the reason for screen failure was transient (including but not limited to study -supplied 
equipment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visit s, etc.), then
subjects may  potenti ally be re -screened. These cases should be discussed wit h the 
[COMPANY_008] study  physician and docum ented in the Invest igator Study  File (ISF).
Any re -screened subject will be re -enrolledand reassigned their originally  assigned enrolment
number after signing a new Informed Consent Form (ICF) and after all V1 assessments have 
been performed as listed in SoA, Table 1(with the excepti on of  testing for HIV1 and HIV2, 
hepat itis B and C, and FSH). If the timefra me between screening and re -screening exceeds [ADDRESS_106726] o n study results, if any, can be assessed.
IMPORTANT: Re-screening for subjects who have screen -failed due to PRO criteria (e.g.

6.3 Measure to minimize bias: randomization and blinding
The Investigator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent or assent fro m the potential subject, or their 
guardi an/legal representative, before any study  specific procedures are performed.
2. Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’) 
via the interactive web response system/interactive voice response system 
(IWRS/IVRS).
3. Determine subject eligibilit y. 
4. Assign the eligible subject unique rando mizat ion code via IWRS/IVRS.
5. Subjects will be allocated to receive tezepelumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and 
stratifi ed by [CONTACT_96754] (< 150, 150 -300, > 300). Randomizat ion 
numbers will be grouped in blocks. If a subject withdraws fro m the study , then 
his/her enrolment/rando mizat ion code cannot be reused. Wit hdrawn subjects will 
not be replaced.

Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
rando mize d or receive study  medicati on. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who 
are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all  the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mized or init iated on treatment and must be withdrawn from the study .
If a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteria but is randomized in error, or incorrectly  
started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the [COMPANY_008] study physician 
immediately , and a discussi on shoul d occur between the [COMPANY_008] study  phys ician and the 
Invest igator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the subject from treatment. Study 
treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a 
safet y risk to the patient. In those cases where continuat ion of the study  therapy  is judged not 
to present a concern related to safet y and di sease management, the rationale for continuing 
study  therapy  must be cl early  docum ented. Regardless of what is decided about IP, all 
rando mized patients should remain in the study  and the subjects should continue to be 
followed up in accordance with defined study  procedures.
Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_96721]. Approximately 30% of 
subjects wi th < 150 bl ood eosinophils/μL, approximately 30% of subjects with 150 - <300 
blood eosinophils/μL, and approximately 40% of subjects with ≥300 blood eosinophils/μL. 
Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially in each stratum  as subjects beco me 
eligible for randomizat ion.
The rando mizat ion code will be assigned fro m a rando mizat ion list prepared by a 
computeri zed system  provi ded by [CONTACT_96755] (AZRand). 
Ensuring blinding
This is a double -blind study  in which tezepelumab and plac ebo are not visually  distinct from
each other. All packaging and labelling of IP will be done in such way as to ensure blinding 
for all sponsor and investi gational site staff. Neit her the subject nor any  of the Investi gators or 
sponsor staff who are invo lved in the treatm ent or clinical evaluat ion and m onitoring of the
subjects will be aware of the treatment received. Since tezepelumab and placebo are not 
visually dist inct, IP will be handled by a qualified person (e.g. pharmacist, Investigator or 
qualified designee) at the site.

 Those generat ing the randomization list
 Personnel at the IXRS company
 Supply  Chain Management department

No other m ember of the extended study  team  at [COMPANY_008], or any  CRO handling data, will
have access to the rand omization scheme during the conduct of the study  and until database

Methods for unblinding
Individual treatment codes, indicat ing the treatment randomizat ion for each rando mized 
subject, will be available to the Investigator(s) or delegate at the study  sites from the 
IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be 
provi ded to each site.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate
management of the subject requir es knowl edge of  the treatment randomizat ion. The 
Invest igator should document and report the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the 
treatm ent given to subject to the [COMPANY_008] staff. 
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that ar e unexpected and are

importance of co mpleting the paper diary assessments as scheduled to capture the subject's 
experience and meet the object ives of the study. The quest ionnaires will be co mpleted at home 
in the fo llowing order: Rescue medicat ion, nocturnal awakening, maintenance medication. At 
every visit, subjects will be asked to return their paper diaries to be filed with the source 
docum ents. Si te will  give the subject a new diary  bookl et every  visit, as specified in the SoA.
At-home paper diary assessments will start the evening of V2. Subjects will co mplete 
assessments twice daily  at timepoints specified in the SoA. 
The Investigator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to the paper diary 
completion to minimize missing data at each study visit. Frequent compliance checks between 
visitswill be necessary  to ensure sufficient data is available to meet inclusio n criteria 14and

[IP_ADDRESS] Paper Diary
The paper diary  will be com pleted each day  from the evening of V2 to the morning of Visit 14 
(V14). The morning diary  will include: quest ions about rescue medicat ion, night -time 
awakening, and use of maintenance medicat ions. The evening diary  will include: quest ions 
about rescue medicat ions. Only the occurrence of worsening or new asthma symptoms will be 
reported on the paper diary . 
Please note: During the COVID -19 pandemic, once extra dosing and/or home IP 
administration is implemented, recording, collect ion, and dispensat ion of the subject's paper

recorded separately
8.3.7 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the CSP mandated laboratory  tests, vi tal signs and ECG will be summarized 
in the CSR. Deterioration as co mpared to ba seline in protocol -mandated laboratory  
values/vital signs/ECG should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE 
criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign/ ECG is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  
resul t/vital sign will  be considered as addi tional inform ation. Wherever possible the reporting 
Invest igator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (e.g. anemia versus low 
hemoglo bin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteri orations in non -mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant ab normal  medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE. 
When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms. Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest 
tightness, dy spnea, breathlessness and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:
The sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Appendix B
The patient discont inues IP due to the sign or symptom
The sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the patient’s pre -
exist ing asthma history  (defined as within 1 y ear of V1) as j udged by [CONTACT_24342].

Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that the IP 
under study  may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medication.  
Congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs.  Ele ctive abortions without complicat ions should not be handled as AEs.  
The outcome o f all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormalit y) should be fo llowed up and docum ented 
even if the subject was di scont inued fro m the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
must inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_106785] igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 5 
calendar day s for SAEs (see Secti on 8.4.1 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.
The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy and the paper -based 
pregnancy outcome report is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Paternal exposure 
Pregnancy of the subject’s partners will not be considered an AE.  However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies ( spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented for concept ions 
occurring from the date of the first administration of IP until 16 weeks (5 half -lives) after th e 
last administration of IP.
8.4.3 Overdose
A dose in excess of 280 mg administered within a 2- week period is considered an overdose.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
Statistical hypotheses: The null hypothesis H0: The ratio (tezepelumab/placebo) of the 
change, expressed as a ratio, from baseline to EOT for each primary and secondary endpo int 
between tezepelumab and placebo equa ls 1 and will be tested versus the alternat ive hypothesis 
H1: The ratio (tezepelumab/placebo) of the change, expressed as a ratio, from baseline to EOT 
for each primary and secondary  endpoint between tezepelumab and placebo is not equal to 1. 
Improvem ent u nder treatment is characterized by a reduction in the number of inflammatory  
cells, so ratios of tezepelumab/placebo less than [ADDRESS_106794] submucosal neutrophils (ratio of 
tezepel umab to placebo). 
It is estimated that 50 subjects in each treatment arm will pr ovide (using a [ADDRESS_106795] wi th a

The timing of AEs will be assigned to the period in which they  first occurred. If an AE has a 
missing onset date, then unless the stop date of the AE indicates otherwise, this will be 
considered an on -treatm ent event. Similarly, if an AE has a partial onset date, then unless the 
partial onset date or the stop date indicates otherwise, this will be considered an on -treatment 
AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant adverse events
During the evaluat ion of the AE data, an [COMPANY_008] medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs or discontinuat ions due to AEs.
Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may , after 
consultation wit h the Gl obal Patient Safety  Physicia n, be considered other significant AEs 
(OSAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory  abnorm alities, and certain 
events that led to intervent ion (other than those already  classified as serious), dos e reduction, 
or significant addit ional treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory variables
Blood and urine samples for determinat ion of clinical chemistry , hematol ogy and urinalysis 
param eters will  be taken at the times detailed in the CSP and will be assessed in a central 
laboratory . The parameters outlined in Table 7in Section 8.2.1 , will be co llected. Laboratory 
data will be reported in SI units.
Changes in hematology  and clinical chemistry  variables between baseline and each 
subsequent on treatment assessment will be calculated as described in Section 9.3.1 . There 
will be no imputation for missing values.
Absolute values will be compared to the relevant reference range and classified as low (below 
range), normal (within r ange or on limit s) or hi gh (above range). The [COMPANY_008] extended 
reference ranges will be used for laboratory  variables (where they  exist). All  values (absol ute 
and change) falling outside the reference ranges will be flagged.

Twelve -lead ECG measurements will be recorded in accordance wit h the protocol, with the 
baseline visit being defined as V1.
The outcome o f the overall evaluat ion is to be recorded as normal/abnormal in the eCRF, with 
any abnormalit ies being recor ded as not clinically significant or clinically significant.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination
Com plete and bri ef physical examinat ions will be performed at time po ints specified in 
Table 1.
What i s included in the assessment will be dependent on whether the examinat ion is co mplete

whether the assessment was performed or not will be recorded.
Each component of the complete physical examination at baseline visit (i .e., V3a) will be 
recorded as normal or abnormal. Each co mponent of the physical examinat ions at fo llow-up 
will be recorded as normal, same as baseline, or new/aggravated.

Nonparam etric analyses will be applied as sensit ivity analyses.
All hypothesis testing will be repor ted using 2- sided tests wi th a no minal 10% significance

will also be reported. The direction o f interest for each o f the primary  endpoints is that the 
ratio tezepel umab/placebo is lower than 1. Nominal p -values will be reported for primary  and 
secondary  variables i .e., no adj ustment of multiplicity will be perform ed. P- values will be 
rounded to 3 decimal places.
9.4.2 Analysis of the primary variable(s)
The primary  efficacy  objective will be evaluated through statist ical test ing of the within 
subject change from baseline to (EOT) , expressed as a ratio, in number of airway submucosal 
inflammatory  cells (separately  eosinophils, neutrophils, T cells, and Mast cells). 
The primar y variable of within subject change from baseline to EOT (expressed as a ratio) in 
numbers of each o f the airway  subm ucosal  inflammatory  cells will be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) including at least screening blood eosinophil strata 
(screening blood eosinophil count <150 cells/µL, 150 - <300 cells/µL, and ≥ 300 cells/µL at 
Visit 1), baseline value, and treatment as covariates. The analysis will be performed by  [CONTACT_96779]-transform ed data and estimated geometric means and the ratio of geo metric means wi th 
both 95% and 90% two -sided confidence intervals will be presented.
If the change fro m baseline for a subject, expressed as a ratio, is zero, the value will be 
replaced by  [CONTACT_96780] -zero v alues, before 
doing the logarithmic transformat ion.  If the baseline value for a subject is zero, the baseline 
value will be replaced by [CONTACT_96781] -zero 
values, before calculat ing the change from baseline.  If both baseline and on -treatm ent for a 
subject is zero, the value for the ratio is defined to be 1.  
Available values at both baseline and (EOT) are required for a subject to be included in the 
analysis and it is unlikely that a subject with a missing basel ine value will undergo a second 
biopsy.

A [ADDRESS_106834] a 
causal relat ionship with this treatm ent.   An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, i ncluding 
run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  Phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_96697] 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty.  
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect.
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
B 3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the A E as i t 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (e.g. hepatitis that resolved witho ut hepati c failure).
B 4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96698] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (e.g. bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
Clinical Study Protocol -4.[ADDRESS_106835] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used . Exam ples of such events are:
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatm ent wi th N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (e.g. neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
B 6 Intensity rating scale:
1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
3. severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and se vere AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] B 2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not ne cessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B
2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2.

Clinical Study Protocol -4.0
[COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00013
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 138of 166When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
 Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
 Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
 De-challenge experience.  Di d the A E resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
 No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_96786], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Re-challenge exper ience.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally 
recommend or support a re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough

Tezepelumab -D5180C00013
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 139of 166For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant 
or has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medi cation error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error: 
 Occurred
 Was i dentified and intercept ed before the participant received the drug
 Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
 Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
 Dispensing error e.g. medicat ion prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  
given to the participant
 Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
 Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as 
a solid tablet 
 Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
 Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples o f events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one 
of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 144of 166Appendix D Genetics
D 1 Use/analysis of DNA
Genet ic variat ion may impact a subject’s response to therapy , susceptibilit y to, and severi ty 
and progression of disease.  Variable response to therapy may  be due to ge netic determinants 
that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism of act ion of 
the drug; disease etio logy; and/or m olecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, 
where local regulat ions and IRB/IEC allow, blood samples will be co llected for DNA analysis 
from consent ing subjects.
[COMPANY_008] intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to 
medications.  Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis 
of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery o f new di agnost ics, 
treatm ents or m edicat ions.  
In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from po pulat ions wit h well described clinical 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, i.e. the 
entire geno me. 
The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study  report (CSR) or in a 
separate study  summary.
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protec t confident iality.
The samples will be retained while research on tezepelumab cont inues but no l onger than [ADDRESS_106840] of the main study .

Clinical Study  Protocol .
Collection of samples for genetic research
Blood sam ples for geneti c research will be obtained from subjects at any  time after the 
consent is signed. Although DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid 
introducing bias through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE),
such subjects would be important to include in any genet ic analysis. Only one sample should 
be co llected per subject for genetics during the study. Samples will be co llected, labelled, 
stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and s torage of DNA samples

and evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix descr ibes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) and Hy’s Law (HL) cases.  It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance 
on managi ng liver abnormalit ies can be found in Section 7.1of the Clinical Study  Protocol .
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_96724]  a central  laboratory  and/or el evated TBL fro m 
a local laboratory .
The Investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical proje ct representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met.  
HL cri teria are m et if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI ) caused by  [CONTACT_96789] (IMP).  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AE and SAE according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with 
standard safet y reporti ng processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3× upper limit of 
norm al (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2×ULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP).  
Hy’s Law (HL)
Clinical Study Protocol -4.[ADDRESS_106844] or ALT ≥ 3× ULN together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, e.g.. elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e., on 
the sam e day) the el evation in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the 
elevations in transaminas es and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation orin combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3×ULN
 AST ≥ 3×ULN
 TBL ≥ 2×ULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a subject meets any o f the PHL i dentificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant fo r any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_96790]
 Com plete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:

criteria are met will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
 Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E 2for definit ion) 
by [CONTACT_96791]
 Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF
E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
 Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidanc e 
provi ded in the CSP.
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
 Within [ADDRESS_106845] igator will report the case as an 
SAE of Potential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y 
assessment ‘y es/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
 For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the Invest igator i s not 
requi red to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s 
condi tion.
 The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and 
agree an approach for the study  subjects’ fo llow-up and the continuous review of 
data.  
 Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_73016]:

symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE form  as required. 
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which tests available in 
the Hy ’s law lab ki t shoul d be used. 
Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s Law cases
The instruc tions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on w hether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_96792] m the date 
PHL cri teria was m et.  The [COMPANY_008] Glo bal Clinical Le ad or equivalent and Global Safet y 
Physician will also be invo lved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted PHL 
SAE and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event term; 
causalit y and seri ousness cr iteria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes. 
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no 
other serious criteria apply

[COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00013
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 152of 166As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y 
assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 calendar d ays in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Provi de any further update to the previ ously  submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP 
and seriousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE 
reporting.
 Continue fo llow-up and review accordin g to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL 
SAE report following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcom e of 
the review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemistry  elevat ions is determined.

J1 Home IP Administration Instructions
Due to local travel  restrictions and/or site restri ctions, patients may not wish to or m ay not be 
able to go to the study  site for study  visits and related procedures. If an on-site visit is not 
possible, it is recommended home administrati on of IP by a qualified HCP, provi ded this is 
acceptable within local regulat ion/guidance. This is to ensure safet y of the study  subjects and
minimum disrupt ion to IP administration that may occur during the COVID -[ADDRESS_106856] ion are listed below under the extra dose(s)

The l ast follow up v isit is an on -site visi t where safety  assessments are performed including 
vital signs, bl ood and urine samples and physical examinat ion. There are several current ly 
enrolled subjects who are expected to have their last follow up visit on site. During the 
COVID -19 pandemic, on -site follow up visit may  be replaced by a phone call and/or a virtual 
visit if allowed by [CONTACT_5737]/regio nal guidelines. 
Having a phone call and/or a virtual visit with the subject will allow :
Adverse Events 
Concomitant Medication
Exacer bation history  to be reported and documented for safet y
J3 Extra Dose(s)
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, sites may administer 1 -6 addit ional IP doses at weeks 28,

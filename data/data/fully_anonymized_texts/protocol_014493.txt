NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_483930] AND SCHEMA  
 
Th
is is a phase I/II study to determine: 1) the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended 
phase II dose of ABT-888 in combination with radiation therapy, and 2) the efficacy of 
administering ABT-888 concurrently with radiation therapy, followed by [CONTACT_386236]-888 and temozolomide (TMZ), in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic 
pontine glioma (DIPG).  
 
This study consists of two parts: the phase 1, dose-finding component of the trial to estimate the 
MTD or recommended phase II dose of ABT-888 in combination with radiation therapy, and the 
phase 2 component of the study to evaluate the efficacy of ABT-888 and radiation therapy, 
followed by [CONTACT_386237]-888 and TMZ, in children with newly diagnosed 
DIPG. Upon completion of ABT-888 and radiation therapy, patients enrolled in the Phase I study 
will
 continue with maintenance therapy with ABT-888 at 25 mg/m2 bid and TMZ at 135 
mg/m2/day for 5 days every 28 days, the recommended phase II doses determined from PBTC-
027. After Phase I is completed, all patients will receive radiation and ABT-888, at the 
MTD/recommended phase II dose determined from the Phase I study, followed by [CONTACT_386238]-888 at 25 mg/m2 bid and TMZ at 135 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_483931] bone marrow reserve, we hypothesize that children for this clinical trial 
may tolerate higher combination doses of ABT-888 and TMZ compared to the children studied 
on PBTC-027. Therefore, during the maintenance therapy phase of bot h the Phase I and Phase II 
studies, intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ will be studied. Each patient will start maintenance 
therapy with ABT-888 at 25 mg/m2 bid and TMZ at 135 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 28 days. 
The TMZ dose will be escalated to 175 mg/m2/day and then to 200 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 
28 days if no minimal toxicity is observed after each course. 
 
Th
e primary endpoints for the Phase I study will be toxicity and safety monitoring of ABT-888 
in
 combination with radiation therapy and will include DLTs and toxic death.  Dose-modifying 
toxicities for maintenance therapy will also be monitored to guide intra-patient dose escalation of 
TMZ and to terminate intra-patient dose escalation if excessive toxicity is observed (section  
5.1.3 ). The primary endpoint for the Phase II study will be the evaluation of the treatment 
efficacy as measured by 1-year overall survival (OS), with 1-year progression-free survival 
(PFS) and best tumor responses observed prior to tumor progression as the secondary measures 
of treatment efficacy.  
 
PARP activity, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity, and γ–H2AX level in peripheral 
blood monocytes (PBMCs) will be quantified pre-treatment, [ADDRESS_483932] course of 
maintenance therapy, as surrogate measures of intra-tumoral PARP inhibition and unrepaired 
double-str anded DNA breaks (DSB).  In atypi[INVESTIGATOR_386193], PARP 
activity and DNA repair protein status will be studied either in frozen tumor material or FFPE 
samples as described in section 9.1.3 . These molecular data will be correlated retrospectively 
NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, 2014 
7 with
 efficacy measures outlined above. Pharmacokinetic studies of ABT-888 on day 1 and day 4 
of ABT-888 and radiation treatment will also be performed. These PK studies will be required 
for Phase I and optional for Phase II of the study. 
 
To
 differentiate pseudoprogression from true early progressive disease, quantitative MR 
mea
sures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), permeability (Ktrans, vp, and ve values), 
and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) will be obtained at diagnosis and during the first six 
months after starting protocol therapy and correlated with disease outcome, including whether 
such metrics differentiate patients with pseudoprogression from those with true early progressive 
disease.   
 
Urine biomarkers will be employed to study the feasibility of a novel, non-invasive method to 
detect the presence, progression and response to therapy of pediatric brain tumors.   
 
Schema:  
Phase I Study 
ABT
-888 will be given twice daily on Monday through Friday, for 6-7 weeks, during daily 
radiation therapy (see table below). The first dose of ABT-[ADDRESS_483933] remain NPO in the morning, ABT-888 should be given nightly prior to sleep, 
with the day time dose given shortly after the child awakens from sedation, adhering as closely 
to an every 12 hour schedule as possible.  
 
Schema – Radiation Phase of Therapy  
Week  [ADDRESS_483934]/ Evaluation  
Radiation Therapy  Daily, M -F for 6 -7 weeks  
 
Dose Level 1 of ABT-888 during radiation treatment will be approximately 80% of the dose that 
has been safely tolerated in adults (100 mg BID). It is also expected that the 150 mg bid dose 
level in adults will be declared tolerable shortly.  Dose escalation/de-escalation will be done 
using a standard phase I, 3 + 3 design in increments of approximately 30% (see the table below).  
If the adult dose of 150 mg bid with radiation has been declared tolerable by [CONTACT_386239], and the starting dose level of 50 mg/m2 bid is also tolerated in children, 
we propose to proceed from dose level 1 directly to dose level 3 (85 mg/m2 bid, equivalent to the 
adult dose of 150 mg bid). If dose level 3 is not tolerated, then we will de-escalate to dose level 
2. If dose level 3 is tolerated, we will study dose level 4 only if supported by [CONTACT_386240].*

Phase II Study 
Phase II of the study will begin when the MTD/recommended phase II dose of ABT-[ADDRESS_483936] of ABT-888 and TMZ beginning at week 11 (3-4 weeks after the completion 
of radiation and ABT-888).   Starting doses of maintenance therapy will be 25 mg/m2 bid of 
ABT-888 and 135 mg/m2/day of TMZ, for 5 days every 28 days, which are the recommended 
ph
ase II doses from PBTC-027. Since this dose determination was based on children with 
refractory brain tumors, many of whom were heavily pre-treated, it is possible that children with 
newly diagnosed DIPG, who are chemotherapy naïve at entry, will tolerate higher doses of ABT-
888 and TMZ during maintenance. In an effort to maximize the TMZ dose (and potentially the 
efficacy of the combination treatment) that can be administered with ABT-888 for each patient, 
intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ will be studied only for patients with minimal 
hematologic toxicities in each course, defined as ≤ Grade 1 thrombocytopenia and ≤ Grade 
2 neutropenia, and minimal non-hematologic toxicities not meeting the definition of dose-
m
odifying toxicities in section [IP_ADDRESS], after their first course of maintenance therapy at Dose 
L
evel 1. These patients’ TMZ dose will be escalated for Course 2 to 175 mg/m2/day (Dose Level 
2), and subsequently (Course 3) to 200 mg/m2/day of TMZ (Dose Level 3) if the toxicities 
observed after 1 course of protocol therapy at each dose level meet the above criteria.

1. OB JECTIVES 
 
1.1 P hase I Primary Objectives 
1. To identify the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase II dose of ABT-888 which 
can be safely administered concurrently with radiation therapy, followed by [CONTACT_386241]-888 and TMZ, in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. 
2. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-[ADDRESS_483940] tumor 
responses observed prior to progression or recurrence. 
2. To explore the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 during ABT-888 and radiation 
therapy.  
3. To explore peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) PARP activity before and after 
treatment with ABT-888. 
4. To explore quantifying non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity or -H2AX levels (as 
surrogate markers of unrepaired DSBs) in PBMC before and after treatment with ABT-888. 
5. To explore quantifying PARP activity and DNA repair protein levels in biopsied atypi[INVESTIGATOR_386194], if available. 
6. To explore associations of molecular parameters from secondary aims 3, 4 and 5 with PFS 
and OS after conclusion of clinical trial. 
7. To explore the quantitative MR measures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), vascular 
p
ermeability (Ktrans, vp, and ve values), and apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) within the 
first six months of initiating protocol treatment to correlate with disease outcome and 
determine whether such metrics differentiate patients with pseudoprogression from those 
with true early progressive disease. 
8. To explore the potential utility of urine biomarkers as a novel, non-invasive method of 
detecting and tracking changes in the status of pediatric brain stem gliomas.

2. B ACKGROUND 
 
2.1 S tudy Disease (s) 
Pediatric Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas 
Prognosis for children with diffuse pontine glioma (DIPG) remains dismal and has not changed 
substantially during the last three decades. The combined 1-year PFS from three recent PBTC 
clinical trials for 140 patients with newly diagnosed DIPG was 15.9 ± 3.1% (section 13 .1), 
highlighting the continued need for novel treatment approaches in this population. Assuming that 
these aggressive tumors are generally irradiation resistant, and intensification of traditional 
chemotherapy agents failed to improve outcome, it is reasonable to hypothesize that novel agents 
that target a critical tumor-specific pathway mediating irradiation and/or chemotherapy 
resistance may be worthy of clinical investigation. 
 
2.2 CTE P IND Agent 
ABT-
888 - Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) and DNA Repair 
Most c
hemotherapy drugs induce single-stranded DNA breaks (SSB), and irradiation induces 
double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB). It is hypothesized that refractory pediatric CNS tumors 
have enhanced SSB and DSB repair and are therefore resistant to chemotherapy and irradiation, 
respectively. Repair of SSB is mediated by [CONTACT_16000], including the base-excision 
repair (BER), and DSBs are repaired by [CONTACT_386242] (HRR) and non-
homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a 
critical enzyme that binds to SSBs and DSBs and recruits and activates repair proteins from the 
BER,1 NHEJ,2 and HRR3 pathways. Elevated PARP expression and/or activity may therefore 
med
iate chemotherapy and irradiation resistance in CNS tumors. 
 
PARP Over-Expression in Pediatric CNS Tumors 
We have previously shown that 56 out of 59 pediatric medulloblastomas (MB) and 16 out of 18 
p
ediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have elevated PARP expression by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC), compared to absent expression in age-matched normal brain (JM 
Su and XN Li, unpublished data; data previously summarized in PBTC-027). Other investigators 
h
ave also demonstrated PARP over-expression in pediatric CNS tumors,[ADDRESS_483941] that elevated PARP activity in pediatric brain tumors may enhance DNA 
repair after irradiation or chemotherapy, mediate treatment resistance, and serve as a potential 
therapeutic target for enhancing sensitivity to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. 
 
2.2.1 Preclinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ABT-888 Enhances Pediatric CNS Tumor Response to Chemotherapy 
ABT-888 is a potent oral PARP inhibitor that potentiates chemotherapy drugs and enhances 
radiation efficacy in xenograft models of human tumors.6,7  We previously showed that ABT-888 
e
ffectively penetrates the blood-brain barrier (CSF to plasma ratio 57 +/- 7% in non-human 
p
rimate models)8 and enhanced in vivo tumor response to temozolomide (TMZ) in a pediatric 
GBM and
 MB intracranial xenograft models (Figure 1A, 1B; JM Su and XN Li, unpublished 
data).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Preferential accumulation of ABT-888 in brain tumor versus plasma 
GBM and MB xenografts and neighboring cerebrum or cerebellum were harvested immediately 
after 5 days of ABT-888 treatment and analyzed for ABT-888 concentrations by [CONTACT_60628]-mass spectroscopy. ABT-888 accumulated preferentially in the xenografts compared to normal neighboring brain, and the tumor to plasma ratio of ABT-888 was 8.25 +/- 6 (n = 10 mice; JM Su and XN Li, unpublished data). This preferential accumulation of ABT-888 in intracranial xenograft tumors was also previously confirmed by [CONTACT_386243].
6 This 
preferential accumulation of ABT-888 in brain tumors, achieving concentration exceeding 5-fold of the plasma level, is a potential therapeutic advantage in targeting CNS tumors.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  ABT-888 Enhances Pediatric MB and GBM Response to Irradiation 
Using primary cultured cells from freshly resected surgical specimens (6 pediatric MB and 5 
GBM), we studied the potential of in vitro  radiation enhancement by [CONTACT_345040]-888 treatment. 
Potential CD133+ tumor stem cells were isolated by [CONTACT_386244]-stem tumor cells in 96-well plates. We selected an ABT-888 concentration range of 1 to 5 µM, corresponding to plasma concentration of ~ 50 to 244 ng/ml (assuming a tumor to plasma ratio of 5, which we and others have demonstrated in xenograft models), which has been safely achieved in adult and pediatric trials (see data below). Tumor cells were pre-treated with ABT-888 for 24 hours, followed by a single fraction of irradiation, and then drug treatment was continued for 14 days, and cell viability was estimated with cell counting kit 8 (CCK8). ABT-888 treatment resulted in radiation sensitization of either non-stem or stem-like tumor cells in 5 out of 6 MB and 4 out of 5 GBM models (Figure 2).

morning dose delivered 30-60 minutes prior to daily irradiation. Animals were then observed 
after 5 days of treatment. We started with ABT-888 at 12.5 mg/kg bid (25 mg/kg/day), the dose 
that has been shown to optimize chemotherapy potentiation without causing excessive toxicities. 
While there was a trend toward increasing survival in the group of animals that received ABT-
888 and radiation, the result did not achieve statistical significance (data not shown).  
 
 
 we repeated the in vivo experiments described above but with increased dosing of ABT-
888 (a
t 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day). Animals that received ABT-888 (50 mg/kg/day) with 
radiation showed statistically significant improved survival compared to control animals that 
received radiation or ABT-888 alone (Figure 3). In the cohort of animals that received ABT-888 
at 100 mg/kg/day, those mice that received ABT-888 and radiation also showed improved 
survival, but the survival curve is not finalized yet (data not shown ).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase I Trial of ABT-888 and XRT in Adults 
[COMPANY_013] Laboratories began a phase I clinical trial of ABT-888, TMZ, and XRT, followed by 
[CONTACT_345040]-888
 and TMZ for 4 additional courses in adults with newly diagnosed GBM in early 2010 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
 
 
 
 
[COMPANY_013] Laboratories is also completing another phase I study of ABT-888 and whole-brain 
irrad
iation in adults with solid tumors metastatic to the brain ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Irradiation is 
administered in either 15 fractions (2.5 Gy daily) for 3 weeks, for a total of 37.5 Gy, with ABT-
888 given bid daily throughout the duration of XRT. No DLT has been observed with ABT-888 
at 50 mg or 100 mg bid (6 and 7 patients, respectively), and the trial is continuing with patients 
receiving ABT-888 at 150 mg BID, with the expectation that this dose level will be declared 
tolerable by [CONTACT_386245] 2011 (  Alice Chen, 
CTEP, personal communication).

.2.3 Pediatric Studies 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase l Trial of ABT-[ADDRESS_483943] completed a phase I clinical trial of ABT-888 and TMZ in children with 
re
current/refractory CNS tumors through the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC-027; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
). The initial treatment schema was as follows:

4 30 mg/m2 /dose BID  200 mg/m2/day 
 
Three patients on Dose Level 1 and two patients on Dose Level 0 experienced hematologic 
DLTs (grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia). Six additional children were enrolled 
onto Dose Level -1, and only 1 patient had a hematologic DLT (a delay in ANC recovery). One 
patient developed grade-[ADDRESS_483944] been observed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative Biological Studies 
Pharmacokinetic data from children enrolled onto PBTC-027 (Table 2) showed that, based on 
AUC 0
->12hr and steady state C max, p ediatric ABT-888 drug exposure at 15 mg/m2 is similar to 
adult dosing at 20 mg bid, and pediatric ABT-888 drug exposure at 20 mg/m2 bid is slightly 
lower than adult dosing at 40 mg bid (AUC 0->12hr  1.55 µg•hr/mL in 1 child vs 1.87 +/- 0.49 
µ
g•hr/mL in 3 adults). Based on maximally effective AUC 0->24hr  of 3 µg•hr/mL predicted from 
a
nimal models and observed AUC 0->24hr  of 3.74 µg•hr/mL in adults receiving ABT-888 at 40 mg 
bid, it appears that pediatric dosing of 20 mg/m2 bid or higher would be required to match the 
drug exposure seen in adults receiving 40 mg bid. Furthermore, PARP inhibition in PBMCs from 
children on PBTC-027 was highly variable, averaging only 31.5 +/- 33.6% inhibition in seven 
p
atients.

Based on the preliminary PK and pharmacodynamic data from PBTC-027, the trial was amended 
in an effort to optimize ABT-888 drug exposure and PARP inhibition. The revised treatment 
schema  is as follows:

Updated Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_483945] any DLT. One out of 3 children 
treated on revised Dose Level 2 had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Another patient on Dose Level 2 
had ~40% tumor reduction after 1 course of protocol therapy but also had a symptomatic 
ischemic infarction within the tumor/brainstem. This complication has not been observed in 
mo
re than 472 adult patients receiving ABT-888 on various phase I trials to date (CTEP, Alice 
Chen, personal communication).  However, since a possible attribution to ABT-888 could not be 
completely excluded, three additional patients were enrolled onto Dose Level 1, and no DLTs 
we
re observed in the six patients treated on Dose Level 1. 
 
Pharmacokinetic data from children on the revised treatment schema are as follows:

It appears that children who received ABT-888 at 25 mg/m2 bid showed PK profile that is 
essentially identical to adults who received the drug at 40 mg bid, the recommended phase II 
dos
e in current adult trials.

gh the sample sizes at each dose level are small, it appears that PARP inhibition is greater 
at 25 mg/m2 bid versus 20 mg/m2 bid. 
 
Based on available PK and PARP inhibition data, and with the aim of optimizing drug exposure 
and biological effect, we amended the PBTC-027 trial to enroll additional patients at Dose Level 
2 (ABT-888 at 25 mg/m2 bid, TMZ at 135 mg/m2/day, for 5 days every 28 days) with close 
monitoring for CNS toxicity. Three additional patients were enrolled on Dose Level 2, and no 
DL
Ts were observed. Thus, Dose Level 2 (ABT-888 at 25 mg/m2 bi d, TMZ at 135 mg/m2/day, 
for 5 days every 28 days) is the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for children with recurrent 
o
r refractory CNS tumors.  
 
To date, a total of twelve patients on PBTC27 have been treated on RP2D, and except for one 
grade-[ADDRESS_483947] two patients, no 
other dose-limiting toxicities were reported. 
 
2.3 Rationa le 
This will be a Phase I/II study of ABT-888 and concurrent radiation treatment, followed by 
[CONTACT_386246]-888 and TMZ, in children with newly diagnosed DIPG. Phase I of the 
s
tudy will be the dose-finding portion of the trial to determine the MTD/recommended phase II 
dose of ABT-888 that can be safely administered with radiation treatment. Dosing of ABT-888 
during irradiation will start at 80% of the adult dose (100 mg bid) that has been safely tolerated 
(section 2.2.2  and 5 .1.1.2 ). After completion of ABT-888 and radiation treatment, patients in 
Phase I of the study will continue with maintenance therapy, receiving ABT-888 and TMZ at the 
re
commended phase II doses determined from PBTC-027 (section 5.1.3 ). Intra-patient dose 
escalation of TMZ will also be studied to optimize TMZ exposure for individual patients (section 
5
.1.3.1 ). 
 
The Phase II study will commence once the MTD/recommended phase II dose of ABT-888 that 
c
an be safely administered with radiation has been determined from the Phase I study. All 
p
atients in the Phase II study will also continue with maintenance therapy, starting with ABT-
888
 and TMZ at the recommended phase II doses determined from PBTC-027. Intra-patient dose 
e
scalation of TMZ will continue to be studied unless excessive toxicities are observed (section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ).  In the absence of excessive toxicities or disease progression, all patients can receive up 
to
 [ADDRESS_483948] confirmed ABT-888’s radiation potentiation in several adult cancers, 
and we have shown similarly that ABT-888 treatment inhibited DSB repair and enhanced 
efficacy of radiation in pediatric CNS tumors, including GBM. It is therefore reasonable to study 
ABT-888 concurrently with irradiation in children with newly diagnosed DIPG tumors. 
 
2.3.2  Rationale for ABT-888 and TMZ 
T
MZ treatment concurrently with radiation therapy and continuing as maintenance therapy for 
NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_483949] of care for adults with GBM. Although in children with high-
grade glioma and DIPG, a COG clinical trial (ACNS0126) of TMZ and irradiation followed by 
[CONTACT_386247], we 
hypothesize that TMZ resistance may account for the lack of therapeutic benefit in the majority 
of p
atients. Several pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that PARP inhibition enhanced in 
vitro  and in viv o  TMZ cytotoxicity in multiple malignant glioma cell lines and xenograft models, 
and such enhanced TMZ cytotoxicity was observed despi[INVESTIGATOR_386195]/or 
MMR deficiency,10-[ADDRESS_483950] shown that PARP is highly expressed in pediatric GBMs and brainstem 
gliomas. As radiation treatment only leads to a transient response in these aggressive tumors, it is 
highly likely PARP over-expression, either at the time of diagnosis or in response to irradiation, 
contributes to apparent radiation resistance. We therefore propose to study the benefit of ABT-
888, a PARP inhibitor, in overcoming the radiation resistance in pediatric DIPG. 
 
2.3.4 Rationale for ABT-888 Dosing During Radiation 
Although it appears that, from the adult clinical trials, ABT-888 administered concurrently with 
TMZ and irradiation is associated with dose-limiting hematologic toxicities, administration of 
ABT-
888 concurrently with radiation therapy only has been well tolerated. No DLT was 
observed at 100 mg BID and cumulative radiation doses of 37.5 Gy and it is anticipated that the 
dose
 of 150 mg BID in adults will be declared tolerable by [CONTACT_386245] 2011 (  
[COMPANY_013] Laboratories and Alice Chen, CTEP, personal communication). We therefore 
p
ropos
e to start at the 80% of the adult dose (100 mg bid) that has been safely tolerated and 
allow for 2 dose escalations to reach a pediatric dose that is equivalent to 150 mg BID in adults. 
 
2.4 Cor relative Studies Background 
 
2.4.1 Rationale for Biology Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential Mechanism of Resistance against PARP Inhibition 
Pre-clinical studies have shown that ABT-[ADDRESS_483951]-treatment DSB capability in patients’ peripheral blood monocytes

Updated Date: February 4, 2014 
20 (P
BMC) and plan to correlate results retrospectively with clinical outcomes. We also propose to 
document pre- and post-treatment PARP activity in PBMC as a surrogate measure of ABT-[ADDRESS_483952] be biopsied and 
p
roven to be high-grade gliomas prior to patients’ enrollment, we also propose to quantify PARP 
activity and DNA repair protein levels (Ku 70, Ku 80, DNA-PK, BRCA 1, BRCA 2, Rad51, and 
ATM) in either frozen tumors or FFPE samples. These molecular data will help in guiding the 
d
esign of a future phase [ADDRESS_483953] 6 months after the initiation of ABT-888 and irradiation (on 
required MRI studies performed at weeks 10, week 18, or 26), the treating physician will have 
th
e option of allowing the patient to remain on study, continuing protocol therapy, and repeating 
disease reassessment in 4-6 weeks. Provided that the patient does not show clinical deterioration 
consistent with tumor progression, has been on a stable or declining dose of steroids, and the 
subsequent MRI demonstrates tumor regression or stable disease, then the patient will remain on 
study and continue protocol therapy, and the frequency of subsequent MRI will revert to pre-
specified intervals. If the repeat MRI after 4-6 weeks shows disease progression, rather than 
ps
eudo-progression, then the time of progression will be the date of the initial MRI, not the 
follow up scan. 
 
Key to assessing disease course and potential pseudoprogression is inclusion of detailed clinical 
data documenting each patient’s status at the time of scheduled imaging or upon institutional call 
of “progressive disease.”  The ability to track neurologic status, symptoms or signs potentially 
heralding or reflecting progressive disease, or apparent neurologic stability is important in 
correlating clinical status with imaging findings, and documenting the clinical and/or imaging 
findings that prompt the investigator to call “progressive disease.” We recently documented a 
re
lationship between tumor volume and diffusion (measured by [CONTACT_386248]) prior to and immediately after irradiation in a cross-protocol analysis of prior PBTC 
newly diagnosed DIPG patients. Tumors with larger diffusion values seemed to respond early to 
radiation therapy and percent reduction in ADC values correlated with both progression-free and 
overall survival rates.[ADDRESS_483954] one of the 40 
patient’s studied.19  
 
As a secondary objective, we shall study relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), vascular 
permeability (Ktrans) along with both fractional plasma volume (v p) and the extravascular volume 
fraction (v e), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as parameters hypothesized to 
differentiate pseudoprogression from true early disease progression (PD). These parameters will 
be studied with serial imaging over the first 6 months after the initiation of ABT-888 and 
irr
adiation; quantitative MR metrics will be retrospectively correlated with clinical outcomes to 
study if they reliably distinguish pseudo-progression from early PD.   
 
Recent preliminary work with adult glioblastoma patients has shown the potential of MR 
NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_483955] that ADC values can 
be used to differentiate residual/recurrent tumor from necrosis.[ADDRESS_483956] 6 months following treatment with ABT-888 and concurrent 
radiation therapy, pseudoprogression will be marked by [CONTACT_386249] (rCBV) compared to that seen in true early progression. T2*-weighted dynamic 
susceptibility-contrast MR imaging will be acquired to determine serial rCBV values. 
 
In addition, we hypothesize that pseudoprogression will demonstrate significantly lower vascular 
permeability (Ktrans) and fractional plasma volume (v p) compared to cases with true early 
progression. The lower v p is postulated to be the result of the absence of angiogenesis that 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_386196].  Extravascular extracellular space volume fraction (v e) 
will likely be significantly higher in pseudoprogression versus true early progression. This is 
postulated to be the result of a decrease in cellularity and an increase in the extracellular space 
seen in necrosis. T1-weighted dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging will be used to determine 
the Ktrans, vp, and v e values serially during the first [ADDRESS_483957] been noted in the brainstem, following treatment for 
posterior fossa tumors arising outside brainstem itself.30   Diffusion tensor imaging will be used 
to assess the fractional anisotropy and ADC values within the tumor, within the white matter of 
the pons, and within the uninvolved midbrain and medulla. 
 
2.4.3 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Studies 
Based on pre-clinical data demonstrating ABT-888’s radiation potentiation in pediatric CNS 
tumor models and adult phase I clinical data, we will be administering ABT-888 at doses higher 
than 50 mg/m2/day (the highest dose studied in PBTC-027) concurrently with radiation therapy. 
It would be imperative that we characterize PK profile of ABT-888 when given at higher doses 
in combination with radiation therapy, especially if unanticipated toxicities are encountered. 
Furthermore, these PK data will be critical in optimal planning of a future phase III study. 
Therefore, PK studies for ABT-888 during radiation therapy will be REQUIRED FOR THE 
P
HASE I STUDY. PK studies for ABT-888 during radiation for the Phase II study will also be 
p
erformed but will be optional .

Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_483958] tumor recurrence remains limited.  Clinicians 
n
eed to know when a tumor is present and – if previously treated – whether recurrence or tumor 
p
rogression is occurring in order to most effectively direct therapy.  For some of the most 
common pediatric brain tumors, such as medulloblastoma, ependymoma and juvenile pi[INVESTIGATOR_386197], patient outcome is closely linked with extent of resection.31-36 Timely diagnosis of 
the presence of disease – including recurrence - is of particular importance in the brain, where 
ra
dical maneuvers to contain tumor spread are often not possible because of eloquent neural 
tissue.  Clinical detection (through observation of neurologic deterioration) of recurrent brain 
tu
mors is twice as likely as asymptomatic radiographic recurrence, yet for patients with 
re
currence detected radiographically before symptoms became present – the patients with early 
d
etection who are less likely to have widespread tumor dispersal - had better survival.[ADDRESS_483959] migrated, increasing the chances for a curative surgical resection.  
 
Unfortunately, certain subtypes of brain tumors remain challenging to treat at any time due to 
growth within sensitive parts of the brain or intrinsic biologic characteristics conferring 
resistance to therapy.  Yet even with these types of tumors, such as diffuse intrinsic pontine 
gliomas (DIPG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the ability to identify tumor status and 
response to therapy or progression is important so that clinicians provide patients and families 
with accurate prognostic information.   
 
We therefore propose to study the feasibility of a novel, non-invasive method employing urinary 
biomarkers to detect the presence, progression and response to therapy of pediatric brain tumors.  
Studies from our laboratory, now confirmed by [CONTACT_2312], support the premise that tumor stage and 
progression may correlate with urinary levels of specific biomarkers,38,[ADDRESS_483960] to other more general methods of high-throughput 
proteomic analyses. 
 
Current methods of brain tumor diagnosis and follow-up center around the use of infrequent 
clinical examinations and expensive radiographic studies, such as computerized tomography 
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that often require sedation or anesthesia in 
children.  By [CONTACT_22242], urine collection carries no risks to the patient and is far less expensive 
(100-fold less than MRIs) so it can easily be done at frequent intervals, potentially enabling 
e
arlier detection of recurrent disease and dynamic evaluation of response to therapy.  Urine 
collection is easy, non-invasive, and can be done locally, saving families travel to tertiary care

enters. Analysis is rapid , with a turnaround time of [ADDRESS_483961] results are numerical and are 
compared to specific statistical cutpoints, obviating the need for analysis that relies on subjective 
measures, such as film review or tissue staining.  Additionally, biomarkers provide a method of 
assessment that relies on metabolic activity; a different – and complementary – approach to the 
c
urrent method of neuroimaging evaluation.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Selection of Brainstem Glioma 
The proof- of-principle data described above suggests that urinary biomarkers may have potential 
to identify the presence of brain tumors.  Further validation of this hypothesis would be bolstered 
by [CONTACT_386250] (response to therapy or progression) are reflected in 
corresponding changes in biomarker levels.   
 
This project will focus on urinary biomarker levels in children with brainstem glioma.  These 
patients represent a relatively homogenous population, minimizing variability in age (children), 
tumor pathology (high grade glioma), location (pontine, without concern for dissemination 
within the neuraxis) and treatment regimens.  As these lesions are not treated with surgical 
excision, the imprecision inherent to measuring the degree of resection will not be present.  The 
near-uniform progression of these tumors within a short window of time (>80% of patients 
manifest disease progression within 1 year) allows for data to be collected within a manageable 
time frame.  In combination, these characteristics support the use of this group as an ideal study 
population.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Justification for Data Collection 
One of the objectives of this study is to identify whether biomarker levels correlate with changes 
in tumor status.   In order to accurately reflect current practice, we will collect clinical data (as 
measured by [CONTACT_386251]) and several different types of radiographic measures, 
including changes in size, altered enhancement pattern and the radiologist’s overall assessment 
of tumor status. 
 
Control urines will be obtained from a pre-existing, institutional review board approved urine 
bank in the Vascular Biology Program at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724].  These samples come from 
children with radiographic evaluation of their central nervous system by [CONTACT_9268].  Children may

2.5 S ummary 
In conclusion, ABT-888, combined with chemotherapy or radiation, has demonstrated anti-tumor 
activity in orthotopic xenograft models of pediatric GBM and has shown an acceptable toxicity 
profile in adult and pediatric phase I trials.  Available data suggests that PARP is over-expressed 
in multiple malignancies, including pediatric high-grade gliomas, and therefore inhibition of this 
target may overcome chemotherapy and/or radiation resistance. Given the dismal prognosis for 
children with DIPG, it is appropriate to evaluate the combination of ABT-[ADDRESS_483966] be available in the patient’s medical or research record.

should ideally be given 60-120 minutes prior to daily radiation treatment. For patients who 
require sedation for radiation treatment and are not able to take the oral medication due to local 
re
quirements for NPO prior to sedation, ABT-888 may be given nightly, and the daytime dose 
g
iven shortly after the child awakens from sedation, adhering as closely to an every 12-hour 
schedule as possible. However, if local sedation guidelines permit, then the morning ABT-888 
dose should be taken 60-120 minutes prior to radiation. Periodic adjustments in the timing of 
twice daily ABT-888 administration are allowed if needed to accommodate patient/family 
convenience provided that the daytime dose is given as close to 60-[ADDRESS_483981] 1 mg 
(e.g. 1.4mg to be rounded to 1.0 mg and 1.5mg to be rounded to 2mg).   Specific instructions for

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose-finding Period for the Phase I study 
The observation period for DLTs (Course 1) during Phase I of the study includes the entire 
duration of radiation therapy (approximately 6 to 7 weeks, allowing for delays in XRT for 
holidays, mask adjustments, etc.) and the rest period between the end of radiation therapy and the 
start of maintenance treatment on week 11.  Dose limiting toxicities are defined in section 5.2.

.1.1.2  Dose Escalations during ABT-888 and Irradiation 
Dose Level 1 of ABT-888 during radiation treatment will be approximately 80% of the adult 
dose of 100 mg bid, which has been well tolerated. It is also expected that the 150 mg bid dose 
level in adults will be declared tolerable shortly.  Dose escalation/de-escalation will be done 
using a standard phase I, 3 + 3 design in increments of approximately 30% (see Table 10 below). 
If the adult dose of 150 mg bid with radiation has been declared tolerable by [CONTACT_386239], and the starting dose level of 50 mg/m2 bid is also tolerated in children, 
we propose to proceed from dose level 1 directly to dose level 3 (85 mg/m2 bid, equivalent to the 
a
dult dose of 150 mg bid). If dose level 3 is not tolerated, then we will de-escalate to dose level 
2. If dose level 3 is tolerated, we will study dose level 4 only if supported by [CONTACT_386240].*

5.1.2 Drug Administration during Radiation - Phase II 
Th
e Phase II portion of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of ABT-888 and radiation therapy (at 
the maximum tolerated or recommended ABT-888 dose level from the Phase I study), followed 
by [CONTACT_386253] 10 cycles of ABT-888 and temozolomide in patients with newly 
diagnosed DIPG.  Follow instructions for administering ABT-888 during radiation for the Phase

Main
tenance therapy of ABT-888 and TMZ will begin approximately at week 11 (3-4 weeks 
a
fter the completion of irradiation and ABT-888) provided that the patient’s bone marrow, renal, 
and hepatic organ functions continue to meet on study criteria.  ABT-888 will be given twice 
d
aily, with the morning dose given 60-120 minutes prior to the daily dose of TMZ.  ABT-888

Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT 
Investigators using IMRT will be required to comply with the guidelines developed for the use of 
IMRT in National Cancer Institute sponsored cooperative group trials. These guidelines are 
available through www.qarc.org. These guidelines require that the protocol explicitly state their 
requirements and methods for localization and immobilization; the use of volumetric imaging; 
target and organ motion management; nomenclature, definitions, and rationale for targets and 
organs at risk; target volume coverage and normal tissue dose constraints; effects of 
heterogeneity in tissues; and quality assurance. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Indications for Radiation Therapy 
All patients enrolled on this protocol will receive concurrent ABT-888 and radiation therapy. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing 
All patients should be seen in consultation by a radiation oncologist at the time of study 
enrollment. The purpose of the consultation is to participate in the initial evaluation and to 
review the adequacy of the initial diagnostic imaging studies that will be used for subsequent RT 
planning. If additional imaging studies are pursued, thin section MR (T2-weighted and FLAIR) 
sequences should be obtained for registration to the CT data set to assist in treatment planning. 
 
Patients are not allowed to have received radiation therapy prior to enrollment on this protocol 
and urgent irradiation is not envisioned under any circumstance. 
 
The first dose of ABT-888 should ideally be given 60-120 minutes prior to timing of radiation 
treatment. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Equipment and Methods of Delivery and Verification 
 B eam Energy 
For 3D-CRT, photon energy of > 4 MV shall be used. For IMRT, photon energy from 4 to 10 
MV shall be used. 
 T reatment Planning 
CT (volumetric) based planning is required to optimize dose to the PTV while protecting normal 
tissues. Organs at risk within the irradiated volume should be contoured including those required. 
A DVH is necessary to determine target coverage and evaluate dose to normal tissues. CT 
section thickness should be < 5 mm although 2-3 mm is preferred. 
 In- room verification of spatial positioning 
Portal imaging is the most common system used to verify patient position, in particular when the 
target volume is believed to possess a fixed spatial relationship with visualized bony anatomy. 
Or
thogonal paired (AP and lateral) portal images (MV or kV) are required for IMRT and 3D-
CRT to verify that the isocenter is in correct alignment relative to the patient position. 
 
Volumetric imaging is allowed in this study. This includes in room kV or MV cone beam or 
conventional CT imaging. Please submit representative axial images showing the isocenter and 
the correct alignment in relationship to the patients’ position. For CT tomography where

[IP_ADDRESS]  Target Volumes 
 Ge neral Comments 
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 50, 62 and 78 
(www.icru.org) define prescription methods and nomenclature that will be utilized in this study. 
MRI obtained immediately prior to RT will be utilized for treatment planning. MR pre- and post-
g
adolinium T1 and T2 sequences shall be reviewed. Usually the T2 weighted images are used to 
d
etermine target volumes but a combination of T2 and FLAIR can be used. The GTV, CTV, 
PTV and normal tissues must be outlined on all axial imaging slices on which the structures 
exist. 
 De finition of GTV, CTV and PTV 
Gross tumor volume (GTV) is based on the most recent MRI. The GTV is defined as the 
abno
rmal signal on MRI (usually T2 weighted, but a combination of T2 or FLAIR abnormality 
on the appropriate MR sequence). Investigators should register the immediate pre-irradiation MR 
imaging sequences that demonstrated tumor and contour the GTV. 
 
The clinical target volume (CTV) includes the GTV with an added margin that is meant to treat 
subclinical microscopic disease and is anatomically confined (i.e. the CTV is limited to the 
confines of the bony calvarium, falx and tentorium where applicable or extends up to but not 
beyond neuroanatomic structures through which tumor extension or invasion is certain not to 
have occurred). The CTV may be manually moved inward to the inner table of the bony 
calvarium. For diffuse pontine gliomas, spread usually occurs to the confines of the brainstem 
circumferentially, rostral to the midbrain and distal to the medulla. The CTV margin will be 1.[ADDRESS_483988] of the CTV growth superiorly and inferiorly as the CTV will not be 
beyond the brainstem circumferentially. The CTV margin chosen for this study requires 
treatment planning MR and/or diagnostic MR imaging data with image section thickness ≤ 5mm. 
 
The planning target volume (PTV) includes a margin which is added to the CTV in 3-dimensions 
to create the PTV. It is geometric and not anatomically defined. The PTV has 2 components, the 
internal margin (IM) and the set-up margin (SM). The IM is meant to compensate for all 
movements and variations in size and shape of the tissues contained within the CTV. The SM is 
meant to account for set-up, mechanical and dosimetric uncertainties related to daily patient 
positioning, treatment equipment and software. For this study, the PTV margin should be 3 or 5 
mm. The use of PTV margin of 3 mm requires written documentation that image guided 
radiation therapy (IGRT) methods are used on a daily basis or alternatively a head fixation 
system or verification system was used with weekly imaging. For this study, IGRT is defined as 
2- or 3-dimensional digital imaging positioning. For all other cases, a PTV margin of 5 mm shall 
be used. Given that the CTV is generally confined to the intracranial space, the PTV may extend 
into or beyond bone but is unlikely to extend beyond the surface of the patient. The PTV margin 
chosen by [CONTACT_386255]/or diagnostic MR 
imaging data with imaging section thickness ≤ the chosen PTV margin. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target Dose 
 Dose Definition 
NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, 2014 
35 P
hoton dose is specified in centigray (cGy)- to-muscle. 
 Prescribed Dose and fractionation 
Planning Target Volume: The total dose to the PTV will be 5400 cGy administered in 30 
fractions of 180 cGy.  
 Dose  Uniformity 
At least 95% of the protocol-specified dose should encompass 100% of the PTV. No more than 
10% of the PTV should receive greater than 110% of the protocol dose as evaluated by [CONTACT_25400]. 
The 100% isodose line should be equal to the protocol specified dose. Wedges, compensators 
and other methods of generating more uniform dose distributions are encouraged. 
 T issue heterogeneity 
Calculations must take into account tissue heterogeneity and should be performed with CT-based 
treatment planning to generate dose distributions and treatment calculations from CT densities. 
F
or questions about heterogeneity corrections or approved algorithms, please contact [CONTACT_174636] 
(www.qarc.org ). 
 T reatment Interruptions, Delays and Dose Modifications 
The patient should be treated with one fraction per day, [ADDRESS_483989] been initiated, treatment will not be interrupted except for life threatening infection 
o
r severe hematological toxicity during the course of treatment. The reason for any interruptions 
greater than 3 treatment days should be recorded in the patient treatment chart and submitted 
with the QA documentation. There should be no modifications in dose fractionation due to age or 
field size. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Technique 
 Beam configuration 
Every attempt should be made to minimize dose to organs at risk without compromising 
coverage of the target volume. 3DCRT (coplanar or non-coplanar) or IMRT are required to 
minimize dose to normal tissues. 
 F ield Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_386201]. 
 S imulation 
Patient positioning and immobilization device- Reproducible set-up is critical and the use of an 
im
mobilization device is to be used. The imaging studies should provide a clear assessment of 
the target volume with the patient in the treatment position. Anesthesia or sedation may be 
required in some patients to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments. 
 S pecia l Considerations 
Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young patients, to 
prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Organs at Risk 
The organs at risk (OAR) guidelines in this section are recommendations. If the recommended 
doses to the OAR are exceeded because of target volume coverage requirements or other 
conditions, an explanation should be included in the quality assurance documentation. In some 
cases, IMRT may be the preferred treatment method to meet these requirements and the required 
tar
get volume coverage guidelines.

Events v4.0 (CTCAE) http://ctep.cancer.gov/reprting/ctc.html.  Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) 
will be defined as any of the following events that are at least (possibly, probably, or definitely) 
attributable to ABT-888 observed during the dose finding phase (the first 10 weeks of therapy).  
 
5.2.1 Dose-Limiting Toxicities during Phase I 
During the Phase I portion of the study, the observation period for DLTs includes the entire 
duration of radiation therapy (approximately 6 to 7 weeks, allowing for delays in XRT for 
holidays, mask adjustments, etc.) and the rest period between the end of radiation therapy and the 
start of maintenance treatment (week 1 through week 10). All dose modifications are to follow 
th

studied under a CTEP IND (see section 7).   
 
6. DOS ING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
The study chair must be notified of any proposed dose modifications.  After consultation with the 
Study Chair, the site should follow the dose modification guidelines in this section.  
 
6.1 Dose  Modification for DLT during ABT-888 and Radiation 
6.1.1 Non-Hematologic 
For ABT-888-related non-hematologic DLTs during radiation therapy, ABT-888 will be 
withh
eld until the toxicity resolves to meet on study parameters (section 3 .1.6 ), and the patient 
will restart ABT-888 at one dose level lower (see Table 10), if not already at Dose Level 0.  
P
atients who experience a non-hematologic DLT on Dose Level 0 will complete radiation 
without ABT-888.  
 
6.1.2 Hematologic 
For ABT-888-related hematologic DLTs, ABT-888 will be withheld until criteria described 
below are met, and ABT-888 will be restarted at one dose level lower, if not already at Dose 
Level 0. If the same DLT is experienced at the lower dose level, then ABT-888 should be 
discontinued.  If a different DLT is encountered, then the patient may restart ABT-888 at the 
next lower dose level, if not already at Dose Level 0. 
 
In
 the event of hematological DLT, CBC should be checked twice weekly until recovery of ANC 
≥ 1,000/ mm3 and platelet ≥ 100,000/ mm3. A patient who experiences any DLT despi[INVESTIGATOR_386207] 0 will complete radiation therapy without ABT-888. Irradiation should 
b
e continued despi[INVESTIGATOR_386208]-888-related DLT, unless there is a clinical contraindication.   
 
a. ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia: Platelet transfusion is permissible and strongly encouraged 
for patients with dose-limiting thrombocytopenia to minimize the risk of intra-tumoral 
hemorrhage. ABT-888 should not be restarted until platelet count has recovered to 
≥100,000/mm3 (transfusion independent). Radiation therapy should not be interrupted 
unless clinically indicated. 
 
b. Patients with grade 4 neutropenia may receive filgrastim (G-CSF) support only for 
documented infection and/or sepsis, and they should re-start ABT-888 at the next lower 
dose level without GCSF support.  ABT-888 should not be restarted until the ANC is 
≥1,000/ mm3 for at least 48 hours without G-CSF support. Radiation therapy should not 
be interrupted unless clinically indicated. 
 
Patients who experience ABT-888-related DLTs during irradiation will still receive ABT-888 
during maintenance therapy, provided that they meet the criteria to start subsequent course of

 An y grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity with the exception of: 
o Gr ade 3 nausea and vomiting of < 5 days 
o Gr ade 3 elevation of transaminases that returns to levels meeting 
eligibility criteria within 7 days of study drug interruption and does not 
recur upon restarting drug.  
o Gr ade 3 fever or infection of fewer than 5 days in duration 
o Gr ade 3  hypophosphatemia,   hypokalemia,   hypocalcemia  or

 An y grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity that persists for > 7 days and is 
considered medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by [CONTACT_386260]-hematologic toxicities during maintenance therapy, ABT-888 and 
TMZ will be withheld until the toxicity resolves to meet on study parameters (section 3.1.6 ), and 
the patient will restart ABT-888 and TMZ at the next lower dose level (see Table 12). Protocol 
th

6.2.2  Hematological Toxicity 
 ≥  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
 Gr ade 4 neutropenia  
 A delay of > 14 days in starting subsequent cycles of maintenance due to ANC 
< 1,000/mm3 and/or platelet < 100,000/mm3 (for example, a patient never 
experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia, but his/her platelet count lingered 
between 50,000 to 100,000/ mm3 beyond 42 days after the start of the previous 
course of maintenance therapy) 
 
For the hematologic toxicities outlined above that occur during maintenance therapy, ABT-888 
and TMZ will be withheld until criteria described below are met, and ABT-888 and TMZ will be 
restarted at the next lower dose level (see Table 12). Protocol therapy will be discontinued if a 
h
ematologic dose-modifying toxicity occurs at dose level 0. 
 
a. ≥Grade 3 thrombocytopenia: Platelet transfusion is permissible and strongly encourage d 
for patients with dose-limiting thrombocytopenia to minimize risk of intra-tumoral 
hemorrhage. ABT-888 and TMZ should not be restarted until platelet count has 
recovered to ≥ 100,000/mm3 (transfusion independent).  
 
b. P
atients with grade 4 neutropenia may receive filgrastim (G-CSF) support only for 
documented infection and/or sepsis. ABT-888 and TMZ should not be restarted until the

C is ≥ 1,000/mm3 and for at least 48 hours without G-CSF support. Patients should 
start the subsequent cycle at the next lower dose level, without G-CSF support. 
 
Complete blood counts should be repeated twice weekly for any hematological toxicity described 
above until counts recover to meet criteria for starting subsequent course of maintenance therapy.  
 
7. AD VERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting (via CTEP-AERS ) in  addition  to 
routine reporting.   
 B aseline Abnormalities 
Any baseline (pretreatment) abnormalities observed during the initial physical 
examination should be recorded in the PedBraTum database. 
 
 R outine AE Recording 
Only record adverse events grades [ADDRESS_484002] all adverse events grades 3 through 4 and deaths (while on treatment 
or within 30 days of treatment), regardless of attribution on the electronic case report 
forms (PedBraTum RDC database).   
 
7.[ADDRESS_484003] (CAEPR) 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764].  In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset of AEs, 
the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column 
and is identified with bold and italicized text.  Th e SPEER is a list of events that are protocol-
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP-AERS (except as noted below).  
R
efer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements’ 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm for 
further clarification.  
 
NOTE:  The highest grade currently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER.  Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditiously via CTEP-AERS.  If this 
CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE 
listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.

7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
tre
atment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
 L eukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 45)  
 M yelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 Treatment-related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.

A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONL Y routine reporting 
via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
8. P HARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational or commercial 
agent administered in this study can be found in sectio n 7.1. 
 
8.1 ABT-888 (NSC # 737664) 
 
Chemical Name:  1H-Benzimidazole-7-carboxamide, 2-[(2 R)-2-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl]-  
Other Names: Veliparib, A-861695.0 
C
lassification: Poly (ADP-ribosome) polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor 
CAS Registry Number: 912444-00-9 
Mo
lecular Formula: C 13H16N4O  M.W.:  244.29 
 
Mode of Action: ABT-888 is a potent oral PARP1/2 inhibitor whose pharmacological properties 
in
clude high solubility (crosses the blood brain barrier), linear PK, and low potential drug-drug 
interactions.  In vivo and in vitro, ABT-888 inhibits the formation of poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) 
polymer and prevents the repair of DNA that is damaged by [CONTACT_321875]. Furthermore, 
ABT
-888 can increase antitumor efficacy of temozolomide, cisplatin, carboplatin, 
c
yclophosphamide, irinotecan, or radiation therapy. 
 
R
oute of Administration: The oral solution can be administered with water or juice if needed. 
ABT-888 will be administered twice daily (~12 hours apart), Monday through Friday, during 
radiation therapy. The morning dose of ABT-[ADDRESS_484013] remain NPO in the 
morning, ABT-888 may be given each night prior to bedtime, and the morning dose should be 
given shortly after the child recovers from sedation, adhering as closely to an every- 12-hour 
schedule as possible. However, if permitted by [CONTACT_386261]/anesthesia guidelines, ABT-
888 may be given each morning prior to sedation, ideally 60-120 minutes prior to irradiation. See 
additional administration instructions in section 5.1. See Appendix  D for calculated dose of 
ABT
-888 capsules for patients taking capsules only. 
 
During the maintenance therapy (starting on week 11 of protocol therapy), ABT-888 will be 
given twice daily (~12 hours apart), on days 1-[ADDRESS_484014] to meals. If emesis occurs within 10 
minutes of administration, the dose should be repeated. 
 
Potential Drug Interactions: Clinical studies evaluating the metabolism of ABT-[ADDRESS_484015] not 
been conducted.  However, results from the in vitro analysis reveal that this agent is metabolized 
by [CONTACT_321876] – CYP1A1, 2D6, 2C19 and 3A4.  ABT-888 is neither a potent inhibitor

NCI supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy 
requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB 
does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is 
obtain
ed.)  The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP supplied 
investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be 
registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial 
Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP 
supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_25559].

9.1.4 Urine Biomarkers 
Participation in the urine biomarker study is strongly encouraged but optional.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sampling Strategy  
Urine will be collected at time of enrollment (pre-treatment), post ABT-888 plus radiation then 
at the time of each scheduled MRI.   Urine will be collected throughout the time that each patient 
is receiving protocol treatment until disease progression.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Collection  
10-30 milliliters of urine will be collected in a specimen cup and immediately placed in ice.  The 
specimen can remain on ice in the original container for 1-2 hours until transfer to a freezer for 
storage (-20 Celsius).  Samples should be maintained at -20 C until shipped. Urine can be 
collected as a mid-stream catch while voiding or can be collected from a urimeter if the child is 
catheterized.  It is necessary to keep the urine refrigerated to prevent the degradation of peptides.  
The MMPs are particularly sensitive to warmer temperatures and other enzymes within the urine 
will break down biomarkers if not inactivated by [CONTACT_386267]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Labeling 
Each urine specimen must be labeled with the patient’s accession number, the study number 
(PBTC-033) and the date collected.  Data should be recorded on the Urine Specimen Transmittal 
F
orm located on the PBTC-033 Protocol Specific Instructions/Forms section of the PBTC

.1.4.5  Description of Urine Biomarker Assay 
All samples will be analyzed for the presence or absence of each of the 8 biomarkers.  
Zymography will be performed to analyze for MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-9/NGAL in a blinded 
fa
shion by [CONTACT_386269] a positive or negative result, following a 
protocol well-established in our laboratory which has been validated in the literature.39   
 
Zymography 
Samples will be frozen immediately after collection and stored frozen (-20C) until assay. 
Aliquots of each sample will be centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4C and the supernatants 
collected. Urine samples (30 uL) will be mixed with buffer consisting of 4% SDS, 0.15 mol/L 
Tris (pH 6.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% (w/v) brom-phenol blue. Samples will be applied, 
without boiling, into wells of a 4% acrylamide Laemmli stacking gel/10% SDS-acrylamide 
separating gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin (Life Technologies, Inc.) on a mini gel apparatus. 
Gels will be run at 15 mA/gel during stacking and at 20 mA/gel during the resolving phase at 
room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gels will be soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 with 
gentle shaking for 30 min at ambient temperature with one change of detergent solution. The gels 
will then be rinsed and incubated overnight at 37ºC in substrate buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCI 
buffer (pH 8), 5 mmol/L CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3,]. After incubation, gels will be stained for 15 
to 30 min in 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250 in acetic acid, isopropyl alcohol, and water (1:3:6); 
destained in acetic acid, ethanol, and water (1:3:6), and photographed.  The presence or absence 
of each species (MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-9/NGAL) will be recorded and relative intensities (if 
present) noted. 
 
ELISA 
ELISA will be used to establish quantitative levels of each of the 8 biomarkers.  Kits will be 
obtained from the manufacturers (R&D systems and Bioplex/Bio-Rad).  Specimens, standards 
and reagents will be prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions.  Protein concentration 
will be determined via the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard.  
Results will be recorded as ng/ml or pg/L. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_484037] MRI will be obtained within 2 weeks prior to registration, at the end of radiation 
therapy (week 10), within [ADDRESS_484038] MRI through week 26 (6 months from initiation of treatment).  
 
F

Volumetric analyses will be done at the Neuroimaging Center (NIC, Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724]) 
via the Vitrea (Vitrea™) workstation, from the axial FLAIR and T1-weighted post-contrast brain 
images.

permeability MRI to assess immediate biological activity followed by T2*-weighted dynamic 
susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI technique.  DSC perfusion MRI dynamics will 
allow assessment of the hemodynamic parameter relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). DCE 
permeability MRI metrics will include the volume transfer constant between plasma and 
extravascular extracellular space (Ktrans), fractional blood-plasma volume (V p), and the volume of 
the extravascular extracellular space per unit volume tissue (V e).  Both DCE and DSC MRI-
derived data will be complementary to conventional contrast-enhanced MR imaging.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  DCE permeability MRI 
Please note that there will be a total of 5 sequences: 4 for T1 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386221]).  Also, it is important that the same patient MUST be scanned on the same exact 
scanner (not just the brand/tesla, but actual scanner) if more than one exam is to be done.   
A 3D (not 2D) fast gradient echo type of sequences (fast SPGR, FLASH, THRIVE) must be 
used.  This will be performed as 3D slab in the axial plane.  Normalization or intensity correction 
or flow correction filters such as CLEAR, SCIC or PURE must not be used for any of the series.  
The slice locations and positioning for the T [ADDRESS_484041]  be identical 
(s
ame matrix, slices, FOV, TR, TE, except NEX and FA). Hence copying of the slices is needed. 
The TR and TE for all 4 series (4 T 1 maps plus a dynamic series) should be identical. For GE 
systems, reduce Turbo Factor to 1 or 0 if TR and TE do not match across series. T 1 Maps should 
be acquired with 2 signal averages and the Dynamic Series with 1.  Temporal Resolution of “T1 
DCE” series (scan time per phase/measurement) should be less than or equal to 6 Seconds, with 
NO gaps between phases.  ASSET/IPAT/Parallel Imaging Parallel imaging is set to be OFF, 
however, if it is not possible to achieve a temporal resolution of less than [ADDRESS_484042] 5 minutes in total scan time ( excluding  T1 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_386222]). 
 
The table below describes the image acquisition parameters for the T 1 map sequences as well as 
the dynamic scan, in the order of acquisition (first T1 maps then T1 DCE) . Make sure this 
happens before  DSC perfusion MRI.

, FOV = 240 mm, frequency direction R-L, slice thickness = 5.0 mm with 2 mm gap, flip 
angle = 60 degrees, NEX = 1.  Repeat 50-60 times.  Total acquisition time ~ 2 minutes.  Begin 
bolus injection (2 ml/sec) of 0.05mmol/kg BW GdDTPA at 20secs after scanning starts followed 
b
y a 10 cc saline flush at the same rate.  Regional rates of transverse relaxation enhancement 
(Δ
R2*) during contrast agent passage will be calculated from: ΔR2*(t) = (-1/TE) In [S(t)/S(0)] 
from which estimates of rCBV will be derived.   
 
Perfusion MR images will be transferred to the GE Advantage Workstation (4.3.05); Functool 
(4.4.05) (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) to calculate rCBV maps on a voxel-wise basis.  User 
defined regions of interest (ROIs) measuring 3-5 mm will be placed within areas that 
demonstrate maximal CBV based on color-overlay maps.  Effort will be made to exclude large 
vessels and necrotic-appearing regions from the ROIs.  An ROI will also be placed in the frontal  
normal appearing white matter (NAWM) to provide relative CBV (rCBV) values to normalize 
perfusion data and enable comparison between patient and between serial studies.18  
 
Permeability MR Images will be transferred to the iCAD Workstation (iCAD, Inc., Nashua, NH).  
This utilizes a [ADDRESS_484046] of 35 direction DTI sequences: slice thickness 2.2 mm, TR= 
8800 ms, TE= 88ms, FOV 220 mm, b value= 1000 s/mm2, [ADDRESS_484047] MRI, perfusion/ permeability and DTI images will be electronically transferred to the 
PBTC Neuroimaging Center (NIC).  All patient specific data are stripped from the images and 
replaced with PBTC case-ids prior to sending images to the NIC. All image data transfer is 
accomplished using PGP (pretty-good-privacy) 128-bit encryption which meets industry 
standard for secure communication. 
9.2.5 Central Review 
Central review of imaging studies will be conducted through the PBTC Neuroimaging Center 
(NIC).  The director and one neuroradiologist at NIC will review the imaging studies for 
response and pseudo-progression at study completion.  Post processing of perfusion/permeability 
studies will be done at USC.

compared with the baseline measurements, on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids, 
accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination, and maintained for at least 8 
weeks 
  
11
.1.3 Stable Disease (SD) 
Neurologic exam is at least stable and maintenance corticosteroid dose not increased, and 
MR/CT imaging meets neither the criteria for PR nor the criteria for Progressive Disease.  If this 
c
ategory is to be reported as of possible clinical benefit, Stable Disease status must be 
maintained for 16 weeks.  
 
11.1.4  Progressive Disease (PD) 
Progressive Disease (PD): Progressive neurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status 
not explained by [CONTACT_167748] (e.g., anticonvulsant or corticosteroid 
toxicity, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, hyperglycemia, etc.), OR a greater than 25% increase in 
the bi-dimensional measurement, taking as a reference the smallest disease measurement 
recorded since the start of protocol therapy, OR the appearance of a new lesion, OR increasing 
doses of corticosteroids required to maintain stable neurological status or imaging. 
 
* Consideration for possible pseudo-progression 
For patients showing possible radiographic evidence of tumor progression on MRI during the 
first 6 months after initiation of  ABT-888 and radiation (on required MRI studies performed at 
week 10, week 18, or 26), the treating physician will have the option of allowing the patient to 
remain on study, continuing protocol therapy, and repeating disease reassessment in 4-6 weeks. 
Provided that the patient does not show clinical deterioration consistent with tumor progression, 
has been on a stable or declining dose of steroids, and the subsequent MRI demonstrates tumor 
regression or stable disease, then the patient will remain on study and continue protocol therapy, 
and the frequency of subsequent MRI will revert to pre-specified intervals. If the repeat MRI 
after 4-6 weeks shows disease progression, rather than pseudo-progression, then the time of 
progression will be the date of the initial MRI, not the follow up scan. The addition of steroids is 
allowed, at the time of suspected pseudo-progression, as long as the patient can be maintained on 
a decreasing dose.

13.1 Phase I Study Design/Endpoints 
13.1.[ADDRESS_484064] to the efficacy (Phase II) component of this study.  The traditional 3+[ADDRESS_484065] 10 weeks (6-[ADDRESS_484066] period), which is the DLT observation period. If none of these three patients 
experience a DLT, escalation to dose level [ADDRESS_484067] to the Phase II component of this study. If dose level 0 is determined to be too 
toxic (i.e. more than 1 DLT), then the trial will be closed to accrual and the approach will be re-
evaluated. 
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_484068] 1 dose of the study regimen and are removed from treatment for 
toxicity during the dose-finding period are evaluable for estimating the MTD/recommended 
Phase II dose as long as no additional anti-cancer therapy or supportive care that would confound 
the interpretation of any observed toxicity or side effect is given. 
 
Patients who receive at least 85% of prescribed therapy during the dose-finding period but who 
progress prior to completing the rest/evaluation period may be considered evaluable for 
estimating the MTD, as long as no additional anti-cancer therapy or supportive care that would 
confound the interpretation of any observed toxicity or side effect is given. Patients should have 
completed all of the clinical and laboratory monitoring requirements specified by [CONTACT_386271]/recommended 
Phase II dose. 
 
Patients who receive less than 85% of the protocol specified therapy and who go off treatment 
for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. progressive disease, withdrawal of consent etc.) will be 
c
onsidered inevaluable for estimating the MTD/recommended Phase II and will be replaced.  
 
Patients who complete all therapy during the dose-finding period but who fail to comply with all 
the specified clinical and laboratory monitoring requirements for the dose finding period may be 
considered inevaluable by [CONTACT_386272]/recommended Phase II and 
may be replaced. 
 
13.1.3  Feasibility Assessment of Intra-patient Dose Escalation (for patients treated in both 
Phase I and Phase II of the study): 
During maintenance therapy, in an effort to maximize the TMZ dose for each patient, intra-
p
atient dose escalation will be studied. All patients will initiate maintenance treatment with  
NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, 2014 
69 25
 mg/m2 ABT-888 and 135 mg/m2 of TMZ with a possibility to escalate to 175 mg/m2 and to 
200
 mg/m2 of TMZ, if no unacceptable toxicities occur following 1 course of treatment at each 
of these dose levels ( Table 12 ). More specifically, intra-patient dose escalation will only be 
considered if a patient meets the escalation criterion following the first course of TMZ as part of 
main
tenance therapy. Intra-patient dose escalation will be assessed only in patients who are 
eligible to escalate and escalation to a given dose will be halted based on similar rules employed 
in traditional 3+[ADDRESS_484069] 
course of treatment at a given dose level for TMZ, we will periodically monitor for the 
occurrence of dose modifying toxicities in later courses and may revise this approach in the 
event that excessive toxicities are observed.  
 
13.2 P hase II Study Design/Endpoints: 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this phase II trial is overall survival defined as the time from 
initiation of therapy to the date of death from any cause or to the date patient was known to be 
alive for surviving patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) is a secondary endpoint and is 
d
efined as the time from initiation of treatment to the earliest date of failure (disease progression, 
death from any cause, or second malignancy) for patients who fail and to the last assessment date 
for patients who have not failed. Patients who start other anti-cancer therapy prior to disease 
progression will be censored in the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS as of the date the alternative 
therapy began. Patients who have not failed (died) at the time of analyses will be censored at 
their last date of contact [CONTACT_386273]-Meier estimate of the PFS (overall survival) distribution.  
 
The primary objective of this part of the study will be assessed based on the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
hypothesis. That is, any eligible patient who receives any ABT-[ADDRESS_484070] 1 dose of ABT-888 are evaluable for assessing overall survival, 
the primary endpoint of the Phase II part of this study, as well as for evaluating progression free 
survival and objective response rates. 
 
13.2.2  Design for the Phase II Component: 
As mentioned previously OS is the primary endpoint for the assessment of efficacy of the 
proposed regimen in patients with newly diagnosed DIPG. The following design utilizes the 
in
formation available from the PBTC contemporary historical control cohort of eligible patients 
with newly diagnosed non-metastatic DIPG who were treated on the first five PBTC clinical 
trials (-006 [phase I, imatinib]; -007 [phase I & phase II, gefitinab]; and -014 [phase I & phase 
II, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734]]). All patients treated on these trials were between [ADDRESS_484071] two years to 
estimate the distribution of OS.

T
he TTEDesigner software available from MD Anderson software download page 
(https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/ ) was used for the necessary calculations. 
 
The prior parameters for the experimental treatment mean were estimated based on the PBTC 
h
istorical cohort described above. As mentioned previously the Inverse Gamma distribution, 
which is the conjugate prior for to the Exponential distribution, will be used to provide the prior 
information on the exponential mean. Besides conjugacy, another attractive aspect of the Inverse 
Gamma distribution is that its parameters have intuitive interpretations. More specifically in this 
setting the distribution is parameterized by α s=number of failures in the historical cohort and 
βs=total time at risk in the historical cohort. The values of these parameters were calculated from 
the PBTC historical control cohort described above. Following the recommended approach by 
[CONTACT_203320], Wooten and Tannir,[ADDRESS_484074] size is parameterized in terms of the median time to death. The median time to 
d
eath estimate based on the current PBTC historical cohort is 10.85 months. Following the Brain 
Malignancy Steering Committee’s recommendation we have set the “effect size” at 5.5 months, 
re
flecting a 50% improvement in the primary outcome parameter, which would certainly be a 
notable “success”, if an experimental treatment were to achieve it. 
 
Our historical experience suggests an average accrual rate of 2 patients per month and we 
propose to monitor the outcome information twice a year (approximately every 6 months) for 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_386224]. This monitoring schedule coincides

Updated Date: February 4, [ADDRESS_484075] to early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the design we present 
below will only stop for futility. This design has a 6.3% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_386225] 16.5 months for the experimental treatment and 63.85% chance of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_386226] [ADDRESS_484076] for a difference. In addition, we will perform a Bayesian 
analysis of the outcome information providing a 95% credibility interval for the median survival 
estimate. While it is unlikely, since the prior information is based on the PBTC historical data, if 
the Bayesian and the frequentist analyses lead to conflicting conclusions, additional analyses will 
be undertaken to explain the discrepancy but ultimately the frequentist inference will be favored 
over the Bayesian one.  
 
Under the assumption that the survival distributions are exponentially distributed with the above 
specified medians and that the analysis time is as detailed above, using the unconditional power 
e
stimate proposed by [CONTACT_386274]49 and as implemented in SiZ software package (ver 1.0)  
the estimated power of this log-rank test based on a 1-sided test and α=0.1 is 87.72%. Since the 
asymptotic relative efficiency of the log-rank test is 100% in cases where there is no censoring or 
when there is random but equal censoring in two groups within the family of Weibull 
distributions50 we expect that the power estimate above is relatively accurate. As we have 
ind
icated previously, the Weibull distribution fits well to our historical control data and given the 
fact that the final analysis will be done [ADDRESS_484077] response prior to failure 
(disease progression, death from any cause or second malignancy). Exact confidence interval

stimates will be provided for the sustained objective response (PR + CR) rate. 
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_386275]. The 
DSMB meets semi-annually but also meets via teleconferencing if necessary to review and 
discuss critical events; such as interim analyses. Accrual, demographic and safety data will b e 
reported to the PBTC membership at the PBTC semi-annual meetings. 
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_484078], such as apparent volume of the central 
compartment (Vc/F), elimination rate constant (Ke), half-life (t1/2), apparent oral clearance 
(CL/F), and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) will be estimated using 
compartmental methods. Dose proportionality in pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
investigated by [CONTACT_386276]-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on dose-normalized 
parameters. 
  
In
 addition to estimating individual pharmacokinetic parameters, we will also estimate the 
population parameters using nonlinear mixed effects modeling methods (NONMEM). This 
method estimates the population parameters and both the inter- and intra-subject variability. 
On
ce the population parameters and corresponding covariance matrix are estimated, individual 
estimates can be obtained using post hoc analysis.  
 
13.3 P rojected Accrual Rate and Study Duration 
Phase I 
The projected accrual rate is 1.5-2.5 patients per month, based on knowledge of the member 
institutions and their commitment to the Consortium. With 2-3 likely dose levels, the total 
sample size and the study duration are expected to be 12-18 and about 1 .5-2.0 years, 
respectively. The estimated duration incorporates the planned accrual suspensions for routine 
toxicity monitoring. 
 
Phase II 
The projected accrual rate is 1.5-2.5 patients per month, based on knowledge of the member 
institutions and their commitment to the Consortium. The total sample size and the study 
duration are expected to be approximately 60 patients and about 2-3.5 years. The table below is

13.4 Anal ysis of Secondary Endpoints 
13.4.1  Statistical Analysis of Imaging Studies: 
We will describe and summarize the observed values of the proposed quantitative imaging 
parameters, namely rCBV, permeability (Ktrans, vp, and v e values) and ADC as well as changes in 
these parameters via descriptive statistics and plots. If serial values are available from adequate 
number of patients to make such models meaningful, we will also entertain the use of mixed 
effects models in modeling changes in these parameters. Depending on the number of 
pseudoprogression calls observed, we may also explore associations between these imaging 
parameters and pseudoprogression vs. true progression via appropriate models or simply via 
summary statistics and descriptive plots within and across patients. The assessment of true vs. 
pseudo progression will be based on the tumor measurements from subsequent scans.  For the 
p
rimary objective regarding pseudoprogression, we will provide 95% confidence interval 
estimates of the proportion of patients determined to have experienced pseudoprogression. 
 
13.4.2  Statistical Analysis of Biologic Correlates  
[IP_ADDRESS]  NHEJ and PARP Activity 
PARP inhibition in PBMCs will be measured as a ratio of pre/post-treatment values and will be 
su
mmarized by [CONTACT_386277]. The values observed in this trial will be 
contrasted to the values reported in adults. 
 
Provided adequate number of events is observed among patients who participate in biology 
studies to make such analyses feasible, we will utilize Cox models to explore associations 
between the molecular parameters from correlative biology aims 1-2, namely PARP and NHEJ 
activity or γ-H2AX levels and PFS and OS. Associations between these parameters and objective 
response may also be explored provided a large enough number of responses are observed. 
Otherwise correlations between PARP and NHEJ activity or γ-H2AX levels with radiographic 
re
sponse and clinical outcome will be summarized descriptively. 
 
13.4.3  Urine Biomarkers 
Comparison of Urine Biomarker Levels in Patients vs. Controls: 
In order to determine whether the levels of these urinary biomarkers are elevated in DIPG 
patients, we will compare median levels for tumor patients to levels in healthy age- and gender -
matched controls using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_386227], 
Mann-Whitney U-test allows us to utilize a conservative approach compared to the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test since matching by [CONTACT_386278]. In addition, the percentage of patients and controls 
above the previously established cut-off values for each urinary biomarker will be compare d 
using the chi-square test.  Based on a preliminary power analysis for this chi-square test a sample 
NCI Protocol #: PBTC-033 
Version Date: February 4, 2014 
Updated Date: February 4, 2014 
75 s
ize of 58 brain tumor patients and 58 controls will provide 80% power with a conservative two-
sided alpha level of 0.01 in capturing a difference of 30% between the groups with respect to 
each urinary biomarker. We will also utilize ROC analysis for each biomarker in exploring 
various cut-points for differentiating between the control subjects and DIPG patients. 
Multivariable logistic regression models coupled with ROC analyses will be used to select a 
combination of these biomarkers in an attempt to improve their collective performance as a 
classifier.  
 
Longitudinal Assessment of Changes in Biomarker Values and Their Association with Outcome: 
Using the data for patients who progress, for each biomarker we will compare the levels at 
baseline with levels at progression as determined by [CONTACT_386279]. This will be done via Wilcoxon signed rank test and exact 
confidence interval estimates of the percent change. We will also tabulate the percentage of 
patients who have biomarker levels above the previously established cut points for each 
biomarker at baseline and at the time of progression. We will investigate whether the percentage 
of patients who are above/below the cutpoints for each of the biomarkers is different between 
baseline and time of progression via the McNemar’s test. Provided adequate number of 
responses is present to make such analyses meaningful, we will also perform similar analyses 
comparing biomarker levels at baseline and at the time of response. 
 
Time- to-event data will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and by [CONTACT_386280]-off values at baseline.[ADDRESS_484079] to 
make such an exercise informative, will also utilize multivariable Cox proportional-hazards 
regression model with each of the 8 urinary biomarkers as time dependent predictors and 
relevant covariates including age and gender to explore associations with PFS and OS.53

-888 Oral Solution Handling Guidelines 
 
NSC# 737664 ABT-888 (Veliparib)  
 
ABT-888 Oral Solution Dosing Administration 
Dosing is based on the BSA at the beginning of radiation and each course of maintenance.  The 
a
ttending physician or designee calculates the required dose in mg based on the patient’s BSA and 
assigned dose.  Once the dose is calculated, the attending physician or designee should convert the 
mg/dose into milliliters; calculate the total milliliters to be dispensed to the family and demonstrate at 
least once to family member(s) the correct volume of ABT-[ADDRESS_484083] 1mg (0.2 ml for the 5 mg/ml concentration).   
 
C
are Provider obtains the following from the clinical site:  
1.  ABT-[ADDRESS_484084] at the clinical site.  
The ABT-888 oral solution can be used for up to 30 days when stored at room temperature (15°C – 
25°C) , protected from light.  
2
.  Oral syringes (5- 20 mL).  One syringe will be used per dose. 
 
Procedure for Dosing ABT-888 Oral Solution 
1. Invert the suspension in the closed bottle before each use.  
2. Open the cap and insert the supplied oral dosing syringe into the opening of the press-in bottle adaptor 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_49840]), maintaining the bottle in an upright position.  
3. Invert the bottle and withdraw the required volume.  Your research doctor will tell you how much 
solution to draw from the bottle for each dose. 
4. Remove the oral dosing syringe and administer the content of the syringe (containing solution from 
Step 3) to patient.  
5. Close the bottle tightly and store upright.  
6.  Place the used syringes in the biohazard bag provided by [CONTACT_16133].  Return the used syringes 
as well as the ABT-888 solution bottle to the clinic at each visit.

In
structions for Administration of Temodar 
(Patients who are unable to swallow capsules) 
 
Temodar is an oral cancer medicine that your child will be taking for treatment of his/her brain tumor. 
Your child is unable to swallow capsules so the following instructions must be followed for safe 
administration of this medicine. 
 T emodar must be kept in a dark container 
 T emodar should be taken the same time every morning, about 60-120 minutes after the morning 
dos
e of ABT-888 
 If  your child requires a nausea medicine, it should be taken prior to the Temodar 
 If  the dose of Temodar is vomited (which is unusual) within 10 minutes of administration, please 
repeat the dose. If vomiting occurred more than 10 minutes after a dose, do not repeat the dose 
 If  the person dispensing this medicine is pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant, she should not 
dispense this medicine.  
 
Temodar is an anti-cancer agent, and so special precautions must be taken when handling this medicine. 
There is potential hazard to anyone who handles this medicine once the protective capsule is opened. 
S
ince your child is unable to swallow the capsule, you will be required to open the capsules and mix the 
contents of the capsule in apple sauce or apple juice. This process must be done according to the 
following guidelines to ensure safe administration of this medicine. 
 Find a place that is as free of air flow as possible and is not an area where food is stored or 
prepared. 
 The work surface should be covered with aluminum foil to reduce exposure to other members of 
the family. 
 T emodar can be mixed in apple sauce or apple juice. 
 P lace the apple sauce or apple juice in a disposable container. 
 P ut on disposable gloves, mask and goggles (eye protection). 
 Op en each capsule and place the powder in a medicine cup. 
 Add  the whole contents of the medicine cup to either apple sauce or apple juice. The medicine 
will not dissolve completely if mixing in apple juice, and so have extra apple juice on hand so 
you can add it to any remaining powder in the bottom of the cup. 
o If you need to prepare additional juice or apple sauce, remove your gloves before 
touching the main container, and then place on new gloves before adding the additional 
juice or apple sauce to the medicine. (You do not want to contaminate the main container 
of apple juice/sauce with any powder that may be on your gloves). 
 An ything that comes into contact [CONTACT_386284], such as the spoon used 
for mixing or eating the apple sauce. 
 Once all of the medicine is taken, throw away the following in the red bag: medicine cup, the 
c
ontainer the medicine was mixed in, the cover for the work surface, mask, gloves, and anything 
else that has been in contact [CONTACT_386285]. 
 On ce a course of medicine is completed, bring the red bag with you to the clinic so it can be 
disposed properly.

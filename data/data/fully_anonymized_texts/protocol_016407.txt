2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease(s)  
 
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] -2 (SARS -CoV -2) is a novel coronavirus  
that causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19). Since initial detection of the virus, more than 
[ADDRESS_1159482] been confirmed worldwide, and COVID -19 is responsible 
for more than 505,500 deaths. The [LOCATION_002] has seen over  2.5 million  cases of COVID -19 
 
 and 126,000 deaths from this disease  (as of June, 30 , 2020, source: Johns Hopkins Univ ersity).  
SARS -CoV -2 is efficiently transmitted from person -to-person and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) to be a pandemic.  
COVID -[ADDRESS_1159483] an incubation period of 1 –[ADDRESS_1159484] cases 3 –
[ADDRESS_1159485] presented with mild flu -like symptoms, but a few patients are in critical 
condition and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_834874] (ARDS), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
multiple organ failure, and death.  The case fatality rate increases with the severity of illness and 
can reach up to  49% in critically ill patients (Wu).   
 
Unfortunately, specific and  effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135297] -[ADDRESS_1159486] that administration of the anti -viral agent , Remdesivir , to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834875] -19 decreases time to recovery from 15 to 11 days and decreases mortality at 14 
days fro m 11.9% to 7.1% (Beigel) . A preliminary, unpublished analysis from a large, 
multicenter, randomized, open -label trial for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834876] a reduced rate of 
mortality compared to those who received standard of care. This benefit was observed in patients 
with severe COVID -[ADDRESS_1159487] in those who required mechanical ventilation at 
enrollment (RECOVERY  Trial ). These [ADDRESS_1159488] of care ( SOC ) for 
treating patients with COVID -19. However, additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_834877] -19 are critically 
need ed.  
 
 
2.1.1 IND Agent(s)  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_834878] -reference letter from [COMPANY_001]  and has received a Safe to 
Proceed determination  (IND #152065) .  
 
The rationale for the proposed starting dose  is based on the standard renal transplantation dose, 
which has a time -honored profile of sa fety in this population. Please see [LOCATION_002] Product 
Insert ( USPI ) for full detail on summaries of nonclinical and clinical studies, nonclinical and 
clinical pharmacokinetics,  and major route of elimination  
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/050715s035,050716s038lbl.pdf ).   
 
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
Severe COVID -19. Initial reports from cases identified between February 12 to March 16 in the 
[LOCATION_002] (U.S.) show rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53763] -19 to be 21 -31%, intensive care 
unit (ICU) admissions to be 5 - 12%, and fatality to be 2% -3% [CDC COVID -19 Response T eam 
2020]. High -risk groups for severe COVID -[ADDRESS_1159489] been identified as the elderly population and 
 
 those with underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, pulmonary 
disease, renal disease, and diabetes mellitus [Xu 2020; Huang 20 20].  
 
Severe COVID -19 results from a dysregulated hyperimmune state . Severe symptoms of 
COVID -19 are associated with a hyperimmune response referred to as a cytokine storm. In one 
study, all 41 patients with COVID -19 admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834879] -1, -1R, -
7, -8, -9, -10, and basic FGF2, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN -γ, IP10, MCP1, M1P1A, MIP1B, PDGF, 
TNF -α, and VEGF. Patients admitted to the ICU had higher leve ls of IL -2, IL -7, IL -10, GCSF, 
IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF -α than patients who did not require ICU admission [Huang 
2020]. Emerging data has shown that early rapid SARS -CoV -2 replication causes massive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_834880] a cytokine storm and vascular leakage, causes 
pyroptosis in macrophages and lymphocytes, and results in exhaustion of T cells and NK cells 
[Yang 2020][Chen2020][Zheng 2020].  
 
COVID -19 similarities to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH ). HLH is an under -
recognized, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal cytokine storm 
and multi -organ failure. In adults, HLH is most commonly triggered by [CONTACT_834903] 3.7% to 4.3% cases of sepsis. Cardinal features include unremi tting fever, cytopenias, 
and hyperferritinemia. Pulmonary involvement (including ARDS) occurs in ~50% of patients. 
Each of these clinical features and a highly overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_834881] -19. This demonstrates that the clinical pre sentation and pathologic mechanisms of 
severe COVID -19 is similar to, or is HLH.  
 
Cyclosporine ( CSA ) suppresses hyperimmune states.  Calcineurin inhibitors such as CSA 
suppress the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which results in decreased IL -[ADDRESS_1159490] of T -cell activation and dampens T 
cell responses and their associated cytokine storms [Holzner 2019]. CSA is approved by [CONTACT_834904] 1) prophylaxis of o rgan rejection in kidney, liver, and heart 
transplants, 2) treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) treatment of adult severe 
recalcitrant plaque psoriasis. It is critical to consider whether dampening of T -cell responses 
using CSA would cur tail the vigor of T -cell hyperactivity in COVID -19 disease and provide an 
opportunity for these patients to recover.  
 
CSA for COVID -19. Proposed is the use of the calcineurin inhibitor, CSA, for the treatment of 
patients with COVID -19. This is based on: 1) observations that COVID -19 disease is associated 
with a hyperimmune response very similar to HLH, for which treatment with CSA is effective 
and recommended [La Rosee 2019], 2) COVID -19 is associated with dysregulated macrophage 
activation similar to macr ophage activation syndrome (MAS) which is also therapeutically 
suppressed by [CONTACT_834905] [Merad M 2020; Liddacoat A 2019 ] , and 3) in vitro studies demonstrating 
that CSA specifically inhibits the replication of coronaviruses including SARS -CoV -2 with a 
high degre e of specificity [Dittmar 2020] . 
 
CSA specifically inhibits coronavirus replication.  Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with large 
genomes that enter  host cells through binding of its transmembrane spi[INVESTIGATOR_834882] -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) recep tors expressed by [CONTACT_834906], which is the 
 
 same mechanism utilized by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV (i.e., SARS) [Walls 2020; Fu 2020]. Cyclophilins 
appear to play a critical role in the replication of many viruses including coronaviruses, HIV, and 
hepatitis C virus [de  Wilde 2018; Tanaka 2013; Baugh 2012]. Although the exact mechanisms 
are not yet well understood, in vitro studies suggest that the coronavirus’ nonstructural protein 
(Nsp) and nucleocapsid protein bind to cyclophilins, and knockdown of cyclophilin express ion 
results in near complete inhibition of coronavirus replication [de Wilde 2018; Baugh 2012]. 
These data show that viral protein binding to cyclophilins is an important step for successful 
coronavirus replication, and inhibition of this interaction by [INVESTIGATOR_45599] A prevents viral replication. An 
important study demonstrated that CSA dominantly inhibited replication of human coronavirus 
229E (HCoV -229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and SARS, and that treatment with 
increasing doses of CSA caused a dose -dependent de crease in SARS -CoV replication in human 
cells in vitro without affecting cell viability [de Wilde 2011]. The same group demonstrated that 
CSA inhibited replication of MERS -CoV without affecting cell viability of mock -infected cells 
[de Wilde 2013]. An inde pendent group demonstrated that increasing concentrations of CSA 
treatment of SARS -CoV -infected human cells resulted in a dose -dependent decrease in viral 
replication, and inhibited the replication of other coronaviruses, including human CoV -NL63, 
CoV -229E , feline CoV serotypes I and II, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), 
avian infection bronchitis virus (IBV), and two isolates of SARS -CoV (Frankfurt and Hongkong) 
[Pfefferle 2011]. Taken together, Tanaka et al (2013) proposed a dual mechani sm in which (1) 
calcineurin inhibition by [CONTACT_834907] -P, thus preventing the 
production of IL -2 and other proinflammatory cytokines, and (2) CSA inhibits viral replication 
of coronaviruses, likely through blockade of calcineuri n, causing the inhibition of cyclophilins 
required for viral replication. Most recently, Dittmar et al., demonstrated that CSA is highly 
specific and effective at inhibiting SARS -CoV -2 replication  in various human cells, via 
inhibition of Cyclophilin  [Ditt mar 2020].  
 
Safety  of CSA  in COVID -19. Since April 2020 mounting evidence from various patient 
populations has strongly suggested  that CSA can be used safely in patients with  COVID -19. 
Simon et al, recently demonstrated that patients with “Immune Mediated Inflammatory 
Diseases” (IMID)  on various immunosuppressive drugs related to CSA have a “ significantly 
reduced incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection”  (Simon 2020) . Di Lernia et al ., reported no 
significant increase in the incidence or severity of COVID -19 disease in patients undergoing 
CSA therapy for Psoriasis, but rather suggested a potentially milder disease in these patients  
(Di Lernia 2020 ). Another study of over 4000 patients  in Madrid, Spain by [CONTACT_834908] -Fredas et 
al., demonstrated “ a universal relationship between the use of Cyclosporine A and better 
outcomes”  in patients with COVID -19 disease  (Heili -Frades S 2020 ). In line with the findings 
from Spain, Cavagna et al. in Italy observed that transplant patients with ongoing Calcineurin 
Inhibitor therapy developed only mild symptoms of COVID -19 disease and concluded that 
“Calcineurin inhibitor -based immunosuppressive regimens appear safe” in COVID -19 disease 
and should not be disco ntinued  (Cavagna  2020 ). These recent clinical outcomes data suggest that 
the use of CSA in patients with COVID -19 is safe and potentially effective.

6.2.1 Drug Interactions:  Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclospor ine 
Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Renal Impairment:  All of the individual drugs cited below are well substantiated to 
interact with cyclosporine. In addition, concomitant non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
drugs, particularly in the setting of dehydration, may potentiate renal dysfunction.  
 
 
During the concomitant use of a drug that may exhibit additive or synergistic renal impairment 
with cyclosporine, close monitoring of renal function  (in particular serum creatinine) will be 

 
 performed. If a significant impairment of renal function occurs, t he dosage of the co -
administered drug should be reduced or an alternative treatment considered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cytochrome P450 System : Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_097] 3A 
isoenzymes, in particular CYP3A4, and is a substrate of the multidrug efflux 
transpo rter P -glycoprotein. Various agents are known to either increase or decrease 
plasma or whole blood concentrations of cyclosporine usually by [CONTACT_834912]3A4 or P -glycoprotein transporter or both. Compounds that 
decrease cyclosporine absor ption such as orlistat should be avoided. Appropriate 
Neoral dosage adjustment to achieve the desired cyclosporine concentrations is 
essential when drugs that significantly alter cyclosporine concentrations are used 
concomitantly.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  HIV protease inhibitors  (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) are 
known to inhibit cytochrome P -450 3A and thus could potentially increase the 
concentrations of cyclosporine, however no formal studies of the interaction are 
available. Care should be exercised w hen these drugs are administered concomitantly.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grapefruit , grapefruit juice , pomegranate, and orange juice  affect metabolism, 
increasing blood concentrations of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drugs/dietary supplements that decrease cyclosporine concentrations  include the 
following agents:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan (250 to 1000 mg every 12 hours based on 
tolerability) and cyclosporine (300 mg every 12 hours for 2 days then dosing to 
achieve a Cmin of 200 to 250 ng/mL) for 7 days in healthy subjects resulted in 
decreases in the cyclosporine mean dose -normalized AUC, Cmax, and trough 
concen tration of approximately 50%, 30%, and 60%, respectively, compared to 
when cyclosporine was given alone (See also Effect of Cyclosporine on the 
Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents). Coadministration of 
cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Boceprevir: Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) 
and cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in 

 
 the mean AUC and Cmax of cyclosporine approximately 2.7 -fold and 2 -fold, 
respec tively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Telaprevir: Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 11 days) 
with cyclosporine (10 mg on day 8) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the 
mean dose -normalized AUC and Cmax of c yclosporine approximately 4.5 -fold 
and 1.3 -fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) 
was given alone.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1159498]. John’s Wort: There have been reports of a serious drug interaction between 
cyclosporine and the herbal dietary supplemen t St. John’s Wort. This interaction 
has been reported to produce a marked reduction in the blood concentrations of 
cyclosporine, resulting in subtherapeutic levels, rejection of transplanted organs, 
and graft loss.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Rifabutin: Rifabutin is known to increas e the metabolism of other drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_35233] P -[ADDRESS_1159499] precaution should be taken when 
these two drugs are administered concomitantly.  
 
 
 
6.2.2 Drug Interactio ns: Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety 
of Other Drugs or Agents . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of multiple drug efflux transporters (e.g., 
P-glycoprotein) and may increase plasma concentrations of comedications that are 
substrates of CYP3A4, P -glycoprotein or organic anion transporter proteins.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cyclosporine may reduce the clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, HMG -
CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and, aliskiren, bosentan, dabigatran, repaglinide, 
NSAIDs, sirolimus, etoposide, and other drugs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Digoxin: Severe digitalis toxicity has been seen within days of starting cyclosporine 
in several patients taking digoxin. If digoxin is used concurrently with cyclosporine, 
serum digoxin concentrations should be moni tored.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Colchicine: There are reports on the potential of cyclosporine to enhance the toxic 
effects of colchicine such as myopathy and neuropathy, especially in patients with 
renal dysfunction. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and colchicine results 
in significant increases in colchicine plasma concentrations. If colchicine is used 

 
 concurrently with cyclosporine, a reduction in the dosage of colchicine is 
recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors (statins): Literature and postmarketing cases of 
myotoxici ty, including muscle pain and weakness, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis, 
have been reported with concomitant administration of cyclosporine with lovastatin, 
simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and, rarely fluvastatin. When concurrently 
administered with c yclosporine, the dosage of these statins should be reduced 
according to label recommendations. Statin therapy needs to be temporarily withheld 
or discontinued in patients with signs and symptoms of myopathy or those with risk 
factors predisposing to severe  renal injury, including renal failure, secondary to 
rhabdomyolysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repaglinide: Cyclosporine may increase the plasma concentrations of repaglinide and 
thereby [CONTACT_834913]. In 12 healthy male subjects who received 
two doses of 100 m g cyclosporine capsule orally 12 hours apart with a single dose of 
0.25 mg repaglinide tablet (one -half of a 0.5mg tablet) orally 13 hours after the 
cyclosporine initial dose, the repaglinide mean Cmax and AUC were increased 1.8 
fold (range: 0.6 to –3.7 fo ld) and 2.4 fold (range 1.2 to 5.3 fold), respectively. Close 
monitoring of blood glucose level is advisable for a patient taking cyclosporine and 
repaglinide concomitantly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ambrisentan: Coadministration of ambrisentan (5 mg daily) and cyclosporine (100 t o 
150 mg twice daily initially, then dosing to achieve Cmin 150 to 200 ng/mL) for 8 
days in healthy subjects resulted in mean increases in ambrisentan AUC and Cmax of 
approximately 2 -fold and 1.5 –fold, respectively, compared to ambrisentan alone. 
When coad ministering ambrisentan with cyclosporine, the ambrisentan dose should 
not be titrated to the recommended maximum daily dose  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anthracycline antibiotics: High doses of cyclosporine (e.g., at starting intravenous 
dose of 16 mg/kg/day) may increase the exposu re to anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., 
doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) in cancer patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Aliskiren:  Cyclosporine alters the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, a substrate of P -
glycoprotein and CYP3A4. In 14 healthy subjects who received concomitant ly single 
doses of cyclosporine (200 mg) and reduced dose aliskiren (75 mg), the mean Cmax 
of aliskiren was increased by [CONTACT_3450] 2.5 -fold (90% CI: 1.96 to 3.17) and the 
mean AUC by [CONTACT_3450] 4.3 fold (90% CI: 3.52 to 5.21), compared to when 
these  subjects received aliskiren alone. The concomitant administration of aliskiren 
with cyclosporine prolonged the median aliskiren elimination half -life (26 hours 
versus 43 to 45 hours) and the Tmax (0.5 hours versus 1.5 to 2.0 hours). The mean 
AUC and Cmax of cyclosporine were comparable to reported literature values. 
Coadministration of cyclosporine and aliskiren in these subjects also resulted in an 
increase in the number and/or intensity of adverse events, mainly headache, hot flush, 
nausea, vomiting, and  somnolence. The coadministration of cyclosporine with 
aliskiren is not recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bosentan: In healthy subjects, coadministration of bosentan and cyclosporine resulted 
in time -dependent mean increases in dose -normalized bosentan trough concentrations 
(i.e., approximately 21 -fold on day 1 and 2  fold on day 8 (steady state)) compared to 
 
 when bosentan was given alone as a single dose on day 1. Coadministration of 
cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dabigatran: The effect of cyclosporine on dabi gatran concentrations had not been 
formally studied. Concomitant administration of dabigatran and cyclosporine may 
result in increased plasma dabigatran concentrations due to the P -gp inhibitory 
activity of cyclosporine. Coadministration of cyclosporine wi th dabigatran should be 
avoided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potassium -Sparing Diuretics: Cyclosporine should not be used with potassium -
sparing diuretics because hyperkalemia can occur. Caution is also required when 
cyclosporine is coadministered with potassium -sparing drugs (e.g.,  angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists), potassium -
containing drugs as well as in patients on a potassium rich diet. Control of potassium 
levels in these situations is advisable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonsteroidal Anti -inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Interactions: Clinical status and 
serum creatinine should be closely monitored when cyclosporine is used with 
NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Pharmacodynamic interactions have been 
reported to occur between cyclosporine and both naproxen a nd sulindac, in that 
concomitant use is associated with additive decreases in renal function, as determined 
by 99mTc -diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and (p -aminohippuric acid) 
PAH clearances. Although concomitant administration of diclofenac does  not affect 
blood concentrations of cyclosporine, it has been associated with approximate 
doubling of diclofenac blood concentrations and occasional reports of reversible 
decreases in renal function. Consequently, the dose of diclofenac should be in the 
lower end of the therapeutic range.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methotrexate Interaction: Preliminary data indicate that when methotrexate and 
cyclosporine were coadministered to rheumatoid arthritis patients (N=20), 
methotrexate concentrations (AUCs) were increased approximately 30% and the 
concentrations (AUCs) of its metabolite, 7 -hydroxy methotrexate, were decreased by 
[CONTACT_3450] 80%. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. 
Cyclosporine concentrations do not appear to have been altered (N=6).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sirolimus: Elev ations in serum creatinine were observed in studies using sirolimus in 
combination with full -dose cyclosporine. This effect is often reversible with 
cyclosporine dose reduction. Simultaneous coadministration of cyclosporine 
significantly increases blood le vels of sirolimus. To minimize increases in sirolimus 
concentrations, it is recommended that sirolimus be given 4 hours after cyclosporine 
administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: Frequent gingival hyperplasia when nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_834889] s been reported. The concomitant use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_834890] a side effect of cyclosporine.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methylprednisolone: Convulsions when high dose methylprednisolone is given 
concurrently with cyclospor ine have been reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Immunosuppressive Drugs and Agents: Psoriasis patients receiving other 
immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy (including PUVA and UVB) should 
 
 not receive concurrent cyclosporine because of the possibility of excessive 
immunosuppression.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1159500] of Cyclosporine on the Efficacy of Live Vaccines : During treatment with 
cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should 
be avoided.  
 
 
6.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due t o adverse event(s), treatment may continue for  7 days  or 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 
• Patient non -compliance  
 
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_3211]  
 
• The drug manufacturer can no longer provide the s tudy agent  
 
The reason(s) for protocol therapy discontinuation , the reason(s) for  study removal , and the 
corresponding dates must be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1159501]. Please refer to the schedule of events ( Table 1), below . Patients 
experiencing  adverse event(s) that require cessation of Neoral will  be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adv erse event.  
 
6.5 Missing Data  
 
To minimize missing data, we will differentiate treatment discontinuation from study 
withdrawal. Study withdrawal will be considered as withdrawal of consent or loss of follow -up. 
 
7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
 
 7.1.1 The dose of Neoral is 2.5mg/kg PO BID , based on the renal transplant dose , and 
Neoral will be administered for 7 days .  
7.1.2 A blood cyclosporine trough level will be obtained  on day 3  to avoid toxicity due 
to high concentrations.  If this level is greater than 250 ng/ml, the Neoral dose  
will be decreased by 25 -50%. If the level is 250 ng/ml or less, no modifications 
will be made.  
7.1.3 Cyclosporine trough levels will be also obtained on day 6 and day 9. If this level 
is greater than 250 ng/ml on day 6 the Neoral dose will be decreased by 25 -50% 
for the rest of the study period (7 days).

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
The primary outcome of this study is the WHO COVID -[ADDRESS_1159508] and 
safety of Neoral  (CSA) for treatment of COVID -19 (+) non -ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39485].  
11.1 Primary Endpoint and Analytic Plan  
The primary endpoint is the clinical outcome based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 
COVID Ordinal Clinical Improvement Scale (Table 2) on day 14. Wilcoxon rank sum test will be 
used to compare the ordinal scale between groups on day 14.  
11.2 Sample Size /Justification  
We expect to see higher grades  of WHO COVID ordinal clinical scale in control group  
compared to the CSA treatment group , and propose to use a 1 to 2 randomization in favor of 
CSA group.  
The total sample size of 75 evaluable participants will  provide 81% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the grade  in control group is less than or equal to the CSA group with a 10% 
one-sided significance level  when the true effect side, as measured by [CONTACT_834916], is 0.65 or greater.  Sample size and/or power for the 
various scenarios were calculated using nQuery 8 (StatSols Version [IP_ADDRESS]).  
The following provides the rationale for the alternate hypothesis effect size. We have 
assumed that all participants w ill be starting in category 4. Based on review of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139245], 
about one third of such patients end -up in the ICU and about half of those patients will die. 
Of the two thirds that do not go to the ICU, most will be discharged in [ADDRESS_1159509] of CSA will be to reduce ICU admissions, 
or to shorten time in the ICU and reduce deaths, so that the fraction in categories 6, 7, and 8 
on Day 14 will be reduced and less ill patients will go home earlier, increasing the fraction of 
1 and 2’s on day [ADDRESS_1159510] is used to control (no CSA) and CSA 
on day 14. The one-tailed null hypothesis is  that the distribution of WHO scores  is the same 
in two groups  or worse in CSA , and the alternative is that t he distribution of WHO scores  in 
the CSA group is shifted lower. The effect size (P1=Pr(Control>CSA) ) is the probability that 
a randomly selected observation from the control group has a score  greater than one from 
CSA group. The null value for P1 is 0.[ADDRESS_1159511] 81% power to 
reject the null hypothesis (based on the 8 observable category probabilities for each group 
shown in table 3) in favor o f the alternative hypothesis that an observation in the control 
group has a higher score on  day 14 than an observation in the CSA group using a Wilcoxon 
(Mann -Whitney) rank -sum test with the type 1 error of 10% one -sided significance level.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Table 3. Scenarios and associated sample size and power.  
 
11.3 Stratification  Factors  
 Randomization will be stratified by 1) age (<60 or ≥60 years), 2) WHO severity (4 vs. 5), and 3) 
presence or absence of comorbidities (at least one of the following - hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, congestive heart failure, or diabetes) with total of up to [ADDRESS_1159512] treatment with Neoral and 
throughout the study period. In this study, patients will receive 7 days of Neoral and inci dence of 
Neoral -associated toxicity events (see 11.5) and all AEs will be assessed daily.  
 
11.4.2  Intent to treat  (ITT)  population  
All randomized patients in the study will be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviatio ns. Each patient will be assigned one of the WHO COVID 
scale categories outlined in Table 2. Primary and secondary objectives will be analyzed.  
 
11.4.3  Modified intent to treat (MITT) population  
Primary and secondary objectives will be analyzed in all randomized  patients who complete [ADDRESS_1159513] been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons,

11.5 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary objectives are mostly concerned with the safety and effects of Neoral  (CSA) in this patient 
population. The secondary endpoints include Neoral -associated toxicity events, serum inflammatory 
markers (CRP, d -dimer, ferritin, ANC, absolute lymphocyte count, WBC, PLT (daily while inpatient and 
including day 14 and 28 for those discharged), Viral load (days 14 and 28), vital status  (days 14 and 28), 
disease improvement  (days 14 and 28), proportion of those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, 
incidence of deep vein thrombosis, proportion of patients discharged on day 28, time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954] , and disease resolution (days 14 and 28) .  
For safety, Neoral -associated toxicity events include nephrotoxicity, resistant hypertension, 
hepatotoxicity, signs of CNS toxicity, or superinfection. AE’s and SAE’s by [CONTACT_3989] v5 will be 
summarized descriptively with frequencies and rates. Rates and 95% CI’s of grade 3 and above AE’s will 
be reported.  
Serum inflammatory markers are viewed as interval scales and after appropriate normalizing 
transformation (if needed), will be analyzed using  general linear mixed models to account for within 
patient dependencies to allow comparisons between groups.  
Viral positivity  between groups at days [ADDRESS_1159514].  
Survival analysis methods will be used to describe  overall survival experience, to estimate survival at 
selected time points, and to compare groups. Cumulative incidence analysis methods will be used if there 
are competing risks.  The same approach will be used with disease improvement (alive and free inva sive 
or non -invasive mechanical ventilation) and disease resolution ( alive and discharged home without 
oxygen ).  
Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare rates of need for invasive mechanical ventilation bench  
mark ed to a particular time, and ever need.   If required, this endpoint will include deaths before intubation 
in the rare cases in which this occurs.  
In exploratory analyses, we will use logistic regression to model ventilator need as a function of treatment 
group and other baseline characteristics. Survival analysis methods will be used to analyze time to 
mechanical ventilation, with censoring at last follow -up for those not needing ventilation.

Survival analysis methods will be used with death prior to discharge considered as a competing risk.  
 
 
 
 
 11.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_834894] y. 
11.6.1  Death possibly, probably to definitely related to CSA : Any death in the Neoral group that is 
assessed as at least possibly related to Neoral will result in a pause to study accrual and a review 
be the DSMB.  
 
11.6.2  Targeted Toxicities : Other expected toxicitie s will be continuously monitored using the 
method of Ivanova et al [Ivanova, A., Qaqish, B.F., and Schell, M.J. (2005). Continuous 
toxicity monitoring in phase II trials in oncology. Biometrics 61: 540 -545.]. The method 
generates a Pocock -type boundary for  repeated testing for toxicity. This is a Pocock -type 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_834895] 5% when 
the rate of grade 3 or greater target toxicity is equal to the acceptable rate  of 20%. The 
method will stop the tr ial early with 40% and 86% probability if the toxicity rate is 30% 
or 40%, respectively.  
 
11.6.[ADDRESS_1159516] (DSMB ): The conduct of this study will be overseen by a 
DSMB of 3 experts who are not participating in this study. The DSMB will be 
responsible for recommendations to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_834896]/or early reporting of the study. The study team (with the exception of the 
study statistician) will not have access to the summary outcome data until released by  [CONTACT_40746].  
  
Table 4.  Toxicity monitoring boundaries . The following table will be used. Targeted toxicities include 
renal dysfunction, hypertension and liver toxicity. The trial will be paused and reported to the DSMB if 
the number of patients with grade 3 or greater AE’s for any of the targeted toxicities i s equal to or exceeds 
bn out of n patients with completed follow -up (Day 7).

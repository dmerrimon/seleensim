 1. INTRODUCTION  
The clinical diagnosis of patients with dementia is challenging and is frequently 
inaccurate compared to pathological diagnosis at autopsy.  Although A lzheimer’s disease 
(AD)  is the most common cause of dementia, other etiologies including Fronto -Temporal 
Dementia (FTD), vascular d ementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies occur in a 
substantial number of cases, (Barker et al. 2002) and there may be substantial overlap in 
the clinical presentation of these disorders. In clinico-pathological studies, 10 - 20% of patie nts diagnosed with AD in life did not have pathology consistent with the disease at 
autopsy (Lim et al. 1999, Mayeux et al. 1998, Ranginwala et al. 2008).  Conversely, a recent study showed that 40% of dementia patients diagnosed with a disorder other than AD by [CONTACT_176084] (i.e., AD or mixed dementia) on 
post mortem examination (Beach et al. 2012).  Accurate antemortem  diagnos
 is can be particularly challenging in FTD given the clinical 
and pathologic heterogeneity of the disease (Rabinovici and Miller 2010). Most cases of FTD can be classified into two major pathologic categories: (1) diseases that involve tau deposition (FTD -Tau) and (2) conditions associated with tau-negative, ubiquitin and 
TDP43 -positive inclusions (FTD-TDP) (Mackenzie et al. 2010). In a minority of cases, 
FTD -Tau can be predicted during life with high accuracy based on the presence of a 
known mutation in the MAPT gene, or based on a highly correlated clinical phenotype (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) - Richardson’s Syndrome) (Josephs et al. 
2006).  However, the relationships between other FTD clinical phenotypes and pathologic subtypes are far less predictable (Forman et al. 2006, Hodges et al. 2004, Josephs et al. 2011, Kertesz et al. 2005). For example, the underlying histopathology in patients with behavioral- variant FTD (bvFTD), the most common clinical FTD 
syndrome, is split equally bet ween FTD -Tau and FTD-TDP (Josephs et al. 2011) and 
there are currently no known reliable methods to distinguish the two during life. Accurately determining the underlying neuropathology during life is a critical need to enhance the development and testing of biologically specific drugs targeting tau or TDP.  
 
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by [CONTACT_176085]) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates  (Xia et al., 2013).  Autoradiography results  using 
tissue sections from human brains showed a strong signal in the grey matter of cortical slices from tau positive brains , but weak or no binding in tau negative, Aβ positive, or tau 
and Aβ negative tissue.   Scatchard analysis  based on this heterogeneous autoradiography 
assay  yielded an estimated K
d of 15nM. A saturation binding experiment using purified 
PHF tau  isolated brains of AD patients  yielded a K d value of 0.[ADDRESS_205533] 
common centr
al nervous system ( CNS ) targets  and no clinically relevant inhibition was 
seen.   AV-1451 was positive in the i n vitro hERG assay; however, in vivo  cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD).  Nonetheless, until

doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).   
Potential genotoxicity of non- radioacti ve AV -1451 was tested in both in vitro and in vivo  
assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV -1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity.   
However, in the in vivo  rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV -[ADDRESS_205535] 
systems. In vivo , AV-1451 is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; however, the in vitro  experiments employ 
static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. While the in vitro  data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide assurance that 
genotoxicity is unlikely to occur at clinically -relevant doses for human diagnostic studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects.  Generally, the radiotracer distributi
on was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  
There were three organs that received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The organ that receive d the largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall 
(0.0955 ± 0.0134 mSv/MBq), followed by [CONTACT_176086].  The Effective 
Dose was 0. 0235 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This results in an estimated Effective Dose of 
8.70 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
and florbetapir F [ADDRESS_205536] been 
completed (e.g., Chien et al., 2013). The purpose of the current study is to extend these 
findings by [CONTACT_176087]-1451 in FTD and in particular, whether the

subject and legally authorized representative will have an opportunity to have all 
questions answered by a physician.  The subject will then sign and date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study.    
 
Subjects with FT D are pote
 ntially a vulnerable population with compromised 
mental capacity.  Investigators should take extra care to evaluate a patient’s 
ability to give consent.  If the subject is cap able of giving informed consent then 
the subject should sign on the consent line of the informed consent form.  When 
applicable the legally authorized representative should sign as well, indicating 
that they have witnessed the subject’s consent, and furthe r agree to participate as 
an informant. 
If the subject is not capable of giving consent, consent may be given by a legally 
authorized r

7.6. Documentation  
 
18F-AV-1451 and florbetapir F 18 PET scans will be saved in an ap propriate 
electronic format as specified in the imaging manual s.  A copy of all scans, 
including the MRI scans will be saved at the site/imaging center and a copy of each will be forwarded to the sponsor or to the designated imaging core lab as described i n the i maging manual s.  All other data required by [CONTACT_176100] .  All data in the eCRF s will be substantiated by “source 
documents,” which consist of the subject’s medical files, laboratory result sheets, ECG tracings, etc.  All source documentation must be available to Avid, and its designees.  Completed source documents and eCRFs may need to be made available and complete for an audit by [CONTACT_1622] , other international regulatory 
authorities , or Avid at any time.  eCRFs and all other records must be filed in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations ( see Section 10.6). 
 
7.7. Adverse Events (A E) 
 
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be 
followed 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less 
stringent.  All AEs must be fully recorded on the a dverse event e CRF s. 
Investigators will be instructed to report to Avid, or its designee , their assessment 
of the potential relatedness of each AE to study drug or protocol procedure via 
electronic data entry.  If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly  report to Avid, or its designee, via electronic 
data entry the circumstances and data leading to any such discontinuation of treatment. In cases where the investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should report “unexpected benefit” with the actual event term to Avid , or its designee (for example, the complete actual term would 
be “unexpected benefit - sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_176073]”). 
 Laboratory test abnormalities considered by [CONTACT_176101] s
hould be reported on the adverse e vent eCRFs.  Signs and symptoms of 
each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates/time, severity/intensity, relationship to study drug , action taken, and outcome).

7.7.2.  Adverse E vent Definitions  
Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
 For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre-existing conditions, trial- emergen
t adverse events and treatment -emergent adverse events.   
 Pre-existing conditions (i.e., undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that 
begin prio
r to the Screening Visit) will be recorded on the medical history 
eCRF pages. During the study, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and occurrence and nature of any AEs.  Signs and symptoms that are believed to be due to the pre- existing condition (s) (started prior to dose of 
study medication) do not have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, unless there is an increasing in frequency and severity.  Additionally, signs or 
symptoms or changes in pre- existing conditions that occur outside the tria l 
defined adverse event reporting period (e.g., between each imaging visit will 
be recorded in medical history). 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in hum
ans, whether or not considered drug related. For the purposes 
of this study, untoward medical occurrences will be considered associated 
with the use of 18F-AV-1451, and thus be reported as adverse events, if they 
occur within [ADDRESS_205566] medical 
occurrences will b e considered associated with the use of Florbetapir F 18 
injection, if they occur within 48 hours after Florbetapir F 18 injection 
administration.  Adverse events associated with the use of 18F-AV-1451 or 
Florbetapir F 18 injection will be recorded as treatment emergent relative to 
the respective drug.  Adverse experiences that occur after administration of 
either drug but outside the 48 hour reporting window will not be reported 
unless the investigator believes they are attributable to the drug.  
Trial -emergent adverse events are undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms 
that begi
n, or worsen in intensity or frequency, after the informed consent, and

Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 
A SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the following events: 
• Death;  
• Initia
l or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (other than that required by 
[CONTACT_990]; “
social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” or any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33566]- medical 
reasons does not constitute a SAE); 
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying ); 
• Pers
istent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenit
al anomaly/birth defect; 
• Consider
ed significant by [CONTACT_81121]. 
                                          
Importa
nt medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatenin g, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122949], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
  
Unexpected Adverse Event 
 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse event that occurs with specificity, severity or frequency that is not consistent with the current IB. 
 
Relationship to Study Drug  
 Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential relatedne
ss of each adverse event to protocol procedure or study drug.  The 
assessment of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF.  
Intensity/Severity of an Adverse Event

 In addition to assessing the relationship of the administration of the study drug  
to adverse events, an assessment is required, in order to determine the 
intensity (severity) of the event.   The following classifications should be used:  Mild:   
A mild adver
se event is an adverse event, usually transient in nature and 
generally not interfering with normal activities.  
 Moderate :   
A moder
ate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently 
discomforting to interfere with normal activities.  
 Severe:   
A severe ad
verse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and 
prevents normal activities.   Note tha t a severe event is not necessarily a 
serious event; nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.  
 
7.7.3. Adverse Ev ent Documentation  
 
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the adverse even t eCRFs .  
Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_176102].  Laboratory 
tests, vital signs and ECG abnormalities considered by [CONTACT_176103] s.  Signs and 
symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop da tes, 
severity/intensity, relationship to study drug , action taken, and outcome).  
 
Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of a 
serious adve
rse event should, in addition, be reported on the Serious Adverse 
Event Reporting Form.

Versi on 05MAY [ADDRESS_205569] . Regardless of the 
investigator’s assessment of relatedness or timing, all SAEs that occur after the subject receives the investigational product should be submitted to Lilly GPS for processing to determine applicability of any expedited reporting requirements..   If a patient experiences a SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving s
tudy drug, the event will NOT be reported unless the investigator 
feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study.  
8. STATIST ICAL ANALYSIS  
 
8.1. General Statistical Considerations  
 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. 
The study data collected under  companion proto col such as  but not limited to  
subjects’ demographic and baseline characteristics, history taking, neurological and 
behavioral evaluations, and MRI will be transferred to Avid for analysis purposes. 
Amyloid scans used for review of enrollment criteria will also be transferred to Avid 
if applicable.  
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [N], mean, 
standard devi
ation [SD], median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum) for continuous 
variables and using frequency count and percentage for discrete variables.  T he 
demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for all subjects in 
the safety population according to clinical group.  Safety data will be summarized for 
all patients.  
Subject listings of all data from the eCRFs as well as any derived variables will be 
presented. 
 
8.1.1. Sample S ize Estimation  
This study will enroll up to 25 subjects.  This sample size was chosen in order to 
allow for qua
litative and descriptive review of 18F-AV-1451 PET binding in subjects 
with clinically defined FTD.   Based on prior studies, 10- 15 cases are typi[INVESTIGATOR_176074]3191748

Versi on 05MAY [ADDRESS_205570] deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum values will be provided for continuous variables and counts and 
percentages will be provided for categorical variables.  
Details of analyses will be provided in statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . 
8.2.2. Safety Analyses 
Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of 
number and perc
entage of patients experiencing an AE. The AEs will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. Adverse events will also be presented by 
[CONTACT_926], relationship to treatment, and seriousness. All patients who experience SAEs, or who discontinue due to AEs, will be summarized.  
9. USE OF DATA AND PUBL ICATION
 Avid adheres to the Pharm aceutical R esearch and  Manufacturers of  America 
(PhRMA) Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical 
Trial Results.  A complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can 
also be found at the PhRMA w ebsite (http://www.phrma.org ).  Avid’s policy is 
briefly s ummarized be low: 
•We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlled clinical
trials, regardless of outcome.

 • As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or decline 
publication in cases where the study design , conduct, or data are insufficient to 
allow meaningful interpretation.  Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss the 
study design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion, and will strive, through appropriate scientific debate, to reach a consensus regarding the potential merits of publication.  
• Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts before 
the
y are submitted for publication. Where differences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_176075], the parties (Avid and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific debate.  Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to [ADDRESS_205571] intellectual property.  
• Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate 
recogni
tion as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.  
This is a multi- center s tudy . The primary analysis will include data from all 
centers.  A multicenter publication, reporting the primary analysis data set, with 
authorship from all contributing centers, should precede any other publications. 
10.    INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good Clinical Practice 
regulations; this may include an inspection by [CONTACT_176104]/or Health Authority representatives (FDA or international regulatory authorities) at any time.  
10.1.  Institutional Review Board (IRB)   
 
The intent of the research program, the trial protocol, the patient 
informati
on/informed consent form and any advertising material used to recruit 
subjects must be submitted to the clinical investigator’s local IRB and its approval must be obtained prior to its use.  A copy of the approval must be forwarded to 
Avid.  When necessary, an extension or renewal of IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Avid. 
 
10.2.  Informed  Consent  
 
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained from each patient.  A copy 
of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient for their records.  A copy of the local IRB’s approved version of the informed consent form must be forwarded to Avid, or its designee, for review prior to being used to obtain patient 
consent.

Versi on 05MAY [ADDRESS_205572] be documented, the sponsor/monitor 
informed, and a course of action agreed upon.  
10.4.  Documents Necess ary for Initiation of the Trial  
Avid must be provided with the following documents prior to the enrollment of any subjects:  
• Original signed and dated Statement of Agreement page; • Copy of the IRB and radiation safety committee approval ( if applica
 ble); 
• Copy of the IRB stamped approved consent form; • Name [CONTACT_176110], and 
other fa 
cilities conducting tests, including laboratory certification number 
and date of certification if available;  
• List of reference range laboratory values; and  
• Any a
dditional licenses required in order to order to use 18F-AV-1451 or 
Florbetapir F 18. 
 
10.5. Study Drug  Control  
The receipt of clinical supplies ( e.g. starting material for 18F-AV-1451) must be 
documented at the site .   
 All drug supplies for this trial should be retained in a safe and secure place at all times durin
g the trial.   18F-AV-1451 Injection s and Florbetapir F 18 Injection 
should be prepared by a qualified PET manufacturing site and administered by a qualified individual under the investigator’s supervision.  An up- to-date drug 
inventory/dispensing record must be maintained and all drug supplies must be justified .  After completion of the trial, all remaining clinical supplies mu st be 
returned to the sponsor, or their representative.   
 
10.6. Data Collection  
 
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs ) will be used for this trial.  Individual patient 
files should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to patient’s medical records and laboratory test results.  The files should include information such as visit dates, records of medical history, examinations administered, laboratory, concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes as appropriate.  These constitute “source data”.  All entries on the eCRFs must be backed up by [CONTACT_112099].  Original electronic v ersions of imaging 
studies are also considered source data and should be kept on file by [CONTACT_779]/imaging center , and appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_176076] , or a 
designated Imaging  Core Lab , as specified in the Imaging Manual.

Each patient’s so urce fil e should include an original signed informed consent 
form.  When the trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on 
file with other trial related records.  
 All original laboratory reports must be available for review in each patient’s file.  It is impor
tant that the original reports be available for review because of the 
possibility of inaccuracies or errors in transcribing data from original records to the eCRF.  
 
The eCRFs must be kept in order and up- to-date so 
 that they always re flect the 
latest observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial.  The eCRFs must 
be completed for each patient enrolled in the trial and signed by [CONTACT_093].  This should be done as soon as possible after completion of the patient’s participation in the trial.  A monitor will verify the source data for all information 
on the eCRF. 
 
10.7. Adverse Events  
 All adverse events encountered during the clinical trial must be documented on the eCRF, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 Eli Lilly and Company mus
 t be notified immediately (as soon as possible, and in 
all cases within 24 hours) of a drug experience, condition, development, or event, which is considered serious. Eli Lilly and Com pany m ust be notified immediately 
of any findings with the use of the drug that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and precautions pertinent to the safety of the drug.  The investigator will be requested to complete a separate report form in addition to the information on the eCRF.  See section 7.7.4 for reporting
 serious adverse events 
 If a SAE i
s determined to be unexpected (not previously reported or described by 
[CONTACT_176105]), and study drug- related, Eli Lilly and Co. w ill notify the investigator in 
writing.  The investigator should forward this notification to the IRB within 24 hours of receipt. 
 
10.8. Records Retention  
 
All co rrespondence (e.g., with Avid, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical trial should 
be kept in appr
opriate file folders.  Records of subjects, source documents, and 
drug inventory sheets pertaining to the trial must be kept on file.  Records must be 
retained until the date a marketing ap plication (NDA) is approved for the drug for 
the indication for which it is being investigated, or until 2 years following the date 
of clinical trial termination or completion, whichever is later.   If no application is

STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Protocol Number:  APSS- 44-00 
Title:  A Multicenter, Double- Blind, Randomized, Saline -Controlled 
Study of a Single, Intra -Articular Injection of Autologous Protein 
Solution in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis  
Sponsor:  Biomet Biologics , A Zimmer Biomet Company  
Name [CONTACT_35215]:  nSTRIDE APS Kit  
Device 
Description:  The nSTRIDE autologous protein solution ( APS) Kit with 
anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution, formula A ( ACD- A) is a 
self-contained, sterile- packaged, single- use device designed to 
concentrate  anti-inflammatory cytokines and gr owth factors 
from whole blood. The device system  is to be used at the point 
of care to create an autologous soluti on. This device system  
consists of two parts: the nSTRIDE  Cell Separator and the  
nSTRIDE  Concentrator. The nSTRIDE Cell Separator 
separates the cellular components from plasma and red blood cells in whole blood. The cell solution is then loaded into the 
nSTRIDE Concentrator, which uses filtration through polyacrylamide beads to concentrate the cytokines in the injectable output.  
Intended Use:  The nSTRIDE APS Kit is designed to be used for the safe and 
rapid preparation of autologous protein solution (APS) from a 
small sample of blood at the patient’s point of care. The APS is 
to be injected intra- articularly for the treatment of knee 
osteoarthritis and associated symptoms or knee pain 
associated with osteoarthritis.  
Study Center(s):  The study will be conducted at up to 30 investigative centers in 
the [LOCATION_002].  
Planned Sample Size: 332 subjects will be randomized (1:1) into one of two treatment 
groups (APS and Saline ). 
Study Population:  Patient s with symptomatic  osteoarthritis (OA)  in one knee , who 
have not been able to get satisfactory pain relief with prior treatment.  
Study Objectives:  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is  to determine whether 
nSTRIDE APS is superior to a saline with regard to the mean improvement from baseline to 12 months in Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) LK

3.1 pain  score.   
Secondary and Exploratory Objectives  
Secondary objectives of this study include determining whether 
nSTRIDE APS is superior to saline in improving the WOMAC function subscale score (as evaluated using the percentage of subjects showing at least the minimal clinically important difference (MCID)),  and the WOMAC pain subscale score (as 
evaluated using the percentage of subjects showing at least the minimal clinically important difference (MCID)),  OMERACT -
OARSI responder rates, analyzing WOMAC pain and function in only the KL- II Subgroup, evaluating superiority of APS over 
saline in improving Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) pain, 
assessment of the changes in WOMAC Pain scores over time, and evaluation of the usage of rescue and restricted 
medication .    
Additionally, this study will evaluate change in  joint morphology 
and APS output characteristics. S afety of nSTRIDE APS will 
be compared to saline following intra- articular knee injections 
in subjects  with early to moderate symptomatic OA.  
Study Design and 
Procedures : The study will compare the efficacy of nSTRIDE APS to saline in patient s with early to moderate symptomatic osteoarthritis 
(OA) in one knee , who have failed at least one prior 
conservative OA therapy (e.g. physiotherapy, simple analgesics). This will be do ne using a double- blind, 
multicenter, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) with study subject s receiving either a single injection of nSTRIDE APS or 
saline. The primary efficacy measure will be pain as measured on the WOMAC LK 3; other measures of efficacy w ill include  
function,  stiffness, and quality of life. In addition to clinical 
efficacy measures, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_229702] . Anatomical changes will be evaluated by [CONTACT_12705] (MRI) and radiographs ( X-ray), and key 
factors in baseline blood and APS will be characterized. 
Laboratory characterization procedures will be performed using 
validated, prospectively defined methods . 
During the screening process, potential subjects will provide informed consent and then be scre ened for eligibility. 
Screening will consist of meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including a WOMAC LK 3.1 pain subscale score ≥ 9 
and ≤ 19  and by [CONTACT_229703]- Lawrence scale (assessed from normal 
radiographs ). Subjects will also provide demographics and

Confidential  Page 6 of 59 
 
 
 
 
medication use information  as part of this process . Baseline X-
ray (if needed) and MRI will be collected.  
Within 28 days of the screening visit, subjects will return to the 
clinic for treatment. Subjects will complete the baseline outcomes measurements including the EuroQol questionnaire 
(EQ-5D), and visual analog scale ( VAS)  for knee pain. The 
WOMAC score recorded at the screening visit will serve as the baseline (pre- injection ) WOMAC score, and the WOMAC 
questionnaire will not be re- administered prior to treatment.  
During the treatment visit, all subject s will have a blood draw, 
from which the APS will be prepared for injection and for 
laboratory characterization. The nSTRIDE APS Kits will be 
processed for all subject s in both treatment groups. After all 
available joint fluid is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229665],  according to 
randomization group assignment , approximately 2.5 millili ters 
(ml) of APS or saline will be injected into the j oint. Needle 
placement in the joint will be verified using  ultrasound. A 
blinding sleeve covering the contents of the syringe will mask treatment assignment from the subject  and the injecting 
physician. Any adverse events associated with the blood draw and/or injection procedure will be recorded. All subjects will be instructed to refrain from exceeding  the pre- injection level of 
activity for [ADDRESS_276368] injection. Concomitant treatment for OA  will be 
standardized to be oral acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol) for all 
subjects during the study. Subjects will be asked to abstain from analgesic  use for [ADDRESS_276369] completes  all 12 month follow -up 
evaluations, individual treatment allocation will be unblinded;  
subjects from both groups will be permitted to enter a one 
month open- label repeat treatment phase if they have had no 
major safety events due to the first injection . One month after 
the second injection, subject s will complete the WOMAC, EQ -
5D, and VAS for pain.

Clinical 
Assessment Tools : The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index using the Likert scale, Version 3.1:  
The WOMAC LK 3.1 questionnaire is a validated tool used for assessing knee pain, stiffness, and function. The WOMAC LK 3.1 has 24 items ; 5 items assessing knee pain, 2 items 
assessing knee stiffness, and 17 items assessing physical function. Each item is answered on a 5- point Likert scale, with 
grading from 0 (none or never) to 4 (extreme or always). A higher score indicates worse pain, stiffness, or functional limitation.  
The E uroQol-5 Dimensions  
The EuroQol -5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D) is a validated instrument 
which assesses an individual’s current health status and heath related quality of life.  The EQ -5D-3L descriptive component 
assesses  five dimensions : mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression over three levels  of 
severity.  The EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) assesses 
the respondent’s self -rated overall health state on a scale from 
0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).  
Visual Analog Scale  (VAS) for knee pain  
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276375] 2019  
Confidential  Page 10 of 59 
 
 
 
 
The VAS is a validated measure of knee pain.  The VAS is a 
nominal 100 mm line anchored by 0 “no pai n” and 10 0 “worst 
possible pain”. Subjects rate their average pain over the last 24 
hours  by [CONTACT_229708] a slash mark through 
the line . 
Imaging 
Assessment 
Tools : Radiographs  
Standing posterior -anterior (PA) fixed flexion knee radiographs 
(X-rays) are used to assess structural features of the joint, 
including joint space width, and presence or absence of subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and  osteophytes. X -
ray assessments will be performed by a core imaging laboratory.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been shown to be sensitive to structural changes in cartilage. Specifically, quantitative assessment via T2 MR r elaxation mappi[INVESTIGATOR_229666].  
In addition, semi -quantitative assessment via MRI 
Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS), is used to evaluate the following:  
• Subchondral Bone  
• Cartilage  
• Menisc us 
• Peri-Articular Features  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) assessments will be 
performed by a core imaging laboratory.  
Laboratory  
Characterization : Each subject  will have an additional nSTRIDE APS Kit 
processed for laboratory characterization. The APS output from 
the additional kit, along with a baseline blood sample and 
synovial fluid (if available) , will be sent to a core laboratory for 
analysis. Analyses will include quantification of cellular content  
and key cytokines  and growth factors . Laboratory 
characterization procedures will be performed using validated, 
prospectively defined methods.   
Primary Endpoint : The primary endpoint will be the change in pain from baseline 
to 12 months following injection of nSTRIDE APS or saline, as 
measured by [CONTACT_229709] 3.1 pain  subscale . 
Primary Hypothesis for nSTRIDE Superiority The primary hypothes is to be tested is that the mean 
improvement in WOMAC pain subscale score (baseline to 12 months) in the  APS group will be greater than that of the  saline 
group.  
The primary hypothes is described below will be tested along

Testing:  with the secondary hypotheses using a pre -specified order of 
hypotheses. These tests will be performed at the 0.[ADDRESS_276377] 
the primary endpoint.  The hypothesis  will be:  
H0: µAPS = µ Control   
Versus   
HA: µAPS ≠ µ Control   
Where:  
µAPS = mean change in WOMAC Pain from baseline to 12 
months in the APS group, and  
µcontrol = mean change in WOMAC Pain from baseline to [ADDRESS_276378] of the usage of APS on function will be evaluated as part of the primary endpoint; however, no formal statistical test will be done as a part of the study success criteria.  A qualitative assessment of the changes in WOMAC Function over time for  APS and Saline will be discussed, in order to 
ensure that the impact of the treatment on function is neutral or positive.  The following descriptive analyses will be performed for this assessment of function:  
 (1) A graphical examination of the changes in WOMAC Function for APS and Saline over time, including means 
and standard error bars.  
(2) Descriptive statistics for the mean changes in WOMAC Function over time, separately for each treatment group.  These will includ e mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
For each analysis, it is expected that the changes in WOMAC function will remain neutral or increase over time within the APS group, and also that the mean changes in WOMA C 
Function over time will be at least nominally better for the APS group than for Saline.

Secondary 
Endpoints : Secondary objectives of this study include determining whether 
nSTRIDE APS is superior to saline with regard to the endpoints 
shown below. These tests will be performed if the primary null 
hypothesis has been rejected. If the primary  null hypothesis is 
not rejected, these analyses will be conducted as exploratory analyses only.  
These secondary hypotheses will be tested using a fixed-sequence procedure, constructed using a pre- specified order 
of hypotheses, which will be tested in the order below. Subsequent to the rejection of the primary null hypothesis , 
these tests will b e performed at the 0.[ADDRESS_276380] until one hypothesis is tested not significantly, 
after which all subsequent tests will not be performed as 
secondary analyses, but instead will be performed as 
exploratory analyses only.

1 INTRODUCTION  
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative and disabling articulating joint disease that 
affects both younger, more active patients (e.g., patients with trauma or who have 
prolonged participation in highly demanding sports) and the elderl y (1-4). The 
disease is progressive and debilitating, eventually resulting in pain that may be so severe that restive sleep is impossible, along with life- altering loss of function.  
Surgical int ervention is clinically  successful,  and widely used, in treating  severe 
degenerative OA ; however, treatment modalities for less advanced OA are 
associated with varying —and often disappointing —rates of success . Current  
treatment  options include nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs) , 
corticosteroid injections, and hyaluronic acid (HA) injections. Although these treatments can relieve pain temporarily for some OA patients, they do not address 
the biological mechanisms causing the disease (5). Most are palliative. They mask 
symptoms.  
Osteoarthritis  causes  chronic pain, cartilage degradation and loss, detrimen tal 
subchondral bone remodeling, and varying degrees of synovial inflammation.  OA 
pain is a complex response resulting from the interplay between inflammation, anatomic pathology , innervation of articular cartilage, nerve sensitization, and 
psychological f actors.  Inflammation associated with OA results in joint stiffness and 
pain.  Patients may experience local warmth, tenderness, and effusion (6). Although 
OA is classified as a non -inflammatory disease, inflammation is implicated in many 
symptoms and in OA  progression.  Pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in OA 
development  (7-12). These c ytokines include  interleukin- 1 (IL-1), tumor nec rosis 
factor alpha  (TNFα), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and  interleukin- 8 (IL-8). These proteins  are 
integral in the initiation and maintenance of  inflammation by [CONTACT_229710] -to-cell 
interacti ons. Evidence exists that these factors are out -of-balance in the OA knee 
(13). Of these  cytokines, IL -1 has been proposed as playing a key role (14-16). The 
cytokines associated with inflammation in OA, primarily i nterleukin- 1 beta (IL-1β) and 
TNFα, are also implicated in cartilage matrix breakdown (17-19). These cytokines 
induce cells in the joint to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that in turn are responsible for cartilage matrix degradation  (20). The interactions  between 
chondrocytes in articular cartilage, synovium, IL- 1 and TNFα result in a positive 
feedback loop that increases inflammation and cartilage breakdown further and is 
associated with cartilage repair  attenuation.  IL-1, TNFα, IL-6, and  IL-8, along with 
nerve growth factor , can also lead to nerv e sensitization and stimulation (21).  
Because b oth IL-1β and TNFα play important roles in inflammation and cartilage 
breakdown,  inhibitio n of these cytokines may limit inflammation and matrix 
degradation. Consequently, inhibition of these proteins may constitute an effective OA therapy . The anti -inflammatory cy tokine interleukin- [ADDRESS_276388] (IL-
1ra), a competi tive IL-[ADDRESS_276389] , blocks the signaling activity of IL -1 (and 
has no signal -inducing activity itself ) (22-24). Soluble forms of the IL -1 cell receptor 
(sIL-1R) can bind with IL-1, reduc ing IL-1 biologic activity  by [CONTACT_229711]  (25). Moreover , soluble forms of the cell 
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276390] 2019  
Confidential  Page 18 of 59 
 
 
 
 
receptors for TNFα, known as sTNF -RI and sTNF -RII, can bind to TNFα,  preventing 
TNF-α surface receptor binding and thus inhibiting  cell signaling  (26).  
These anti -inflammatory cytokines are present systemically, but not in the 
concentrations or locations that may be clinically beneficial  in the treatment of knee 
OA. Autologous Protein Solution ( APS), produced using the nSTRIDE APS Kit,  
contains  concentrated levels of anti -inflammatory cytokines , including  IL-1ra, sIL -
1RII, sTNF -RI, and sTNF -RII. APS also contains concentrated levels  of anabolic 
cytokines associated with cartilage  genesis , inclu ding insulin -like growth factor 1  
(IGF-I) and transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF -β1) (27). Balancing these cytokines 
by [CONTACT_229712] (ACS) injection has been explored.  ACS is an 
autologous  acellular plasma serum containing  proteins.  ACS contains up- regulated 
levels of anti -inflammatory cytokines and has shown promise when compared to 
hyaluronic acid ( HA) and saline  for OA  treatment  (28). APS builds upon knowledge 
gained through ACS studies. It is designed to halt and potentially reverse the OA 
disease process by [CONTACT_229713].  
In summary,  inflammatory and catabolic cytokines are strongly implicated in the OA 
degenerative process . Inhibiting  their action may be beneficial  clinically . Anti-
inflammatory and anabolic cytokines found in and concentrated from whole blood 
may reduce or reverse the degenerative process.  Processing  whole blood using the 
nSTRIDE APS Kit can substantially increase anti-inflammatory and anabolic 
cytokine  concentrations . Thus, the introduc tion of  concentrated levels of anti -
inflammatory and anabolic cytokines  in a targeted fashion with APS yields a more 
favorable intra-articular environment. A likely result is the reduction and potentially 
the reversal of  the degenerative impact of out -of-balance inflammatory and catabolic 
cytokines present in the OA knee .  
The study proposed here builds upon decades of research into the causes of 
osteoarthritis. This study is designed to determine whether rebalancing of cytokines with APS prepared using the nSTRIDE APS Kit will, as suggested by [CONTACT_229714] , 
finally yield an eff ective treatment for early to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee  that 
targets the causes of this painful and debilitating  disease.  
1.1  Preclinical Studies  
1.1.1 Mechanism of Action Cell Assays  
The proposed mechanism of action is a process of reducing  OA-related upregulated 
inflammatory cytokines by [CONTACT_229715] . APS has been shown to reduce production of proteins associated with 
inflammatio n and pain responses.  In an in vitro model of inflammation and pain 
reduction, APS was incubated with IL- 1-stimulated macrophages.  APS decreased 
IL-8 production from these activated macrophages  (29). Another study examined the 
effect of APS on cartilage degradation.  APS inhibited IL- 1- and TNFα -induced 
chondrocyte production of MMP -13, a known degradation enzyme of  cartilag e (30). 
Further, inhibition of MMP -13 activity, specifically glycosaminoglycan releas e, was 
also exhibited in cartilage explant cultures stimulated with IL -1 and A PS (31). These 
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276391] 2019  
Confidential  Page 19 of 59 
 
 
 
 
cell assay studies demonstrate that APS can inhibit deleterious enzyme production,  
consistent with the proposed mechanism of action.   
1.1.2 Cytokine Concentration Stud y 
Analysis of APS samples and baseline whole blood samples from 105 OA patients 
revealed that the APS device concentrates IL -1ra and other anti -inflammatory 
cytokines 3 to 5 fold over that of whole blood baseline  concentrations  (27).  
1.1.[ADDRESS_276392] -injection, lameness and quantitative force plate mean results  were 
both significantly  improved relative to the pre- treatment baseline, and APS results  
were statistically superior to saline -treated horse results . Similarly, owners reported 
significant improvements in lameness at 3 months  and 12 months  in the APS -treated 
horses . No related adverse events (AEs) were reported.  Nor were there differences 
in joint swelling, as measured by [CONTACT_229716], between the APS - and saline-
treated animals.  There were also no changes from baseline in total protein, total 
white blood cells ( WBC s), or percent neutrophils in joint fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229667] e 
APS- treated group at [ADDRESS_276393] -injection.  This study provided safety and efficacy 
data showing that  APS reduces pain and impr oves function in horses with OA  (32). 
1.[ADDRESS_276394] s 
with osteoarthritis of the knee was conducted at Saint Anna Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Geldrop , The  
Netherlands  ((33;34) , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The primary study objective was to ass ess 
safety. Nine of 11 subjects (seven male) reported 22 AEs  (total) . There were no 
deaths or serious advers e events. The investigator deemed every AE  to be 
unrelated to the device. All were rated ‘mild’ in severity. The most frequent AEs were 
joint effusion (n=9) and arthralgia (n=5). These were most likely related to the injection procedure and not  to the device per se. One subject withdrew from the 
study subsequent to continued knee pain.  
WOMAC scores improved significantly by [CONTACT_229717] -injection and 
continued to improve as the study progressed . By 12 weeks, 80% of both physicians 
and subjects rated the conditio n under investigation as ‘very much’ or ‘much’ 
improved as determined by [CONTACT_229718]. At [ADDRESS_276395] -OARSI high pain responder criteria 
were met by 8 of 11 subjects (73%). At final follow -up, mean WOMAC pain reduc ed 
by 72% (89% in the 8 responders). WOMAC stiffness and function scores improved

Confidential  Page 20 of 59 
 
 
 
 
by 53% and by 68%, respectively. After study completion, a l ong-term analysis was 
performed at an average of 78 weeks (18 months) after subjects were enrolled. Six 
of the 11 s ubjects returned WOMAC and Patient Global Impression- Change (PGI -C) 
questionnaires and reported pain reduction from baseline measures. The data 
presented here suggest that the treatment is safe and shows a complication profile 
that i s mild and consistent with similar treatments. A single injection of APS for 
treatment of early to moderate knee osteoarthritis led to symptom improvement over the study course.  
After completion of the open- label feasibility study, a multicenter, prospective, 
randomized, double- blind, saline- controlled trial was conducted at three enrolling 
centers in Europe ( (35), [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A total of  46 patients with unilateral OA 
(Kellgren -Lawrence 2 or 3) knee pain were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (31 
patients) received a single ultrasound- guided injection of APS, and Group 2 (15 
patients) received a single sali ne injection. P atient reported outcomes and adverse 
events  were collected  at [ADDRESS_276397] -injection. The patients 
and evaluators were blinded to the treatment allocation, and the outcome was evaluated through VAS, WOMAC, and KOOS sc ores. Imaging evaluation was also 
performed with X -Ray and MRI before and after the treatment (12 months and 3  and 
12 months, respectively).  
The demographics were similar between the groups. The change from baseline to 12 months in WOMAC pain score was 65%  in Group 1 and 41% in Group 2 (p = 
0.02). Additionally, VAS pain improvement was 49% in Group 1 and 13% in Group 2 (p = 0.07 ). WOMAC function change from baseline to 12 months was 55 % in Group 
1 and 4 5% in Group 2 (p = 0. 38). The safety profile was also p ositive, with no 
significant differences in frequency, severity, or relatedness of adverse events between groups. No procedure-  or device- related serious adverse events were 
reported.

is ongoing, and this positive results obtained against saline has been used to plan 
this confirmatory trial that will be conducted to further substantiate these findings 
against those offered by [CONTACT_229719].

1.3.1  Indications  
The nSTRIDE  APS Kit is designed to be used for the safe and rapid preparation of 
autologous  protein solution (APS)  from a small sample of blood at the patient’s point 
of care.  The APS is to be injected intra- articularly for the treatment of knee pain  
associated with osteoarthritis . 
1.3.[ADDRESS_276400] the appropriate medical training to give intra- articular knee injections . 
Specifics on preparation of APS  using the nSTRIDE APS Kit  are given in S ection 
[IP_ADDRESS] – APS Preparation.  
1.4  Current Study Rationale  
OA is a degenerative disease characterized by [CONTACT_229721], cartilage degradation, cartilage loss, subchondral bone remodeling , and varying degrees of synovial 
inflammation mediated by [CONTACT_229722]- inflammatory and catabolic proteins.  
Current ly available  OA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229669] , but none is  known to 
address the underlying pathology  of this disease.  Analysis o f APS , prepared using 
the nSTRIDE APS Kit,  clearly shows multiple fold increases (relative to whole blood) 
of anti -inflammatory and anabolic proteins.  In vitro  and non- human animal stud y 
results  are consistent with the idea that APS can—in a targeted area—inhibit 
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276401] a 
substantial history of clinical us e with no report of any serious adverse events 
(SAEs) . Collectively, (1) t he demonstrated safety  profile,  (2) the evidence of  clinical 
utility , and (3) the potential for disease modification by [CONTACT_229723],  justify continuing human 
clinical trials o f the nSTRIDE APS Kit for OA treatment . Evidence shows that a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_229670] a saf e and reasonable next step in validating APS , prepared 
using the nSTRIDE APS Kit,  as a safe and effective minimally invasive  pain-
reducing  therapy for OA, one that in  vitro findings suggest may have the potential  to 
revers e the disease process . 
1.[ADDRESS_276402] to the mean improvement from baseline to 12 months in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) LK 3.[ADDRESS_276403] of the usage of APS on function will be evaluated as part of the primary endpoint; however, no formal statistical test will be done as a part of the study success criteria.  A qualitative assessment of the changes in WOMAC Function over time for APS and Placebo will be discussed, in order to ensure that 
the impact of the treatment on function is neutral or positive.  The following descriptive analyses will be performed for this assessment of function:  
 (1) A graphical examination of the changes in WOMAC Function for APS and Placebo over time, including means and standard error bars.  
(2) Descriptive statistics for the mean changes in WOMAC Function over time, separately for each treatment group.  These will include mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Secondary and exploratory objectives of this study include determining whether 
nSTRIDE APS is superior to saline in improving patient -reported outcomes including 
function, pain, stiffness, and quality of life in subject s with early to moderate 
symptomatic OA.   
Additionally, this study will evaluate change in joint morphology and APS output characteristics. Safety of nSTRIDE APS will be compared to saline following intra-articular  knee injections in subject s with early to moderate symptomatic OA.

2.4 Eligibility for Re -Screening 
Given the binary nature and time- dependency of many of the eligibility criteria of this 
study, there are times when a patient may not initially meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria but may eventually become eligible due to elapsed time and/or lifestyle modification or resolution of a pre- existing condition.  
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276410] 2019  
Confidential  Page 25 of 59 
 
 
 
 
  
For the following parameters, a patient may be re- screened immediately upon 
resolution of the issue leading to the initial screen failure:  
• Age; patient was initially < 21 years of age but is now ≥ 21 years of age 
• Inability to comply with the study protocol; patient previously met all study 
inclusion and no exclusion criteria but was unable to complete MRI or receive 
injection within 28 day window due to s cheduling conflicts  
• BMI; patient initially had BMI > 40 kg/m2 but now has BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2 
• Active infection of index knee; patient had active infection of the index knee which has since resolved  
• Symptomatic OA in the non- study knee; patient has had a knee re placement 
in the non- study knee and is now fully recovered from the surgery and 
rehabilitation  
• Untreated symptomatic injury of the index knee; patient had untreated 
symptomatic injury of the index knee which has since been successfully 
treated  
• Previous treatment of index knee; patient was previously within the 3 month 
window (steroid injection) or the 6 month window (arthroscopy, open surgery, 
hyaluronic acid injection, other intra- articular injection) of previous index knee 
treatment but now is not  
• Orally administered systemic steroid use within the past 2 weeks; patient was 
previously within the 2 week window of systemic oral steroid use but now is not 
• Use of systemic immunosuppressants within the past 6 weeks; patient was 
previously within the 6 week window of immunosuppressant use but now is 
not 
• Skin breakdown at the knee where the injection is planned to take place; patient previously had skin breakdown but the skin is now intact  
• Pregnant or nursing mother; woman who was previously pregnant or nursing 
is either no longer pregnant or no longer nursing and does not plan to 
become pregnant or nurse during the study  
• Trial participation; patient was previously within the 30 day (drug or device) or 
60 day (biologic) window of clinical trial participation but now is not  
 
Given that OA is a degenerative condition, there are times when a patient may not initially be eligible because their OA or associated symptoms are not severe enough but, over time, the condition may become more severe, thereby [CONTACT_229726]. For the following parameters, a patient may be re-screened upon failure of a newly administered OA therapy, provided that the 
therapy and subsequent failure are documented in the patient’s medical records:  
 Note: Failure of a regularly administered oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_229671] [ADDRESS_276411] 2019  
Confidential  Page 26 of 59 
 
 
 
 
• Kellgren -Lawrence score; initial Kellgren- Lawrence score was 0 or 1, but 
there is now reason to believe that the joint  degeneration due to the OA 
condition is more severe 
• WOMAC score; initial WOMAC pain score of the index knee was not high 
enough, but there is now reason to believe that the pain due to the OA 
condition is more severe 
• No documented prior conservative OA tr eatment; initial screening indicated 
that previous conservative treatment had not been attempted, but the patient has now failed one or more conservative treatments  
 If the patient has failed screening for a reason other than any of those listed above, then the patient will not be eligible for re- screening.  
 If a patient is re -screened, then the screening process should be done all over again, 
beginning with the informed consent, and a new subject ID should be assigned.  
2.5 Concomitant Treatment and Medication  
2.5.1 Allowable Medications/Nonpharmacological Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229672]:  
• Any treatment for a pre -existing condition or for an AE, outside of the study 
indicati on, that is not listed as restricted

the procedure visit ), subjects  may take acetaminophen as needed to a maximum of 
maximum of [ADDRESS_276413] be discontinued 48 
hours prior to the procedure visit and each  subsequent scheduled visit.  
The use of acetaminophen for other types of pain or illness d uring the study (e.g., 
toothache, headache, fever) should also be recorded on the Follow -Up Visit  form. 
Beginning at the procedure visit  through the end of the study , each subject  will be 
provided with a sufficient quantity of acetaminophen tablets at each scheduled clinic 
visit. Subjects  will be asked to report the frequency of tablet consumption since the 
previous visit at each follow -up visit.

2.6.2 Injection Procedure Visit  
During the injection procedure visit, but prior to APS preparation and injection , 
baseline evaluatio ns will be performed, including : 
• EuroQol 5- Dimensions (EQ-5D) 
• Visual Analog  Scale for knee pain ( VAS) 
• Medication Use  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Draws  
Specific instructions on how to complete the blood draws, prepare APS for 
injection, and prepare APS, whole blood, and synovial fluid  for shipment for 
this study  will be provided in a separate laboratory processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_229678] (to be provided separately at a later date) . 
Note : in total, 3 s amples (2 x 60 ml, 1 x 12 ml) of blood will be drawn to 
produce two APS volumes and 1 whole blood volume.  For subjects randomized 
to the APS treatment group, one (processed) APS volume will be used for treatment.  
A second (processed) APS volume will be used for analytical testing , and one whole 
blood sample will be used for analytical testing.  For subjects randomized to the 
saline treatment group, one (processed) APS volume will be used to determine the 
volume of saline for injection and will be used for  analytical testing . A second 
(processed) APS volume will be used for analytical testing, and one whole blood sample will be used for analytical testing.   
If it is not possible to draw the volume of blood required for injection (1 x 60 ml) , then 
that subject should be withdrawn from the study and should not be randomized. Multiple attempts may be made to draw the required volume of blood, provided that the safety of the subject is never compromised.  If the volume required for injection is 
obtained, but the additional volume required for laboratory analysis cannot be drawn, then sample preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_229679] .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization 
After the blood draw, subjects will undergo a 1:1 randomization to determine their treatment group. Details regarding Randomization can be found in Section 5.6.1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] APS Preparation  
Two nSTRIDE APS Kits should be processed for each subject  as described below . If 
a second nSTRIDE APS Kit cannot be processed due to an inability to draw enough blood, fill the second nSTRIDE Cell Separator with water or saline equivalent to the 
volume of blood being processed in the first nSTRIDE Cell Separator (approximately 60 ml)  to act as a counterbalance. Similarly, put water or saline in the second 
nSTRIDE Concentrator (approximately 6 ml) to act as a counterbalance. Alternatively, if only one nSTRIDE APS Kit is being processed in the centrifuge, then 
the appropriate nSTRIDE counterbalances may be used.  
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276418] the  cell solution  into the upper chamber of the  
nSTRIDE  Concentrator (which  contains  polyacrylamide beads ). Turn the paddle to 
mix the cell solution with the beads.  Place the nSTRIDE  Concentrat ors into the 
centrifuge so that they counterbalance one  another and process  for [ADDRESS_276419]  (final APS volume will be 
approximately 2.5 ml  for each device processed) .  
The first APS preparation should be used for the treatment injection. In the case of a 
subject randomized to the saline group, the first APS volume should be used to 
determine the volume of saline to be prepared for injection.  The second APS 
preparation is reserved for testing at the central laboratory.  If the subject  is 
randomized to the saline group,  then after using the first APS preparation to identify 
the quantity of saline to be injected, it should be prepared for  shipment  to the core 
laboratory for analysis  along with the second APS preparation.   
Record each APS volume on the Sample Processing Form. A volume of at least [ADDRESS_276420] the sponsor directly.   
If at any point the blood and/or intermediate cell solution  and/or APS is transferred 
from one facility location to another, then the syringe shall be capped with a sterile 
syringe cap or a sterile capp ed needle prior to transferring the syringe from one 
location to another.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Preparation and Blinding 
Once the APS has been prepared, the delegated unblinded member of the study staff shall prepare a syringe for injection. If the subject  has been randomized to the 
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276421]  has been randomized to the Saline group, then the syringe containing APS 
output labeled for injection shall be used to determine the volume of saline to draw 
up into a new 10 ml syringe. The syringe containing the appropriate volume of saline 
(equal to the volume of the APS) shall be placed in the bli nding sleeve and provided 
to the injecting physician. Additional details regarding Blinding can be found in Section 5.6.2.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Procedure  
Administer  the contents of the masked syringe (approximately 2.5 ml)  as a single 
injection into the joint . The procedure for the injection involves the following steps :  
1. Clean the injection area with an antiseptic solution.  
2. Apply  a local anesthetic on the injection site (optional) . If local anesthetic is used,  
then a topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413], such as ethyl chloride, is recommended. Under no 
circumstances may the anesthetic be injected  intra -articularly.  
3. Position needle into the intra- articular space , and confirm needle placement with 
an ultrasound image .

2.[ADDRESS_276427] Withdraw al 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason or no reason, 
without jeopardizing their medical care.  The investigative site will attempt to 
determine and document the reason(s) for discontinuation on the Study Exit form . 
Any subject who does not return for a scheduled follow -up evaluation w ill be 
contact[CONTACT_229727] , and an 
attempt to re -schedule the visit will be made . A subject will be withdrawn from the 
study (lost to follow -up) after a minimum of two unsuccessful attempted contacts 
were made. All subjects withdrawing from the study during the follow -up phase but 
prior to completion of the 12 month endpoint will be asked to voluntarily return for a final follow -up. 
Subjects may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator prior to receiving an injection for the 
following reasons:  
• If it is not possible to withdraw the required amount of blood for nSTRIDE 
APS Kit processing  (60 milliliters) , then the subject  will be withdrawn from the 
study and will not receive the injection. This will ensure that all treated subjects  receive the appropriate treatment volume.  
• If, on the day of injection, it is determined by [CONTACT_229728] ( e.g., due to development 
of infection of the index joint)  then the subject will be withdrawn from the 
study and will not receive the injection.  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to receiving an injection will be 
replaced.  
The investigator, the IRB, and the sponsor have the right to discontinue a subject for 
the following reasons : 
• Occurrence of unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the study  
• Insufficient compliance with the protocol by [CONTACT_423]  
• AEs intolerable to the subject  
• Participation in another clinical investigation that interferes with this study

acetaminophen for breakthrough pain, will be collected.  
2.8.3 Knee Radiograph  
A standing posterior -anterior (PA) fixed flexion radiograph of the index knee will be 
acquired.  Joint space width (JSW) and joint space narrowing (JSN), as well as 
Kellgren -Lawrence grade, will be measured according to validated, prospectively 
defined techniques described in a signed charter  produced by [CONTACT_229729]. This charter will specify the details of radiograph acquisition, transfer, 
and analysis techniques. All X -rays will be transferred to the Imaging Core 
Laboratory for independent review. Radiographs will be taken at the time of 
screening , or up to [ADDRESS_276429] T2 relaxation mappi[INVESTIGATOR_109242], they will be

2.8.6 WOMAC LK 3.1  Questionnaire  
The WOMAC LK 3.1 questionnaire is a validated tool used for assessing knee pain, stiffness, and function.  The WOMAC LK 3.1 has 24 items ; 5 items assessing knee 
pain, 2 items assessing knee stiffness, and 17 items assessing physical function.  
Each item is answered on a 5- point Likert scale, with grading from 0 (none or never) 
to 4 (extreme or always).  A higher score indicates worse pain, stiffness, or functional 
limitation.

2.8.7 EQ-5D 
The EuroQol -5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D) is a validated instrument which assesses an 
individual’s current health status and heath related quality of life.  The EQ -5D-3L 
descriptive component assesses  five dimensions : mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression over three levels of severity.  The EQ visual 
analogue scale (EQ VAS) assesses the respondent’s self -rated overall health state 
on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state)  to 100 (best imaginable health 
state).  
2.8.8 VAS Pain  
The Visual Analog Rating Scale is a validated measure of knee pain.  The VAS is a 
nominal 100 mm scale anchored by 0 “no pai n” and 10 0 “worst possible pain”.

Exploratory endpoints are listed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) (Supplement 
3). All analyses of exploratory endpoints  will be conducted at α = 0.05 and will not be 
adjusted for multiple comparisons as these are exploratory outcomes.  
3 PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING AND MANAGEM ENT 
Protocol violations will be tracked and reported by [CONTACT_456].  
Protocol  violations identified by [CONTACT_229730].  Protocol violations identified during monitor ing visits will be 
documented on the appropriate CRF and di scussed with the investigator.  Where  
necessary a corrective action will be implemented.  
Protocol deviations will be classified into two severity categories:  
• Minor  deviations : violations  that do not impact and do not have the potential 
to impact patient safety  or scientific validity of the primary endpoint . Examples  
include isolated instances of missing laboratory values or study assessments . 
• Major deviations : violations  that impact patient safety  or have the potential to 
do so , or have the potential to impact  scientific validity of the primary 
endpoint . Examples include no ICF prior to procedure or  inclusion of a subject  
who clearly did not meet eligibility criteria.  
[ADDRESS_276439] the onset and resolution date(s) listed  (when known) , will have their 
management and outcome documented (if possible) , and will be assessed for 
severity, relatedness , and whether th ey were anticipated.  SAEs will be described in 
a narrative in the final study report . 
Anticipated AEs in this trial include , but are not limited  to, those associated with any 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229690], bleeding, bruising, 
infection, deep venous thrombosis, scar tissue formation, thrombotic complications , 
or nerve/ nervous system damage.  Anticipated AEs associated with the injection 
procedure include worsening of knee pain and/or function, effusion,  and infection.   
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276440] a causal relationship with the 
treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporal ly associated with the 
use of an investigational device,  whether or not related to the investigational device . 
Any AE that oc curs during or after the blood draw will be recorded.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an  AE that:  
• Results in d eath 
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148078] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect  
Adverse Device E ffect 
An adverse device e ffect (ADE)  is an  AE whose  causal relationship with the 
investigational device is determined to be likely or definite.  The following are 
identified as possible examples of ADEs:  
• Injection site reaction –  swelling, redness, burning, itching at the injection site –  
to a degree that is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_229691] -articular aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229692]  
• Knee arthralgia –  severe pain in the knee joint  
• Knee joint ache – to suffer dull, continued pain 
• Knee joint inflammation –  a localized protective reaction of tissue to irritation, 
injury, or infection, characterized by [CONTACT_77368], redness, swelling, and sometimes loss 
of function 
• Knee joint effusion –  the escape of fluid from the blood vessels or lymphatics into 
the knee joint  
• Knee arthrosis – degenerative disease of the knee joint  – beyond what is 
considered to be normal OA progression  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipat ed adverse device effect  (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device;  if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degr ee of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects .

4.2 Adverse Event  Assessments  
All AEs reported to or identified by [CONTACT_229731]’s study chart and on the Event Form , 
including  but not limited to the following:  
• Observed or volunteered problems  
• Physical signs and symptoms  
• Medical condition which occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline  
• Medical condition present at baseline, which appears to worsen during the study  
All AEs will be documented on the Adverse Event Form  regardless of  whether the 
medical/clinical event is associated with the use of the investigational device.  
Each AE record must include a description of the event,  date of onset, date of 
resolution  (when known) , severity, action  taken, relationship to study  device and 
seriousness criteria.  Each AE must be recorded separately.  
An outcome which may be expected to occur following any joint aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229693] (e.g. transient pain at the injection site, mild swelling of the joint ) 
should not be cl assified as an adverse event unless it is considered to be more 
severe or of longer duration or otherwise more pronounced  than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855].  
Negative responses on follow -up questionnaires which are intended to evaluate 
clinical efficacy will not be recorded as adverse events.

ray) which is considered by [CONTACT_229732].  
Severity  will b e assessed by [CONTACT_229733]:  
Mild: Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate : Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
Relationship to the study device will be assessed by [CONTACT_229734]:  
Definitely Not:  Evidence exists that the AE  definitely has a cause other than 
the study device (e.g. , pre-existing condition or underlying disease, interc urrent 
illness, or concomitant medication) and does not m eet any other criteria listed.  
Unlikely : A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
preparation/ administration of the investigational device (or comparator) . 
Although the AE may appear unlikely to be related to the investigational  device, 
it cannot be ruled out with certainty; and/ or the event cannot be readily 
explained by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Likely : A temporal relationship exists between t he event onset and 
preparation/ administration of the investigational device (or comparator)  and

treatment of an AE must be recorded on the Adverse Event Form . If the medication 
necessary for treatment is on the restricted medication li st, a Protocol Deviation form 
must also be completed. If more than one  distinct AE occurs, each event should be 
recorded separately.  The worsening of an adverse event should not be recorded as 
a new AE but as a continuation of an ongoing AE.  Based on the i nformation reported 
for the AE , if the sponsor or the sponsor’s agent determines that the reported AE is

The nSTRIDE APS  Kit has a favorable risk profile.  The injectable APS is processed 
from the patient’s own whole blood using the nSTRIDE APS Kit . If properly 
processed then the risk of any immunogenic reactions, disease transmission or 
adverse interactions with systemic drugs is  minimal .  Because APS is delivered 
intra-articularly , there is localized anatomical impact allowing for the precise 
monitoring of adverse effects . There is  little, if any , systemic introduction.  Therefore, 
safety concerns with APS may  be primarily related to the injection process.  The most 
likely  adverse eff ects are pain and swelling at the injection site.  Such reactions

serious complications of intra- articular injections include,  but are not limited to, local

Subjects  in this study are exposed to potential  risks associated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229696], a blood draw, and solution injection into the knee.  These include pain, 
bleeding, bruising, infection, deep venous thrombosis, scar tissue formation, 
thrombotic complic ations and nerve damage.  These risks are not unique to this 
study and may occur with any aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], blood draw, or joint injection procedure.  
Potential r isks associated with the injection of the APS include worsening of pain 
and/or knee function, effusion, and infection.  Mixing up blood and/or APS samples 
from multiple donors presents a risk of injecting the APS produced from one patient into another patient.  This would be associated with a possible inflammatory reaction 
or disease transmission to  the patient receiving the injection.  There are no known 
specific risks of the investigational device itself.  
5.[ADDRESS_276446] any injection si te reactions or other AEs.  Rigorous  
inclusion/exclusion criteria ensure that any patient who may be at increased risk is 
not enrolled in the study (e.g., patients with a systemic inflammatory condition).  
Appropriate investigative center  personnel  will be  thoroughly  trained on the 
processing  of the nSTRIDE APS Kit .  
Sticker labels are included in each kit to identify the subject  associated with each 
syringe , device and specimen . The use of these labels will reduce the risk of sample 
mix-up. Additionally, o nly one subject ’s blood will be processed in the centrifuge at a 
time.

any AE indepe ndently reviewed by [CONTACT_229736].  
5.4 Investigation Suspension or Termination  
The Investigator, the IRB , and the Sponsor may suspend or terminate the 
investigation at any/all investigational sites at any time if they believe:  
• There is unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the study  
• A decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the product (subjects already enrolled would be 
followed until they complete the study)  
• Failure of the investigator to enroll patients into the study at an acceptable rate 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol or appropriate 
regulations , especially with respect to subject safety  
• Site personnel knowingly  submit  false informat ion from the investigative site 
to the sponsor, study monitor, IRB, or regulatory authority  
The sponsor  should be notified immediately  if any one of  these conditions is present.  
The sponsor will determine the appropriate course of action taking into account 
medical assessments, regulatory mandates and ethical considerations.  If the clinical 
investigation is suspended or terminated then the sponsor , in coordination with the 
IRB and investigator , will comply with any necess ary action regarding investigation, 
documentation,  and reporting.  
5.5 Potential Benefits of the Procedure  
The potential benefit of APS i s the treatment of knee OA and associated symptoms, 
or the treatment of knee  pain associated with OA . This study also explores other 
potential benefits, such as knee function restoration and anatomical improvement 
within the joint.  
5.6 Bias Minimization
 
5.6.1  Randomization  
The randomization plan will be produced using SAS v 9.2 for Windows or similar 
software. Balanced, blocked randomization (1:1, APS: Saline ) will be 
implemented.  In the event that a screen failure occurs post -randomization, and no 
study treatment was given, randomization will not be reassigned and in this case will 
not count toward the o verall sample size. Randomization will continue with the next 
case enrolled until the minimum sample size is reached in both treatment groups. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725], and each site will receive separate 
randomization plans using random predetermined block sizes that will remain 
undisclosed to the sites. The randomization file will be uploaded into the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system. Once the subject  is enrolled into the EDC and has been 
identified as eligible for randomization, the  randomization allocation will be visible 
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276448] the 
blind, any recorded information specifically related to APS treatment will be kept in 
an “unblinded” file, separate from the rest of the study data, and will only be 
available to the unblinded research associate. Blinded evaluators will not have access to the unblinded file.  
Study -related communications between the unblinded research associate and the 
blinded evaluators will be limited to prevent breaking  the blind. Study -related 
communications should be limited in scope to the subject’s pre- existing conditions 
prior to treatment or to adverse events following treatment. The unblinded research associate will not play a role in any follow -up visit study procedures, and unblinded 
personnel will be strictly forbidden from discussing treatment allocation with subject s 
and clinical observers.  
The subject’s  randomization allocation  will be viewable in the EDC by [CONTACT_229737] . This allocat ion will only be communicated to blinded study 
personnel  if a serious adverse event occurs and information as to which treatment 
the subject  received is essential for the medical treatment of the subject  and adverse 
event reporting. All sites and the spons or will keep a record of the communication of 
the randomization allocation of any subject . 
[ADDRESS_276449] be 
maintained by [CONTACT_15009]/her designee on a device accountability log. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that all investigational devices are kept in a secure location, with access limite d to individuals authorized by [CONTACT_093].

Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276450]  any remaining investigational 
material which was prepared (using an acceptable disposal method for products 
potentially contaminated with blood) .  
After completion  of the treatment period of the study, all unopened devices will be  
returned to the sponsor  in the original containers or will be  destroyed at the study 
site by [CONTACT_10184] . The monitor will complete  an accountability form to 
document the action taken.  
The device accountability records must be readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_11200], independent auditor , and any regulat ory authority inspector. The 
study monitor will reconcile device supplies as part of the routine monitoring visit.  
6.1  Description and Control of Saline Comparator
 
The saline comparator will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. The comparator will be 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The saline solution will be stored and administered in a 
consistent manner with the investigational device.

Confidential  Page 48 of 59 
 
 
 
 
• Withdrawal of IRB approval  
• Major d eviations from the investigative plan  
• Use of an investigational device without informed consent  
An investigator shall  provide accurate, complete, and current information about any 
aspect of the study  upon request by [CONTACT_1034], the reviewing IRB , or FDA . 
[ADDRESS_276454] to the mean improvement from baseline to 12 
months in  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
(WOMAC) LK 3.[ADDRESS_276455], and all subsequent tests, will be performed as exploratory analyses. Since the order of the tests is fixed a priori, and the second hypothesis is tested only if the previous hypothesis has been rejected, the principle of closed testing  implies that no 
adjustment to control the familywise error rate is necessary.  The Fixed- Sequence 
Method is described as an acceptable method for addressing the multiplicity problem in Section IV.C.5 of the FDA draft guidance entitled, “Guidance for Industry –  
Multiple Endpoints in Clinical Trials ”.
  
 If the primary hypothesis is not tested significantly, all subsequent secondary tests will be performed as exploratory analyses only.  
 A two -tailed independent sample  T-test will be used to test the primary endpoint.  
The hypothesis  will be:  
 
H
0: µAPS = µ Control   
Versus   
HA: µAPS ≠ µ Control   
 Where:  
µ
APS = mean change in WOMAC Pain from baseline to 12 months in the APS 
group, and  
µcontrol = mean change in WOMAC Pain from baseline to [ADDRESS_276456] of the usage of APS on function will be evaluated as part of the primary endpoint; however, no formal statistical test will be done as a part of the study success criteria.  A qualitative assessment of the changes in WOMAC Function over time for APS and Placebo will be discussed, in order to ensure that the impact of the treatment on function is neutral or positive.  The following descriptive analyses will be performed for this assessment of function:  
 (3) A graphical examination of the changes in WOMAC Function for APS and Placebo over time, including means and standard error bars.  
(4) Descriptive s tatistics for the mean changes in WOMAC Function over time, 
separately for each treatment group.  These will include mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
For each analysis, it is expected that the changes in WO MAC function will remain 
neutral or increase over time within the APS group, and also that the mean changes in WOMAC Function over time will be at least nominally better for the APS group than for Saline.  
  
A finding of nSTRIDE APS superiority on the mean improvement in WOMAC LK 3.1 Pain along with no corresponding deterioration in WOMAC Function will be 
considered evidence of nSTRIDE APS efficacy, and the device will be considered efficacious  for the treatment of  knee  pain associated with osteoarthritis . 
 
9.2 Demographics  and Medication Use  
Analyses  will be done to determine whether randomization succeeded in creating 
groups that were balanced with regards to key baseline characteristics . Planned 
tests aimed at determining this are specified in the statisti cal analysis plan. All tests 
will be under a null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups.  
 
A time -course tabulation showing rescue medication (acetaminophen) use (for index 
knee OA) by [CONTACT_229740]. In addition the percentages of subjects requiring rescue medication for their index knee OA during the course of follow -up (up to 12 months) will be compared for APS vs. Control using a Fisher’s 
Exact test.  
9.[ADDRESS_276457], 
AE severity, AE device relatedness, AE duration, and AE onset  for each treatment 
group. AEs will also be used to characterize the safety of a repeat APS injection.  
10 STUDY MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL  
The investigators will permit trial- related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and 
regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to the trial site and to source 
data/documents upon request. Clinical trials sponsored by [CONTACT_229741]. The sponsor’s staff and/or 
representatives will closely monitor the conduct of the clinical investigation so that any questions and problems that may arise can be promptly resolved. Such monitoring will also ensure that the c linical investigation is conducted in accordance 
with this clinical investigation plan, including all amendments, with good clinical practice ( GCP ) guidelines , and with International Standards Organization (ISO) 
[ZIP_CODE] stipulations . Monitoring will involve visits by [CONTACT_456]'s representative to 
the investigational center s to verify good management of subject s and the clinical 
investigation devices, to observe procedures and to audit the clinical investigation for quality control purposes (to check device accountability and supplies, presence of required documents, informed consent and to compare CRFs  with source data). 
There will also be frequent telephone contact [CONTACT_229742] s. The Monitoring P lan is presented in 
Supplement  4. 
[ADDRESS_276458]  
The investigator will ensure that the clinical study is conducted in accordance with : 
• The Protocol  
• Regulatory and reviewing IRB requirements  
• ISO [ADDRESS_276459] of the IRB members (including their Institution 
 
Zimmer Biomet  [ADDRESS_276460] 2019

affiliations, gender makeup, and occupations); or a statement from the IRB 
specifying that the membership complies with applicable regulations, including but not limited to [ADDRESS_276461]'s medical record and reported to the sponsor within the time period required by [CONTACT_229743].  
12.4 Informed Consent  
Prior to the performance of any study -specific procedures, subjects will be provided 
with an informed consent form ( ICF) and patient information sheet and be given 
ample opportunity to review the ICF  and ask questions.  If the subject agrees to 
participate in the study,  then the subject must sign and date the ICF. The 
Investigator or designee must also sign and date the ICF.  A copy of the ICF should 
be given to the subject.  
The specific ICF used must have current IRB  approval at time of use.  A HIPAA 
statement must be included in the ICF or provided as a separate document.    
Subjects will be informed of new information learned during the study, if any, which may affect the subject’s decision to continue participation in the study.   
An Informed Consent Log will be completed to document the existence of the signed ICF. The log w ill contain: Subject ID, date ICF signed, and the version signed.  The 
monitor will initial and date the log once the executed ICF  has been reviewed.  
Signed ICF (or copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) are to be maintained in the study file and must be available 
for verification by [CONTACT_229744].

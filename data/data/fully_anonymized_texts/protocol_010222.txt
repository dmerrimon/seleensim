BI 409306 -a potent selective phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9A) inhibitor – is being developed 
for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment associated 
with schizophrenia (CIAS).
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Alzheimer ’s disease (AD), a chronic progressive mental di sorder, is the most common cause 
of dementia and accounts for 50 to 70 % of all cases. AD is mainly  a disorder of the elderl y; 
however it can also affect patients below the age of 60. More than [ADDRESS_511603] of them suffering from AD, with around 5 
million new cases occurring every  year (R10-5095 ;R10-5106). The age - specific prevalence 
of AD almost doubles every  5 years after age 65. Among developed nation s, approximately  1 
in 10 elderly  people (65+ y ears) is affected by [CONTACT_342339] , whereas more than 
one third of the very  old people (85+ y ears) may  have dementia-related s ymptoms and signs 
(R10-5105).
AD is characterized, in the earl y stage ,by [CONTACT_342340][INVESTIGATOR_405699], like executive function, orientation and judgment. The pattern of 
cognitive and functional decline is not uniform over the course of the disease and differs 
according to t he measure in question and the scales used. This is followed by a progressive 
decline in the ability  to perform activities of daily  living and the appearance of behavioral 
changes and/or ps
ychiatric symptoms (mood disturbances, hallucinations, personality 
changes ).
Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and disabling brain disorder affecting about one percent of 
the world´s general population. The sy mptoms of schizophrenia fall into three broad 
categories:
Positive sy mptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thoughts.
Negative s ymptoms, such as restricted affect and drive.
Cognitive sy mptoms, such as poor executive functioning, trouble focusing or pay ing             
attention, impairment of working memory , verbal and visual learning and memory .
Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. There is substantial evidence that 
cognitive deficits are a major determinant of functional recovery  in schizophrenia. Around 
20-60% of the variance in functional outcome in schizophrenia is explaine d by [CONTACT_405729].
On cellular level, AD is characterized b y a progressive loss of synapses and neurons. 
Affected transmitter s ystems mainly  include cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons. 
Cognitive dy sfunction in schizophrenia is caused by  [CONTACT_405730] s in (pre -) frontal cortical but also limbic areas of the brain ( R10-5098 ;R10-
5113;
R10-5103 ). Glutamate as the major excitatory  neurotransmitter in the human brain is most 
prominently  associated with functions of memory  formation and learning. Glutamatergic 
transmission is mediated by  [CONTACT_342341] -synaptic NMDA receptor play ing 
an essential role. Upon activation, a cascade of in tracellular, post -synaptic signaling events is

activation of protein kinases and manifestation of long- term potentiation (LTP) and sy naptic 
plasticity . LTP is regarded a s a validated ph ysiological model for cellular processes 
underlying learning and memory  formation ( R10-5109; R10- 5092; R10- 5102). Impaired 
NMDA receptor signalling and reduced levels of cGMP ( R10-5110 ,P10-[ZIP_CODE]; R10- 5097) 
have been shown in animal models of schizophrenia and in patients suffering from AD. 
Phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) h ydrol yses cGMP with the highest affinity of all PDEs and 
is highly  expressed in the neocortex and hippocampus; therefore it is likely  to be a significant 
determinant of intracellular basal cGMP levels in these brain regions.
PDE9A inhibitors should restore cGMP levels to phy siological levels and give rise to 
memory  improvement in patients via enhancing glutamatergic signalling, manifestation of 
long-term potentiation and strengthening of s ynaptic plasticity. BI 409306 showed 
convincing efficacy  in two animal models of cognition enhancem ent addressing cognitive 
domains and brain regions known to be affected in AD and CIAS.
The pathoph ysiological mechanisms leading to deficits in cognition in schizophrenia and 
Alzheimer´s disease are largel y unknown. Some of the deficits concern functions, such as 
working memory , attention, and perceptual organization, that have been proposed to involve 
synchronization of oscillatory  activity  in the high- frequency  band (β and γ) ( R14-3532). 
A substantial body  of EEG studies supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia and AD are 
related to impaired neural sy nchron y and there is growing evidence that impaired sensory -
processing significantl y contributes to the cognitive deficits in these disorders ( R14-3419;
R14-3418 ;R14-3420 ). Sensory  event -related potentials (ERPs) have also been widel y used to 
examine basic neuronal activity  in both normal brain function and in schizophrenia and 
Alzheimer´s disease, and have revealed abnormalities in the basic processing of both repeated 
and novel environmental stimuli ( R14-3433 ) and may  be used as biomarkers of the diseases 
(R14-3416 ;R14-3417).

outer segment of the photoreceptor lay er.
Subsequently , BIinvestigated in a second preclinical study  the effects of PDE9 -inhibitor BI 
409306 on rat retina in-vitro by  [CONTACT_405731]- retinogram (ERG) and ganglion cell 
activity  using different concentrations andsildenafil, a PDE5- inhibitor with PDE6 off -target 
activity  as an active control. Results show that the PDE9 -inhibitor increased the amplitude of 
A-wave and B -wave of ERG, like the experimental control sildenafil. Field action potential 
analysis revealed that BI 409306, comparable to the experimental control sildenafil, enhanced 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_405700]. The effects of BI 409306 and sildenafil on retinal 
activity  (ERG and ganglion cell activity ) were shown to be reversible.
As a conclusion from these experiments ,PDE9 protein is expressed in retina and PDE9 -
inhibition leads to changes in retina ph ysiology  (ERG and ganglion cell act ivity), providing a 
likely  explanation for the transient visual effects noted in human.   
This study  will utilize targeted ophthalmological assessments tofurther explain and 
characterize the effect of BI 409306 
on ocular physiology .
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
1.2.1 Drug substance
BI 409306 is a new chemical entity  (NCE) intended for oral administration. Film coated
immediate release tablets of 25 mg and 10
0mg will be applied in this trial.
Pharmacology  
BI 409306 is a potent and selective PDE9A inhibitor. I n vitro, BI 409306 inhibits the full -
length rat PDE9A with an IC50 of 168 nM and shows a long- lasting potentiation of 
hippocampal LTP in acute slices of rat brain ( U10-2281; U10- 2282; U10- 2283; U10- 2286).
In vivo, a dose -dependent increase of cGMP in brain and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) was seen 
(U10-2288; U10- 2287). In addition, BI [ADDRESS_511606] (T -maze) and 
novel object recognition test ( U10-2472; U10-2284 ).
The results obtained with BI [ADDRESS_511607] distribution into tissues. The volume of distribution was 0.8 l/kg in the rat and 1.4 
l/kg in the dog. Total plasma clearance was low in the rat (12.7 mL/min·kg) and in the dog 
(7.4 mL /min·kg). The absolute bioavailability  accounted for 74% in rats and for 100% in 
dogs (C02101303
).

was recovered in feces and 64.5% was recovered in urine until [ADDRESS_511608] dose ( C02101303).
BI 409306 is extensively  metabolized, and two major Phase I metabolites are likely  formed in 
humans ( U10-2959; U10- 2646 ). In vitro investigations with human hepatocy tes and human 
liver microsomes demonstrated that BI 409306 oxidative metabolism is mainly  dependent on 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzy me 2C19 ( U10-2646 ). In human liver microsomes of 
CYP2C1 9 poor metabolisers, BI 409306 metabolism was low and mediated by [CONTACT_097] 3A4/5, 
though a contribution of further enz ymes cannot be excluded ( U11-2807 ).
The in vitro plasma protein binding of BI 409306 in humans is low (27%) and consiste nt over 
other species with no observed gender difference. BI 409306 showed a high intrinsic passive 
permeability in investigations with Caco -2 cells. BI 409306 was not a substrate of P -gp, 
BCRP and SL C. The drug was identified as weak inhibitor of P -gp, BC RP, OAT3 and other 
SLC-transporters with IC 50’s of >500 μM, 100 -500 μM, 26 μM and >200 μM, respectivel y.
An affinit y to melanin containing tissues, i.e. skin and eye was observed; however, as BI
409306 does not significantly  absorb light in the relevant wavelength of 290 –700 nm, no 
phototoxic potential is expected. After single intravenous and oral administration to rats, BI 
409306 was extensively  metabolised.
Drug -drug interactions based on inhibition or induction of cy tochrome P450 enzy mes b yBI 
409306 are unlikel y to occur. In vitro investigations with human hepatocy tes and human liver 
microsomes demonstrated that BI 409306 metabolism is mainly  CYP 2C19 dependent.
Safety  Pharmacology (other than ocular)
Central nervous system
There was no effect of BI [ADDRESS_511609] in rats and on nocturnal motility  in rats up 
to dose of 45 mg/kg. Reduced bod y weight gain ([ADDRESS_511610] dose but reversible until Day 7), 
slight to moderate decrease in body temperature ([ADDRESS_511611] dose) an d slight decrease in 
locomotor activity  ([ADDRESS_511612] dose) were limited to the maximum dose tested (750 mg/kg) 
(C02101303).
Cardiovascular function
BI 409306 did not induce any  effects on ECG and blood pressure in dogs (telemetry ) upto 
the dose of 5 mg/kg. Dose dependent increase of contractility , heart rate with cases of sinus 
tachycardia and s ystolic ventricular pressure in the dose levels of 9 and 20 mg/kg were 
observed. Additionall y, decrease in s ystolic pressure and reduction of RR/ PR/ QT intervals 
were limited to the highest dose level of 20 mg/kg ( C02101303).

1.2.2 Toxicology
Target organs identified after repeat -dose toxicity testing were liver (rats), adrenal glands
(rats), ovaries (rats), spleen (rats) and the cardiovascular s ystem (rats and dog s) (R05-2282 ; 
U10-2597 ; U10-4089 ; U11-1173 ). Adverse effects in rats were mainly  limited to the highest 
doses tested. Cardiovascular effects in dogs occurred also at lower dosages but were 
considered monitorable.
The No Observed Effect Levels (NOEL) after oral administration of BI 409306 for 13 weeks 
was 9 mg/kg (corresponding to C max) of 9090/7880 nmol/L , and AUC 0-24hof24600/[ZIP_CODE] 
nmol·h/L  in males/females) in the rat. After oral administration of BI [ADDRESS_511613] Level (NOAEL) was 9 mg/kg (corresponding to C(max) of 
[ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE] nmol/L , and AUC 0-24hof [ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE] nmol·h/L  in males/females) in the dog.
The overall assessment of genotoxicity  testing in vitro and in vivo revealed that BI 409306 is 
not genotoxic.
Data from the dose range finding studies in mice and rats indicate a low potential of BI 
409306 for acute toxic effects (estimated LD50: > 750 mg/kg in mice; around 1000 mg/kg in 
rats; > 50 mg/kg in dogs).
Assessment of female reprotoxicity  has not been conducted y et.
Specific toxicological aspects
The liver and the heart were identified as target organs for adverse histopathological changes, 
restricted to the highest tested dose of 750 mg/kg in rats ( C02101303).
In the liver, adaptive h ypertroph y of the hepatocytes (corresponding to reversibly  elevated 
organ weight), mild exacerbation of apoptotic hepatocy tes and postnecrotic microgranulomas 
in males were observed. 
Cardiac changes had also been noted in the 2 -week oral dose range finding study , including 
multifocal fibrosis/fibroplasia in the septum and the papi[INVESTIGATOR_405702]. A nephropathy  in the 
kidney  was ascribed to the male rat -specific nephropath y due to accumulation of α2u -
globulin and therefore to be of no relevance for humans.
In the dog, the main finding was increased heart rate, ranging from moderate elevation to
tachycardia. Whereas cardiac histopathological changes (slight hemorrhages, infl ammatory  
infiltration with focal necrosis) were noted in the escalating dose study  with oral doses 
ranging from 10- 50 mg/kg administered for 3 or 4 day s each, no comparable morphological 
alterations were observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 4 -week study  up to 40 mg/kg. A slight cellular 
depletion of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow was onl y observed in the escalating dose

study  and thus may  represent an incidental finding.
In summary , the non -clinical safet y data of BI 409306 supported a clinical Phase I trial with
oral administration in patients with Alzheimer Disease and schizophrenia. The toxicological 
profile of BI 409306 was characterized b
y cardiac effects which seem t o be consistent with 
those described for phosphodiesterase inhibitors in general. All adverse effects generall y 
were restricted to high dose levels and were reversible. Visual side effects occurred shortl y 
after dosing because there was widespread distribu tion of PDE9 in the retina but the side 
effects will mostly  be resolved within 1 h. Based on the available non-clinical data, BI 
409306 was associated with an acceptable safet y profile for phase I studies with oral 
administration under close monitoring of the toxicities identified, in particular careful 
monitoring of cardiac function and serum liver enzy mes.
1.2.3 Clinical Study
Safety  data from f ivephase I studies are available ( U12-1034; U13- 1182; U12- 2165; U13-
1303 ; c02098989) in healthy  young and healthy  elderly  volunteers. In all fivehealth y 
volunteer trials, the most frequent drug related adverse events were visual side effects that 
occu rred shortl y after dosing and mostly resolved within [ADDRESS_511614] recombinant human PDE6 
isoforms in the retina revealed no relevant activity, indicating that visual disturbances do not 
seem to be linked to PDE6 or other off -target activity  of BI 409306 ( cf.Section 1.1 ). Two 
preclinical studies were then conducted to further explore this phenomenon.  The first study  
confirmed that there was a widespread distribution of PDE9 in the rat and human retina; and 
the second revealed enhanced spi[INVESTIGATOR_405703].  It was concluded that PDE9 protein is expressed in 
retina and PDE9- inhibition leads to changes in retina phy siology  that likely result i n the 
transient visual effects noted in human.
Overall, there were no relevant changes observed for laboratory , ECG recordings, and vital 
signs following treatment with BI 409306 when compared to placebo. Onl y a rapid and short 
lasting increase in supi[INVESTIGATOR_72122] 12.9 ± 4.4 bpm was detected in Chinese CYP2C19 
poor metabolizers subjects treated with BI 409306 (100 mg single dose) in Study  1289.4 
(c02098989). Following this observation, pharmacometric analy sis of all available huma n 
data revealed a BI 409306 plasma concentration dependent increase in supi[INVESTIGATOR_405704] 
a maximum of 7 -13 bpm (median) at high exposure end in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers 
treated with BI 409306 at 100 mg. The maximum effects of BI 409306 on pulse rate w ere 
generall y achieved at maximum BI 409306 plasma concentrations ([ADDRESS_511615] dose) 
and disappeared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_405705].
None of the safet y data presented a safety issue for further clinical trials.

[ADDRESS_511616] biphasic manner. Less than 2 % of the oral dose is recovered 
unchanged in urine. Plasma protein binding was determined at 27 % in humans.
BI 409306 is extensively  metabolized. Compared to CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EM), 
poor metabolizers (PM) had about 2.2 -2.3 and 4.1 
- 5.0- fold higher peak and total exposure.
However, the C maxand AUC 0-∞ values observed in the PM group on the 10 mg and 100 mg 
dose level were still fully contained within the exposure- range observed in the EM group up 
to a dose of 350 mg.
In the multiple rising dose trial s 1289.2 ( U13-1182 ) and 1289.17 ( U13-1303 ), only minor 
accumulation was seen, regardless of the predicted phenoty pe of CYP2C19, with mean 
accumulation ratios for C maxand AUC of 1.02 to 1.41 among the once dail y treatment groups 
evaluated. In both multiple dose trials, also elderl y male and female volunteers (65 years or 
older) were included, who showed slightl y higher exposure compared to the young volunteers 
at the highest tested dose of 100 mg q.d.
While plasma exposure increased slightl y more than dose proportional over the dose range of 
0.5 mg to 350 mg tested in the single rising dose trial, no deviation from dose proportionality  
was noted in the multiple dose trial over the dose range from 25 mg to 100 mg given once 
daily .
A drug -drug interaction with fluvoxamine, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 
induced a 30- fold increase of the total plasma exposure (AUC 0-24) and a 6 -fold increase in 
Cmax of BI  409306. Mainly  non- PMs (10 out of 13 subjects) and onl y [ADDRESS_511617] that in non
-PM, CYP1A2 is involved in BI 409306 
metabolism, in addition but to a lesser extent to CYP2C19, and that in PMs CYP1A2 is the 
major CYP450 isoform involved in the metabolism of BI 409306 (Study 1289_0035) .
BI 409306 enters the CSF as shown in trial 1289.3 ( U12-2165) after single dosing from 25 to 
200 mg. The maximum concentration (C max) of BI 409306 in plasm a was achieved between
0.75 h and 1.25 h after drug administration and between 1.50 h and 2.00 h after drug
administration in CSF. As such, the maximum CSF concentrations were reached 
approximately  0.75 h to 1.25 h after the maximum plasma concentrations a nd increased with 
increasing dose. The dose -adjusted gMean (90% CI ) CSF to plasma ratio of the BI 409306 
Cmaxwas 28.31% (25.42% to 31.53%). After attainment of C max, BI 409306 concentrations 
declined in a monophasic manner in CSF with a similar terminal h alf-life compared to plasma 
(1.28 h to 2.35 h in plasma and 1.24 h to 1.62 h in CSF).

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
This trial is designed to evaluate the ocular safet y, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI 
409306 film coated tablets administered in25mg q.d. or 100 mg q.d. given orally  for 14 day s 
in patients wi th schizophrenia orAlzheimer’s disease , and compar edto age-comparable 
healthy  volunteers.
There are currently  no approved medications indicated for the treatment of cognitive 
impairment in schizophrenia , and currentl yapproved AD treatment is purely  symptomatic. 
Registered s ymptomatic treatment consists of acety lcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE -Is) and 
memantine. AChE -Is in general and donepezil in particular can be currently regarded as gold 
standard for treatment of mild to moderate AD.   As the AD resear ch interest are moving 
toward more effective s ymptomatic treatment options and new compounds with a disease -
modify ing potential, the current focus on a s ymptomatic treatment that proves to be more 
efficacious than the currently  available compounds (AChEI s,memantine) in improving both 
existing cognition deficits and the ability  to better perform activities of daily  living would 
provide a substantial benefit to patients.
Safety  data from f ivephase I studies are available ( U12-
1034; U13- 1182; U12- 2165; U13-
1303 ; c02098989) in healthy  young and healthy  elderly  volunteers, and one study  in patients 
with schizophrenia ( Study  1289.18, c02318916 ). In all sixstudies , the most frequent drug 
related adverse events were visual side effects (such as sensation of flashing lights, altered
colour perception, photophobia/ increased sensitivity  to light or blurred vision) that occurred 
shortly  after dosing of BI [ADDRESS_511618] 
of BI 409306 on ophthalmologic ph ysiology  in patien ts with AD, patients with CI AS, and 
healthy  volunteers.  
Mismatch negativity  (MMN), P1, N1 and P3a, and evoked gamma power are auditory  ERP 
components that have emerged as translational biomarkers with promising applications for 
use in clinical studies to assess drug sensitivity .
Patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease have been shown to have abnormal 
electroencephalographic (EEG) gamma -band responses (GBRs) associated with sensory
(R14-4685; R14-4695; R14- 4678; R14- 4679; R14- 4680) , perceptual (R14- 4681) attentional 
(R14-4682 ), and cognitive control ( R14-4677) processes. Glutamatergic neurotransmission at 
NMDA receptors provides excitatory  regulation of parvalbumin fast- spi[INVESTIGATOR_231301], 
contributing to the generation of gamma oscillations in pyramidal cell networks (R14-4684).

to unattended changes in background stimulation (R14-4688; R14- 4689). Since these 
measures re quire no overt behavioral response and can be elicited even in the absence of 
directed attention (R14-4688 ; R14-4690) , they  are presumed to reflect a predominantly  
automatic or pre -conscious process of detecting a “mismatch” between the deviant stimulus 
and a sensory –memory  trace (R14-4683 ).
Previous studies have demonstrated that MMN, P1, N1 and P3a are each significantly  
correlated with distinct domains of cognitive ( R14-4687) and ps ychosocial functioning ( R14-
4686 ).  
Because of the established link between these ERP components, the glutamatergic s ystem, 
and cognitive deficits in AD and schizophrenia, they  will be measured in healthy  volunteers, 
AD patients and schizophrenia patients to further understand the effect of BI 409306 ( R14-
3419 , R14-3418 , R14-3420 ).
Single dose of 100 mg BI 409306 in Chinese CYP2C19 poor me tabolizers subjects showed a 
rapid and short lasting increase in supi[INVESTIGATOR_72122] 12.9 ± 4.4 bpm.  Further observations 
on this population revealed a BI 409306 plasma concentration dependent increase in supi[INVESTIGATOR_405706] a maximum of 7 -13 bpm (medi an) at high exposure (median C max was

the additional safet y and pharmacokinetic profiles will support further studies to define safet y 
and efficacy  of BI 409 306 in patients with AD and CI AS.

The target structure (PDE9) for the c ompound BI 409306 is widely  distributed in various
tissues and organs but predominantly  localized throughout the specific brain areas
(hippocampus, cortex, olfactory  bulb, striatum, thalamus, hy pothalamus, amy gdala, midbrain,
cerebellum ( R12-
4412, R10 - 5402 ).
The enzymatic action of cy clic nucleotide PDEs is the primary  mechanism for inactivation of
cAMP/cGMP by  [CONTACT_405733]. I nhibition of PDE9 increases the intracellular availability  of
the second messenger cGMP and consequentl y could have a positive effect on several aspects
of cognition, including information processing, attention, memory  and executive functioning.
Based on its mechanism of action and its preclinical profile, including the in vitro, in vivo
pharmacology  data, the data from toxicology  studies in two species as well as the data
obtained in the clinical studies ( U12-1034, U12 -2165 , U13-1182), there is no indication that 
BI 409306 should be regarded as a high risk compound.
Overall, BI 409306 shows a favorable nonclinical safet y profile. There was no genotoxic
potential of BI 409306. The toxicological profile of BI 409306 is characterized by  [CONTACT_405734]. Previous clinical trials found that BI 409306 was well tolerated in y oung and elderl y 
healthy  subjects in single doses of 0.5 to 350 mg and multiple doses up to 100 mg once dail y. 
The mos t frequent drug related adverse events were visual side effects that occurred shortl y 
after dosing and mostl y resolved within 1 hour. All adverse effects generally  were restricted 
to high dose levels and were reversible (U12-1034 ; U13-1182; U12- 2165; U13- 1303). 
Cardiac function will be monitored during the study , along with a 24-hour ambulatory  heart 
rate monitoring ( cf.Flow Chart ).
As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions have to be taken
into consideration when BI 409306 is administered. Other risks are inherent to any  early
clinical trial such as unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory  event. Although rare, a 
potential for drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by  [CONTACT_405735]. Therefore, this study  requires timely  detection, evaluation, and follow -up of 
laboratory  alterations of selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure subjects ´ safet y. 
No studies have been done with BI [ADDRESS_511621] y appropriate action. 
This is an experimental drug at an earl y stage of testing and therefore an individual benefit
cannot be guaranteed. The study  procedures (e.g. ocular assessment s, safety  and suicidality

trial, it can be assumed that the trial results may contribute to better drug development in 
future. 
This study  will explore the 
ophthalmologic changes with respect to the visual acuit y effects
andother neurophy siological changes in order to further investigate the safety , tolerability  
and pharmacokinetics of thedoses of BI 409306 (25 mg and 100 mg) that were already  
established to be within the safet y margin of therapeutic dose.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a multi- center, double -blinded, parallel groups study  in patients with mild 
Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD) and cognitive i mpairment associated with s chizophrenia (CIAS), 
and health y volunteers (HV) . 
Approximately  60 subjects (20 with A D, 20 with CI AS, and 20 age-comparable HV) who 
met the eligibility  criteria will be randomized into either the BI 409306 25mg or 100 mg 
treatment group according to the study  design provided (see Figure 3.1: 1).  Refer to Section
3.3.2 for description of age -comparable healthy  volunteers (e.g. definition of low age group 
and high age group) .

patient/volunteers enter the trial ( Figure 3.1: 1) at Visit 2, are treated for 14 day s with either 
the BI 409306 25mg or 100 mg and are then followed up for an addition al1-2 weeks . 
Patient /volunteer participation is concluded when they  have completed the End-of-Trial 
(EOT) visit at Day 21+ (unless the patient is lost to follow up, informed consent is withdrawn 
or earl y discontinued). For more details about the visit schedule please cf.Flow Chart .
Adverse events that begin during treatmen t with all trial medications ( BI 409306 25mg or 
100 mg ),or in the [ADDRESS_511624] period (REP), will be 
considered “on treatment events”. For more details about the safet y assessment in this trial cf. 
Sections 5.2 and 7.3.3 .
3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
The trial is sponsored b y Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Boehringer Ingelh eim (BI) will appoint a Trial Clinical Monitor (TCM), who is responsible 
for coordinating the activities required to manage the trial in accordance with applicable 
regulations and internal standard operating procedures (SOPs), directing the clinical trial 
team in the preparation, conduct and reporting of the trial, order materials as needed for the 
trial, ensuring appropriate training of the clinical monitor local (CML ), clinical research 
associates (CRAs) and investigators.
Data management and statistical evaluation will be performed b y BI according to BI SOPs.  
For these activities, a Trial Data Manager (TDM) and Trial Statistician (TSTAT) will be 
appointed.
Documents on participating investigators, including their curricula vitae, will be filed in the 
TMF.  
The Investigator Site File (I SF) will be maintained at the sites as required by  [CONTACT_405736]. A cop y of the I SF documents will be kept as an electronic document in BI RDS
according to BI SOPs.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
This randomised, double -blinded , parallel group design was chosen for this study  to observe 
the effects of BI 409306 within the patient groups (AD, CIAS) and health y volunteers for two 
treatments .  Each eligible patient or health y volunteer will be blindly  randomized to either the 
BI 409306 25 mg or 100 mg dose treatment .  The patient or health y volunteer will be 
dispensed three tablets from the study  medication carton assigned.  If randomized to the 25 
mg dose group, they  will be t aking one BI 409306 25 mg and two BI 409306 50 mg matching 
placebo tablet s;or to the 100 mg dose group , one BI 409306 25 mg matching placebo and
two BI 409306 50 mg tablets.
The population/ patient group sizes (20 subjects with 10 per dose group) are in ge neral 
considered sufficient for the exploratory  nature of this study .

[IP_ADDRESS] Removal of individual subjects
An individual patient must be withdrawn from the treatment if:
The patient withdraws consent, without the need to justify  the decision.
The patient needs any invasive procedure such as cataract surgery , laser 
photocoagulation or retinal surgery  during the study  period.
The patient needs any invasive procedure as cardiac catheterism or stent.
The patient becomes pregnant during the trial. Patient will be followed up until birth
or otherwise termin ation of the pregnancy .
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational
product(s), in the clinical judgment of the investigator.
The patient is no longer able to participate for other medical reasons (e.g. surgery ,
AEs, or other diseases).
The patient needs to stop all current antipsy chotic or concomitant ps ychotropic
medications.
The patient’s disease state dramatically  worsens, in clinical judgment of investigator.
The patient experiences clinically  significant loss of visual acuit y and/or any ocular 
symptoms/ signs attributable or not to the study medication, by  [CONTACT_093]’s 
judgment (e.g. acu te loss of vision ≥5 letters, new macular changes such as intra -or 
sub-retinal fluids or haemorrhage, etc.).
The patient exhibits suicidality , in the clinical judgment of the investigator or
according to criteria below:
Any suicidal behavior (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or 
preparatory  acts o r behavior)
Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the C -SSRS (i.e. active suicidal thought (s)
with intent but without specific plan, or active suicidal thought (s)with plan and
intent) .
A patient can be discontinued from treatment after discussion between sponsor and
investigator if eligibility  criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply  with the
protocol (e.g. non -attendance at study  assessments).
Subjects who discontinue participation after signing the informed consent form but prior to
randomization (Visit 2) will be considered screening failures. For screening failure subjects ,
the demographic, AE, concomitant medication and randomization eCRFs in RDC mu st be
completed. The subjects will be identified as screen failures in the randomization eCRF and
no further follow -up is required. SAEs occurring in subjects after having discontinued in the 
study  due to screening failures ,and who did not receive an y stu dy medication ,do not need to 
be reported, unless the investigator considers the SAE related to the screening procedure s.
Subjects who discontinue or withdraw from the study  after randomization (Visit 2) will be
considered as “early discontinuations” and the reason for premature discontinuation must be
recorded in the eCRFs (cf. Section 6.2.3 for earl y discontinuation procedures). The data will

Subjects eligible for the trial will be assigned at random in a 1:1 ratio of 25 and 100 mg dose 
per group at Visit 2 (cf. Section 3.1 ). Details on randomization are provided in Section 7.[ADDRESS_511634] population group assigned (AD 
group, CIAS group, HV/AD low age group, HV/AD high age group, HV/CI AS low age 
group, HV/CIAS high age group). The assigned medication number will be entered in the 
eCRF and the corresponding medication kit should be given to the patient/healthy volunt eer.
Using this procedure, the I nvestigator and study  staff will be blinded to the assignment to 
which the patient was randomized . Note that the medication numbers assigned to the patient
are different from the patient number.
4.1.3 Selection of doses in thetrial
According to the result of previous trials, BI 409306 was well tolerated in young and elderl y
healthy  subjects in single doses of 0.5 to 350 mg and multiple doses up to 100 mg once dail y. 
The doses selected for this trial cover the estimated therapeutic range and include a safet y 
margin ( cf.Section 1.2 ).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Patient /healthy  volunteer will be assigned study  medication and the first dose administered on 
site at Visit 3, Day  1.Other doses may  be administered at home, according to the home visits 
optional schedule as specified in the Flow Chart .  Each patient/healthy  volunteer will be 
administered three tablet s, one from each blister dispensed.  Table 4.1.4: 1 outlines the

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clini cal 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessaril y 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which:
results in death,
is life -threatenin g,
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],
results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity ,
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect,
or
isto be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardize the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
theabove definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have caused death 
if more severe.
Every  occurrence of canc er or exacerbation of an existing cancer must be reported as a 
serious event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the 
occurrence of the cancer.
AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be

above.
The latest list of “Alway s Seri ous AEs” can be found in the RDC system.
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessme nt within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI 
need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_405744]: 
- A n elevation of AST and/or AL T >[ADDRESS_511637] combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_511638] measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
-Marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥[ADDRESS_511639]
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the subjects showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the drug -induced liver injury
(DILI) checklist provided in the I SF. In case of clinical sy mptoms of hepatic injury  
(icterus, unexplained encephalopath y, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the 
investigator should make sure these par ameters are anal ysed, if necessary  in an 
unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the 
procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .
Clinically  significant loss of vision  (assessed by [CONTACT_405745]) base d on investigator’s 
judgment
Clinically  significant change of color vision (assessed by  F-M100) based on 
investigator’s judgment
Marcus Gunn pupil sign
Acute corneal edema
Increase of IOP ≥ 30 mmHg
Retinal vascular occlusion and/or retinal hemorrhage or e dema
Blurred papi[INVESTIGATOR_405715] (papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] -edema)
Intensit y of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without pri or written permission.Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, tem poral relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF  by  [CONTACT_405746]), until individual patient’s End of Trial, all AEs (serious and non- serious), and AESIs .
The REP is defined as [ADDRESS_511640] trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered as on 
treatment (cf.Section 7.3. 3).Events which occurred after the REP will be cons idered as post 
treatment events.
After the individual patient’s E nd of Trial the investigator does not need to activel y monitor 
the patient for AEs but should only  report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the 
investigator may  become aware of through the SAE reporting process, not on eCRF .
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
Sponsor’s (SAE form and specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I SF). The same 
timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available. In specific occasions the 
Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does no t replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without pri or written permission.Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
(e)CRF pages and the BI SAE form, e.g. onset, end date, intensity , treatment requ ired, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug(s). The Investigator 
should determine the causal relationship to the trial medication and an y possible interactions 
between the investigational drug(s) and a Non- Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP) .
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the (e)CRF and SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_737].
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after trial completion must be followed up until they  
have resolved, have been sufficiently characterized, or no further information can be 
obtained.
Pregnancy
In the rare case that a female subject participating in this clinical trial becomes pregnant af ter 
having taken trial medication, the I nvestigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours) the 
drug exposure during pregnancy  (DEDP) to the Sponsor’s ( form and specific contact [CONTACT_405747] I SF). The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clin ical Trials (Part A) 
should be used. 
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trials (Part B). 
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE, 
only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be 
completed. If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy  then the SAE has to be reported 
on the SAE form in addition. 
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B ).

5.2.6 Vital signs
Vital signs (orthostatic measurements of s ystolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate as 
outlined below) will be recorded at the time points and study  visits as described in the Flow 
Chart , including the End of Trial visit. 
Orthostatic measurements:
1) Have the patient lie down for at least 5 minutes
2)Measure blood pressure and pulse rate in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]
3)Have the patient stand and measure blood pressure and pulse rate immediately  after 
the patient stand up
4) Repeat blood pressure and pulse rate measurements after standing 3 minutes
Only  on Day  1, the following additional vital sign assessments need to be performed which 
include ( cf. Flow Chart ):
Pulse rate is to be measured in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_96839] [ADDRESS_511647] -dose (20 ±5 mi n, 30
±5min, 45 ±10 min and 90 ±20 min ). Pulse rate should be taken before the respective 
blood for PK sampling is drawn.
Orthostatic measurements of systolic/diastolic b lood pressure and pulse rate areto be
done at pre-dose ( baseline )and at 70~[ADDRESS_511648] to be avoided. In case of an unexpected disturbance (for example slamming
door) this measurements may  be repeated.
If there is a finding which meets an y withdrawal criterion ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), the subject
should be removed from study  participation. The investigator may  repeat the post -dose pulse
rate assessment at an y other visit under the conditions described for Day 1 if deemed
clinically  necessary  for any  reason.
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings noticed after baseline assessment will be reported as
(S)AEs.
5.2.7 24- hour holter monitoring
Holter monitoring will be performed over a 24 hour period atScreening and repeated a gain 
on Day  3.  Holter data will be recorded using equipment provided and also anal ysed by a 
central ECG vendor.  Holter monitoring procedure is to be initiated after all other laboratory  
related tests are completed.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All subjects are to adhere to visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart . With the exception 
of the Screening visit and End of Trial visit where there is an allowable time window for visit 
scheduling, all other visits starting at Day  -2 or -1 (Baseline) to Day  14must occur on the 
scheduled day.
The following stud y visits : Visits 4 -6 (Day  2-4), Visit 8 (Day  6), Visits 10 -14  (Day  9-12),
may be conducted as home visits in lieu of study  center visits .
In-patient stay  is optional. If feasible for in -patient stay , the following procedures would 
apply : eligible study  participants will be admitted to the study  center in- patient facility  for 
overnight stay s.  All CI AS patients will remain in -patient for the duration of the treatment 
period, starting on Day  -[ADDRESS_511652] times of measurements outside the permitted time windows will be documented. Time
windows are permitted as follows:
General medical/ph ysical examination: at screening ( -3to -[ADDRESS_511653] 
study  day), on Day  -2 or -1(Baseline) , Day  7and at the End of Trial (within [ADDRESS_511654] trial procedure).
  
 
 
 
For planned individual plasma concentration sampling refer to the Flow Chart. While 
these nominal times should be adhered to as closely  as possible, the actual sampling 
times will be recorded and used for determination of pharmacokinetic parameter. In 
the event that a sample time point is not adhered to or missed, subsequent samples 
should be taken based on the time of drug administration.
The designation “before” on study  Day  1 refers to the time period of within 2 hours 
before drug administration (see Flow Chart ), (i.e. study  measurements and 
assessments scheduled to occur “before” have to be performed and completed within 
2 hours prior to drug administration ).
In-patient meal and snacks times may  be ± 1 hour of planned times , if applicable .
Relevant ti me violations will be identified and their handling discussed no later than at the 
Blinded Report Planning Meeting (BRPM).

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a Phase Ic, randomised, parallel -group, d ouble -blind study .
The primary  objective is to investigate the ocular safet y of BI 409306 in patients with 
schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and age -comparable healthy  volunteers following oral 
administration of 25 mg and 100 mg over 14 day s.
The primary  endpoint is n umber (%) of subjects with AEs , coded to the MedDRA -SOC ‘Ey e 
disorders’, as determine d by [CONTACT_405749] .
The secondary  objective s are the evaluation of s ystemic safet y and exploration of the 
pharmacokinetics of BI 409306. 
Secondary  endpoints include the number (%) of subjects with drug -related AE s as determined 
by [CONTACT_405749] . Secondary  endpoints also include the following 
pharmacokinetic parameters of BI 409306:
Cmax, ss -maximum measured concentration of the anal yte in plasma at steady -state 
(Day 14).
tmax,ss -time from dosing to maximum measured concentration of the anal yte in
plasma at stead y-state (Day  14).
The derivation of the PK parameters is given in Appendix Section 10.1 .
No statistical testing will be performed on the primary  and secondary  endpoints.

General t olerability  will be evaluated on the basis of the following investigations: phy sical 
examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12 -lead ECG (electrocardiogram), clinical laboratory  tests 
(haematology , clinical chemistry  and urinal ysis) and adverse events.
7.[ADDRESS_511659] one dose of study  drug will be included in the assessment 
of ocular adverse events . Safety  anal yses will be performed in accordance with BI standards, 
essen tially , tabulations of frequencies/proportions will be display ed.
Ocular adverse events will be those events coded to the SOC ‘Ey e disorders’.
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Affairs 
(MedDRA). The anal ysis of a dverse events will be based on the concept of treatment 
emergent adverse events. All adverse events occurring before drug intake will be assigned to 
“screening”.  All adverse events occurring between drug intake until 7 day s (inclusive) after 
last treatmen t administration will be assigned to “treatment”.  Adverse events occurring after 
this period and prior to End of Trial will be assigned to “post -treatment”.   Adverse events 
occurring after End of Trial will be considered “post -study ”.  Independent of thi s rule, the 
relationship of an adverse event to the stud y drugs treatments will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275]. Adverse event information as reported in the CRFs will be aggregated in a two -
step process. First, multiple recordings (AE occurrences) of the same adverse event will be 
combined into one AE epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (collapsing). The second step will combine all of the AE 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_405719] b y-subject summaries 
(condensing). The evaluation of adverse events will comprise various frequency  tabulations.

For pharmacokinetic analy sis and display s, concentrations will be used in the same format as
reported in the bioanal ytical report. Only  concentrations within the validated concentration
range and actual sampling times will be used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic
parameters. For derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters see Appendix Section 10.1.2.
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic anal yses of the plasma concentration -time data will be

consents. The accuracy  of the data will be verified by  [CONTACT_405752] 8.3.1.
8.4 LISTEDNESS AND EXPED ITED REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
8.4.1 Listedness
To fu lfillthe regulatory  requirements for expedited safet y reporting, the sponsor evaluates 
whether a particular adverse event is "listed", i.e. is a known side effect of the drug or not.
Therefore a unique reference document for the evaluation of listedness n eedsto be provided. 
FortheBI 409306 this is the current version of the I nvestigator’s Brochure ( C02101303 ).
The current version of the IB is to be provided in the I SF. No AEs are classified as listed for 
matching placebo, stud y design, or invasive procedures.
8.4.2 Expedited reporting to health authorities andIECs/IRBs
Expedited reporting of serious adverse events, e.g. suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to health authorities andIECs/I RBs, will be done acco rding to local 
regulatory  requirements.

Patient confidentiality  will be ensured by  [CONTACT_21654].
Treatment data may be given to the patient ’s personal phy sician or to other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient ’s welfare. Data generated as a result of the trial
need to be available for inspection on request b y the participating ph ysicians, the sponsor ’s 
representatives, b y the IRB / IEC and the regulatory  authorities .

10.1 PHARMACOKINETIC METH ODS
10.1.1 Evaluation of Pharmacokinetic Parameter
Individual C max(ss) , tmax(ss) , Ct,Nand C pre,Nvalues will be directly  determined from the plasma 
concentration time profiles of each subject. If the same C max(ss) concentration occurs at 
different time points, t max(ss) is assigned to the first occurrence of C max,ss.
AUC : The area under the curve will be calculated using the linear up/log down algorithm. If 
an anal yte concentration is equal to or higher than the preceding concentration, the linear 
trapezoidal method will be used. If the anal yte concentratio n is smaller than the preceding 
concentration, the logarithmic method will be used.
Linear trapezoidal rule (t 2> t1and C t2Ct1):
The area of the trapezoid between the two data points (t 1, Ct1) and (t 2, Ct2) will be computed 
by:
  t2 t1 1 2 t2-t1 C C t t 0.5 AUC  
Logarithmic trapezoid rule (t 2> t1and C t2< C t1):

10.1.2 Handling of missing data
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma concentration - time profiles
Concentration data identified with NOS (no sample available), NOR (no valid result), NOA 
(not anal yzed),BLQ (below the limit of quantification), and NOP (no peak detectable) will 
be ignored and not replaced by  [CONTACT_405755] (applies also to the lag phase including 
the pre -dose value). Descriptive statistics of concentrations at specific time points will be 
calculated onl y when at least 2/[ADDRESS_511677] concentrations within the validated 
concentration range. The overall sample size to decide whether the “2/3 rule” is fulfilled will 
be based on the total number of samples intended to be dr awn for that time point (i.e. BLQ, 
NOR, NOS, NOA, NOP are included).
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic parameters
In the noncompartmental anal ysis, concentration data identified with NOS, NOR, and NOA 
will not be considered. BLQ and NOP values in the lag phase will be set to zero. The lag 
phase is defined as the period between time zero and the first time point with a concentration 
above the quantification limit. All other BL Q and/or NOP values of the profile will be 
ignored.
If the predose concentration before the first dose is less than or equal to 5% of C maxvalue in 
that subject, the subject’s data without an y adjustments can be included in all 
pharmacokinetic measurements and calculations (i.e. the predose value will not be changed to 
zero). If the predose value is greater than 5% of C max, the subject should be dropped from all 
statistical evaluations. The individual pharmacokinetic parameters can be calculated and 
listed separatel y. 
Every  effort will be made to include all concentration data in an anal ysis. If not possible, a 
case to case decision is required whether the value should only  be excluded from half- life 
estimation or the complete anal ysis.

Section to be changed Section 1.2.4 Pharmacokinetic profile in humans
Description of change Added text:
A drug -drug interaction with fluvoxamine, a 
strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 
induced a 30 -fold increase of the total plasma 
exposure (AUC 0-24) and a 6 -fold increase in 
Cmax of BI 409306. Mainly non -PMs (10 out 
of 13 subjects) and only [ADDRESS_511693] that in non -
PM, CYP1A2 is involved in BI 409306 
metabolism, in addition but to a le sser extent 
to CYP2C19, and that in PMs CYP1A2 is the 
major CYP450 isoform involved in the 
metabolism of BI 409306 (Study 1289_0035).
Rationale for change Include results from clinical DDI stud y 
1289_0035.
Section to be changed Section 3.3 Selection of trial population
Description of change Added text:
A log of all subjects included in the study  (i.e. 
having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site 
irrespective of whether or not they  have been 
treated with investigational product. Re-
screening of not yet randomised patients can 
be allo wed in exceptional cases but should be 
discussed on a case -by-case basis between the 
study site, monitor staff and with the TCM.
Rationale for change For consistency  with other studies in the project 
(Studies 1289.5 and 1289.7) and to provide 
subjects a second chance to participate.

Rationale for change Clinical data (Study  1289_0023) did not show 
evidence for clinicall y significant changes in 
exposure to BI 409306 after CYP3A4 inhibition.  
Recent data (Study  1289_0035) showed that 
CYP1A2 inhibitors do have an effect on BI 
409306.

Section to be changed Section 4.2.1 Rescue medication
Description of change Deleted text:
Use of donepezil is allowed in this study , as a 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) is not expected with 
this drug, commonl y used in AD patient 
population. Specifically , BI 409306 is 
predominantly  metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]2C19 with 
minor contribution from CYP3A4, which are not 
inhibited by  [CONTACT_405761]. Also, BI 409306 is not a 
substrate of the DDI -relevant renal and hepatic 
drug transporters. As such, donepezil is not 
expected to increase exposure to BI 409306.
While potential of donepez il to induce CYP2C19 
or CYP3A4 is not known, but any  potential time 
dependent decrease in BI 409306 exposure will 
be evident based on Day  1 and Day  14 
pharmacokinetics.
Donepezil is metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 and 
CYP2D6. BI 409306 is not expected to inhibit 
CYP 3A4, CYP2D6 or any renal or hepatic 
transporters relevant for drug-drug interaction.

Also, BI 409306 is not an inducer of CYP450 
enzymes. As such, BI 409306 is not expected to 
either increase or decrease donepezil exposure.
Rationale for change No longer relevant per Study  1289_0023.

Section to be changed Section [IP_ADDRESS] Electroencephalograph y (EEG)
Description of change Revised texts: 
Event Related Potentials:
ERPs are a noninvasive method of measuring the 
distinct electrocortical processing stages enabling 
cognition and have become a popular tool in 
neuroscience, and increasingl y in clinical and 
pharmacological investigations. I n particular, the 
MMN and P3a, P1, N1 and MMN component s 
have been widel y applied in the scientific study of 
cognitive d ysfunction, because they  reflect 
attentional and memory  processes and their 
amplitude is they arereduced in both disorders 
and may  be used as biomarkers of Alzheimer´s 
disease and Schizophre nia (R14-3416 ; R14-
3417 ).  These ERPs will be measured in health y 
volunteers, AD patients and schizophrenia 
patients at baseline and Day  13 at peak exposure
time point (20 -90minutes after dosing). In 
addition to MMN and P3a, further ERP 
parameters of interest might also be assessed 
and evaluated .

Method:
EEG data will be continuously  recorded and 
referenced offline. Vertical and horizontal electro -
oculograms, recorded from electrodes above and 
below the left ey e and at the outer canthi of both 
eyes, respectivel y, will be used to correct EEG for 
eye movement and blink artifacts. An electrode 
will be placed at the tip o f the nose for additional 
offline re -referencing positions. All EEG setup 
and data acquisition will take approximately  60 
minutes with breaks. Subjects will be assessed on 
EEG biomarkers in the same sequential order: 
resting state EEG (5 minutes), MMN/P1/N1/P3a
ERPs via Passive A uditory Oddball paradigm 
(20 minutes), GBR Auditory Steady State 
Response paradigm (5 minutes), and then 
resting state EEG (5 minutes) . The study  team 
has extensive experience in the testing of 
thousands of subjects using the above paradigms 
and are thus well -positioned to monitor the 
comfort and tolerability  of the subjects . 
MMN/P1/N1/P3a Passive Auditory Oddball
Paradigm for Assessing ERPs : 
Auditory  stimuli will be presented to participants

be computed on [ADDRESS_511702] -free epochs in each 
block and digitall y filtered using a zero -phase 
shift, 10 -60 Hz bandpass filter (24 dB/octave).  
The averaged epochs across the click trains (0 -
512 msec) will then be transformed into power 
spectra b y means of fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
using a bin width of 1.95 Hz for the assessment of 
evoked power anal yses.
Gamma phase locking will be calculated 
following wavelet transformation of the 
segmented data.  Mean values across the 40 Hz 
frequency layer will be obtained for the each of 
the six 100- ms windows from -100 to 500 ms 
relative to stimulus onset. 
Rationale for change Texts revised to describe actual EEG assessment 
performed.

The advent of  combination  antiretroviral therapy ( cART) has dramatically improved the 
clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)-infected individuals through 
sustained reduction in viral replication. However, it has become clear that cART  alone 
cannot eradicate HIV in infected individuals, likely in part due to the persistence of viral 
reservoirs in peripheral blood and various tissue compartments. Consequently, a major 
thrust of HIV research over the past several years has been to develop  therapeutic 
strategies that can  eliminat e persistent viral reservoirs and  boost host immunity to control  
viral replication upon discontinuation of cART. Therapeutic HIV vaccination is one 
approach that could potentially  achieve  these goals through  vaccine -induced  
improvement in  HIV-specific immune responses and/or by [CONTACT_316830] -
specific CD4+ memory T cells  that harbor latent HIV. A n effective therapeutic vaccine 
could augment immunologic control of HIV infection and potentially obviate the need for 
chronic cART .  
 
The current study is a n exploratory  randomized, 2 -arm (1:1), double -blind, placebo -
controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an HIV -1 multiantigen plasmid DNA 
(HIV-MAG pDNA) vaccine prime in combination with an interleukin -12 plasmid DNA (IL -
12 pDNA) adjuvant  delivered by [CONTACT_316831] a recombinant 
vesicular stomatitis virus vector containing the HIV -1 gag gene (rVSV HIV gag) booster 
vaccine in subjects on cART who started therapy during acute or early HIV infection.  
 
Subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or t he HIV -MAG pDNA (3000 µg) vaccine 
prime and IL -12 pDNA adjuvant (1000 µg) at week 0, 4, 12, and [ADDRESS_389702] er vaccine  (1x107 plaque -forming units)  at week [ADDRESS_389703] be receiving an effective cART regimen , with a CD4 cell count of

the limit of detection for >[ADDRESS_389704] demonstrated that HIV persists in latently 
infected, CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood of virtually all infected individuals 
receiving clinically effective doses of cART .5-[ADDRESS_389705] in 
such individuals in the absence of detectable viremia.8-10 Given that plasma viremia 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_316792] -infected individuals upon cessation of cART, 
regardless of the duration and timing of therapy,11,12 therapeutic strategies aimed at 
destroying persistently infected cells are needed to achieve complete eradication of 
HIV.13 
 
Nearly a decade ago, several clinical studies tested the feasibility of purging latent 
HIV reservoirs in infected individuals receiving cART, with the use of non -specific 
immune -activating agents, such as IL -214 and an anti -CD3 antibody.15 In a non -
randomized study, subjects who received cART plus repeated cycles of intermittent 
IL-2 exhibited a marked diminution of the pool of latently infected, resting CD4+ T 
cells, compared with those recei ving cART alone;14 nonetheless, rapid rebound of 
plasma viremia was observed following interruption of cART.12 More recently, 
valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was tested in humans as a 
potential virus -“purging” agent and was shown in o ne study to diminish the size of 
the latent viral reservoir in infected individuals receiving ART.16 However, 
subsequent studies demonstrated no appreciable reduction of the latent viral 
reservoir following treatment with VPA.17,18  
 
Other therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving eradication are under  investigation. 
These include genetic manipulation of CD4+ T cells (deletion of one of the HIV co -
receptors chemokine receptor type 5)19,[ADDRESS_389706] 
immunity to control HIV replic ation in infected individuals in the absence of cART (a 
“functional” cure).[ADDRESS_389707] 14, 2015  
Page 14 of 72 that control of viral replication could be achieved in the absence of cART, thus, 
mimicking the unique immune response of a small portion of HIV -infected 
individuals who are able to control viral replication in the absence of treatment 
(variably termed elite controllers or long -term non -progressors). Early attempts at 
therapeutic vaccination in HIV -1-infected individuals during the pre -cART era were 
largely unsuccessful; however, these results were not unexpected. The 
introduction of a small amount of exogenous antigen in the form of a therapeutic 
vaccine is unlikely to have a significant immunostimulatory effect in chronically 
infected individuals with  uncontrolled viral replication and ongoing CD4 cell death.  
 
More recent pre -clinical and clinical studies, performed in the cART era, have 
shown improvement of virus -specific immune responses after therapeutic 
vaccination. The induction of broad T -cell responses was observed in a macaque 
simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV) model using  DNA vaccine during suppressive 
cART.[ADDRESS_389708] decrease in their viral load set point at the end of the 
ATI, compared with unvaccinated controls ; however, the decrease did not reach 
the pre -specified level of s ignificance ( P <0.025). In a recently published 
randomized controlled study by [CONTACT_316832],24 subjects receiving the active 
dendritic cell vaccine  (autologous dendritic cells pulsed with autologous heat 
inactivated virus ) had  a significant decrease in viral set point following ATI  
compared to controls .  
 
The studies presented above suggest that therapeutic vaccination could become a 
promising immune -based modality for the treatment of HIV -1 infection, if more 
immunogenic vaccinat ion strategies can be developed. Our trial will utilize a pDNA 
prime/live virus vector boost vaccination strategy that has been shown to elicit a 
strong HIV -specific cellular immune response  in pre -clinical animal models . This 
vaccination regimen has addit ional features designed to maximize immunogenicity.  
For example , the HIV -MAG  pDNA  vaccine prime -IL-12 pDNA adjuvant  will be 
administered to study participants  via an in vivo  EP delivery system. EP is a 
technology in which a transient electric field is applied to enhance the cellular 
uptake of large molecules, such as DNA, and it has been shown to provide an 
efficient method of delivering DNA into the cell.25 Preclinical stud ies in nonhuman 
primates provide compelling evidence that in vivo  EP enhances the potency of the 
HIV-MAG  pDNA /IL-12 pDNA vaccine  (see Section 1.1.2 ). In addition, clinical 
studies indicate that EP delivery of pDNA vaccines is safe and well tolerated .[ADDRESS_389709] 14, 2015

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) rarely causes infections in humans; thus, the use of 
an rVSV vector will minimize any interference of pre -existing immune responses in 
study subjects.  
1.1.1  Description of the Study Agent s 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  prime  
The HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine consists of 2 DNA expression vectors ( HIV-1 
gag/pol  [WLV -151M ] and HIV-1 nef/tat/vif , env [WLV -255M ]) encoding 
multiple HIV -1 clade B antigens ( Figure 1). WLV -151M is a 7,487 -base pair  
(bp) plasmid expressing an HIV-1 clade B ( HIV-1HXb2) Gag/Pol fusion protein 
control led by  [CONTACT_316833]  (HCMV) immediate early promoter 
and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation (polyA) signal. WLV -
255M is a dual -promoter plasmid (8,750 bp) expressing an HIV -1 clade B 
primary isolate (HIV -[ZIP_CODE]) Env gp160 controlled by [CONTACT_316834] (SCMV) promoter and the BGH polyA, and an HIV -1 clade B 
(HIV-1NL43) Nef/Tat/Vif fusion protein utilizing the HCMV promoter and the 
simian virus (SV)40 polyA tail.  
 
IL-12 pDNA adjuvant  
IL-12 pDNA adjuvant is a dual -promoter expression plasmid ( Figure 2) that is 
6,[ADDRESS_389710] s of 2 genes encoding the human IL -12 proteins 
p35 and p40. Each cistron contains one of the two IL -12 subunits, p35 or p40, 
and each subunit is control led by  [CONTACT_316835]. The p35 
subunit is controlled by [CONTACT_316836]/  enhancer and the SV40 poly A 
signal. The p40 subunit is regulated by [CONTACT_316837].

rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine  
The rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine preparation contains an attenuated, 
replication -competent form of the lab-adapted recombinant Indiana serotype 
vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV IN) that expresses the HIV -1 clade  B (strain 
HXB2) Gag protein. The vaccine vector was attenuated by [CONTACT_316838] N gene from the first position (N1) in the genome to the fourth  
position (N4) and truncation of the virus G protein cytoplasmic tail (CT) from 
29 amino acids to 1 amino acid (CT1). The HIV -[ADDRESS_389713] position ( gag1 ) in the rVSV genome adjacent to the virus messenger 
RNA transcription promoter  to maximize Gag protein expression. The vaccine 
vector has been named to reflect the major attenuating mutations, the 
position of the gag gene , and the vector serotype (Fig ure 4 ).

in combination with the human IL-12 pDNA adjuvant delivered by  [CONTACT_316839] 
A good laboratory practice study was carried out to characterize the systemic 
biodistribution and persistence/integration of the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine in 
combination with the human IL -12 pDNA adjuvant  in rats . The formulated 
pDNA vaccine was administered bilaterally (tibialis anterior muscles) in  2 
groups of 22 rats each (11 rats/sex/group)  at a dose of 80 µg (32 µg HIV -1 
gag/pol , 32 µg HIV -1 nef/tat/vif, env , 16 µg IL-12 pDNA )  by [CONTACT_316840] (for a total dose of 160 
µg per animal ). Additionally, a  group of 12 rats (6 rats/sex) was injected with 
saline using the TDS device.  Real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) was used to estimate the levels of the vaccine pDNA in tissue 
specim ens. The presence of the vaccine pDNA in the total DNA (genomic + 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389714] 14, 2015  
Page 19 of 72 plasmid) isolated from the blood and various tissues was examined in this 
study at day [ADDRESS_389715] -vaccination. PCR analyses of tissue 
specimens obtained at day 7 showed that the distribution of the vaccine 
pDNA was largely confined to the tissues at the site of administration (muscle 
and skin)  following IM or IM EP delivery . On day 60,  the vaccine pDNA was 
detected in tissues at the site of administration in both the IM  and IM EP 
delivery  groups at levels of <7,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ µg. Plasmid levels decreased by 
[CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_389716] following 
IM vaccination .29 Mice were inoculated with the rVSV INN4CT9 gag1  vaccine at 
a dose of 108 pfu (10 x the anticipated  clinical dose) ; the rVSV INN4CT9 gag1  
is a closely related but more competent vector than rVSV INN4CT1 gag1 
vector . Vector replication and spread was monitored by [CONTACT_316841] - specific quantitative PCR performed  on tissue, 
blood , and organ samples collected at different time intervals post -injection  
(day 0 -2, 4, 8, and 10) . Results from  these studies showed  that all 
measurable virus replication was localized at the IM injection site  and in the 
major , draining poplilteal lymph node. Viral replication peaked at [ADDRESS_389717]-injection . 
Repeat -dose toxicity study of the HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine with or 
without the human IL -12 pD NA adjuvant and the rVSV HIV gag booster  
vaccine delivered by [CONTACT_316842] a repeat -dose toxicology study , NZW rabbits  were administered  the HIV-
MAG pDNA vaccine as an IM injection at a dose of 4,000 µg with or without 
the human IL-12 pDNA adjuvant (1,000 µg) on day 1, 22, 43, 64, 85 , and 
106. A subgroup  of animals treated with the HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine and 
IL-12 pDNA  adjuvant also  received the rVSV HIV gag booster  vaccine on day 
64 and 85 by [CONTACT_188849].  Animals in all  groups exhibited minor  changes in 
body weight, food consumption, and clinical and anatomical pathology, 
generally with a complete or partial resolution of these changes by [CONTACT_106842]. Based on the se results,  it was concluded that the toxicity 
effects were localized or reflective of an inflammatory response targeted at 
the injection/ EP sites rather than being systemic  in nature .

A good manufacturing practice  toxicology study was performed in 20 rabbits 
using the rVSV HIV gag vaccine.  No AEs were observed either at the 
injection site or systemically following the IM injection  of the rVSV HIV gag 
vaccine at a total dose of 108 pfu. Blood chemistry panels remained normal 
throughout the study and tissue/organ histopathology profiles were 
unremarkable in animals treated with the vaccine, compared with those in the  
placebo  group . 
 
Immunogenicity study of the HIV-MAG  pDNA vaccine  plus a rhesus IL-
[ADDRESS_389719] of EP on the immunogenicity of HIV -MAG  pDNA 
vaccination, a preclinical study was conducted in rhesus macaques  
immunized with an HIV -MAG pDNA  vaccine  (8500 µg)  plus a rhesus IL-12 
pDNA  adjuvant  (1500 µg) by [CONTACT_316844]  
(1200 µg HIV MAG pDNA + 300 µg IL-12 pDNA ).30 Animals immunized by [CONTACT_316845] , compared with those 
immunized by [CONTACT_316828] . At 8 and 22 weeks after the final 
pDNA immunization , there was a 10 - and 45 -fold increase , respectively,  in 
HIV-specific IFN -γ responses , as measured by [CONTACT_122789] -linked 
immunos orbent  spot ( ELISpot ) assay , in the IM EP delivery group , compared 
with the IM delivery group. Th e 10- and [ADDRESS_389720] the 
less immunogenic a ntigens ( nef-tat-vif), resulting in a more balanced immune 
response. In addition, antibody responses against the env antigen showed 
that the IM EP delivery led to an ~2.5-log increase in antibody titer , compared 
with the IM delivery  group.   
 
Immunogenicity  studies  of an rVSV SIV or HIV Gag p55 vaccine in 
rhesus macaques   
The first non-human primate  experiments to evaluate rVSV as a vector 
system for HIV infection  were conducted by [CONTACT_316846]. In 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_316793] y, rhesus macaques (n=7) were immunized with a 
combination of 2 prototypic rVSV vectors expressing an HIV -1–89.6 env 
gp160/VSV -G fusion polypeptide and an SIV Gag p55 protein  or control 
(n=8) .31 In this study, all animals  in the combination vaccine group  remained 
disease -free after the challenge for >[ADDRESS_389721] , all the macaques in 
the control group progressed to AIDS with in an average time of 8 months. 
The protection from AIDS in this study correlated with large differences in 
peak viral loads, low or undetectable viral loads at set  point, and the 
preservation of CD4+ T cells in the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_316794]. 
This encouraging level of post -challenge vaccine efficacy suggested that 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389722] ive AIDS vaccine in 
humans.  
In a separate  unpublished study  conducted by  [CONTACT_316847] , groups of rhesus 
macaques were immunized at weeks 0 and 8 with a highly attenuated 
replication competent rVSV vaccine vector encoding the HIV-1 Gag p55 
protein (rVSV HIV gag) at a dose of 1x107 pfu or a much more virulent 
prototypic rVSV vector (rVSV -HIV gag5) vaccine at a dose of 1x107 pfu by 
[CONTACT_316828] ; the rVSV -HIV gag5 vaccine was previously shown 
by [CONTACT_316848]31 to protect macaques against simian -AIDS in a 
pathogenic SHIV (simian/human immunodeficiency virus) challenge model. 
The data demonstrate that the highly attenuated rVSV vector was as good as 
the more virulent vector in eliciting HIV gag-specific IFN -γ ELI Spot r esponses 
following vaccination  (rVSV INN4CT1gag1 vaccine Profectus Bioscience 
investigator’s brochure).  
 
Immunogenicity stud ies of an IL-12-enhanced SIV-MAG  pDNA vaccine 
plus an rVSV gag boost er vaccine  in rhesus macaques  
In a pre -clinical , immunogenicity study  conducted by [CONTACT_316847] , rhesus 
macaques  were infected with SIV and subsequently placed on cART until 
they reached  suppressive viremia. Macaques were then immunized with an 
IL-12-enhanced SIV -MAG  pDNA vaccine alone  or in combination with a 
heterologous rVSV booster  vaccine. Unimmunized control animals exhibited  
SIV-specific immune responses barely detectable by [CONTACT_316849]. Animals  vaccinated with the IL -12-enhanced SIV-
MAG pDNA vaccine demo nstrated a [ADDRESS_389723], animals

The s afety and adjuvant activity of the IL -12 pDNA alone, or in combination with 
the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine has been evaluated in several phase I clinical 
trials. The HVTN -080 phase I study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of 
the PENNVAX™ -B (gag, pol, env ) vaccine, with or without an IL-12 pDNA 
adjuvant , delivered by [CONTACT_316854] 48 healthy, HIV-negative  adults. 
Participants who receiv ed the gag, pol, env  vaccine alone (group 1), or in 
combination with the IL -12 pDNA adjuvant (group 2 & 3) , developed  both HIV -
specific CD4+  (Figure 7) and CD8+ (Figure 8) T-cell responses. After 3 
vaccinations, 44.4% (4/9) of subjects in group 1  and 80.8% (21/26) of subjects 
in group 2 and 3  responded  (Figure 7 ). The latter response rate was higher than 
after 4 vaccinations with the gag, pol, env  vaccine with the IL-12 adjuvant 
delivered by [CONTACT_316855] ( P=.005; HVTN -070). The response rate for 
the gag, pol, env  vaccine with the IL-12 adjuvant IM+EP was still relatively high 
(53.6% 15/28) [ADDRESS_389736] 14, 2015

Several other ongoing clinical studies evaluating  the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine or 
the rVSV HIV gag vaccine provide interim safety data. The IAVI-B004 study is a 
double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial assessing  the safety and 
immunogenicity of a n HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine with a recombinant IL -12 pDNA 
adjuvant  followed or preceded by a recombinant Ad35 -GRIN/ENV HIV vaccine 
in healthy , HIV-negative participants. Enrollment is complete and vaccination of 
the first participant occurred in December 2011. To date, no safety concerns 
have been reported . Interim data f ollowing the HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine 
revealed a 36% combined response rate, and the full data set is anticipated in 
January 2013. The ongoing ACTG -5281  trial is a placebo -controlled, dose -
escalation study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity study of a cytokine -
enhanced HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine delivered IM or IM  EP injection in individuals 
with chronic HIV infection. Interim data show a 30% response rate . Enrollment is 
complete and vaccination  of the first subject occurred in April 2011 ; no grade [ADDRESS_389738] 14, 2015  
Page 29 of 72 The safety and immunogenicity of the rVSV HIV gag vaccine was evaluated in a 
phase I , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -escalation study  
(HVTN -090) of healthy, HIV -negative adults; the study began  in October 2011. 
Groups of 12 participants received the rVSV HIV gag vaccine (n=10/group) at 5 
nominal dose levels (104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 pfu) or placebo (n=2/group)  
delivered by [CONTACT_316856] 0 and 2 months.  Reactogenicity over 7 days, AEs, 
and viral cultures from  whole blood, urine, saliva, and swabs of oral lesions were 
collected. HIV -1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses to the Gag peptides 
were measured [ADDRESS_389739] -vaccination using an  ICS assay . 
  
As of July 31, 2012, all the vaccinations for this s tudy were completed. As of 
September 11, 2012, the study is still ongoing , and the data are blinded. The 
median age for the  participants is 24 years; 47% of participants are female and 
37% are nonwhite. Local ( Figure 9) and systemic ( Figure 10) reactogenicity was 
self-limited, mild -to-moderate in intensity, and increased with the dose; 
headache was the common AE (52%) followed by [CONTACT_205288]/fatigue (43%).  
 
At the highest dose, 92% of  the subjects reported having systemic symptoms, 
including flu -like syndrome (41%), fever (41%), and moderate chills (33%). Of 
the AEs considered related to the study product and reported by 30% of 
participants, the following were experienced by >1 partici pant: lymphadenopathy 
(3), decreased neutrophil count (3), mouth ulceration (3), other oral lesions (3), 
presyncope (3), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (2). Other AEs considered 
related to the study product and reported by [ADDRESS_389740], myalgia, 
dizziness, hypoesthesia (at the injection site), oropharyngeal pain, and hot 
flushes. No severe reactogenicity, encephalitis, or product -related SAEs were 
reported. Viral -infectiv ity assays were performed on blood, urine, and saliva 
samples at baseline, [ADDRESS_389741] -vaccinations, and any time symptoms of a viral 
syndrome were reported within 1 week of the vaccination. Saliva samples and 
swabs were collected for all oral ulcerations or oral lesions detected during the 
exam. Cultures of VSV tested negative at all the doses and sites analyzed. Low -
frequency, HIV -specific, CD4+ (9%) , and CD8+ (3%) T -cell responses were 
detected post -vaccination in the first 3 -dose levels. At the 107 pfu dose level, 
HIV gag-specific cell -mediated immune responses were detected in 6 of the 10 
(60%)  vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], as measured by [CONTACT_20129] -γ ELISpot or IFN -γ/IL-[ADDRESS_389742]-vaccination. A similar transient lymphopenia (presumably a result of

3.1 Description of the Study Design  
This is a randomized, 2-arm (1:1), double -blind, placebo -controlled study evaluating 
the safety and efficacy  of an HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine prime  with EP  in combination 
with an IL-[ADDRESS_389747] 14, 2015  
Page 33 of 72 Vaccination schedule  
Subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine prime  
(3000 µg) and IL -12 pDNA adjuvant (1000 µg) at week 0, 4, 12, and 36, and the 
rVSV -HIV gag booster vaccine (1x107 pfu) at week 24 and 48  (see Appendix B ).  
 
Each construct ( HIV-1 gag/pol  plasmid or the HIV -1 net/tat/vif , env plasmid) of the 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine (1500 µg each) will be mixed with 1000 µg of the IL -12 
pDNA adjuvant and administered as 2 IM injections, 1 into each deltoid, with EP. The 
rVSV HIV gag  booster  vaccine will be administered as 2 IM injections (1 mL each), 1 
into each deltoid.  
 
Analytical  treatment interruption  
After the week 5 6 visit, all subjects  meeting ATI criteria (described below)  will undergo 
an approximately  16-week ATI to determine if th e vaccination strategy result s in an 
improved immune control of the viral replication , as evidenced by a blunted or absent 
viral rebound in the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , compared with the placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].   
1. ATI will be initiated only in subjects whose CD4 cell count s are >400 cells/  mm3 
and plasma viral levels are below the limit of detection  at week 56. HIV plasma 
viremia and CD4 cell counts will be assessed every [ADDRESS_389748] w ho develops oral lesions that are positive for VSV by [CONTACT_316859] (for at least 4 weeks) . 
4. Individuals taking non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) will 
be advised to switch to a protease inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor -based 
regimen  2 weeks prior to the discontinuation of cART to ensure that the washout 
period of antiretroviral agents is roughly equal.    
5. Subjects whose plasma viral levels are below the limit of detection at week 72 
(the end of the ATI period) may elect not to restart  cART until their viral levels 
rise above the limits of detection.  
6. Subjects will be restart ed on cART if they meet any of the following criteria during 
the ATI:  
 A confirmed >30% decline in baseline CD4 cell count or an absolute CD4 cell 
count <350 cells/ mm3. 
 A sustained (≥4 weeks) HIV RNA level of >50,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/m L.  
 Any HIV-related symptoms.

Page 34 of 72  At least possibly related to the test article, and 
 Definit ely NOT related to a factor other than the test article . 
3.2.2  Secondary Endpoint  
The difference in HIV -1 viral load at the end of the  ATI between the vaccine and 
placebo groups.  
3.2.3  Exploratory Endpoints   
1. The frequency and rate of decay of the infectious HIV reservoir between the 
vaccine and placebo groups .  
2. Change from baseline (mean of entry and pre -entry) to post -vaccination in 
the number of IFN -γ/IL-2-generating  CD8+ and CD4+ T -cells/million PBMCs 
in response to gag, pol, env, nef, tat  and vif, as measured by [CONTACT_270052].  
[ADDRESS_389751] Selection  
Individuals who begin cART during early/acute HIV infection have been shown to 
have a relat ively preserved immune function, with smaller numbers of persistently 
infected CD4+ T cells, compared with those who initiated cART during the chronic 
phase of infection. Limiting enrollment to this pool of subjects  maximizes  safety , and it 
helps to determin e whether therapeutic vaccination can significantly augment HIV -
specific immune responses in a clinically meaningful way.   
4.2 Recruitment Plan  
Subjects will be recruited from known cohorts of individuals  who started treatment 
during acute/early HIV infection. Additional local and national recruitment will be done

5 Justification for Exclusion of Women and Children (Special Populations)   
Exclusion of women:    
 Pregnancy:  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  prime /IL-12 pDNA adjuvant/rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine 
on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_316797] .   
 Breastfeeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing 
infants secondary to the treatment of the mother with the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine  
prime /IL-12 pDNA adjuvant/rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine , breastfeeding should be 
discontinued if the mother is treated with these study agents . 
Exclusion of children : Because there are insufficient data regarding the dosing or AEs 
available in adults for the study agents  to judge the potential risk in children, they are 
excluded from this study.

rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine  
The r VSV-HIV gag booster vaccine is a clear , colorless solution  packaged in 3-mL 
single -use vials.  Each 3 -mL single -use vial contains 1.3 mL (5x106 pfu/mL) of the 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389765]  
Sodium chloride for injection  (USP 0.9% ) will be used as a control substance for the  
placebo group. The volume of sodium chloride  administered will be the same as that 
for the study vaccine compon ents.   
Dosing and administration  
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine prime will be administered at a dose of 3000 µg (1500 µg  
of the HIV -1 gag/pol  plasmid and 1500 µg  of the HIV -1 net/tat/vif , env plasmid)  at 
week 0, 4, 12, and 36. Each construct of HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine (1500 µg each) will 
be mixed  and combined  with 1000 µg  of the IL -12 pDNA adjuvant. The resulting 
mixture will be divided  into 2 IM injections  and administered as  0.75 mL IM injection in 
the left deltoid and 0.75 mL IM injection in the right deltoid with EP using the TDS 
device.  
IL-12 pDNA adjuvant will be mixed with the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine prime, as noted 
above, and administered at a dose of 1000 µg ([ADDRESS_389766] ion) at week 
0, 4, 12, and 36.  
rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine --The total dose , 1x107 pfu, will be  administered as 1 
mL (5x106 pfu) IM injection in the left deltoid and 1 mL (5x106 pfu) IM injection in the 
right deltoid at week 24 and 48.  
Placebo for the IL-12 pDNA adjuvant and HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine ( sodium chloride 
for injection , USP 0.9%) will be administered as 0.75 mL IM injection in the left deltoid 
and 0.75 mL IM injection in the right deltoid at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 36 with EP using 
the TDS device.  
Placebo  for the rVSV HIV gag (sodium chloride for injection , USP 0.9%) will be 
administered as 1 mL IM injection in the left deltoid and 1 mL IM injection in the right 
deltoid at week 24 and 48.  
 
Dose Adjustments/Modifications/Delays  
Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be delayed. 
The factors to consider when such a decision needs to be made include , but are not 
limited to , the following:  
 Live attenuated vaccines , other than influenza vaccine , received within 30 days 
prior to the study  vaccination (s). 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389767] 14, 2015  
Page 40 of 72  Influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated (e .g., 
pneumococcal  vaccines ) received within 14 days prior to the study  
vaccination (s). 
 Allergy treatm ent with antigen injections received within 30 days prior to the 
study vaccination(s).  
 Abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms prior to the study vaccinations that may 
interfere with  assessment of the vaccine reaction.  
In order to avoid vaccination delay s and missed vaccinations, participants who pl an to 
receive licensed vaccines or allergy treatments  will be counseled to schedule receipt 
of these substances outside the intervals indicated above, when ever possible. 
Because the effects of these substances on the safety and immunogenicity 
assessments and their interactions with the study vaccines are unknown, the 
substances should also be avoided in the [ADDRESS_389768] pDNA vaccination, i f a participant misses a 
vaccina tion and the 14-day window period for the vaccination has passed, that 
vaccination cannot be administered . The participant should be asked to continue with 
the remaining study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination schedule for 
the next vacc ination unless there are circumstances that require further delay or 
permanent discontinuation of the vaccination.   
 
If a participant receives only 1 of the 2 scheduled injections  (i.e. half  of the vaccine/  
placebo  dose ), the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_316803].

8 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
8.1 Clinical Evaluations  
 Medical history and physical examination  
 Deltoid skinfold measurement: The skin -pi[INVESTIGATOR_316805] 
(medial deltoid muscles). This measurement will be used to determine the depth of 
the injection for each eligible subject to ensure IM administration of the vaccine/  
placebo prior to the first vaccination. The skin -thickness range and corresponding 
depth settings on the TDS -IM are described in the TDS-IM: Instructions for Use  
Manual .   
 Phlebotomy : Blood will be collected for routine  serologic,  hematologic , and clinical 
chemistry evaluations  as described in Section  7.  
 Oral swabs : Subjects who develop oral lesions  up to [ADDRESS_389785] -vaccination with 
rVSV/placebo  will have the lesions  tested  for the presence of VSV shedding via 
RT/PCR analysis and in vitro virus culture via the rVSV viral infectivity assay. Vero 
cell cultures will be incubated with participant samples and examined by 
[CONTACT_10840]-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389786] sample(s) to verify the prese nce of VSV. 
All viral infectivity assays will be performed by [CONTACT_316826].  
 Assessment of reactogenicity : For all participants, reactogenicity  assessments 
will be  performed at baseline prior to any study vaccinations and subsequently 
after each vaccination. All reactogenicity symptoms will be  followed until resolution 
and graded according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the 
Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December 2004 
(Clarification Augus t 2009) . 
The reactogenicity assessment period is 3 full days following each HIV -MAG pDNA 
vaccine/placebo injection and 7 full days following the rVSV- HIV gag vaccine/  
placebo injection according to  the schedule shown in Table [ADDRESS_389787] -vaccination symptom log /diary 
card (see Appendix D ) and to contact [CONTACT_316863]. 
Participants will also be  instructed to contact [CONTACT_316864]. In general, a ny 
participant who self -repor ts a post -vaccin ation reaction greater than moderate  will 
be evaluated  by a clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is 
improving and/or has completely resolved.

8.2 Research  Evaluations  
Leukapheresis:  Will be performed for research studies including, but not limited to, 
measurements of  the  frequency of CD4+ T cells carrying replication -competent HIV 
by [CONTACT_316865]. These studies will determine the rate of decay of the 
CD4+ T-cell reservoir. If leuk apheresis cannot be performed for technical reasons 
(e.g. poor venous access ) [ADDRESS_389788] of the vaccinations on the HIV 
pathogenesis may include :

9 Potential Risks and Benefits  
9.1 Potential Risks  
General risks associated with vaccination/ DNA vaccination  
Possible risks associated with vaccines include fever, chills, rash, arthalgias/myalgias , 
nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue , and anaphylaxis . The theoretical risks of DNA 
vaccination could include the possible integration of plasmid DNA into the host  
genome, resulting in mutations , problems with DNA replication , triggering of 
autoimmune responses, and activation of cancer -causing genes.  To date, there is no 
clear evidence  from numerous clinical trials  for integration of plasmid DNA into the 
host genome triggering autoimmune disease/neoplastic disease.   
 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine   
The HIV-MAG  pDNA vaccine ha s been administered to approximately 150 individuals 
to date , and it appear s to be well tolerated.  The vaccine plasmids HIV -1 gag/pol and 
HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env are formulated in 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , thus, there is a risk of 
allergic reactio n from bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , including nausea, vomiting, chills, rash, urticaria, 
angioedema, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis.  Significant AEs,  including cardiac arrest 
and death , have occurred following intravenous delivery of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. In most 
cases, th e events o ccurred following  use of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_142245] a dose of 1.6 mg/kg. In the 
current study , bupi[INVESTIGATOR_316806] a dose of 2.5 mg/m L (maximum 
2 mL or 5 mg). A 7 0-kg pe rson would receive a dose of 0.07  mg/kg per dose . 
Participants with a history of  allergic reaction to amide -type local anesthetics 
(bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], lidocaine, mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], etidocaine, prilocaine) will be excluded  from the 
study .

Page 48 of 72 The IL -12 plasmid adjuvant is also formulated in 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], so the risks 
associated with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_316807] (see HIV -MAG 
pDNA above).  
In addition, it is possible that administration of the IL -[ADDRESS_389791] for the presen ce of IL -12 neutralizing antibody following  
administration of the IL -12 pDNA (1,000 µg or placebo). Results showed that [ADDRESS_389792] tested positive for IL -12 neutralizing antibodies following vaccination (49 
NU/mL), but the subject also had a high levels (39 NU/mL) at baseline. Another 
subject was po sitive for IL -12 neutralizing antibodies at baseline (31 NU/mL) followed 
by [CONTACT_316866] -vaccination levels (9 NU/mL).   
 
Electroporation  
EP has been associated with transient muscle contractions and injection -site 
discomfort , such as pain, soreness, bruising,  redness, swelling, itching, and stiffness 
of the upper arm . The procedure also carries the theoretical  risks of electrical injury or  
infection at the injection site, disruption of the function of the implanted electronic 
medical devices (e.g., pa cemaker, implantable cardi ac defibrillator), or the 
exacerbation of cardiac arrhythmias. Participants with a history of clinically significant 
cardiac arrhythmia (excluding sinus arrhythmia) , pacemakers, implantable cardi ac 
defibrillator,  or certain metal implants will be excluded.  Electroporation with the TDS 
device has been used in about [ADDRESS_389793] been largely 
limited to acute discomfort during  the procedure application , and transient injection -
site soreness of mild –to-moderate severity for up to  1 week following administration.  
 
rVSV HIV gag  
Results from a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -escalation study of  
60 healthy volunteers ( HVTN 090 ) showed that l ocal ( Figure 9) and systemic ( Figure 
10) reactogenicity was self -limited, mild -to-moderate in intensity, and increase d with 
dose; headache was the common AE (52%) followed by [CONTACT_205288]/fatigue (43%). At the 
highest dose  (108 pfu), 92% of the subjects reported having systemic symptoms, 
including flu -like syndrome (41%), fever (41%), and moderate chills (33%). Of the AEs 
considered related to the study product and reported by 30% of participants, the 
following were experienced by >1 participant: lymphadenopathy (3), decreased 
neutrophil count (3), mouth ulceration (3), other oral lesions (3), presyncope (3), and 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_316808] (2). Other AEs considered related to the study product 
and reported by [ADDRESS_389794], myalgia, dizziness, hypoesthesia (at the injection site), 
oropharyngea l pain, and hot flushes. No severe reactogenicity, encephalitis, or 
product -related SAEs were reported.  
 
VSV infection in humans is rare, but it can occur when animal handlers and 
veterinarians come in close contact [CONTACT_316867]-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389795] bites. Human infection with VSV can either be 
asymptomatic , or it may lead to disease symptoms, which include myalgia, headache, 
fatigue, oral ulcers , and fever that resolve in 3 –5 days without complications. Because 
the vaccine candidate is a live, replication competent vector, there is a theoretical risk 
of human disease , including neurologic manifestations . The vaccine vector was 
specifically attenuated to eliminate neurovirulence , which has been tested  in sensitive 
animal models  (refer to the investigator’s brochure for more information on 
neurovirulence testing) . Furthermore, no evidence of encephalitis or other neurologic 
events was observed following administration of the vaccine  in subjects participating 
in the HVTN  [ADDRESS_389796] a neurological/neuropsychiatric disorder that could be 
confused with reactions to the VSV HIV gag vaccine , or could interfere with the 
assessment of safety .  
 
There is also a hypothetical risk of eliciting autoimmune responses in vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. This risk is based on the identification of a peptide octamer and other 
shorter peptides in the Indiana serotype VSV (VSV IN) N protein that are very similar in 
sequence to peptides found in Ro60kD, which bind the anti -Ro/SSA antibodies found 
in sera of subjects  with systemi c lupus erythematosis (SLE) .[ADDRESS_389797] criteria for restarting cART, it is extremely 
unlikely that the ATI will lead to the development of any opportunistic infections or 
AIDS -defining conditions.  
 
Leukapheresis  
The potential  risks associated with  leukapheresis  include lightheadedness, dizziness , 
possible fainting,  tingling around the mo uth and in the fingers and toes,  nausea, chills, 
vomiting , mild mu scle cramps,  loss of <[ADDRESS_389798] 10 years at the NIH.   
 
Phlebotomy  
This may be associated with discomfort, bruising, local hematoma formation and, on 
rare occasions, infections , lightheadedness,  and fainting. The amount of blood drawn 
for research purposes will be within the limits allowed for adult subjects by [CONTACT_316868] (Medical Administrative Policy 95 -9: Guidelines for Limits of Blood Drawn for 
Research Purposes in the Clinical Center: 
http://internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/list_policies.asp?index=med_chrono ). 
 
HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_316809], or a faster progression to AIDS. HLA

Medical rec ords containing this information are maintained in a secure place.  
9.2 Potential Benefits  
Improvement of HIV-specific immune control from the vaccine regimen is a potential 
benefit for subjects  randomized to the vaccine arm.   
10  Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens or Data  
 Intended use: Stored blood s amples and data collected under this protocol may be 
used to study the effect of the HIV -MAG pDNA vaccine prime in combination with the 
IL-12 pDNA adjuvant and the rVSV HIV gag booster vaccine on  the v irologic and 
immunologic parameters listed in Section 8.2. Samples may also be used to study 
other aspects of the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection  or measure serum levels of 
antiretroviral agents during ATI .  
 Storage: Access to stored samples will be limited using a locked room or a locked 
freezer. Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_473]. 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389799] 
access to the samples and data.  
 Tracking: Samples  will be tracked utilizing the repository operated by [CONTACT_316869], Inc. Data will be stored and maintained in the NIAID CRIMSON database.  
 Disposition at the completion of the protocol : At the completion of the protocol 
(termination), sampl es and data will either be destroyed, or after IRB approval, 
transferred to another existing protocol.   
 Report ing the loss or destruction of samples/specimens/data to the IRB:  
 Any loss or unanticipated destruction of the samples or data (for example, due to 
freezer malfunction) that meets the NIH Intramural protocol deviation  definition or 
results in a deviation  that compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected 
for the study will be reported to the NIAID IRB.   
 Additionally, subjects may decide at any point not to have their samples stored. In 
this case, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_316812]. This decision will affect the 
subject’ s participation in this protocol , but it may not affect participation in other 
protocols at the NIH.  
11 Remuneration Plan for Subjects  
Subjects will receive financial compensation for leukapheresis according to the NIH  
Clinical Cente r volunteer guidelines: $100 for a 2 -pass leukapheresis procedure or $[ADDRESS_389800], information regarding AEs will be elicited by 
[CONTACT_245151] , and it will be:  
 Immediately documented in the electronic database  and medical record . 
 Reported as outlined below (e.g., IND spon sor, IRB, Food and Drug 
Administration  [FDA]). 
12.[ADDRESS_389801], 
including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the 
resea rch, whether or not considered related to the research.  
 
Adverse reaction   
An adverse reaction (AR) is an AE  that is caused by [CONTACT_4523] (drug 
or biologic).  
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389802] 14, 2015  
Page 52 of 72  
Suspected adverse reaction  
A suspected AR (SAR) is a n AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational agent caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about the causality than an AR,  which implies a 
high degree of certainty.  
 
Serious adverse event  
An SAE  is an AE that results in one or more of the following  outcomes:  
 Death.  
 A life -threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life) event.  
 An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 A medically important event .* 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical 
events that may not  be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but they ma y jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
 
Unexpected adverse event  
An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in  the investigator’s brochure  or package  
insert (for marketed pr oducts) , or it is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed. It is the responsibility of the IND spon sor to make this 
determination.  
 
Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction  
A serious and unexpected suspected AR ( S[LOCATION_003]R ) is a SAR that is both  serious 
and unexpected.   
 
Unanticipated problem  
An unanticipated problem (UP) is an event, incident, experience, or outcome that 
is—  
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to — 
a. The research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; investigator’s brochure, or other 
study documents; and  
b. The characteristics of the subject population being studied; and  
2. Possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research ; and  
3. Places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological , economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389803] 14, 2015  
Page 53 of 72 recognized ( per the IND sponsor, an AE with a serious outcome will be 
considered increased risk) . 
 
Unantici pated problem that is not an adverse event  
An unanticipated problem that is not an AE is incident, experience , or outcome that 
is not associated with an AE, which meets the 3 criteria of a UP. Examples include 
breaches of confidentiality, accidental destr uction of study records, and  
unaccounted -for study drug.  
 
Protocol Deviation  
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved study procedures in 
a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non -serious 
and further characterized as : 
 
1. Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the 
protocol.  
2. Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented.  
3. Those that are discovered after they occur  
 
 
Serious Protocol Deviation:  A deviation that meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  
 
 
Non-compliance: The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB 
requirements, or regulatory requirements fo r the protection of human subjects. 
Non-compliance is further characterized as : 
1. Serious: Non -compliance that  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH -HRPP  
d. Invalidates  the study data  
2. Continuing: Non -compliance that is recurring  
3. Minor: Non -compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.  
Protocol specified events  
Protocol specified events  are AEs specified in the protocol that the principal 
investigator , IND sponsor, or medical monitor would like to review in real time 
rather than weeks or months later , when they would otherwise appear in various 
line listings. These events may or may not also be SAEs.  
12.3 Investigator Assessment of Adverse Events  
If a diagnosis is clinically evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis 
rather than the individual signs and symptoms or lab abnormalities will be recorded 
as the AE.  
 
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389804] to Seriousness  (criteria listed 
above), Severity (intensity or grade), and Causality  (relationship to study agent 
and relationship to research) according to the following guidelines.  
12.3.1  Severity  
The principal i nvestigator will grade the severity of each AE according to the 
Division of Aids Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events Version 1.0, December, 2004 , (Clarification  August 20) which can be 
found at:   
http://rsc.techres.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/Table_for_Gradin
g_Se verity_of_Adult_Pediatric_Adverse_Events.pdf   
  
Subjective reactogenicity symptoms (such as malaise, fatigue, injection sit e 
pain, headache, chills ) will not be given a grade [ADDRESS_389805] for 
>3 days.  
 
Some grade 1 lab parameters on the DAIDS toxicity table (fibrinogen, low 
calcium levels , high fasting glucose, low phosphate  levels , low potassium levels , 
low sodium levels , elevated uric acid levels [ males only ]) fall within the NIH l ab 
reference range fo r normal values.  These normal values will not be reported as 
grade 1 AEs. The grade 1 values for these tests will be reported as follows:  
 Fibrinogen: 100 –176 mg/dL . 
 Phosphate (low): There is no grade 1 reportable value .  
 Sodium (low): 130 –134 mmol/L . 
 Potas sium (low): 3.0 –3.2 mmol/L . 
 Calcium (low): 1.95 –2.04 mmol/L . 
 Glucose (high, fasting): 116 –125 mg/dL . 
 Uric Acid (males): 8.7 –10.0 mg/dL .  
12.3.2  Causality    
Causality (likelihood that the event is related to the study agent) will be  
assessed considering the factors listed under the following categories:  
 
Definitely related     
 Reasonable temporal relationship.  
 Follows a known response pattern.  
 Clear evidence to sugge st a causal relationship . 
 There is no alternative etiology.  
 
Probably  related   
 Reasonable temporal relationship.  
HIV-MAG pDNA vaccine  version 6.[ADDRESS_389806] 14, 2015  
Page 55 of 72  Follows a suspected response pattern (based on similar agents).  
 No evidence of a more likely alternative etiology.  
 
Possibly related   
 Reasonable tem poral relationship . 
 Little evidence for a more likely alternativ e etiology.  
 
Unlikely related   
 Does not have a reasonable temporal relationship .  
OR 
 Good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology.  
 
Not related   
 Does not have a temporal relationship .          
OR 
 Definitely due to an alternative etiology . 
 
Note:    
Other factors (e.g., dechallenge, rechallenge) should also be considered for 
each causality category when appropriate. Causality assessment is based on 
available information at the time of the assessment of the AE. The investigator 
may revise the causalit y assessment as additional information becomes 
available.  
12.4 Investigator Reporting Responsibilities to the  Sponsor  
12.4.1  Adverse Events  
Line listings , frequency tables, and other summary AE data will be submitted to 
the IND sponsor per the Safety Review and Communications Plan (SRCP – see 
below), or as needed for periodic safety assessments, review of IND annual 
reports, review of IND safety reports, and preparation of final study reports.  
12.4.2  Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs (whether or not they are also UPs) must be reported on the SAE/UP report  
form and sent  to the sponsor Clinical Safety Office (CSO) by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail

Pregnancy outcome data (e.g., delivery outcome, spontaneous or elective 
termination of the pregnancy) will be reported to the CSO within 3 business days 
of the site awareness on a protocol -specified form.  In the event of pregnancy, 
the following steps will be taken:  
 Discontinuation of the study agent s. 
 Unblind per the unblinding section of the protocol . 
 Withdraw from the study but co ntinue follow ing for safety . 
 Report to safety oversight committee ( Data and Safety  Monitoring Board 
[DSMB ]) and the IRB. 
 Advise research subject to notify the obstetrician of study agent exposure .

Page 57 of 72 [IP_ADDRESS].  Waiver of Reporting Anticipated Protocol Deviations, Expected 
UP nonAEs and Deaths to the NIAID IRB  
 
Anticipated deviations in the conduct of the protocol will not be reported 
to the IRB unless they occur at a rate greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_58860]. Expected adverse events will not be reported to the IRB 
unless  they occur at a rate greater than that known to occur in HIV(+) 
population . If the rate of these events exceeds the rate expected by [CONTACT_58860], the events will be classified and reported as though they are 
unanticipated problems. Deaths related to th e natural history of HIV (+) 
population will be reported at the time of continuing review.  
12.5.2  Annual Reporting to the NIAID IRB   
The following items will be reported to the NIAID IRB in summary at the time of 
continuing review:  
 Serious and non -serious unantic ipated problems  
 Expected serious adverse events that are possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the research  
 Serious adverse events that are not related to the research  
 All adverse events, except expected AEs and deaths granted a waiver 
of reporting .  
 Serious and Non -Serious Protocol deviations  
 Serious, continuing, and minor non -compliance  
 Any trends or events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_316813]  
12.[ADDRESS_389813] s (i.e., after the first vaccination ) are 
followed until the final outcome is  known or until the end of the study follow -up 
period.  
 
SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_1008] -up period are followed until the 
final outcome is known. If it is not possible to obtain a final outcome for an SAE 
(e.g., the subject is lost to follow  up), the reason a final outcome could not be 
obtained will be recorded by [CONTACT_316870]/UP report form .  
 
SAEs that occur afte r study completion ( month  24) that are reported to and are 
assessed by [CONTACT_1010], probably, or definitely related must be 
reported to the CSO, as described above.  
12.7 Sponsor’s Reporting Responsibilities  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs as defined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.[ADDRESS_389814] 14, 2015  
Page 58 of 72  
The IND sponsor will also submit an IND annual report of the progress of the 
investigation t o the FDA as defined in 21 CFR 312.33.  
12.8 Halting Criteria for the Protocol  
Halting the study requires immediate discontinuation of the study agents  
administered for all subjects and suspension of enrollment until a decision is made 
about whether or not to  continue study agent administration.   
  
The halting criteria (as determined by [CONTACT_26848]  [INVESTIGATOR_316814]) for this study include:  
 Any SAE or grade  4 AE that is  possibly, probably, definitely related  to the study 
agent; OR  
 Any death; OR  
 Any safety issue that the study principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_316815].  
 
Any related AE that is ≥ grade 3 (not including transient, subjective reactogenicity 
symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, injection site pain, he adache, chills ) will be 
review ed within 48 hours of site awareness, by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_316816] , to consider the need for halting the protocol . 
 
The IRB, the IND sponsor, DSMB, or the FDA may halt the study at any time due 
to safety concerns.  
 
Halting is carried out by [CONTACT_316871]  (or designee if 
unavailable) within 24 hours of the decision to halt the trial, regardless o f the party 
initiating the halt, whether the halt is due to the criteria defined above or another 
issue.  
12.8.1  Reporting of Study Halting  
If the study is halted , a description of the event(s) or safety issue must be 
reported by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_389815] 14, 2015  
Page 59 of 72 The decision to suspend administration of the study agent(s) for a single subject ,  
or for all the subjects in the study , requires discontinuation of the study agent 
administrated f or the study subject(s)  until a decision is made whether or not to 
continue study agent administration.   
 
The pausing criteria for a single subject or for all the subjects in this study include:  
 
 A subject  or 3 subjects experience an SAE or grade  3 or greater AE  (not 
including transient, subjective reactogenicity symptoms such as malaise, 
fatigue, injection site pain, headache, chills, or total bilirubin in subjects taking 
atazanavir )  that is unexpected (as determined by [CONTACT_316872]) and is 
possibly, probabl y, or definitely  related to the study agent;  
OR 
 2 subjects experience grade  4 local or sys temic reactogenicity symptom(s)  or 
AE that is considered to be related to the study vaccination.  
            OR 
 Any safety issue that the site investigator determines should pause 
administration of the study agent to a single subject or to all the subjects in the 
study.  
 The IND sponso r, in collaboration with the principal investigator , may also 
pause for an individual subject or the entire group if a safety concern is identified 
during routine aggregate data analysis.  
12.9.[ADDRESS_389816] or Group  
If a pausing requirement is met, a description of the AE(s) or safety issue must 
be reported by [CONTACT_458]  [INVESTIGATOR_316817] e -mail within [ADDRESS_389817] or Group  
The IND sponsor in collaboration with the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the 
relevant DSMB  will determine if it is safe to resume administration of the study 
agents to the subject/group. The IND sponsor will notify the principal 
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_215716]. The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_316818].  
12.[ADDRESS_389818] will be withdrawn for any of the following:  
 An individual subject’s decision.  
(The investigator will attempt to determine the reason for the subj ect’s decision ,  
and will strongly suggest a follow -up plan to help ensure the subject safely

12.12.2  Sponsor Medical Monitor  
A medical monitor, representing the IND spon sor (OCRPRO ), has been 
appointed for the safety oversight in this clinical study. The sponsor medical 
monitor will be  responsible for performing safety assessments as outlined in the 
SRCP.

As per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) 5.[ADDRESS_389822] to the NIAID/ OCRPRO  will visit the clinical research site to 
monitor aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate regulations and 
the approved protocol. The objectives of a monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the 
existence of signed informed consent documents and documentation of the 
informed consent form process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt 
and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all 
SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted information CRIMSON data abstracts  with 
individual subjects’ re cords and source documents (subjects’ charts, laboratory 
analyses and test results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other 
relevant original subject information); and 4) to help ensure that investigators are in 
compliance with the protoco l. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site 
regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research 
Protections  [OHRP ]), FDA,  and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP) are being

Page 62 of 72 followed. During the monitoring visits, the inves tigator (and/or designee) and other 
study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.  
 
The investigator (and/or designee) will make the study documents (e.g., consent 
forms, CRIMSON data abstracts , and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316820], the FDA, the site monitors, and the NIAID 
staff for confirmation of the study data.  
 
A specific protocol monitoring plan will be discussed with the  principal investigat or 
and s tudy staff prior to enrollment. The plan will outline the frequency of the 
monitoring visits based on factors such as the study enrollment, data collection 
status , and regulatory obligations.   
13.1.1  Study Blinding and  Unblinding  
Study participants  and site staff (except for the NIH pharmacists) will be blinded 
to the participant treatment arm assignments (e .g., active vaccine or control). 
Any discussion about the study product assignment between the pharmacy staff 
and any other protocol  staff is pro hibited. The DSMB  members also are 
unblinded to the treatment assignment for the  review of trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prior to study completion, the participant will 
be told he or she must wait until the all the participants are unb linded to learn 
about his or her treatment assignment.  
Emergency unblinding decisions will be made by [CONTACT_458]. if 
time permits, the sponsor medical monitor will be consulted before emergency 
unblinding occurs.  
[ADDRESS_389824] comply 
with regulations set forth in the NIH’s Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant 
DNA Molecules . Information about the study must be submitted to site Institutional 
Biosafety Committees and must be approved before participants are enrolled in the 
study. IBC review and approval must be documented by [CONTACT_316873].  
The NIH guidelines also require that human gene transfer trials conducted at or 
sponsored by [CONTACT_316874].  
The study team and DAIDS will ensure that reporting requirements to the Recombinant 
DNA Advisory Committee, as outlined in Appendix M -I-C-1.Initiation of the Clinical  
Investigation , Appendix M -I-C-3.Annual Reports , and Appendix M -I-C-4.Safety Reporting 
are satisfied per the NIH guidelines.

with an AE of probability P. For instance, P=.05 corresponds to an AE that occurs 
in about 5% of participants; the probability of this AE being observed for at l east 1 
of the 15 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_316821] 54%. This means that we cannot be 
confident of observing relatively rare events with a probability of 5% or less. On the 
other hand, the probability of observing at least 1 vaccine participant with an AE  of 
probability 15% is approximately 91%. This means that if we do not observe 
anyone with a given type of AE, we can be relatively confident that it occurs in 
fewer than 15% of the population.

The p ower for a comparison of the [ADDRESS_389827] to a given AE is low unless 
the event probability is high in the vaccine arm and very low in the placebo arm. For 
example, if the AE probabilities in the 2 arms are .55 and .05, then power using 
Fisher’s exact test is approximately 82%.  
 
To compute the power for the secondary outcome  of difference in plasma viremia at  
the end of the ATI phase of the study , we needed to estimate the standard deviation 
of rebound plasma viremia  in log [ADDRESS_389828] deviation of close to 1 in the ART treatment arms, though their 
measure of rebound plasma viremia was determined following a longer period of 
time (36 weeks) f rom the treatment interruption. To be  conservative, we decided to 
adopt the larger standard deviation of 1. Although the Wilcoxon rank sum test will 
be used to compare the [ADDRESS_389829] (the asymptotic relativ e efficiency is 
approximately 95%). Therefore, we approximated power for the Wilcoxon test by 
[CONTACT_316875] t -test. The p ower based on a 2-sample t -test with a 2-tailed alpha of .05 
and a total sample size of 30 is approximately 91% to detect a 1.25 log 10 reduction 
in the rebound plasma viremia .

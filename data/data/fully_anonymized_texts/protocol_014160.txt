3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
GVHD  is a frequent  and at times  unpredictable  severe  complication  of HSCT1-3, and is a 
leading  cause  of TRM  following  HSCT1,4. GVHD  can be characterized  as acute  or chronic,  
based  on the clinical  manifestation5. Acute  GVHD  damages  the skin, gut,  and/or   liver. 
Nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhea,  bloody  stool and/or  jaundice  are commonly  
present.  While  calcineurin -inhibitor  based  GVHD  prophylaxis  has decreased  the incidence  
and mortality  associated  with aGVHD,  it provides  inadequate  protection  since  this disease  
commonly  affects  > 50% of HSCT  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]6. Risk factors  associated  with aGVHD  include  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_728542]-mismatched  HSCT  and/or  HLA-mismatched  donor,  peripheral  blood  stem  
cell graft and myeloablative  conditioning7,8. The incorporation  of an additional  prophylactic  
agent  could  potentially  decrease  the incidence  of GVHD  development  and ameliorate  
transplant  complications  including  TRM.  However,  in RI and NMA  conditioning  
transplantation,  critically  dependent  of graft-versus -tumor  effect  for cure,  in vivo T-cell 
antibody  based  GVHD  prophylaxis  (i.e. anti-thymocyte  globulin)  can also impair  survival9. 
Thus,  novel  T-cell replete  GVHD  regimens  would  be of considerable  utility.  
 
For the patients  who develop  grade  II-IV aGVHD,  the standard  first-line treatment  is oral or 
IV corticosteroids10. It is difficult  to predict  at the onset  of aGVHD  who will respond  fully or 
partially,  or who will be refractory.  Approximately  50% of patients  will not achieve  a sustained  
complete  response  of aGVHD  to first-line therapy  with corticosteroids6. For those  patients  
who fail to respond  to corticosteroids  additional  immunosuppressive  agents  are 
necessary11,12. Unfortunately,  survival  is poor in steroid -resistant  aGVHD  at approximately  
15% at [ADDRESS_994977] with consequent  malabsorption  and 
diarrhea,  inflammation  of the liver, suppression  of the immune  system  and occasionally  other  
auto-immune  phenomena  (such  as, auto-immune  hemolysis)  or involvement  of other  organs  
(such  as,  pulmonary   involvement).   Chronic   GVHD   is  diagnosed   and  graded   as  mild,

Approval date: [ADDRESS_994978]  after RI conditioning9. They  found  that 
patients  who received  a T-cell replete  regimen  had a 3-year incidence  of cGVHD  of 52% 
(95%CI:  49-56) whereas  patients  who had alemtuzumab -containing  and ATG-containing  
regimens  had a lower  incidence  of 24% (95%CI:  18-30) and 40% (95%CI:  36-44), 
respectively,  p = <0.001.  However,  the risk of 3-year relapse  was lower  in the T-cell replete  
regimen  when  compared  to alemtuzumab -containing  and ATG-containing  regimens  (38%  vs 
51% vs 49%).  Similarly,  disease -free survival  was higher  in the T-cell replete  regimen  than 
those  who received  in vivo T-cell depleted  regimens.  
Mielcarek  et al analyzed  GVHD  according  to conditioning  regimen  intensity  in 96 allograft  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]14. The incidence  of grade  II-IV aGVHD  at day 100 was higher  in the myeloablative  
conditioning  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93059] 77% when  compared  to that of 62% in NMA  conditioning  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
(p = 0.02)  whereas  grade  III-IV severe  aGVHD  was  similar  (p = 0.89)  This  comparison  
revealed  that the median  time to initiation  of corticosteroids  for treatment  of GVHD  was 
delayed  by [CONTACT_56944] 2 months  (median  time 3.0 months)  in the NMA  group  when  compared  
to the myeloablative  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (median  time 0.95 months).  These  findings  suggest  that the 
median  onset  of GVHD  is delayed  in NMA  conditioning  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The probability  of cGVHD  
was similar  among  for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_728543]  (77%  vs 74%,  p = 
0.37).  
 
Ceberio  et al evaluated  71 patients  with hematologic  malignancies  who received   either  
reduced  RI (n = 12) or NMA  (n = 59) conditioning  followed  by [CONTACT_728552]15. GVHD  
prophylaxis  consisted  of sirolimus,  tacrolimus  and low-dose  methotrexate.  The analysis  
showed  a cumulative  incidence  of grade  II-IV and III-IV aGVHD  at 1 year of 28% (95%CI:  18- 
39) and 7% (95%  CI: 3-15), respectively.  The median  onset  of aGVHD  was day 123 (range  
17-268) and the majority  of the patients  who developed  aGVHD  occurred  in the context  of 
immunosuppression  tapering.  The cumulative  incidence  of chronic  GVHD  in 70 evaluable  
patients  at 1 year was 15% (95%  CI: 8-24) and 2 years  was 32% (95%CI:  22-44). 
 
The results  of a prospective  phase  II trial assessing  peri-transplant  rituximab  with a NMA  
conditioning  regimen  for patients  with CD20  B cell NHL was recently  published  by [CONTACT_728553]16. The 
data from this study  (n = 51) reveals  a promising  2-year event -free survival  (EFS)  in this 
group  of patients;  the EFS was 84% and 40% for chemosensitive  as compared  to 
chemotherapy  refractory  patients  before  allo-HSCT.  The cumulative  incidence  of grade  II-IV 
aGVHD  at [ADDRESS_994979]  was 18% (95%CI:  7-29) and 25% (95%CI:  13-38), 
respectively,  whereas  the cumulative  incidence  of severe  grade  III-IV aGVHD  at 3 and 6 
months   was  8%  (95%CI:   0-16)  and  11%  (95%CI:   3-24),  respectively.   The  cumulative  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Page  7 of 36  
  
 
incidence  of moderate  to severe  cGVHD  at 1 year was 14% (95%CI:  3-24) and at 2 years  
was 29% (95%CI:  15-44). Notable,  GVHD  was noted  to be a more  frequent  cause  of death  
than disease  relapse  or progression.  The number  of patients  who suffered  a transplant - 
related  event  (most  of which  were  due to GVHD)  was 20 (19%),  while  the number  of patients  
who relapsed  or progressed  was 14 (13%).  In particular,  in those  patients  with FL, there  was 
one disease -related  event  and 9 transplant -related  events.  In a follow -up analysis  as of 
September  1, 2014,  46 patients  were  alive without  progression  of disease  at day 100. Of 
those,  the development  of any GVHD  syndrome  was assessed.  This analysis  demonstrated  
a cumulative  incidence  of 63% (95%CI:  47-76) at 1-year of any GVHD  syndrome.  Thirty -five 
percent  (n = 16) had no active  GVHD  whereas  30 patients  had active  GVHD  syndrome.  The 
predominant  manifestation  was late onset  aGVHD  (n = 9, 19.5%)  and overlap  syndrome  (n = 
9, 19.5%),  followed  by [CONTACT_728554]  (3 interrupted,  4 de novo)  and recurrent  
aGVHD  (n = 5, 11%)  (unpublished  data).  
3.2 Proteosome  inhibitors  to reduce  GVHD  
 
The proteasome  inhibitor,  bortezomib,  has immunomodulatory  properties  with the ability  to 
selectively  deplete  proliferating  alloreactive  T lymphocytes,  reduce  T-helper  type 1 cytokines,  
and block  antigen  presenting  cell activation17,18. Bortezomib  may also spare  regulatory  T- 
cells (Treg)  that may be relevant  in GVHD  control.  In a phase  I/II trial at Dana  Farber  Cancer  
Institute19, Koreth  el al evaluated  Bortezomib -based  regimen  for  the  prophylaxis   against  
GVHD  for patients  who received  HLA-mismatched  unrelated  donor  transplant  after RI 
conditioning regimen. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus, methotrexate and 
Bortezomib.  A total of 45 patients  were  enrolled  on this trial in which  bortezomib  was given  
on days  +1, +4, and +7. Toxicities   included  cytopenias   and infections,  not deemed  to be 
related  to the study  drug.  The cumulative  incidence  of grade  II-IV aGVHD  at 180 days was 
22% whereas  the cumulative  incidence  of cGVHD  at 12 months  was 29%.  Additionally,  the 
cumulative  incidence  of non-relapse  mortality  at 2 years  was 11%.  Given  these  results,  the 
authors  surmised  that bortezomib  is a promising  novel  immune  modulatory  agent  that may 
decrease  GVHD  following  allo-HSCT.  
The effect  of Bortezomib  on cGVHD  was also assessed  in a murine  model20. This study  
demonstrated  that Bortezomib  ameliorated  cGVHD  cutaneous  lesions,  which  were  also 
associated  with a reduction  in total numbers  of germinal  center  B cells and lower  B-cell 
activating  factor  gene  expression  levels  in cutaneous  lesions.  Pai et al conducted  a dose  
escalation  clinical  trial in patients  with steroid -intolerant,  dependent  or resistant20.  Ten 
patients  received  Bortezomib,  of those,  6 received  >60%  of the schedu led doses  and 5 of 6 
patients  responded  to therapy,  achieving  a marked  clinical  improvement,  which  was also 
associated  with reductions  of peripheral  B cells and minimal  toxicity.  In the majority  of the 
responders,  the dose  and/or  number  of immunosuppressive  drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_728544].  
3.2.[ADDRESS_994980] included  
patients  with advanced  solid tumors,  lymphoma,  relapse/refractory  multiple  myeloma  (MM),  
and  relapsed   or  refractory   light-chain   (AL)  amyloidosis.   In   addition,   ongoing   clinical

pharmacokinetic  (PK) of ixazomib  are ongoing.  Preliminary  clinical  data is available  for a total 
of [ADDRESS_994982]  a potential  role of this drug in the prevention  of acute  and chronic  
GVHD.  While  proteasome  inhibitor  bortezomib  has demonstrated  efficacy  in the prophylaxis  
and treatment  of GVHD,  its administration  by [CONTACT_728555][INVESTIGATOR_728545].  
Ixazomib  may overcome  this limitation  since  is orally  bioavailable  and is associated  with 
favorable  safety  and toxicity  profile.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  and drug  metabolism  
 
Clinical  intravenous  and oral PK data show  that ixazomib  citrate  (measured  as the 
biologically  active  boronic  acid form of  ixazomib   [MLN2238])   has  multi-exponential  
disposition  with a rapid  initial  phase  that is largely  over by [ADDRESS_994983] time of occurrence  of maximum  (peak)  
concentration  (Tmax)  of approximately  0.5 to 2.0 hours  and a terminal  disposition  half-life 
(t1/2)  after multiple  dosing  of approximately  5 to 7 days21. Results  of  a  population   PK 
analysis  (n = 137) show  that there  is no relationship  between  body surface  area (BSA)  or 
body weight  and clearance  (CL).  Also,  based  on stochastic   simulations  for fixed dose,  
exposures  are independent  of the individual  patient’s  BSA22. Therefore,  fixed dosing  was 
recommended  in clinical  trials.  An absolute  bioavailability  of 67% was determined  for 
ixazomib  using  the population  PK analysis.  
 
Metabolism  appears  to be the major  route  of elimination  for ixazomib,  and urinary  excretion  
of the parent  drug is negligible  (< 5% of dose).  In vitro studies  indicate  that ixazomib  is 
metabolized  by [CONTACT_728556]  P450s  (CYPs)  and non-CYP enzymes/proteins.  The 
rank order  of relative  biotransformation  activity  of the 5 major  human  CYP isozymes  was 3A4 
(34.2%)  > 1A2 (30.7%)  > 2D6 (14.7%)  > 2C9 (12.1%)  > 2C19  (< 1%). Ixazomib  is not an 
inhibitor  of CYPs  1A2, 2C9, 2C19,  2D6, or 3A4 nor a time-dependent  inhibitor  of CYP3A4/5.  
The  potential   for  ixazomib   treatment   to  produce  drug-drug  interactions   (DDIs)   via  CYP

metabolism  when  ixazomib  is administered  via the PO route  and because  of the moderate  
contribution  of CYP3A4 - and CYP1A2 -mediated  metabolism  of ixazomib  in human  liver 
microsomes.  Ixazomib  may be a weak  substrate  of P-glycoprotein  (Pgp),  breast  cancer  
resistance  protein  (BCRP),  and multidrug  resistance  associated  protein  (MRP2)  efflux  pump  
transporters.  Ixazomib  is not an inhibitor  of Pgp, BCRP,  and MRP2.  The potential  for DDIs  
with substrates  or inhibitors   of Pgp, BCRP,  and MRP2  is, therefore,  inferred  to be low. 
Clinical  Study  C16009  (Arm  1) with ketoconazole,  a strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  showed  a 2- 
fold increase  in area under  the plasma  concentration  versus  time curve  (AUC)  in  the 
presence  of ketoconazole23. This resulted  in the exclusion  of concurrent  use of  strong  
CYP3A4  inhibitors  proteasome  inhibitor/  ixazomib.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ixazomib  safety  profile  
 
The emerging  safety  profile  indicates  that ixazomib  is generally  well tolerated.  The adverse  
events  (AEs)  are consistent  with the class -based  effects  of proteasome  inhibition  and are 
similar  to what has been  previously  reported  with VELCADE  though  the severity  of some,  for 
example  peripheral  neuropathy,  is less. While  some  of these  potential  toxicities  may be 
severe,  they can be managed  by [CONTACT_728557],  or, as 
needed,  dose  modification  or discontinuation.  
Fatigue  was the most  common  AE reported  among  384 patients  treated  in the oral studies  
(47%).  Other  common  AEs reported  in the pooled  intravenous  and oral safety  populations  
include  nausea,  thrombocytopenia,  diarrhea,  and vomiting.  Rash  is also a commonly  
reported  treatment -emergent  event;  however,  there  is some  variety  in its characterization  
and causality  resulting  in different  preferred  terms  to describe  it. A high-level term outline  of

Reconstitution  directions:  N/A. 
 
Storage  and stability:  on receipt  at the investigative  site, study  drug should  remain  in the 
blister  and carton  provided  until use or dispensation.  The container  should  be stored  
refrigerated  (36°F  to 46°F,  2°C to 8°C).  All excursions  should  be brought  to the sponsor’s  
attention  for assessment  and authorization  for continued  use. Ensure  that the drug is used  
before  the retest  expi[INVESTIGATOR_728546]/  Millennium.  Expi[INVESTIGATOR_728547]. 
 
Study  drug dispensed  to the patient  for take-home  dosing  should  remain  in the listed  
packaging  and carton  and refrigerated  as noted  above  until the point  of use. Comprehensive  
instructions  should  be provided  to the patient  in order  to ensure  compliance  with dosing  
procedures.  Patients  should  be instructed  to store  the medication  refrigerated  (36°F  to 46°F,  
2°C to 8°C) for the duration  of each  cycle.  Patients  should  be instructed  to return  their empty  
carton  to the investigative  site, rather  than discarding  them.  
 
Reconciliation  will occur  accordingly  when  the patient  returns  for their next cycle  of take- 
home  medication.  Any extreme  in temperature  should  be reported  and dealt with on a case - 
by-case basis.  
 
Preparation:  Patients  should  be instructed  to swallow  ixazomib  capsules  whole,  with water,  
and not to break,  chew,  or open  the capsules.  Study  drug should  be taken  on an empty  
stomach  (no food or drink)  at least 1 hour before  or 2 hours  after a meal.  Each  capsule  
should  be swallowed  separately  with a sip of water.  
 
Clinical  considerations:  Missed  doses  can be taken  as soon  as the patient  remembers  if the 
next scheduled  dose  is [ADDRESS_994995].  A double  dose  should  not be taken  to make  
up for a missed  dose.  If the patient  vomits  after taking  a dose,  the patient  should  not repeat  
the dose  but should  resume  dosing  at the time of the next scheduled  dose.  
 
Hydration:  A total of approximately  8 ounces  (240 mL) of water  should  be taken  with the 
capsules.

The following  medications  and procedures  are prohibited  during  the study.  
Systemic  treatment  with any of the following  metabolizing  enzyme  inhibitors  is not permitted  
in this study.  A DDI with a strong  inhibitor  would  increase  the ixazomib  exposure  and could  
lead to a higher  probability of an AE:

o Strong  inhibitors  of CYP3A:  clarithromycin,  telithromycin,  itraconazole,  voriconazole,  
ketoconazole,  nefazodone,  and posaconazole.  
 
Systemic  treatment  with any of the following  metabolizing  enzyme  inducers  should  be 
avoided,  unless  there  is no appropriate  alternative  medication  for the patient’s  use (rationale:  
Unlike  with inhibitors,  if there  were  to be a DDI with an inducer,  ixazomib  exposure  would  be 
less; therefore,  there  would  be a reduced  chance  of an AE. However,  there  may be less 
chance  for an antitumor  effect,  but that is not an absolute  reason  to be taken  off ixazomib):

that may or may not be pruritic  over a few areas  of the body,  to a more  generalized  eruption  
that is predominately  on the trunk  or extremities.  Rash  has been  most  commonly  
characterized  as  maculopapular  or macular.  To date,  when  it does occur,  rash is  most  
commonly  reported  within  the first 3 cycles  of therapy.  The rash is often  transient,  self- 
limiting,  and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_78949]  1 to 2 in severity.  
 
Symptomatic  measures  such  as antihistamines  or corticosteroids  (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855])  have been  
successfully  used  to manage  rash and have been  used   prophylactically   in  subsequent  
cycle s. The  use of a  topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855],  IV, or oral  steroid   (e.g.,  prednisone   ≤ 10  mg  per day or 
equivalent)  is permitted.  Management  of a Grade  3 rash may require  intravenous  
antihistamines  or corticosteroids.  Administration  of ixazomib  (and/or  other  causative  agent  if 
given  in combination)  should  be modified  per protocol  and re-initiated  at a reduced  level from 
where  rash was noted.  
In line with clinical  practice,  dermatology  consult  and biopsy  of Grade  3 or higher  rash or any 
SAE involving  rash is recommended.  Prophylactic  measures  should  also be considered  if a 
patient  has previously  developed  a rash (e.g. using  a thick,  alcohol -free emollient  cream  on 
dry areas  of the body  or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_728549]).  A rare risk  is Stevens  -Johnson  
Syndrome,  a severe  and potentially  life-threatening  rash with skin peeling  and mouth  sores,  
which  should  be managed  symptomatically  according  to standard  medical  practice.  Punch  
biopsies  for histopathological  analysis  are encouraged  at the discretion  of the investigator.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_995015]  clinical  practice.  Ixazomib  administration  should  be 
modified  as noted  as per dose  modification  recommendations  in the protocol  when  
neutropenia  occurs  (see Table  9.1.1).  Therapy  can be reinitiated  at a reduced  level upon  
recovery  of neutropenia.  
 
Thrombocytopenia  may be severe  but has been  manageable  with platelet  transfusions  
according  to standard  clinical  practice.  Ixazomib  administration  should  be modified  as noted  
as per dose  modification  recommendations  in the protocol  when  thrombocytopenia  occurs.  
Therapy  can be reinitiated  at a reduced  level upon  recovery  of platelet  counts.  A rare risk is 
thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (TTP),  a rare blood  disorder  where  blood  clots form in 
small  blood  vessels  throughout  the body characterized   by  [CONTACT_12703],   petechiae,  
fever,  or possibly  more  serious  signs  and symptoms.  TTP should  be managed  
symptomatically  according  to standard  medical  practice.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -076 A(4)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_995016]  been  
reported  with ixazomib.  Blood  pressure  should  be closely  monitored  while  the patient  is on 
study  treatment  and fluid deficit  should  be corrected  as needed,  especially  in the setting  of 
concomitant  symptoms  such as nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  or anorexia.  Patients  taking  
medications  and/or  diuretics  to manage  their blood  pressure,  should  be managed  according  
to standard  clinical  practice,  including  considerations  for  dose   adjustment   of  their 
concomitant  medications  during  the course  of the trial. Fluid deficit  should   be  corrected  
before  initiation  of study  as needed  during  treatment  to avoid  dehydration.  
9.2.7  Posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  
 
One case of posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome,  which  ultimately  resolved,  has 
been  reported  with ixazomib.  This condition  is characterized  by [CONTACT_12704],  seizures  and 
visual  loss, as well as abrupt  increase  in blood  pressure.  Diagnosis  may be confirmed  by 
[CONTACT_728561]  (MRI). If the syndrome  is diagnosed  or suspected,  symptom - 
directed  treatment  should  be maintained  until the condition  is reversed  by [CONTACT_728562].  
9.2.8  Transverse  myelitis  
 
Transverse  myelitis  has also been  reported  with ixazomib.  It is not known  if ixazomib  causes  
transverse  myelitis;  however,  because  it happened  to a patient  receiving  ixazomib,  the 
possibility  that this drug may have contributed  to transverse  myelitis  cannot  be excluded.  
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
All patients  will be closely  monitored  and evaluated  as per MSKCC  BMT standard  of care 
guidelines.  Study  specific  assessment  schedule  listed  in table  below.  
 
Evaluation  includes  history  and physical  examination,  blood  count,  chemistry  including  liver

12.1 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
 
12.[ADDRESS_995023]-transplant.  Therapeutic  response  will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_728563]-IV aGVHD  or chronic  GVHD  diagnostic  features  (or 
any of the other  failure  criteria  listed  in 12.2)  during  the study  window  
 
Patients  who receive  at least one cycle  of therapy  will be considered  evaluable  for the 
primary  endpoint.  
 
 
12.3 Criteria  for treatment  failure  for the primary  endpoint  
o Study  drug is discontinued  and unable  to resume  due to drug related  toxicity.  
o New onset  or recurrence  of grade  II-IV aGVHD  (including  GVHD  flares).  
o New onset  of chronic  GVHD.  
o Administration  of systemic  therapy  for treatment  of GVHD.  
o Development  of secondary  graft failure  during  the administration  of the study  drug.  
o Mortality  (transplant  or treatment -related)  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -076 A(4)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_995024] disease  (GVHD)  
 
Acute  GVHD  will be diagnosed  clinically  and histological  assessment  will be obtained  where  
possible.  Grading  of aGVHD  will be based  on IBMTR  criteria25. Acute  GVHD  will be 
assessed  at Day [ADDRESS_995025]-allograft.  Assessments  will evaluate  the severity  of symptoms  and signs  
caused  by [CONTACT_728564].  Additional  assessments  may be 
conducted  if clinically  indicated.  
12.3.2  Secondary  graft  failure  
 
Secondary  graft failure  is loss of ANC to < 500/µL for 14 consecutive  days after initial  
recovery  or loss of donor  chimerism  to < 10% donor  after primary  donor  engraftment  has 
been  achieved  not due to progressive  malignancy  within  the marrow.  
Patients  with suspected  graft failure  will be evaluated  with bone  marrow  biopsy  to assess  BM 
cellularity  and assess  for residual  or recurrent  disease,  and molecular  analyses  of marrow.  
 
12.3.3  Transplant  related  mortality (TRM)  
TRM  is defined  as death  at any time from the commencement  of the study  trial due to any 
cause  other  than disease  relapse  with the exception  of automobile  or other  accidents.  The 
incidence  of TRM  from the enrollment  on protocol  to [ADDRESS_995026],  
is a secondary  endpoint  of this study  and will be defined  by [CONTACT_728565][INVESTIGATOR_633109] 5%, by [CONTACT_728566],  pathologic  lymphadenopathy  or by [CONTACT_728567]. Radiologic  studies,  flow cytometric  analysis  or molecular  studies  of the marrow  
and/or  peripheral  blood,  and/or  biopsy of lymph  nodes  or other  sites may also be obtained  for 
the diagnosis  of relapse  or disease  progression.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_995027]-transplant  according  to 
the CDC  guidelines.  Percentage  of patients  who get vaccines  on time and response  to 
vaccination  will be documented.

Patients  who meet  criteria  for immunization  (CD4  T cell > 200cells/ µL, CD19  B cells > 50 
cells/µL, IgG > 500 mg/dl,  > [ADDRESS_995028] dose  of IVIG,  > [ADDRESS_995029] dose  of 
Rituximab)  will have pre-immunization  titers measured  and will be immunized  according  to 
institutional  guidelines.  Post-vaccine  titers  will be obtained  to evaluate  for vaccination  
response  which  is defined  as at least a fourfold  rise in specific  antibody  levels  or a rise to a 
level considered  protective  per standard  BMT practice.  
 
12.3.6  Overall  and progression -free survival  
Overall  survival  is defined  as the time of study  enrolled  to death  from any cause;  patients  
who remain  alive will be censored  at the time of last follow -up. Progression -free survival  is 
defined  as time from study  enrollment  to death  or disease  progression.  
 
12.3.7  Percentage  of patients  who remain  on immunosuppression  
We will score  patients  as remaining  on immunosuppression  at 1 year if they remain  on 
immunosuppressants  at 1 year after the date of their stem  cell infusion.  
 
 
13.0     CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  will be removed  from study  if any of the following  events  occurs:  
• If at any time the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the 
section  on Criteria  Subject  Eligibility , the patient  will be removed  from the study.  
• If subject  withdraws  consent  for continued  participation.  Management  will depend  on 
where  they are in their treatment  course.  Such  patients  will receive  appropriate  
supportive  care.  
• Grade  II-IV acute  GVHD  or chronic  GVHD  develops.  If a patient  is in the middle  of a 
cycle,  the patient  may finish  their cycle  and then will be removed  from study.  
• Malignant  disease  relapse,  progression,  or death  occurs.  
• If a patient  experiences  severe  unexpected  adverse  events,  the treating  physician  or 
primary  investigator  can remove  the patient  from study  at their discretion.  
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a single  arm phase  2 trial to investigate  the efficacy  of a weekly  ixazomib  regimen  to 
reduce  recurrent  or late onset  acute  and chronic  GVHD.   The primary  endpoint  of this study  
is the incidence  of recurrent  or late acute  grade  II-IV aGVHD  or chronic  GVHD  from the time 
of enrollment  (day +100  to +150)  to 1-year post-transplant  time point.  In addition  to GVHD,  
the additional  treatment  failure  criteria  listed  in 12.[ADDRESS_995030] been  eligible  to enroll  on this study  is 63% (no

patient  died for reasons  unrelated  to GVHD).  Therefore,  the trial is designed  such  that a one- 
year incidence  of recurrent  or late acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  or cGVHD  of 40% would  be 
considered  promising  for further  development,  whereas  a 60% incidence  would  not be 
considered  worthy  of further  study.   Using  these  thresholds,  we will utilize a Simon’s  two- 
stage  optimal  design  based  on the proportion  of patients  who develop  GVHD.  If more  than

In addition  to the primary  objective,  there  are a number  of secondary  and safety  endpoints  
included  in this study:  
Secondary  endpoints:  
 
1. Cumulative  incidence  of   cGVHD  following  study  enrollment  will be estimated.  This will be 
calculated  overall  and by [CONTACT_926]  (moderate/severe).  Disease  progression  and death  in the 
absence  of cGVHD  are considered  competing  risks for this analysis.  
2. The cumulative  incidence   of TRM  from the time of study  enrollment  will be estimated,  
treating  disease  progression  as a competing  risk. 
3. The cumulative  incidence  of disease  progression  from the time of study  enrollment  will be 
estimated,  treating  death  in the absence  of disease  progression  as a competing  event.  
4. The cumulative  incidence  of grade  II-IV and III-IV acute  GVHD  will be estimated.  Disease  
progression  and death  in the absence  of acute  GVHD  are considered  competing  risks for this 
analysis.  
5. Kaplan-Meier methods will estimate overall and progression-free survival  from the time of 
study  enrollment.  
6. The proportion  of patients  who are able to discontinue  all immunosuppressive  medication  at 
one year will be estimated  along  with a 95% confidence  interval.  
7. Graphical  and summary  measures  will be used  to describe  CD3+CD4+  and CD3+CD8+  
populations  during  the study  window.

Exploratory  Endpoint:  
1. The proportion  of patients  who are able to get vaccines  on time will be report  with an exact  
95% confidence  interval.  The vaccine  response  will be similarly  described.  Both timing  and 
response  will be estimated  separately  for each  vaccine.  
 
2.  The treatment  failure  endpoint  will be described  separately  for patients  who enroll  on study  
day +100  to day +125  and for patients  who enroll  on study  day +125  to day +150.  
 
Safety  Endpoint:  
1.   The frequency  and severity  of adverse  events  will be tabulated.  
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES 
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration

Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_209870],  at a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  (DSM) at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of  the National  Cancer  
Institute   for  Data  and  Safety   Monitoring   of  Clinical   Trials”   which   can  be  found   at:  
Http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/r  esearchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans   at  MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_379139].  The MSKCC  Data 
and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:

y% 
 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148],  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation. 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSK’s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect

• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent  and is registered.   SAE 
reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’ s last investigational  treatment  or 
intervention.  Any events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  
related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
An SAE must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  within  5 calendar  days of the event.  The IRB/PB  
requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  electronically  to the

For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  AE report  should  be completed  as above.   If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to 
the FDA by [CONTACT_86497].  Potentially  serious  toxicities  are an expected  part  
of transplant  therapy.  Adverse  events  (AEs)  and serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  will be captured  and 
reported  as outlined  in the Departmental  Standard  Working  Procedure  titled “Adult  Bone  Marrow  
Transplant  (BMT)  Adverse  Event  (AE) and Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Guide”.  In addition,  the 
expected  adverse  events  outlined  in Table  11.[ADDRESS_995032]  be reported  to [COMPANY_005]  Pharmaceuticals/  Millennium  
Pharmacovigilance  (or designee)  from the first dose  of study  drug through  [ADDRESS_995033] of ixazomib.  Any SAE that occurs  at any time after completion  
of ixazomib  treatment  or after the designated  follow -up period  that the sponsor -investigator  
and/or  sub-investigator  considers  to be related  to any study  drug must  be reported  to [COMPANY_005]  
Pharmaceuticals/  Millennium  Pharmacovigilance  (or designee).   In addition,  new primary  
malignancies  that occur  during  the follow -up periods  must  be reported,  regardless  of 
causality  to study  regimen,  for a minimum  of three  years  after the last dose  of the 
investigational  product,  starting  from the first dose  of study  drug.  All new cases  of primary  
malignancy  must  be reported  to [COMPANY_005]  Pharmaceuticals/  Millennium  Pharmacovigilance  (or 
designee).  
 
 
17.3.2  Serious Adverse Event Definition 
 
Serious  AE (SAE)  means  any untoward  medical  occurrence  that at any dose:  
• Results  in death.  
 
• Is life-threatening  (refers  to an AE in which  the patient  was at risk of death  at the time of 
the event.  It does not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have caused  death  if it 
were  more  severe).  
 
• Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202917]  (see 
clarification  in the paragraph  below  on planned  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).  
 
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity . (Disability  is defined  as a 
substantial  disruption  of a person’s  ability  to conduct  normal  life functions).  
 
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect . 
 
• Is a medically  important  event .  This refers  to an AE that may not result  in death,  be 
immediately  life threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  but may be considered  serious  
when,  based  on appropriate  medical  judgment,  may jeopardize  the patient,  require  
medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  1 of the outcomes  listed  above,  or involves  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -076 A(4)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_995034]  of an infectious  agent.    Examples  of 
such  medical  events  include  allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  intensive  treatment  in an 
emergency  room  or at home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse;  any 
organism,  virus,  or infectious  particle  (e.g.,  prion  protein  transmitting  transmissible  
spongiform  encephalopathy),  pathogenic  or nonpathogenic,  is considered  an infectious  
agent.  
 
Clarification  should  be made  between  a serious  AE (SAE)  and an AE that is considered  
severe  in intensity  (Grade  3 or 4), because  the terms  serious  and severe  are NOT 
synonymous.   The general  term severe  is often  used  to describe  the intensity  (severity)  of a 
specific  event;  the event  itself,  however,  may be of relatively  minor  medical  significance  
(such  as a Grade  3 headache).   This is NOT the same as serious , which  is based  on 
patient/event  outcome  or action  criteria  described  above,  and is usually  associated  with 
events  that pose  a threat  to a patient’s  life or ability  to function.   A severe  AE (Grade  3 or 4) 
does not necessarily  need  to be considered  serious.   For example,  a white  blood  cell count  
of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000  is considered  Grade  3 (severe)  but may not be considered  
serious.   Seriousness  (not intensity)  serves  as a guide  for defining  regulatory  reporting  
obligations.  
 
17.3.3  Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
AEs may be spontaneously  reported  by [CONTACT_17491]/or  in response  to an open  question  
from study  personnel  or revealed  by [CONTACT_4171],  physical  examination,  or other  diagnostic  
procedures.   Any clinically  relevant  deterioration  in laboratory  assessments  or other  clinical  
finding  is considered  an AE.  When  possible,  signs  and symptoms  indicating  a common  
underlying  pathology  should  be noted  as one comprehensive  event.   For serious  AEs, the 
investigator  must  determine  both the intensity  of the event  and the relationship  of the event  
to study  drug administration.  For serious  pretreatment  events,  the investigator  must  
determine  both the intensity  of the event  and the relationship  of the event  to study  
procedures.  
Planned  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_728551] (e.g.,  surgery  was performed  earlier  or 
later than planned).   All SAEs  should  be monitored  until they are resolved  or are clearly  
determined  to be due to a patient’s  stable  or chronic  condition  or intercurrent  illness(es).  
Since  this is an investigator -initiated  study,  the principal  investigator  (Doris  M. Ponce),  also 
referred  to as the sponsor -investigator,  is responsible  for reporting  serious  adverse  events  
(SAEs)  to any regulatory  agency  and to the sponsor - investigator’s  EC or IRB.

Regardless  of expectedness  or causality,  all SAEs  (including  serious  pretreatment  events)  
must  also be reported  in English  to [COMPANY_005]  Pharmaceuticals/  Millennium  Pharmacovigilance  
(or designee):  
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours but no later than 5 calendar days of the 
sponsor -investigator’s  observation  or awareness  of the event.  
All other  serious  (non-fatal/non  life threatening)  events  within  5 calendar  days of the 
sponsor -investigator’s  observation  or awareness  of the event  
See below  for contact  [CONTACT_728568]/  
Millennium   Pharmacovigilance.  
The sponsor -investigator  must  fax or email  the de-identified  SAE Form  per the timelines  
above.   A sample  of an SAE Form  will be provided.  
The SAE report  must  include  at minimum:  
• Event  term(s)  
• Serious  criteria  
• Intensity  of the event(s):  Sponsor -investigator’s  or sub-investigator’s  
determination.   Intensity  for each  SAE,  including  any lab abnormalities,  will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_728569],  as a guideline,  
whenever  possible.   The criteria  are available  online  at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 
• Causality  of the event(s):  Sponsor -investigator’s  or sub-investigator’s  determination  
of the relationship  of the event(s)  to study  drug administration.  
 
Follow -up information  on the SAE may be requested  by [CONTACT_728559]/  
Millennium.  
Intensity  for each  SAE,  including  any lab abnormalities,  will be determined  by [CONTACT_728570],  as a guideline,  whenever  possible.  The criteria  are 
available  online  at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
Relationship  to all study  drugs  for each  SAE will be determined  by [CONTACT_107246]- 
investigator  by [CONTACT_728571]:  Is there  a reasonable  possibility  that the 
AE is associated  with the study  drug(s)?  
Sponsor -investigator  must  also provide  [COMPANY_005]  Pharmaceuticals/  Millennium  
Pharmacovigilance  with a copy of all communications  with applicable  regulatory  authorities  
related  to the study  product(s).

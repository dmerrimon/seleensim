		Protocol	v	5.22.19	2	1.		Background	Genetic	testing	in	ovarian,	fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_314509]	a	rapi[INVESTIGATOR_314510],	complicated	both	by	[CONTACT_314517].	The	demand	for	testing	in	certain	populations	has	risen	in	correlation	to	an	increasing	awareness	of	the	genetic	background	of	several	cancers.	In	the	case	of	high-grade	epi[INVESTIGATOR_314507],	fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_314511],	up	to	eighteen	percent	of	these	gynecologic	cancers	are	secondary	to	BRCA1	and	2	mutations,	and	a	further	five	to	ten	percent	are	secondary	to	other	associated	pathogenic	mutations	[1,2].		Results	of	genetic	testing	may	have	profound	implications	for	future	family	members,	who	can	choose	to	undergo	closer	surveillance	or	prophylactic	measures	should	they	also	carry	a	mutation	[3].	Testing	results	can	also	impact	patient	treatment,	as	there	now	exist	multiple	FDA	approved	anticancer	agents	for	BRCA	mutations	carriers	[4-7].	For	these	reasons,	current	national	guidelines,	including	the	2014	SGO	Clinical	Practice	Statement	and	the	NCCN	guidelines	version	2.2019	that	all	patients	with	ovarian,	fallopi[CONTACT_1629],	or	peritoneal	cancer	should	be	offered	genetic	testing	[8,9].	The	traditional	model	of	genetic	counseling		Several	societies,	including	ASCO	and	the	National	Society	of	Genetics	Counselors,	have	provided	guidelines	for	comprehensive	patient	education	and	informed	consent	prior	to	administration	of	testing	[10-14].	These	recommendations	originate	from	the	concept	that	the	process	of	counseling	and	testing	can	be	psychologically	detrimental	to	patients	and	their	family	members	and	are	grounded	in	a	practice	of	non-directive	counseling	[12].	Fulfillment	of	these	recommendations	has	traditionally	been	accomplished	through	face-to-face	consultation	with	a	genetic	counselor	prior	to	testing.			During	these	consultations,	patients	receive	approximately	thirty	to	ninety	minutes	of	in-depth	education	concerning	their	hereditary	cancer	risk	and	the	implications	of	testing.	This	educational	component	of	this	process	is	exhaustively	defined	by	[CONTACT_9526]’s	elements	of	informed	consent	for	genetic	counseling,	which	upon	last	update	contains	sixteen	separate	discussion	topi[INVESTIGATOR_314512]-gene	panel	testing	[14]	[Figure	1].

	*Changes	from	the	[ADDRESS_387011]	counseling	guidelines	may	still	be	appropriate	in	certain	populations	for	whom	universal	testing	has	not	been	recommended	by	[CONTACT_314518],	it	seems	reasonable	to	expedite	the	process	for	ovarian	cancer	patients.			Second,	the	lack	of	consistent	referral	and	limited	supply	of	counselors	associated	with	the	traditional	model,	when	combined	with	non-directive	counseling,	has	resulted	in	a	persistent	failure	to	achieve	universal	testing,	with	approximately	25%	of	patients	receiving	BRCA1	and	2	testing	[15,16].	The	supply	and	demand	issue	will	likely	worsen,	as	genetic	testing	referrals	for	other	solid	tumors	are	also	increasing	in	frequency.	In	short,	the	recommendation	for	universal	BRCA1/[ADDRESS_387012]	counseling	only	[17,18].	More	recently,	the	streamlined	model	has	been	successfully	incorporated	into	several	institutions	through	quality	improvement	initiatives	[19,20].	In	this	model,	the	patients	are	counseled	and	testing	at	their	primary	oncologic	appointment,	either	by	[CONTACT_314519].	These	modifications	have	been	shown	to	be	easily	implemented	and	to	increase	the	institutions'	counseling	and	testing	rates	by	[CONTACT_314520].		Safety	of	alternative	models	While	expedited	models	may	increase	efficiency	and	genetic	testing	uptake,	it	must	be	established	that	these	methods	are	not	detrimental	to	patients.	ASCO	and	NSGC’s	original	policies	regarding	pre-test	education	originate	from	an	effort	to	minimize	patient	distress.	As	reported	in	its	policy	statement	on	genetic	counseling	for	cancer	susceptibility	mutations	in	2003,	“a	definitive	genetic	test	may	have	considerable	medical	and	psychological	implications,”	and	its	counseling	framework	intends	to	prepare	the	patient	for	these	[12].		This	assumption	may	not	hold	true,	however,	in	the	setting	of	more	directive	counseling,	when	the	stakes	for	patients	and	family	members	are	more	significant.	A	
		Protocol	v	5.22.[ADDRESS_387013]	counseling	[21].	Multiple	studies,	however,	have	demonstrated	that	BRCA	1	and	2	testing	in	high-risk	populations	does	not	generally	increase	patient	distress	[22,23].	Furthermore,	the	use	of	certain	alternate	models	to	provide	pre-test	education,	such	as	telephone	counseling	and	teleconferencing,	did	not	increase	patient	distress	when	compared	to	the	traditional	model	[17,24].		Unfortunately,	uptake	of	testing	via	telephone	counseling	was	shown	to	be	lower	than	that	achieved	by	[CONTACT_314521]	a	prospective	non-inferiority	trial	[17],	and	videoconferencing	still	requires	possible	over-utilization	of	genetic	counselors	in	a	pre-test	setting.			Purpose	of	study	As	evidenced	by	[CONTACT_314522],	a	model	that	achieves	the	goal	of	increasing	uptake	and	decreasing	resource	utilization	while	not	significantly	increasing	patient	distress	has	yet	to	be	established.	We	hypothesize	that	a	streamlined	model	of	service	delivery	will	not	have	a	detrimental	effect	on	patient	distress	with	the	counseling	and	testing	process.	We	also	hypothesize	that	this	model	will	adhere	to	near-universal	testing	uptake	without	increasing	cost	burden	on	the	healthcare	system.	This	would	be	the	first	randomized	trial	to	investigate	the	safety	and	non-inferiority	of	this	promising	new	genetic	service	delivery	model,	providing	an	alternate,	resource-effective	method	of	pre-test	education	that	could	improve	genetic	testing	uptake	without	increasing	adverse	psychological	effects.			2.	Study	Objectives		Primary	Objective	a.	To	determine	if	implementation	of	a	streamlined	model	of	genetic	service	delivery	increases	patient	distress	as	measured	by	[CONTACT_314523]	[25].			Hypothesis:	An	expedited	education	and	testing	model	in	this	patient	population	will	not	decrease	patient	satisfaction	with	genetic	counseling	or	increase	patient	anxiety.	
		Protocol	v	5.22.[ADDRESS_387014]	between	the	traditional	genetic	counseling	model	and	the	streamlined	model.				Hypothesis:	An	expedited	education	and	testing	model	in	this	patient	population	will	be	less	expensive	compared	to	the	traditional	model.				b.	To	compare	genetic	testing	uptake	between	the	streamlined	and	traditional	models.			Hypothesis:	In	this	study	setting,	both	groups	will	have	close	to	universal	testing	uptake.			c.	To	observe	differences	in	distress	throughout	the	genetic	education	and	testing	process,	including	pre-education,	post-education,	and	post-results	disclosure.		Hypothesis:	The	process	of	genetic	education,	testing	and	results	review	causes	minimal	distress	in	patients.			3.	Study	Design	3.1	Experimental	Design	This	is	a	prospective,	randomized	non-inferiority	trial.		3.2	Study	location	This	study	will	recruit	from	the	gynecologic	oncology	clinics	at	Duke	Cancer	Institute	and	collaborating	institutions.	3.3	Study	time	period	Estimated	ascertainment	completion	date:	12/31/2020	Estimated	study	completion	date:	3/31/[ADDRESS_387015]	Selection	and	Enrollment	4.1.2	Inclusion	and	Exclusion	Criteria	Inclusion:	• Age	greater	than	18	years	• Female		• Either	a)	pathologically	confirmed	diagnosis	of	high-grade	epi[INVESTIGATOR_314507],	fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_314513]	b)	cytologic	diagnosis	consistent	with	high-grade	epi[INVESTIGATOR_314514].		• Presenting	to	Duke	gynecologic	oncology	clinic	or	collaborating	institution	for	first	outpatient	visit	following	pathologic	or	cytologic	diagnosis.		If	logistic	constraints	prevent	the	patient	from	being	enrolled	at	her	initial	visit,	she	will	be	eligible	for	enrollment	up	to	initiation	of	her	fourth	cycle	of	chemotherapy.		Exclusion:	• Known	family	or	personal	history	of	an	inherited	cancer	susceptibility	mutation	• Previously	received	genetic	counseling	or	testing	for	an	inherited	cancer	susceptibility	mutation	• Insurance	provided	by	[CONTACT_314524]-to-face	genetic	consultation	prior	to	testing	• Unable	to	read	or	speak	English	as	study	design	includes	video	assisted	educational	materials	in	English	• Blind	or	deaf	as	study	design	includes	video	assisted	educational	materials	in	English		4.1.3	Recruitment	Procedures	Recruitment			
		Protocol	v	5.22.19	8	• Recruitment	will	occur	in	the	gynecologic	oncology	clinics	at	Duke	Cancer	Institute	and	collaborating	institutions.		• Potential	subjects	will	be	identified	by	[CONTACT_314525],	fellows,	residents	and	APPs	to	make	their	potential	eligibility	for	the	trial	known.		Eligibility	Determination	and	Introduction	of	Trial	• Once	the	patient	arrives	in	clinic,	both	the	research	coordinator	and	primary	provider	will	review	her	eligibility	for	the	trial	based	on	the	above	stated	criteria.	• If	eligible,	either	the	primary	research	coordinator	or	provider	will	give	a	brief	explanation	of	the	trial	and	assess	patient’s	willingness	to	enroll.		• If	the	patient	agrees	to	enroll,	the	process	of	consent	will	begin.	If	the	patient	does	not	agree	to	enroll,	a	note	stating	that	the	patient	was	approached	and	then	declined	enrollment	will	be	placed	in	the	EMR	so	that	she	is	not	approached	again.	The	patient’s	basic	demographic	information	will	also	be	recorded	in	the	secure	online	database	for	later	comparison	of	demographic	information	between	those	who	were	amenable	to	alternative	forms	of	service	delivery	and	those	who	did	not	wish	to	participate.			4.2	Process	of	Consent	4.2.1	Consent	Process	• If	the	patient	is	amenable	to	enrollment,	she	will	be	consented	in	one	of	the	clinic	rooms	in	the	gynecologic	oncology	clinic	during	her	primary	appointment	by	[CONTACT_314526].		• The	IRB	approved	consent	will	be	reviewed	in	full,	including	trial	purpose,	stated	objectives,	study	procedures,	risks,	benefits,	and	costs.	The	consent	process	will	take	place	in	a	clinic	exam	room	with	a	closed	door	to	ensure	privacy.		• Patients	will	have	ample	time	while	in	clinic	to	ask	questions	of	the	research	coordinator	or	gynecologic	oncology	provider.	Up	to	thirty	minutes	will	be	allotted	for	review	of	consent	form.	If	they	have	questions	after	their	consent	is	signed,	the	contact	[CONTACT_314527].	
		Protocol	v	5.22.[ADDRESS_387016]	signed	the	consent.		4.2.2	Legal	Capacity	to	Give	Consent	• The	subject	must	have	full	capacity	to	consent.		4.3	Risk	and	Benefit	Assessment	4.3.1		Risk	• The	first	risk	associated	with	this	proposed	study	includes	the	use	of	secure	medical	records.		To	ensure	that	patient	confidentiality	is	maintained,	all	data	retrieval	will	be	performed	by	[CONTACT_314528]	[INVESTIGATOR_314515]-secured	computers.		Each	subject	will	be	assigned	a	subject	ID	code	that	will	be	linked	to	the	medical	record	number.		This	will	be	generated	using	REDCap	database	and	will	be	stored	on	a	standalone	database	server	hosted	by	[CONTACT_314529]	(DHTS)	and	will	only	be	accessible	to	the	key	personnel	of	this	study.	Collaborating	sites	will	share	the	same	Duke	REDCap.		• Risks	of	genetic	testing	will	also	be	associated	with	the	study,	as	a	majority	of	patients	in	both	arms	will	likely	undergo	testing.	However,	this	is	a	risk	associated	with	a	separate,	well-established	standard	of	care	in	this	population	rather	than	with	the	study	intervention.	Thus,	while	it	will	be	addressed	with	the	patient	when	they	complete	their	separate,	standard	consent	for	genetic	testing,	it	is	not	considered	to	be	an	incremental	risk	of	this	study.		• The	study	also	incurs	a	potential	incremental	risk	of	adverse	psychological	reactions	to	streamlined	genetic	counseling	and	testing.		Our	hypothesis	is	that	the	streamlined	model	will	not	significantly	increase	patient	distress	with	the	genetic	counseling	and	testing	process.		4.3.2	Benefit	• Patients	will	receive	genetic	risk	assessment,	which	is	currently	recommended	for	everyone	in	this	patient	population.	There	is	no	other	direct	benefit	provided	to	
		Protocol	v	5.22.[ADDRESS_387017]	counseling	is	not	currently		billed	at	Duke	Cancer	Institute,	nor	would	the	streamline	education	process	be.			4.3.4	Compensation	• No	compensation	will	be	provided	for	participation	in	this	trial.		5.	Study	Design		5.1	Randomization	Following	consent,	the	clinical	research	coordinator	will	randomize	the	patient	to	either	the	Traditional	Group	(TG)	or	Streamlined	Group	(SG).	The	randomization	process	will	have	occurred	previously	using	the	REDCap	randomization	tool.				5.2	Study	Procedures	(See	Figure	One)	5.2.1	Baseline	Questionnaires	(Both	Groups)	• After	randomization,	each	subject	will	complete	a	series	of	baselines	questionnaires	on	a	tablet	in	the	gynecologic	oncology	clinic,	entering	their	results	directly	into	the	secure	REDCap	database.	These	baseline	questionnaires	include	a	basic	numeracy	test,	the	baseline	anxiety	and	distress	survey	(IES)	and	the	demographic	information	questionnaire,	which	will	include	questions	concerning	age,	race,	marital	status,	home	address,	and	income	[26,27].			5.2.2	Tradition	Counseling	Group	(TG)	
		Protocol	v	5.22.19	11		a.	Formal	Consultation	Scheduling	• After	completion	of	baseline	surveys,	the	TG	subjects	will	be	referred	to	a	formal	pre-test	consultation	with	a	genetic	counselor	that	will	be	scheduled	for	a	date	approximately	2-4	weeks	after	their	primary	appointment	(for	patients	in	whom	results	will	determine	treatment,	appointments	will	likely	be	expedited).		They	will	be	made	aware	of	the	date	and	time	of	this	appointment	prior	to	leaving	their	initial	visit.		b.	Electronic	Family	History	Questionnaire	• TG	subjects	will	complete	an	electronic	family	history	questionnaire	(FHQ)	within	one	week	of	the	primary	visit.	This	is	a	system	already	employed	by	[CONTACT_314530].	An	email	is	sent	to	the	subject’s	primary	email	account	with	a	link	to	a	secure,	HIPAA	compliant	portal,	in	which	the	subject	can	then	enter	her	family	cancer	history.	• A	member	of	the	genetics	team	will	curate	the	results	by	[CONTACT_314531].		c.	Formal	Consultation	and	Post-Counseling	Distress	Survey	• The	TG	subjects	will	then	meet	with	the	genetic	counselor	at	the	previously	scheduled	appointment	time.	During	this	visit,	they	will	receive	approximately	thirty	to	sixty	minutes	of	counseling	regarding	genetic	testing	and	potential	results.	The	discussion	is	based	on	the	ASCO	and	NCCN	guidelines	of	informed	consent	for	genetic	testing.		• After	counseling,	participants	will	be	given	the	option	to	undergo	a	multi-gene	panel	genetic	test	either	via	saliva	or	blood	sample.	Those	who	agree	to	testing	will	also	complete	the	standard	genetic	testing	consent	form.	As	per	standard	practice	of	the	clinical	genetic	service	at	DCI,	patients	will	also	be	asked	to	provide	consent	for	somatic	tumor	testing	of	surgical	specimen	(non-cytologic).		• Subjects	will	complete	a	post-education	distress	and	anxiety	survey	(IES)	via	an	email	link	to	a	confidential	REDCap	survey	link	within	one	week	of	formal	consultation.			5.2.3	Streamlined	Group	(SG)	
		Protocol	v	5.22.19	12	a.	Video-Assisted	Genetic	Education	• After	completion	of	the	baseline	surveys,	the	SG	subjects	will	watch	an	approximately	eight	minute	long	genetics	education	video.	This	video	will	be	made	with	the	assistance	of	Duke	University	genetic	counselors	and	gynecologic	oncology	providers.	It	will	consist	of	a	discussion	of	genes	and	mutations,	the	recommendation	of	universal	testing	for	high	grade	epi[INVESTIGATOR_314514],	a	review	of	genes	associated	with	ovarian	cancer	predisposition,	the	possibility	of	uncertain	results	including	variants	of	undetermined	significance,	the	potential	for	undetected	mutations	in	known	or	unknown	cancer	susceptibility	genes,	the	potential	impact	on	personal	treatment	and	on	family	members,	the	possibility	of	genetic	discrimination	and	the	legal	protection	of	genetic	information.	• After	watching	the	video,	the	primary	oncologic	provider	will	then	offer	multi-gene	panel	testing.	• All	subjects	will	then	have	the	option	to	"opt	out"	and	receive	formal	genetic	counseling	prior	to	making	a	decision	about	testing.	• If	the	subject	elects	to	undergo	genetic	testing,	she	will	fill	out	the	standard	genetic	testing	consent	form.	As	per	standard	practice	of	the	clinical	genetic	service	at	DCI,	patients	will	also	be	asked	to	provide	consent	for	somatic	tumor	testing	of	surgical	specimen	(non-cytologic).	b.

This	margin	was	chosen	as	a	high	general	MICRA	score	has	previously	been	considered	to	be	one	standard	of	deviation	above	the	mean;	thus,	we	are	taking	a	more	conservative	approach	by	[CONTACT_2329]	a	non-inferiority	margin	of	0.[ADDRESS_387022]	deviation	observed	in	Cella	et	al	[28].		When	incorporating	a	potential	10%	attrition	rate,	the	total	sample	size	will	be	112.			5.4.[ADDRESS_387023]’s	new	assigned	number	will	be	stored	in	RedCap	database	and	on	a	standalone	database	server,	hosted	by	[CONTACT_314529]	(DHTS).			5.6	The	Role	of	External	Personnel	No	external	personnel	will	be	involved	in	this	study.

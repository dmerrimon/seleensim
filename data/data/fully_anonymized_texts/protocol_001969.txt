Title  of Study:  
An Open -label, Single- arm, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Early Effects of Abaloparatide 
on Tissue-based Indices of Bone Formation and Resorption 
Study  center(s): Approximately  5 in the United  States 
Studied  period  (years):  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: April [ADDRESS_333]  completed: January 2019 Phase  of development:  3 
Objectives:  
The objectives of  this study are to: 
1. Demonstrate the early effects of abaloparatide on tissue -based bone formation and 
resorption indices 
2. Assess the degree to which increased bone formation is achieved by [CONTACT_719],  
remodeling, and  overflow bone formation 
3. Relate  the early  indices  of tissue- based  bone formation  and bone resorption  to those  
measured  using  biochemical  markers of  bone turnover. 
Endpoints:  
• Change from baseline to 3 months in dynamic indices of bone formation in the  
relevant  bone envelopes (cancellous, endocortical,  intracortical,  and periosteal)  
− Mineralizing  surface  (MS/BS)  
− Mineral  apposition rate (MAR)  
− Bone formation  rate (BFR/BS)  
• Structural  indices  in the relevant bone envelopes at Month 3 
− Cortical  porosity (Ct.Po/Ct.Ar)  
• Static  indices in  the relevant bone  envelopes at Month  3 
− Osteoid  volume (OV/BV)  
− Osteoid  surface (OS/BS)

− Osteoid  thickness  (O.Th)  
− Wall thickness (W.Th)  
− Eroded surface (ES/BS)  
• Change from baseline to 3 months in special histomorphometric variables in the  
relevant bone envelopes  
− Remodeling, modeling, and overflow modeling- based  formation  (RmF/BS,  
MF/BS,  oMF/BS)  
• Change in serum procollagen type I N- terminal propeptide (s -PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]) and carboxy- 
terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (s- CTX) from baseline to 1 and 3  
months 
• Correlations of tissue -based indices of bone formation and bone resorption with s- 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_681] s- CTX  
• Overall safety and tolerability of abaloparatide in postmenopausal women with  
osteoporosis.  
Methodology: 
This is an open-label, single- arm, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis.  The study is designed  to measure the early  effects of  abaloparatide on  
tissue -based bone formation using samples obtained by [CONTACT_720]. The study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 1 month), a 
Pretreatment Period (approximately 1 month), a Treatment Period (3 months), and a Month [ADDRESS_334] dose of study  medication.  Biopsies are to be  obtained at 3 
months of treatment  for the  following reasons:  
• This is the optimal time for changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover to 
predict changes in BMD after 18 months of treatment with abaloparatide (Radius, 
data on file).  
• Longer periods of time increase  the risk that the  initial  set of  labels will be  
resorbed,  which would seriously confound the results.  
• Comparisons to the 3-month results for teriparatide from the AVA Osteoporosis 
Study will be possible. 
There will be a sub -study at selected sites to collect pQCT  data and extend an additional  
3 months of study drug administration for  a total  of 6 months of  treatment.  
Details of the schedule of measurements,  endpoints and statistical  analysis methods will be  
described  in a separate document  for the sub-study.

Efficacy  analysis  
The primary endpoint of this study is the change from baseline to 3 months in mineralizing surface (MS/BS) in the cancellous bone envelope. Paired t- tests will be used to compare the 
differences in dynamic indices between the two time -points derived from the two sets of 
double labels using the Bone-Biopsy Population. If the normality assumption of efficacy 
variable is not satisfied at the 0.[ADDRESS_343], 
will be used to evaluate the primary endpoint. No adjustments for multiplicity will be made. A p-value < 0.[ADDRESS_344] dose of  
abaloparatide will  be summarized  separately.

2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. Background  
Abaloparatide (marketed as TYMLOS™ in the [LOCATION_002]) is a novel, synthetic, 34 
amino acid peptide designed to be a potent and selective activator of the PTH/PTH- 
related protein (PTHrP) type 1 receptor (PTHR 1) signaling pathway with 41% homology 
to PTH[1 –34]) and 76% homology to human PTHrP[1–34]. Abaloparatide is 
differentiated from PTH and PTHrP ligands based on its high affinity and > 1000- fold 
greater  selectivity  for the G protein-coupled (RG) vs the non-G protein-coupled (R0) 
conformation of PTHR 1 (Hattersley, 2016). Differential PTHR 1-RG binding with 
abaloparatide results  in potent and  transient  intracellular  cyclic AMP  (cAMP)  signaling. 
In nonclinical studies, the  transient  PTHR [ADDRESS_345] on bone resorption ( Makino, 2015).  
Abaloparatide is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Abaloparatide was shown in Study BA058-05-003 (ACTIVE) to reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared  to placebo, and  to increase hip BMD  more  than teriparatide  (Miller,  2016).  
 
2.2. Disease  and Study  Background  
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by [CONTACT_724]  (Rizzoli,  2001) . This disease  is characterized  by [CONTACT_725]. The fractures associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality, as well as  
economic burden to society, together make up the clinically significant and medically relevant group termed major osteoporotic fractures. In the [LOCATION_002] (US), there are an estimated 2 million osteoporotic fractures annually ( Litwic, 2014). The number of 
osteoporotic fractures is projected to increase in both men and women by [CONTACT_726] 3- fold over the next 50 years as  a result of the aging population ( WHO,  2007).  
Bone remodeling occurs through the action of osteoclasts, which are involved in the resorption of bone followed by [CONTACT_727]. In addition to continued use of calcium  and vitamin  D, the current therapeutic approach to  the treatment  
of osteoporosis through inhibition of bone resorption includes agents such as bisphosphonates ( Rosen, 2017), or the monoclonal antibody, denosumab, that inhibits the 
action of osteoclasts by [CONTACT_728]-B (RANK) ligand. An alternative approach has been to tip the balance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic resorption through the use of parathyroid hormone receptor  modulation using teriparatide  (rhPTH[1 –34]).  
Until re cently,  teriparatide has  been the only approved  osteoporosis treatment in  which  
the major mode of action is stimulation of bone formation (anabolic) rather than suppression of bone resorption. Teriparatide has delayed and modest effects on increasing BMD  at the total  hip and femoral neck,  and on decreasing BMD at  the distal 1/3 radius.

The increase in cortical porosity that can occur may result in maladaptive effects on  
cortical  bone microarchitecture ( Bilezikian, 2007 ). 
The short- term anabolic effects of teriparatide have been demonstrated in  
histomorphometric analyses of a single transiliac  crest  bone biopsy after administration  
of two sets of tetracycline labels (quadru ple labeling) ( Lindsay, 2006). One month of 
treatment stimulated bone formation on cancellous and endocortical surfaces by [CONTACT_729]-based and remodeling-based formation. Likewise, the same technique demonstrated  stimulation  of bone formation  after  3 months of treatment  with teriparatide,  
but inhibition of bone formation in subjects treated with the antiresorptive agent, denosumab ( Dempster, 2016, AVA Osteoporosis Study). In this study, early stimulation 
of bone formation by [CONTACT_730], endocortical, intracortical and periosteal envelopes. The stimulation of bone formation was due to an increase in remodeling-based formation (27%), overflow modeling- based formation (9%), and  
modeling- based  formation (6%) (Dempster, 2017).  
The effects of  abaloparatide on bone histomorphometry were recently  reported in a subset 
of subjects in the ACTIVE trial ( Moreira, 2017). Biopsies were obtained at 12 to18 
months (average 15.5 months) from subjects treated with either abaloparatide, teriparatide, or placebo. Few differences were detected among the three treatments, likely  
due to the fact that only cancellous bone was studied, as well as the late timing of the biopsies when the effects  of the anabolic agents  were declining. 
2.3. Quadruple  Label  Technique  
The purpose of this study is to assess the early effects of abaloparatide in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using tissue-based indices of bone metabolism and to relate these indices to biochemical markers of bone turnover. All four bone envelopes (cancellous, endocortical, intracortical, and periosteal) will be examined in iliac crest  
biopsies after fluorochrome labeling. The quadruple labeling technique has previously been  described by [CONTACT_731] ( Lindsay, 2006).  
As noted above, this novel labeling technique has been found to be highly effective in two studies demonstrating the early effects of anabolic therapy with PTH (1-34) on bone formation in subjects with osteoporosis. It has also been used successfully to investigate  
the early  effects  of PTH  (1-84) replacement  in subjects  with hypoparathyroidism 
(Rubin, 2011). Recently, a quadruple label protocol proved to be particularly useful in 
elucidating the mechanism of action of the sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, in the treatment of osteoporosis ( Chavassieux, 2017). In quadruple -labeled biopsies taken at  
two months, the bone formation rate was dramatically increased compared to pretreatment  levels. However,  in biopsies taken  at [ADDRESS_346] been difficult to explain  the large increments in bone mineral density, cancellous bone volume, trabecular 
connectivity, and cortical thickness achieved by [CONTACT_732]. The principal advantage of the technique is that it allows measurement of dynamic bone formation variables before and after initiation of a drug treatment in a single biopsy. This eliminates the side- to-side variability  in the traditional paired  biopsy study design and, in any case,  
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Stud y BA058 -05-020, Amendment  2 Page  20 of 60  
  
such a design is not practical to study early effects (within 3 months) of drug 
administration. In  the quadruple labeling  technique, two  different  fluorochromes 
(demeclocycline HCl and tetracycline HCl)  are used for the pre -treatment  and 
on-treatment labels. The difference in color of each fluorochrome allows any label to be 
unambiguously identified as a pre- treatment or on -treatment label, even if only one set of 
labels  is present in a particular  forming  osteon. 
To prepare for biopsy, subjects will be given two sets of fluorochrome labels in the 
following way. The first set of labels will be given to all subjects in standard format: 3 
days of demeclocycline HCl (150 mg, four times per day), a 12-day intermission, and 3 more days of demeclocycline (same dose). After the first set of labels has been  
administered, daily administration of 80 µg abaloparatide will commence. This treatment will be continued during administration of the second set of labels and until the day of biopsy. Approximately 23-26 days before the Month 3 visit, a second set  of double labels  
will be administered following the same schedule, but this time using tetracycline HCl (250 mg, four times daily  for 3 days on, 12 days off, 3 days on). 
Standard transiliac crest bone biopsies will be performed [ADDRESS_347] procedures (See Section 7.2.10). The 
biopsies will be embedded in methyl methacrylate and prepared in a standard fashion for histomorphometric analysis. Serial sections from each subject will be examined under UV light for evaluation of tetracycline labels  and under  polarized  light after  staining  with 
toluidine blue for evaluation of reversal and cement lines. 
Using two sets of fluorochrome labels, which differ in their color under fluorescent light 
enables  one to distinguish the first  and second sets  of labels,  even  when only single labels  
are present. Using standard histomorphometry, mineral apposition rate and mineralizing surface can be measu red for the two separate labeling periods, and bone formation rates 
can be calculated. The technique has two key advantages over paired biopsies. First, only one biopsy is required. Second, each subject serves as his or her own pretreatment 
control, elimin ating problems caused by [CONTACT_733].  
2.4. Bone  Histomorphometry Results from  Study  BA058 -05-003 
In Study BA058-05-003, a subset of subjects at selected centers was asked to undergo a 
bone biopsy ( Moreira, 2017). Biopsies were obtained after the subjects had received  
between  [ADDRESS_348] bone biopsy after quadruple tetracycline labeling and to rel ate these indices to  
biochemical markers of bone turnover. All four bone envelopes (cancellous, endocortical, 
intracortical,  and periosteal) will be examined.  
2.6. Dose  Rationale  
The approved dose of abaloparatide in the US for the treatment  of postmenopausal 
women  at a risk for fracture  is 80 µg per day.

(seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and before blood sample collection. At visits when study drug is administered at the site, vital sign asse ssments will be collected before the 
dose of study drug. Only blood pressure, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_698] -dose. Supi[INVESTIGATOR_699].  
d Height  is to be  measured in  the standing position  with shoes off using  a medical  stadiometer.  
e An ECG  will be recorded  immediately  prior  to dosing and one hour post-dose during the Treatment  Period.  
f All routine urinalysis will be performed on a sample freshly voided during the visit and sent to a central lab for microscopy if test is positive for micro- 
organisms  via dipstick.  
g Serum  chemistry  will be measured predose  at Visits  3, 4, and 5. 
h Eighteen days before Day 1 of the Treatment Period (Visit 3), subjects who remain eligible for study participation will begin the first bone biopsy labeling 
procedure  with administration  of 150 mg demeclocycline  4 times  daily  for 3 days followed by a 12-day intermission,  and then demeclocycline for 3 additional 
days at the  same dose.  
i Approximately 23 to  26 days  before  Month 3 (Visit 5), subjects  will begin the second bone  biopsy labeling  procedure  with administration  of [ADDRESS_367] entry  into the Screening  Period (Visit 1) of the study  (signed  
informed  consent)  until [ADDRESS_368] sign and date a study-specific informed consent form (ICF) before any 
study specific procedures can be performed. The consent forms will comply with all applicable regulations governing the protection of human subjects. An ICF, approved by [CONTACT_750]'s institutional review board (IRB) must be used. The Investigator or designee must record  the date when  the ICF was signed in the subject’s  source document. 
7.2.3. Assigning  Subject  Numbers  
Once a subject has  signed an  ICF, a subject  number will be  assigned. The  subject will 
retain  this number for the entire study. 
 
7.2.4. Subject  and Disease  Characteristics  
Subject  and disease characteristics  include the following: demographics, medical  history, 
height, and  weight. 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject during screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying medical conditions as specified 
in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history shall include a complete 
review  of systems, past  medical and surgical histories,  and any allergies.  
Subjects  included into the study based  on a history of low-trauma nonvertebral fractures  
must have sufficient source documentation in the form of a medical report or 
radiographic films as evidence of such history. 
 
7.2.5. Screening  (Visit  1) 
Signed informed consent will be obtained and eligibility for study entry assessed. Subjects  who  are eligible for  the study on the basis  of screening  evaluations  will enter  the 
Pretreatment Period of the study and will be provided calcium and vitamin D supplements. This should be continued through the Treatment Period according to the subject’s  need, so that they have an intake of at least 1200 mg/day of calcium and  
800-1000 IU/day  of vitamin  D. Vitamin D  supplements are required  to be administered  
daily from the Pretreatment Period until the end of the Treatment Period. Calcium will 
also be administered daily, with the exception of the days of administration of 
demeclocycline and tetracycline, where calcium administration will be withheld. The  
following baseline screening  evaluations will be performed: 
• Obtain Informed Consent

7.6. Bone  Biopsy  Processing  Procedure 
The bone cores will be processed without decalcification and embedded in methyl 
methacrylate.  Three levels  of transverse  sections from each biopsy block will be cut  100 
micron apart using a Leica SM 2500E Polycut microtome. In each level, two adjacent sections at 7 -micro ns and one adjacent 20-micron thick sections will be collected. The 
two 7 -micron adjacent sections will be stained with toluidine -blue (ethanol base) and 
Goldner’s trichrome, respectively. The toluidine-blue stained section will be used to demonstrate bone cells, osteons, and cement lines. The trichrome stained section will be used to demonstrate osteoid. The 20- micron section will be left unstained for  
visualization of tetracycline labels. Each section will be subjected to histomorphometric  
analysis using computerized image analysis as previously described ( Dempster, 2001;  
Dempster 2017). All variables will be calculated and expressed according to the guidelines of the ASBMR’s  Bone Histomorphom etry Committee  (Dempster, 2013).  
7.7. Imaging Procedures  
All imaging measurements (spi[INVESTIGATOR_703]) will be performed according  to the procedures outlined in  the Imaging  Charter  and Imaging Manuals  which  
will be provided as a separate document.  
 
7.7.1. Dual  Energy  X-ray Absorptiometry  (DXA)  
All subjects  will have areal  bone density (aBMD)  measurements  taken  via DXA of the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck, at Screening (Visit 1). Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_704] L1 through L4. Hip scans will include the entire proximal femur to about [ADDRESS_377] X -rays taken to document fractures of the lumbar and thoracic 
vertebrae at Screening to confirm entry criteria. Radiographs of the lateral thoracic and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_705] T3 to S1. The lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_706] -quantitative (SQ)

• Grade 0: Normal  (approximately  < 20% reduction in  anterior,  middle,  or 
posterior height) 
• Grade 1: Mild  fracture (approximately  20%–25% reduction in anterior,  
middle, or posterior height) 
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  2 Page  45 of 60  
 • Grade 2: Moderate fracture (approximately 25%–40% reduction in anterior, 
middle,  or posterior height) 
• Grade 3: Severe fracture (> 40% reduction in anterior, middle, or posterior 
height). 
Subjects will be clinically evaluated for vertebral and nonvertebral fractures (wrist, hip, 
rib, etc.) which occur during the study. Should a clinical fracture occur, X- ray images and  
reports associated with the fracture must be obtained and maintained in the subject’s medical  record.  
All fractures  will be  identified  and evaluated  as part  of the disease assessment  and will be 
documented in the eCRFs  and source documents. 
 
7.7.3. Treatment  and Imaging at Selected  Sites  
Selected sites will follow expanded treatment and imaging procedures. Sites following 
expanded procedures will be provided instructions and details in a separate document for the sub-study. 
Additional treatment  and imaging procedures at  selected  sites  includes: 
• Abaloparatide treatment  for total of 6 months 
• pQCT  of the forearm and tibiae performed at the pretreatment visit (Visit 2),  
at Month 3 (Visit 5), and at Month 6 (Visit 7).  
 
7.8. Discontinuation  from  the Study  
Subjects may  voluntarily discontinue from the study for any  reason at  any time.  
Subjects  sustaining a radiologically  confirmed incident vertebral  fracture will be  
informed of the finding and will be counseled as to treatment options and may 
discontinue or choose to  remain on the study. 
Subjects  who decide they  do not wish to participate  in the study further should return  for 
the assessments indicated for the Month 3/Early Termination and 30 days later for the 
Month 4 Visit in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures ( Table 1 ). If they fail to  
return for these assessme nts for unknown reasons, every effort (eg, by [CONTACT_756], email, 
and letter for a minimum of three attempts) should be made and documented in the subject’s  study file. 
 
7.8.1. Withdrawal of Consent  
Subjects  may  voluntarily withdraw consent to participate  in the study for any reason  at 
any time.  
Withdrawal of consent occurs only when a subject does not want to participate in the 
study anymore and does not want any further visits or assessments and does not want any further study related contact.

All AEs are collected from the time of the informed consent until [ADDRESS_380] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or dis ease temporally  
associated  with  the use of a medicinal  (investigational) product, whether or not related  to 
the medicinal (investigational) product ( ICH,  1995).  
AEs include: 
Worsening (change in nature, severity,  or frequency) of conditions present  at the onset of 
the study 
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug  interactions  
• Events related to  or possibly related to concomitant  medications  
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significant shifts from Baseline within the range of normal that the Investigator considers to be clinically  
important)  
• Clinically  significant abnormalities  in physical examination, vital signs, and  
weight 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless it requires a 
therapeutic intervention or is considered  by [CONTACT_757].

• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie, substantial disruption of  
the ability  to conduct normal life function) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed  in this definition.  Examples  of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
All adverse events of osteosarcoma will be reported as SAEs. All reports of  
osteosarcoma, regardless of causality or expectedness, will be expedited to the FDA  
within [ADDRESS_381] be followed until resolution (subject has returned to baseline status of 
health)  or until stabilization  (the Investigator does not expect  any further improvement or 
worsening of the reported event). 
 
8.1.3. Recording  Adverse Events  
All AEs/SAEs  will be entered  into the electronic database.  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709] a time other than the planned date or the pre-existing illness or disease worsens after enrollment into the  study. 
Fractures identified during the study are not to be recorded as AEs unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the fracture  is complicated,  or the Investigator considers the fracture  to be 
unrelated to the subject’s underlying osteoporosis. All fractures will be identified and  
evaluated as part of the disease assessment and will be documented in the case report  
form  and by [CONTACT_758]. 
For both serious and  non-serious adverse events,  the Investigator  must determine  the 
intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration. Intensity  for each AE  will be defined  according to the following criteria:  
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  2 Page  49 of 60  
  
 
Intensity  Definition  
 
Mild  Awareness  of sign or symptom, but easily  tolerated.  
 
Moderate  Discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily 
activities.  
 
Severe  Inability  to perform normal daily activities.  
 
If the intensity of an adverse event changes within a day, the maximum intensity should  
be recorded. If the intensity changes over a longer period of time, the changes should be 
recorded  as separate events  (having separate onset and stop dates for  each intensity).  
Relationship  to blinded study drug administration  will be determined  by [CONTACT_759]:  
 
Relationship  Definition  
 
None No relationship  between  the event  and the 
administration of study drug. The event is related to other etiologies, such as concomitant medications  or subject’s  
clinical  state.  
 
Unlikely  The current state of knowledge indicates  
that a relationship to study drug is unlikely or the temporal relationship is such that study drug would not have had any reasonable association with the observed event.  
 
Possible A reaction  that follows a plausible temporal  
sequence from administration of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. The reaction might have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy  
administered  to th e subject.

Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  [ADDRESS_382]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy  
administered  to the subject. 
 
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs that are classified with a relationship to study  
medication administration of possible or probable will be considered treatment- related  
events.  
 
8.1.4. Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) Reporting  
Any SAEs that occur during the study from the t ime the subject signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_383] be retained in the site study  file. 
 
8.1.5. Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be followed with  appropriate medical  management  until resolved  or 
stabilized.  
 
8.1.6. Abuse,  Misuse,  Overdose,  or Medication  Error  
Abuse, misuse, overdose or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the 
Sponsor whether  or not they result in an AE/SAE.  
• Abuse – Persistent  or sporadic intentional intake of investigational medicinal  
product at a dose higher than prescribed per protocol (but below the dose defined for overdose) or when used for non-medical purpose (eg, altering one’s state of consciousness).  
• Misuse – Intentional or unintentional use of investigational medicinal product other than as directed or indicated at any dose, which is at or below the dose defined for overdose Note: this includes a situation where the test article is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_760]. 
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  2 Page  51 of 60  
 • Overdose – Intentional or unintentional injection of a dose of abaloparatide at 
least 2 times higher than the protocol specified dose and is associated with clinical  symptoms. 
• Medication Error – A mistake made in prescribing, dispensing, administration and/or use of the investigational medicinal product. 
 
8.1.7. Regulatory Agency,  Institutional  Review  Board, Ethics  Committee  and 
Site Reporting  
The Sponsor and/or the clinical contract  research organization  (CRO)  are responsible for 
notifying the relevant regulatory authorities/US central Institutional Review Boards  
(IRBs)/EU central ethics committees (ECs) of  related, unexpected SAEs. 
The Investigator  is responsible for notifying the Sponsor, CRO,  and local  IRB,  local  EC, 
or the relevant local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as  
required. 
If a death occurs during the study or within 30 days after Month 3/Early Termination visit 
(Visit 5), and it is determined to be related either to a study procedure or study drug, the 
Investig ator or his/her designee must notify the Sponsor and will communicate that 
information to the IRB within one business day of knowledge of the event. The contact 
[CONTACT_761] e- mail.  
8.2. Study  Completion  and Post-Study  Treatment  
The Investigator must provide follow- up medical care for all subjects who are 
prematurely  withdrawn  from the study due to  an adverse event or must refer them for 
appropriate ongoing care.  
 
8.3. Lost  to Follow -up 
For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the Investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_762], eg, dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject s hould not be formally 
considered lost to follow-up until his/her scheduled end of study visit would have occurred.

9. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Analysis Plan  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be completed  and approved prior 
to database lock. All statistical tests will be two -sided with a significance level of 5%, 
unless otherwise specified.  
 
9.2. Statistical Hypothesis 
9.3. Analysis Datasets  
9.3.1. Population for Analysis 
The primary population for all efficacy analyses will be the Bone-Biopsy Population, 
which is defined as all enrolled subjects who received a biopsy. The primary population for all safety  analyses will  be the Safety  Population, which will be  defined  as all enrolled  
subjects  who received  at least one dose of abaloparatide.  
9.4. Description  of Statistical Methods  
9.4.1. General  Approach  
Baseline is defined as  the last  value obtained prior to the first dose of study medication.  
For categorical data, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of subjects  
within  each category  of the parameter  will be  presented. For continuous data, the number 
of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, interquartile range (Q1 
and Q3), and maximum will be  presented.  
 
9.4.2. Analysis of the Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint of this study is the change from baseline to 3 months in 
mineralizing surface (MS/BS) in the cancellous bone envelope. Paired t- tests will be used  
to compare the differences in dynamic indices between the t wo time -points derived from 
the two sets of double labels using the Bone-Biopsy Population. If the normality assumption of the efficacy data is not satisfied at the 0.[ADDRESS_384], will be used to assess changes from baseline. No adjustments for multiplicity  will be made. A  p-value < 0.05 will be  considered statistically  significant.  
9.4.3. Analysis of Secondary  Endpoint(s)  
Secondary efficacy endpoints of tissue-based indices of bone formation and bone 
resorption will be analyzed in  the same manner as  the analysis of the primary  efficacy  
endpoint using the Bone Biopsy Population. 
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  2 Page  53 of 60  
 The change and percent change from baseline in bone turnover makers (s- PI[INVESTIGATOR_686]  
s-CTX) will be summarized descriptively at each visit (1 and 3 months) using the 
Bone-Biopsy and the Safety  Populations. 
Linear regression analyses will be used to assess the relationships between efficacy  
endpoints of tissue-based indices of bone formation and bone resorption and changes in bone turnover markers at each visit, including changes in MS/BS and BFR/BS in each envelope to changes in s- PI[INVESTIGATOR_680], changes in intracortical  MS/BS and BFR/BS to changes 
in s-CTX, MS/BS and BFR/BS in each envelope at Month 3 to s-PI[INVESTIGATOR_710] 1 and 3, intracortical MS and BFR/BS at Month 3 to s-CTX at Month 3, and ES/BS in each envelope and cortical porosity at Month 3 to s-CTX at Month 3. The analyses include scatter plots, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and slopes of simple regression models using the Bone-Biopsy Population. 
 
9.4.4. Safety  Analyses 
Unless  otherwise specified, safety  analyses  will be  conducted using the Safety  Population 
and will be descriptive in  nature.  
Study drug exposure and  study drug compliance will be calculated.  The duration of study 
drug exposure, total dose received, and percent compliance will be summarized.  
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. The number and percent of subjects who experienced  treatment -emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_763] (SOC), and preferred term (PT). Summaries will also be provided for severe 
TEAEs, serious TEAEs (SAEs), TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal, drug- related  
TEAEs (with probable or possible relationship to study drug), and TEAEs by [CONTACT_764]  (mild, moderate,  severe).  
The number and percent of subjects who report TEAEs associated with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria will be summarized.  
All AEs collected  prior to  the first dose of study drug will be  summarized separately.  
Descriptive  statistics  for clinical  laboratory data (including serum  calcium  and albumin), 
vital signs (including blood pressure), ECGs, and Investigator assessment of local  
tolerance will be provided by [CONTACT_765]. For laboratory data, vital signs and ECGs, absolute results and changes from baseline will be presented. In addition, laboratory test results will be classified as  above normal limit,  within normal l imit, or  below normal limit.  
Laboratory shift frequencies will be tabulated between the Screening visit and relevant post- baseline visit(s).  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary and summarized by [CONTACT_766].  
 
9.4.5. Adherence and Retention  Analyses 
The number and percentage of subjects who withdraw from the study, with primary reason,  will be summarized.  
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  [ADDRESS_385] a condition noted. Results from the baseline physical examination will be summarized by [CONTACT_767].  
9.4.7. Interim  Analyses 
There are no interim analyses planned  for this study. 
 
9.4.8. Tabulation of Individual  Response  Data  
Individual efficacy  and safety  data will be  tabulated as  appropriate.  
 
9.5. Sample  Size Calculation  
In the AVA study of teriparatide and denosumab ( Dempster, 2016 ), the mean (± SD)  
change from baseline in cancellous MS/BS (%) for teriparatide was 13.90 (± 9.38) at 
3 months. In  the ACTIVE study, the median %  change from  baseline in s- PI[INVESTIGATOR_711] 
3 months was  60% for abaloparatide and  94% for teriparatide.  The ratio between  the 2 
groups is approximately  2/3 (= 60%/94%). 
Using  the same ratio and the results  for teriparatide  obtained from  the AVA study, we  can 
assume that the mean change from baseline in cancellous MS/BS (%) for abaloparatide at  
3 months will be 9.2% (= 13.90*2/3). Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 12.0%, a sample size of [ADDRESS_386] 90% power to detect a statistically  
significant change from baseline in cancellous MS/BS (%) for abaloparatide at 3 months of 9.2%. The study is planned to enroll approximately 25 subjects to accommodate a 
drop-out rate of 15%, including those with non-evaluable bone biopsy. Additional 
subjects  may  be enrolled  if the  number of evaluable biopsies is insufficient to achieve this 
power.

Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), with applicable  
local  laws  and regulations, and  with  the ethical  principles laid  down in  the Declaration of  
Helsinki.  
The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with 
Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in [ADDRESS_387] the rights, safety, and well -being of the subjects. The study will only be conducted at sites wh ere IRB  
approval has been  obtained. The protocol, IB, ICF, advertisements  (if applicable),  written  
information given to the subjects, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any 
revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_768],  as allowable  by [CONTACT_769]. 
10.2. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
The Investigator is  responsible for obtaining written,  informed  consent from  each  subject  
interested in  participating in this study before  conducting any study- related  procedures. 
Written informed consent should be obtained after adequate, thorough, and clear 
explanation of the study objectives, procedures, as well as the potential hazards of the study. The  method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and  the contents 
of the consent will comply with ICH GCP and all applicable laws and regulations and will be subject to approval by [CONTACT_770]. 
10.3. Investigator  Compliance  
No modifications to the protocol should be made without the approval of both the Investigator and RADIUS. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (ie, efficacy assessments) will require IRB notification before implementation, except where the modification is  
necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. RADIUS will  
submit all protocol modifications to the  required  regulatory authorities.  
When circumstances require an immedi ate departure from procedures set forth in the 
protocol, the Investigator will contact  [CONTACT_771].  If 
possible, contact [CONTACT_772]. Any departures  from protocol must be fully  documented in the source documentation.

The records must also be available for inspection, verification, and copying, as required by [CONTACT_774], by [CONTACT_775] (FDA and others). The Inves tigator must comply with applicable privacy and security laws for use and 
disclosure of information related  to the research set  forth in this protocol. 
 
10.5. Subject  Data  Confidentiality  
To maintain subject confidentiality, all eCRFs, study reports and communications relating to the study will identify subjects by [CONTACT_776]. As required by [CONTACT_777], the Investigator will allow  RADIUS  and/or its representatives  access  
to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data  gathered in the 
eCRFs/SAE Forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA (or other regulatory authority) may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
As applicable,  in accordance with the Health  Insurance Portability  and Accountability  
Act (HIPAA) and associated privacy regulations, a subject authorization to use personally 
identifiable health information may be required from each subject before research  
activities  begin. 
Subject confidenti ality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_778], their  
staff, and RADIUS and their representatives. This confidentiality is extended to cover 
testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information  
relatin g to participants.  Therefore,  the study protocol, documentation, data,  and all other 
information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior wri tten 
approval of RADIUS.  
 
10.6. Research  Use of Stored  Human  Samples,  Specimens,  or Data  
With the subject’s approval, and as approved by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB, biological samples may 
be stored at a centralized facility  determined  by [CONTACT_780]. These  samples could be used  
for retrospective biomarker research or analysis of clinical response to therapy. The 
storage facility will be provided with a code- link that will allow linking the biological 
specimens with the phenotypic data from each subject, maintaining the masking of the identity  of the subject.  
During the conduct of the study, any individual subject  can choose to withdraw  consent 
to have biological specimens stored for future research. When the study is completed, access  to study data and/or samples will be  provided through RADIUS. 
Radius Health, Inc.  
Abaloparatide -SC Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-020, Amendment  [ADDRESS_389] will be entered into an eCRF by [CONTACT_781] a secure,  validated  web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. 
RADIUS  will have  read-only access to all data upon entry  in the EDC application. 
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the Investigator for resolution. Any changes  to study data will be  made to the eCRF  and 
documented in  an audit trail, which  will be maintained  within  the clinical  database.  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, a quality 
assurance audit may be conducted. Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator and institution agree to allow  the auditor/inspector direct  access  to all relevant  documents and  to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. In the case of an audit or inspection, the Investigator or a delegate will alert RADIUS, as  soon as he/she becomes aware of the audit or inspection. 
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
accurate filing system of all study -related documentation that will be suitable for  
inspection at  any time by [CONTACT_780], its  designees,  and/or regulatory agencies.  In signing 
this protocol, the Investigator understands and agrees to give access to the necessary  
documentation and files.  
10.8. Monitoring  
RADIUS is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to 
protocol adherence and validity of data recorded in the clinical database. The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_770]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_782] a representative of RADIUS, or designee (site monitor), who will review the eCRFs, SAE Forms and source documents. The site monitor will ensure that the invest igation  is conducted according  to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
 
10.9. Data  Collection  and Management  Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the  
supervision of the Investigator. The  Investigator is  responsible for ensuring the accuracy,  
completeness,  legibility,  and timeliness  of the data reported.  
RADIUS will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC  
application sufficient to permit site personnel to enter and correct information in the 
eCRFs  on the subjects for which they are responsible for.

It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and 
timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should document the dates an d details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject 
status.  
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF in a timely 
manner  after information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user's identificatio n information and the date and time 
of any correction. The Investigator must provide formal approval of all the information in the eCRFs, including any changes made to the eCRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the Investigator is responsible. 
RADIUS  will retain  the eCRF  data,  queries  and corresponding audit trail.  A copy of the 
final archival eCRF in the form of a compact disc or other electronic media will be  
provided to the site  for placement in  the Investigator's study file. 
 
10.10.  Study  Records  Retention 
The Investigator will maintain study documents for a minimum of [ADDRESS_391] be notified. No records will be destroyed without the written consent 
of RADIUS.  
10.11.  Publ ication  and Data  Sharing  Policy  
Publication of complete data from the study is planned. It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings and/or published in a peer reviewed scientific or medical journal. A Publications Committee composed of Investigators participating in  the study and representatives  from  RADIUS  as appropriate will be 
formed  to oversee the publication of the study results,  which will reflect the experience of 
all participating  study centers.  
Subsequently, individual Investigators may  publish results  from  the study in compliance 
with their agreement with RADIUS.

2. STUDY  SCHEDULE  
This study addendum is comprised of seven clinic visits. Study assessments are to be 
performed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ). There is a ± 4 -day window for 
each clinic visit, other than Day 1 for which there is a +4-day window and Month 7 (Visit 
8) for which  there  is a ±  7-day window. 
The study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 1 month), a Pretreatment Period 
(approximately 1 month), a Treatment Period (6 months), and a Month 7 Visit (one month). During the Treatment Period, subjects will have clinic visits for study- related  
protocol procedures at Day 1, Month 1, Month 3, Month 4, and Month 6. For the 
purpose of this study, one month is equal to [ADDRESS_398]  who terminates  at or before  the Month 3 
Visit will return for assessments as indicated in the Addendum Sch edule of Assessments  
and Procedures for the Month 3 Visit and complete the study 30 days later at the Month 4 
Visit (See Section 2.6 of the main protocol). Subjects who decide they do not wish to participate in the study following the Month 3 Visit should return for assessments as  
indicated in the Addendum, Schedule of Assessments and Procedures for Month 6/Early Termination Visit and 30 days later for the Month 7 Visit ( see Section 2.9 of the main  
protocol). 
 
2.1. Screening  (Visit  1) 
Signed informed consent will be obtained and eligibility for study entry assessed. Subjects 
who are eligible for the study on the basis of screening evaluations will enter the 
Pretreatment Period  of the study, and will be provided calcium  and vitamin  D 
supplements. This should be continued through the Treatment Period according to the 
subject’s need, so that they have an intake of at least 1200 mg/day of calcium and 800- 
1000 IU/day of vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements are required to be administered daily 
from the Pretreat ment Period until the end of the Treatment Period. Calcium will also be  
administered daily, with the exception of the days of administration of demeclocycline and tetracycline, where calcium administration will be withheld. The following baseline  
screening  evaluations will be performed: 
• Obtain  Informed  Consent 
• Verification  of study entry  criteria  
• Review  of medical history  
• Physical  examination  
• Blood pressure  and vital signs (see  Section  7.3 of main protocol)

Subjects whose laboratory tests do not fall within the specified ranges as detailed in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria may have the samples redrawn and the tests repeated within [ADDRESS_399] date. If upon reanalysis, the values fall within the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject may enter the study. Subjects who do not meet the 
25-hydroxyvitamin D entry criterion may receive vitamin D supplementation and be retested one time. Similarly, subjects with minor elevations of PTH may be retested one  
time after vitamin D supplementation. All subjects enrolled following retesting must have  
safety  laboratory results reported within 30 days prior to  enrollment.  
All AEs, including serious adverse events (SAEs), will be recorded from the time of 
signing of the informed consent and through the [ADDRESS_400] dose of study medication.  
 
2.2. Pretreatment  (Visit  2) 
All subjects will receive calcium and vitamin D until the end of the Treatment Period,  
according to the subject’s need so that they have an intake of at least 1200 mg/day of 
calcium and 800-1000 IU/day of vitamin D. Subjects should be on a stable dose of 
calcium  and vitamin  D for 30 days prior to  initiating  the double labeling  procedure. 
Subjects will undergo training for medication self- administration and for completion of 
diary, to include administration  of medications  for bone biopsy labeling  procedure. 
Vitamin D supplements are required to be administered daily from the Pretreatment Period until the end of the Treatment Period. Calcium will also be administered daily, with the exception of the days of administration of demeclocycline and tetracycline where 
calcium  administration  will be withheld. The  following procedures will be performed:

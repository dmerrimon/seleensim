1.2 Objectives  
Overall goal : Develop  pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452]  a new, easily scalable strategy to optimize  post-
surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414].  
 
Specific objective  #1: Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of carrying out a  novel nudge 
intervention that may  reduce excess postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_739746] . 
 
Exploratory objective #2 : Determine whether the nudge intervention leads to changes in 
subsequent postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_739747].  
 
Exploratory  objective # 3: Determine whether this technique affects patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023], refill requests, medical visits for pain, satisfaction with analgesia, and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724].  
1.3 Design and Outcomes   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_739748] a 
nudging intervention providing surgeons with procedure -specific feedback regarding 
patients’ postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447] -to-consumption ratio in individuals 18 years 
of age and older.  
 
Primary outcomes :  
Feasibility : 
1. Percentage  of surgeons approached  who agree to participate in study  
2. Percentage of  patients contact[CONTACT_739812] : 
1. Surgeon -reported acceptability of intervention  
 
Exploratory  outcome s: Mean pre -post percentage change in procedure -specific 
prescription size , mean pre -post change in patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], 
medical visits for pain, satisfaction with analgesia, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] , surgeon -reported 
perceived usefulness of intervention .  
1.[ADDRESS_1010805] phase, p atients undergoing specific elective surgeries at the study site 
(Vanderbilt University Medical Center  [VUMC] , Nashville, TN) during study days 1 -60 
will be contact[CONTACT_739813]  14 days postoperatively (study days 15-
74) and asked to perform an opi[INVESTIGATOR_739749] ; they will also be asked about opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], 
satisfaction with analgesia, emergency room visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_736780], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422].  
 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_1010806] phase data will then be analyzed and p atients ’ surgeons randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1010807] change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_739750] 
(measured in oral morphine equivalents) from baseline between the two groups for 
surgeries performed during days 108-[ADDRESS_1010808] -intervention surgeries (during days 108-
167) 14 days postoperatively (days 122-181) to assess pre -post changes in patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023], satisfaction with analgesia, medical visits for pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724].  
1.5 Sample Size and Population  
Patients  (initial phase) : We anticipate successfully contact[CONTACT_30697] 5 patients per day for a 
total of 300 patients . 
 
Surgeons : We anticipate obtaining mean pre -post prescribing change in up to 60  surgeons 
(30 per group).  
 
Patients (second phase) : We anticipate successfully contact[CONTACT_30697] 5 patients per day for a 
total of 300 patients .

4 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
4.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Among those aged 55 and older, opi[INVESTIGATOR_739751] 8,877 deaths in the U.S. in 2017 (the 
most recent year for which data are available). 4,564 of these deaths were from 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].(1) The total number of U.S. opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related deaths in 2017 was 
47,600, 17,029 of which involved prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Physician prescribing is deeply connected with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]: Most Americans 
misusing prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_739752] a friend or relative with a prescription,(2) and most current heroin 
users started opi[INVESTIGATOR_739753].(3) Surgical prescribing comprises an 
increasing proportion of first -start opi[INVESTIGATOR_739754] -naïve patients;(4) 6% of 
such patients develop new persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_58311].(5) Up to 7 0% of 
prescribed postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_739755] a reservoir for potential 
diversion or misuse.(6)  
4.[ADDRESS_1010816] been propagated(7 -10) in order 
to decrease both the number of surgical patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_739756] -surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Other nudging techniques like ch anging 
electronic medical record prescription size defaults have been used in the surgical setting 
to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414],(11) although such tactics run the risk of increasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_739757] -low prescribers.(12)  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_739758], evidence remains limited regarding the optimal methods for 
reducing post -surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414].(13) Our proposed project will test a novel 
nudging technique that has not been studied in the postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_739759]: 
direct feedback to surgeons about their patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447] -to-consumption 
ratios. Direct feedback to opi[INVESTIGATOR_739760] a fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_739761].( 14) We believe 
that providing granular data to a wide population of surgical prescribers (not just those 
whose patients overdose) will prove similarly effective. Should our intervention decrease 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 8 surgical prescribing, we anticipate it playing a significant role in the national strategy to 
combat the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562].  
 
5 STUDY DESIGN  
We plan a pi[INVESTIGATOR_739762] 
(direct feedback) or control (no direct feedback) arms.  Surgeons frequently performing 
specific elective general, gynecologic, orthopedic, and neurological  surgeries at VUMC  
will be identified during a [ADDRESS_1010817] 18 
years undergoing these  surgeries at VUMC  during study days 1 -60 will be contact[CONTACT_235868] 14 days postoperatively (study days 15-74) and asked to perform an  opi[INVESTIGATOR_739763]; they will also be asked about opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], satisfaction with analgesia, emergency 
room visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_736780], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. The electronic medical record 
will be also queried for the size of the initial postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_739764]. We anticipate successfully contact[CONTACT_30697] [ADDRESS_1010818] block of surgeries and associated patient follow -up (study days 1 -74), data will 
be analyzed and then  surgeons will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1010819] change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_739750] 
(measured in oral morphine equivalents) from baseline between the two groups for 
surgeries performed during days 108-167. That is, mean size of post -intervention 
prescriptions (from electronic medical record queries) will be compared with mean pre -
intervention prescription size by [CONTACT_739814]. Primary outcomes are measures of study feasibility and 
accepta bility given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  The main exploratory  outcome  will be mean 
percentage change in procedure -specific prescription size. We will then compare mean 
per-surgeon percentage change in prescription size between the direct feedback and no -
direct -feedback groups. Multiple regression analyses adjusting for case type and surgical 
specialty  will also be employed to permit more granular examination of the targeted 
changes . To evaluate other exploratory  outcomes, we will contact [CONTACT_739815]-intervention surgeries (during days 108-167) 14 days postoperatively (days 122-181) 
to assess pre -post changes in patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], satisfaction with analgesia, 
medical visits for pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. We again anticipate contact[CONTACT_30697] [ADDRESS_1010820] meet all the inclusion criteria below to participate in the 
study:  
• General, gynecologic, orthopedic,  or neurological surgeon  at VUMC during the 
study period performing any of the surgeries listed below  
Study patient  participants must meet all the inclusion criteria below to participate in the 
study : 
• Aged greater or equal to 18 years  
• Undergoing specified  elective general, gynecologic, orthopedic, and neurological  
surgeries at VUMC during the specified study periods (days 1 -60 for the initial 
patient group; days 108-167 for the follow -up patient group)  
o General: laparoscopic  or open  cholecystectomy, laparoscopic  or open  
appendectomy  
o Gynecologic: abdominal hysterectomy, laparoscopic/robotic  
hysterectomy, vaginal  hysterectomy , anterior repair/colporrhaphy, 
posterior repair/colporrhaphy, tension -free vaginal tape procedure, 
sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_724372] , sacrocolpopexy , uterosacral ligament 
suspension, colpocleisis, perineorrhaphy  
o Orthopedic: total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty , total shoulder 
arthroplasty, 1 - or 2-level spi[INVESTIGATOR_739765]/or discectomy  (without 
fusion)  
o Neurological : 1- or 2-level spi[INVESTIGATOR_739765]/or discectomy  
(without fusion)  
• Provided opi[INVESTIGATOR_739766]  (verified in VUMC 
EMR)  
• Able to understand study procedures and participate in the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_739767]/electronic interview process  in English or Spanish  
• Provide informed consent  
 
6.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
There are no planned exclusion criteria for study surgeon  participants , although those 
performing < [ADDRESS_1010821] 60-day period of surgeries will 
not be eligible for randomization.  
Study patient  candidates meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will 
be excluded from study participation:  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_739768]  (per VUMC  electronic medical record  [EMR ] and 
patient self -report) between 3 months and 14 days prior to surgery  
• Primary reason for surgery as assessed by [CONTACT_739816] -related  
 
Protocol Version 1.8 10 • Surgery is a repeat/revision surgery (e.g., revision total knee arthroplasty)  
• Patient has been inpatient for >[ADDRESS_1010822] -
discharge prescription  
• Vulnerable populations: current pregnancy , prisoners  
• Inability or unwillingness of patient to give informed consent  
• (Partial exclusion) Prior participation in this study (e.g., a patient included in the 
initial patient group undergoing a left total knee arthroplasty on study day 15, 
followed by a right total knee arthroplasty on day 115; such a patient would be 
included in the initial patient group but would not be recontact[CONTACT_695235] -
up patient group)  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1010823]  to utilize deception  for surgeon  
participants , who wi ll be asked to consent for participation in a study giving them 
information about their patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]  (surgeons will be debriefed fully on 
study purposes upon completion of the study) . Surgeon participants will be prospectively 
selected in a participant log kept by [CONTACT_464]. Surgeons will be randomized on a 1:[ADDRESS_1010824] complete a minimum 3 listed cases during the initial 
60-day study period (study days #1 -60) to be eligible for randomization.  
Study patient candidates  will be identified through VUMC EMR queries of performed 
surgical cases for study surgeon participants.  All patient candidates including procedures 
by [CONTACT_739817] a pre -recruitment letter by [CONTACT_739818].  Study team members contact[CONTACT_739819]. All patient  candidates  undergoing included 
procedures by [CONTACT_739820]/exclusion criteria  will be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] [ADDRESS_1010825]  patient participants’ subsequent opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] , we plan to 
obtain electronic informed  consent  from patients  at the time of contact.  Study research 
coordinators will securely document the consent process. Study personnel will also 
maintain a screening log containing  records for all evaluated candidates as well as  
reasons for study ineligibility and non-participation of eligible candidates . 
Additionally, a t the request of the study Data and Safety Monitoring Board, a third 
participant population will comprise all patients undergoing surgery of any kind by 
 
[CONTACT_162797] 1.8 11 surgeons in the nudge intervention group for 60 days following receipt of the nudge 
intervention. This will entail only EHR queries on POD #10 and #30 (on a rolling basis) 
for pain -related medical concerns and healthcare visits. This is to determine whether 
surgeon prescribing practices changed sufficiently following nudge relief to compromise 
postoperative analgesia and potentially harm patients.  These patients will not be 
contact[CONTACT_739821].  
 
[ADDRESS_1010826] on postoperative day 14 (or 
no later than postoperative day 19) for the initial contact [CONTACT_19313] . After verifying eligibility 
and documenting consent, patients will be asked to obtain their prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_739769] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]. If the patient consumed the entirety of the prescription 
and disposed of the bottle, this will be documented.  If the patient does not have their pi[INVESTIGATOR_739770], arrangements will be made to follow up with the patient by 
[CONTACT_739822]. 
Patient participants will also be asked to answer several questions related to our 
exploratory  outcomes:  
• Overall satisfaction with postoperative analgesia ( numeric rating scale)  
• To select from the following answers: “I received a) too many opi[INVESTIGATOR_79534], b) the 
right amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_79534], c) too few opi[INVESTIGATOR_79534].”  
• Whether patient required any medical visits primarily due to postoperative pain 
(office visits, emergency department visits, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614])  
• Whether additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_739771] ( this will also be evaluated through EMR  queries)  
• Evidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] (Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] -9 [COMM -9]) 
The one -time intervention for surgeon  participants in the Intervention Arm  will take 
place on approximately study day 97. This will entail procedure -specific direct feedback 
(through electronic  communication)  on patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] -to-prescription 
ratio. E.g., “Your abdominal hysterectomy patients were prescribed a mean [ADDRESS_1010827] month. These patients consumed a mean 20 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  (33%) .” Surgeon participants 
who perform more than one of the specified procedures (see section 4. 2, above) will 
receive nudging communications  for each individual procedure . Since the data  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_739772] -report data from consented patients, 
surgeons will be specifically informed that the data is self -reported  through inclusion of 
the following statement: “ This is based off self -reported pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]. The information is 
self-reported and not validated so it could be erroneous.”  
Surgeon participants randomized to the Control Arm  will not be contact[CONTACT_739823].  
 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_1010828] as follows: (1) Initial contact 
[CONTACT_739824] ; (2) 
consent process and electronic documentation of consent ; (3) pi[INVESTIGATOR_739773]  (REDCap Twilio) . 
The one -time intervention for surgeon  participants in the Intervention Arm  will be 
delivered by  [CONTACT_20815], paging or e-mail on the same day.

9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Risk/Benefit Profile  and Risk Mitigation  
Potential risks : We anticipate that this will be a minimal risk study. There is a small 
risk that people who are not connected with this study will learn a participant’s 
identity or their personal information through violation of HIPAA compliance and 
established research prot ocols. There is also a small risk that physicians may 
experience some discomfort in learning the opi[INVESTIGATOR_739790] , or that deception was used in the initial  vague descri ption of the purpose of 
the study . Finally, there is a  small risk that surgeon participants  in the Intervention 
Arm may, following the intervention, prescribe insufficient amounts of postoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_739791] -related medical visits.  
 
Potential benefits : There may be no direct benefits to patients participating in this 
study. Providers may benefit from the post -surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_739792]. Prescribers may also be more likely to exercise 
more careful use of op ioids after they have been made aware of discrepancies 
between opi[INVESTIGATOR_739793]. They may also be more likely to adjust 
their prescribing practices, discuss opi[INVESTIGATOR_739794], and identify 
careful use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_739795] -image in the future.  
 
Risk mitigation:  Study staff will protect the privacy of study participants. We do not 
 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_1010832] consists only of feedback regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_172298]/consum ption ratio and published prescribing guidelines. Differences in 
pain-related medical visits will be evaluated as described below. The consent process 
informs a volunteer about the study, indicates the participation is voluntary and 
he/she has the right to  stop at any time. Risks are described during the consent 
process.   Surgeons will be fully debriefed on the purpose of the study as soon as 
deception is no longer necessary (upon completion  of the study ). 
 
Only designated members of the research team will have access to study data. Only 
data from eligible subjects will be analyzed. All data will be stored on password -
protected computers and accessible only accessible to study personnel with 
appropriate password authorization. These measures should be effective in 
minimizing breaches of confidentiality. Prior to study initia tion, approval will be 
obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical 
Center. This approval will be reevaluated each year as part of the Human Subjects 
Committee annual review process, paying particular attention to patient 
confidentiality and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA).  
 
9.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
For this single -site minimal risk intervention pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the study staff and principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_60414]’ safety daily  and for 
monitoring and responding to any adverse events or unanticipated problems and for 
reporting them to the IRB, DSMB, and the NIA Program Officer. No formal safety 
parameter analyses are planned , but study staff will monitor for differences in pain -
related medical visits between the Intervention and Control Arm s. 
9.[ADDRESS_1010833] practices. While the expectedness of adverse 
events is very low, we will investigate every  numerator case identified in all safety 
measures described above.  
 
As requested by [CONTACT_4318], we will perform EHR  queries for all patients in the 
follow -up intervention  patient groups (that is, patients having surgery after the one -
time study has been delivered to the surgeon intervention and control arms) at 
approximately postoperative day 1 4. The purpose of these EHR reviews will be to 
assess for evidence of uncontrolled pain through review of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 24 emergency department visits, clinic visits, and patient phone calls/electronic portal 
messages.  
 
For cases identified by [CONTACT_552250], we will perform manual 
physician chart review to examine the clinical circumstances and to make a judgment 
(1) the expectedness of the event (unexpected, expected), (2) the likelihood that the 
safety event was study related (not related/possibly related/definitely related) and (3) 
judge the event’s severity (abnormal clinical finding without symptoms/symptoms 
requiring clinical intervention/short term disability or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death AND 
separately define the severity as mild, moderate, or severe).  
 
These will be conducted only by [CONTACT_21575]. Study personnel will 
interview patients' treating clinicians when needed to obtain additional information. 
Each case identified will have a case report form with these variables and will be 
signed  and dated by [CONTACT_739828]. These forms will be stored in a 
locked office. Each adverse event will be given an identification number. If study 
personnel believe that a patient that experienced an adverse event would benefit from 
seeing o r communicating with their prescribing surgeon, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_552229] [ADDRESS_1010834] restricted access.  
 
Adverse events will be defined as: Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human study participant, including any abnormal sign ( e.g., abnormal physical 
exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to 
participation in the research.   For this study, we will only be collecting adverse events 
involving  the study intervention s, pain, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Other post -surgical 
complications or adv erse events will not be captured.  
 
Adverse events will be assessed by a qualified medical professional using the 
following guidelines to describe severity:  
 
• Mild : Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
 
• Moderate : Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
• Severe : Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not 
necessarily equate to “serious” . 
Additionally, Serious Adverse Events will be defined as any adverse event that: (1) 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 25 Results in death; (2) Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred; (3) Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; (4) 
Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity; (5) Results in congenital 
anomalies or birth defects; or (6) Is another condition which investigators judge to 
represent significant hazards.  
 
Additionally, all Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be assessed for 
their relationship to study procedures as follows:  
 
• Definitely related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, 
including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time 
relationship to study intervention administrati on and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153].  
 
• Possibly related : There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., 
the event occurred within a reasonable time after the trial intervention or 
patient contact ). However, other factors may have contributed to the event 
(e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
 
• Not related : The AE is completely independent of study intervention 
administration /patient contact , and/or evidence exists that the event is 
definitely related  to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive 
etiology documented by a qualified medical professional.  
9.3.1 Reporting Procedures  
Should a serious, unanticipated, and possibly or definitely related adverse event , 
unanticipated problem or safety analysis occur, w e will  notify the  Safety Officer , 
DSMB Chair, NIA Program Officer, and  theVUMC IRB  within 48 hours of the study 
team becoming aware  of the event . Our report will include appropriate identifying 
information for the study, a detailed description of the unanticipated, 
possibly/definitely related, serious adverse  event, and a description of any changes to 
the protocol or other corr ective actions that have been taken or are proposed. If an 
unanticipated, possibly/definitely related, serious  adverse event occurs, we will 
review relevant clinical decision support and ensure others are not at a greater risk of 
harm than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Patient deaths related to this study are not expected. However, should we identify a 
possibly related or definitely  related patient death in safety measures described above 
we will report the death to the  Safety Officer,  NIA Program Officer , DSMB chair,  
and the VUMC IRB within 48 hours of our knowledge of the death.  
 
The summary of all SAEs (both anticipated and unanticipated) and safety measures 
will be reported and shared with the Safety Officer, NIA Program Officer, DSMB  
chair , and the VUMC IRB quarterly throughout the duration of the project, unless 
otherwise requested. In addition, the summary for reporting all reportable adverse 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 26 events (including a report of all numerator cases to all safety measures identified in 
this report) will be shared with the Safety Officer, NIA Program Officer, DSMB  
chair , and VUMC IRB quarterly, unless more frequent reports are requested by [CONTACT_739829], DSMB, or IRB.  
 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 27  

 
Protocol Version 1.8 28 9.3.2 Follow-up for Adverse Events  
The occurrence of a  reportable adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) 
may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a 
study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
All reportable AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for 
SAEs will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be 
collected includes event description, time of onset, qualified medical professional ’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the 
event. All reportable AEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriat ely regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
The study team  will record all reportable events on consented patients with start dates 
occurring any time post-discharge until the last day of study participation.  Events will 
be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
 
9.4 Safety Monitoring  
For this single -site minimal risk intervention pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the study staff and principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_60414]’ safety daily  and for monitoring 
and responding to any adverse events or unanticipated problems and for reporting them to 
the Safety Officer,  IRB, DSMB, and the NIA Program Officer. The Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to 
monitor participant safety, evaluate the progress of the study, to review procedu res for 
maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and 
analyses. As the NIA has requested the oversight of a DSMB, we will utilize the 
oversight of the standing Roybal Centers DSMB.  The study team will prepare safety 
reports quarterly to be reviewed by [CONTACT_739830]'s continuation, as well as any modification to the study. The DSMB will 
meet at least biannually either in -person or by [CONTACT_739831], data quality, and participants safety.  
 
[ADDRESS_1010835]’s condition becomes stable . 
[ADDRESS_1010836] of a brief behavioral 
nudging intervention on surgeons’ postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414]. In addition to 
determining feasibility and acceptability, we are chiefly interested in obtaining precise 
estimates of mean and variance to aid in planning a larger, sufficiently powered efficacy 
trial. 
 
Exploratory hypotheses include  that (1) surgeons in the Intervention Arm  will exhibit a 
larger pre -post percentage change in procedure -specific prescription size  (measured by 
[CONTACT_739832] [OMEs])  compared with surgeons in the Control Arm  who do 
not receive the nudging intervention  and (2) there will be no pre-post difference between 
the Intervention and Control Arm s in terms of patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], 
medical visits for pain, satisfaction with analgesia, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] . 
11.[ADDRESS_1010837] prescribing change in  up to 60  surgeons ( 30 per 
group). This exceeds the suggested rule -of-thumb threshold of 12 per group for an 
adequately precise estimate of the variance of a continuous variable to use in future 
studies. (16) 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1010838] of all surgeon participants will be generated . Using 
random.org’s sequence generator, a true random integer sequence derived from 
atmospheric noise will determine order in the list. Randomization  will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_739833] (e.g., neurological surgery) and by [CONTACT_739834][INVESTIGATOR_739796] 60-day surgical period prior to randomization (greater or equal to 
median vs. below median) . We will at minimum ensure an even or near -even split 
among the four over all major surgical divisions (general, orthopedic, gynecologic, 
and neurological) across the intervention and control arms.  
11.3 Interim analyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_739797]. There are 
no interim analyses planned that would trigger early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_739798] a single communication with surgeons and a single communication w ith 
participating patients.  As noted in section 8, above, the discovery of any adverse event 
would prompt immediate evaluation by [CONTACT_3476] (including study statistician and, if 
necessary, DSMB statistician) to review the events by [CONTACT_739835] 1.8 30 are statistical and/or clinical concerns. The statistician would report their findings to a 
closed session of the DSMB and/or NIA. Findings would be used to determine what steps 
would be taken.  
11.4 Outcomes  
11.4.1  Primary outcome s   
• Percentage of surgeons approached who agree to participate in study ( goal: 
>50%)  
• Percentage of patients contact[CONTACT_739836] (goal: 
>50%)  
• Surgeon -reported acceptability of intervention ( goal: >75% respond “Yes” to 
question regarding perceived acceptability of nudge intervention)  
11.4.2  Exploratory  outcomes   
• Mean pre -post percentage change in procedure -specific prescription size , as 
measured by [CONTACT_739837]. Mean size of post -intervention prescriptions (from 
electronic medical record queries) will be compared with mean pre -
intervention prescription size by [CONTACT_739838].  
 
• Pre-post change in patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], as measured by [CONTACT_739837]  
 
• Pre-post change in s atisfaction with overall postoperative analgesia, as 
measured by [CONTACT_4676] -reported numeric rating  scale  
 
• Pre-post change  in patient satisfaction with general amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27253]  
 
• Pre-post change in incidence of medical visits for pain (office visits, 
emergency department visits, and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614])  
 
• Pre-post change in number of subsequent opi[INVESTIGATOR_739799] (from EMR/PDMP data)  
 
• Surgeon -reported perceived usefulness of intervention (goal: median response 
to question “Do you think the nudge intervention would be useful?” ≥4 on 0 -5 
scale, where 0 is “not at all” and 5 “extremely.”  
11.5 Data Analyses  
Primary feasibility and acceptability outcomes will be assessed on a descriptive basics 
among both th e intervention and control surgeon groups (each group will be given a full 
explanation of the nature of the study following completion). After the intervention, we 
will also assess pre -post change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_739750] (measured in oral morphine 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 31 equivalents) between the two groups . We will compare postoperative prescription size 
from the baseline (surgeries performed during days 1 -60) to prescription size  for 
surgeries performed during days 108-167. The specific exploratory  outcome will be mean 
percentage change in procedure -specific prescription size. That is, mean size of post -
intervention prescriptions (from electronic medical record queries) will be compared with 
mean pre -intervention prescription size by [CONTACT_739839] n for the same procedure in 
order to calculate change from baseline. We will then compare mean per -surgeon 
percentage change in prescription size be tween the Intervention  and Control Arm s. We 
will plan a multiple regression analysis adjusting for case type and surgical specialty  to 
further explore the targeted intervention effects . 
To evaluate our other exploratory  outcomes, we will assess pre -post changes across 
groups in patient opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], satisfaction with analgesia, medical visits for pain, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666], and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724].  
Additionally , we will examine differential consent rates between patients in the follow -up 
intervention patient group vs. those in the follow -up control patient group using 
descriptive statistics. This is due to the potential for varying consent rates among patients 
who are more or less satisfied with their postoperative analgesia following delivery of the 
one-time study intervention to surgeons.  
We will not undersample or oversample surgeons  who are women and/or members of 
minority racial and ethnic groups, so we expect to enroll them in proportion to their 
population prevalence  at VUMC . We will use VUMC EMR data to assess sex/gender and 
race/ethnicity of patient participants, and will conduct analyses to investigate any 
differences between groups  (including any sex/gender or race/ethnicity differences in 
willingness to participate in the study) .  
[ADDRESS_1010839], consent, and 
interview each patient participant; they will extract pertinent information from VUMC 
EMR data (after obtaining appropriate IRB approval) into Case Report Forms utilizing a 
password -protected, encrypted REDCap database. Study team members, including the 
study biostatistician, will perform outcome assessments as described above.  
12.[ADDRESS_1010840] personnel handling study data will be certified by [CONTACT_739840] (CITI) program, which consists of courses in the Protection of 
Human Research Subjects for Biomedical Research  and Quality Contro l. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_1010841] to intervention status. Consistent delivery of the study 
interventions will be monitored throughout the intervention phase of the study.  
12.2.3  Protocol  Deviations  and Monitoring  
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial 
protocol, International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), 
or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on 
the pa rt of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of 
deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_48162].  
It will be the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to 
identify and report deviations within [ADDRESS_1010842] (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator will be responsible for 
knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements. Further details about the 
handling  of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.  
The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will 
implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to 
be at a level of concern.  
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_739800], source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of 
monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456]/funding agency, and inspection by [CONTACT_739841] y authorities.  
[ADDRESS_1010843] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications will 
be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_449498].  
13.2 Informed Consent Forms  
Electronic  patient participant consent procedures and templates will be IRB -approved and 
the participant will be asked to review their content as appropriate . The 
investigator /clinical research staff  will explain the research study to the participant and 
answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms 
suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks 
of the study and of their  rights as research participants.  Live Spanish translation services 
will be provided for  Spanish -speaking  subjects participating in the consent process that 
do not speak and/or understand English.  Participants will be informed that participation is 
volunta ry and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice, and 
that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to 
participate in this study. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions prior to 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 33 giving consent . The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the 
source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the participant 
undergoes any study -specific procedures. A copy of the  signed  informed consent 
document will be sent to the participants for their records.  
Permission to engage in deception  for surgeon participants will be obtained from the 
VUMC IRB.  
13.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Every effort will be made to avoid the risk of people not connected with the study 
learning participants' identities or personal information. The minimum necessary data 
will be extracted to address our study objectives. Study staff will protect the privacy  of 
study participants. Only designated members of the research team will have access to 
study data. Only data from eligible subjects will be analyzed. All data will be stored on 
password -protected computers and accessible only accessible to study personne l with 
appropriate password authorization. All study staff will undergo mandated VUMC 
training on appropriate research conduct, including HIPAA compliance and protection of 
participant information. These measures should be effective in minimizing breaches of 
confidentiality.  
Any data, specimens, fo rms, reports, video recordings, and other records that leave the 
site will be identified only by a participant identification number ( Participant ID, PID ) to 
maintain confidentiality.  All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  All computer 
entry and networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. Information will not be 
released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring 
by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIA, and the  OHRP . 
13.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or 
other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are 
protected.  
14 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted in accordance with VUMC’s clinical research standards that 
meet regulations relating to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). These standards adhere to the 
following guidelines:  
 
Good Clinical Practice: ICH Consolidated Guideline (International Conference on

16 PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS AND DATA SHARING  
We will adhere to the  USC  Roybal  Center Master Dissemination Plan to ensure that our 
study findings and interventions are quickly and widely shared:  
In accordance with recommended practice for clinical trials, we will register this study 
with ClinicalTrials.gov within the recommended timeframe (not later than [ADDRESS_1010844] participant). We will also ensure that resu lts 
information is submitted in adherence with the timeframes (no later than one year 
following study primary completion date) outlined in ClinicalTrials.gov policies to 
facilitate timely dissemination of study findings. Likewise, we will ensure that infor med 
consent documents include a specific statement relating to the posting of clinical trial 
information at ClinicalTrials.gov.  VUMC  also has an internal policy in place to ensure 
that clinical trials registration and results reporting occur in compliance with policy 
requirements.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the following publication and data 
sharing policies and regulations: National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access 
Policy, which ensures that the public has access to the published results of NIH funded 
research. It requires scientists to submit final peer -reviewed journal manuscripts that arise 
from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication. 
This study will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Policy on the 
Dissemination of NIH -Funded Clinical Trial Information and the Clinical Trials 
Registration and Results Information Submission rule. As such, this trial will be 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, and results information from this trial will be submitted 
to Cli nicalTrials.gov. In addition, every attempt will be made to publish results in peer -
reviewed journals. Timeframe for data sharing is discussed in the Clinical Trial 
Dissemination Plan, above. All data and resources generated through this study will be 
available for replication on a website or repository hosted on the Vanderbilt research 
cloud. This will include pi[INVESTIGATOR_739801] (with detailed information on recruitment, 
randomization, and workflow specifications), intervention language, and any other s tudy 
specific resources necessary to facilitate replication. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_739802] a timely manner, and no later than the online publication date of 
any publications related to the project. It will be available for d ownload from a repository 
hosted on the Vanderbilt research cloud, and will include a “readme” file that explains 
how a researcher can get access to the data and a description of the files and a data 
dictionary that will guide a researcher through potentia l replication of the study.  
Data will be a HIPAA -compliant, limited data set. Prior to sharing of data, data use 
agreements will be executed and data will only be made accessible to key project staff. 
 
Protocol Version 1.8 35 The data use agreement will include language requiring the user(s) to certify that no 
attempt will be made to reidentify participants from de -identified data. There are 
restrictions with sharing this data. Some data will be extracted from the BioVU electro nic 
medical record at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Data may be made available 
through data use agreements among researchers interested in using the data. Patient and 
physician data will be recorded in a secure, electronic database (REDCap), and 
maintained by [CONTACT_739842]. Data will be entered, tracked, edited, updated and reported 
by [CONTACT_094] -approved analysts with the appropriate clearance. Shared data will be fully 
deidentified following HIPAA and VUMC IRB procedures. Study documents will be 
retaine d for a minimum of 3 years after of study completion. No records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor/funding agency, if applicable.  
Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by [CONTACT_103] a nd the NIA prior to submission.

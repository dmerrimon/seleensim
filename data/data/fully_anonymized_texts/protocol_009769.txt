Study Design:  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blinded study of nivoluma b versus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_540089] ( ≥15 years) with 
complete resection Stage IIIb/c or Stage IV NED melanoma at high risk for recurrence. 
Approximately 800 subjects will be randomized 1:1 and stratifie d by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 status (positive vs negative/indeterminate) 
and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage.
Dose reductions will not be allowed.Subjects will be treated with one of the following: Arm A: ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: 10 mg/kg IV q3 weeks for 4 doses, then q12 we eks starting at Week 24 with nivolumab 
placebo IV q2 weeks Arm B: nivolumab 3mg/kg IV q2 weeks with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_540090] q3weeks for [ADDRESS_703930] withdrawal of consent with a 
maximum of 1 year of treatment.
Note: As of Dec-2016, all subjects in both treatment groups were  off study treatment.
Study Population:  High risk, completely resected Stage IIIb/c and IV melanoma subj ects.
Key Inclusion Criteria:
•At least 15 years of age
•Except: where local regulations and/or institutional policies d o not allow for subjects < 18 years of age (pediatric 
population) to participate. For those sites, the eligible subje ct population is ≥ 18 years of age.
•All subjects must be either Stag e IIIb/c or Stage IV AJCC (7th edition) and have histologically confirmed 
melanoma that is completely surgically resected in order to be eligible. Subjects must have been surgically 
rendered free of disease with negative margins on resected specimens. Please refer to  Appendix 1 for description 
of AJCC 7th editions of TNM and staging.
•If Stage III melanoma (whether Stage IIIb or IIIc) the subjects  usually have clinically d etectable lymph nodes that

Study Assessments: Recurrence-free surviv al is the primary e ndpoint of the trial. It is defined as the date between 
the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (loc al, regional or distant metastasis), new primary 
melanoma, or death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first.  Subjects will be assessed for recurrence (until local, 
regional, or distant recurrence (whichever comes first) for Stag e IV subjects and until distant recurrence for Stage III 
subjects) by [CONTACT_540114]:
•Screening. 
•Treatment Period: Every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) from first dose of study drug through 12 months (relativ e to the 
first dose of study drug)  
•Follow-up Period: 
−Every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) through 12 month s for subjects who discontinued early f rom treatmen t (relative 
to the first dose of study drug)  
−Every 12 weeks ( ±14 days) if > 12 months through 24 months (relative to the first dose of study drug)  
−Every 6 months ( ±4 weeks) if > 24 months through and up to Year 5 (relative to the  first dose of study drug).
Although surveillance assessments will not be conducted beyond Year 5, data on recurrence of melanoma 
(loco-regional and distant), as well as development of new prim ary melanomas and non-melanoma cancers 
will continue to be collected in the respective Case Report Form s for an additional 5 years, for a total study 
duration of approximately 10 years.
Statistical Considerations: 
Sample Size: The sample size is calculated to compare RFS between subjects r andomized to receive 
nivolumab vs ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Approximately [ADDRESS_703933] been ran domized to the two treatment arms in a 1:[ADDRESS_703934] 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 wit h an overall type I error of 0.05 (two-sided).
Endpoints:   
Primary Endpoint: Recurrence Free Survival in all randomized subjects is the prim ary endpoint for this study.

Secondary Endpoint: Overall survival is a key secondary endpoint. If RFS superiorit y is demonstrated, OS will be 
tested hierarchically.  
Analyses:   The primary analysis of RFS in all randomized subjects will b e conducted using a two-sided log-
rank test stratified by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 status and stage. The hazard rati o and corresponding two-sided (1-adjusted α)% 
confidence interval (CI) will be estimated using a Cox proporti onal hazards model, with treatment arm as a covariate, 
stratified by [CONTACT_540115]. RFS medians with 95% CIs and RFS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months with 95% 
CIs will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.
An interim analysis of RFS w ill be conducted af ter all subjects  have a minimum of [ADDRESS_703935] number of RFS event s using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with 
O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. No interim analysis of OS will be p erformed at this time.

This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical P ractice (GCP ), as defined by [CONTACT_20417] (ICH) and in accordan ce with the ethical principles 
underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).
The study w ill be c onducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will r eceive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorabl e opi[INVESTIGATOR_122339].
All potential serious breaches must be reported to BMS immediately. A serious breach is a breach 
of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is 
likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physic al or mental integrity of the subjects of 
the study or the scientific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.This study will not use the services of study personnel where s anctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medi cal licensure, debarment). 
2.[ADDRESS_703940]/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and  dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recrui tment materials (eg, 
advertisements), and any other written information to be provid ed to subjects. The investigator or 
BMS should als o provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the  Investigator Brochure or product labeling 
information to be provided to subjects and any updates. 
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative l etters) according to regulatory 
requirements or institution procedures.

BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Loc al) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements re quired by [CONTACT_12212], G CP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form w ill adhere to th e ethical principles that have 
their origin in the D eclaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information ab out the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study pa rticipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
2) Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally accepta ble representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s legally 
acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_35884] i nformed consent discussion. 
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_540096], prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally  acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionall y be obtained from the subject.
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new informatio n becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully  inform the subject or the subject's legally accept able representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regu latory authorities have direct 
access to subject records. 
For minors, according to local legislation, one or both parents  or a legally acceptable representative 
must be informed of the study procedures and must sign the info rmed consent form approved for 
the study prior to clinical study participation. The explicit w ish of a minor, who is capable of 
forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_334459] t o refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn 
from, the clinical study at any time should be considered by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator. 
Minors who are judged to be of an age of reason must also give their written assent.
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

Screening Phase:
•Begins by [CONTACT_52225]’s initial eligibility and si gning of the informed consent form 
(ICF).
•Subject is enrolled using the IVRS. 
•Subject is assessed for complete study eligibility within the required timeframe found in  Table 
5.1-1 .
•A pregnancy test for WOCBP shoul d be documented within [ADDRESS_703942] dose of study medication. 
•Tumor tissue must be received at the Central Laboratory for PD- L1 IHC testing in order for 
the subject to be randomized. PD-L1 status will be used as a st ratification factor. 
•If Stage III, the pathology reports of clinically detectable node(s) confirming malignancy must 
be reviewed, dated, and signed by [CONTACT_98653].

made. The subject is randomly assigned to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/ kg arm and placebo arm 
(Arm A), or the nivolumab 3 mg/kg arm and placebo arm (Arm B).
•Within [ADDRESS_703943] dose of study 
medication (Day  1 of W eek 1)
•On-study laboratory assessments should be drawn within 72 hours prior to dosing
•Adverse event assessments should be documented at each clinic visit and WOCBP must have 
a pregnancy test every four weeks ±1 week.
•PK samples and immunogenicity samples will be collected accordi ng to the schedule in  Table 
5.5-1
•Treated subjects will be evaluated for recurrence every 12 week s ±7 days 
•Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments must be completed af ter randomization, prior to 
the dose of study thera py and according to schedule in  Table 5.1-2 , Table 5.1-3 , Table 5.1-4 ,

•After completion of the first two follow-up visits, subjects wi ll be followed every 3 months for 
survival.
•Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than recur rence will continue to have 
surveillance assessments (until local, regional, or distant recur rence (whichever comes first)
recurrence for Stage IV subjects and until distant recurrence for S tage III subjects)
−Surveillance assessments should occur every 12 weeks ± [ADDRESS_703946] year after 
randomization, every 12 weeks ± 14 days during the second year,  e v e r y  
6 months ± [ADDRESS_703947] assessment at Year 5.
−Study-specified surveillance imaging assessments will be discont inued beyond Year 5. 
Data on recurrence of melanoma (loco-regional and distant), as well as development of 
new primary melanomas and non-melanoma cancers after Year 5 wil l continue to be 
collected in the respective Case Report Forms.
•Subjects will be followed for drug-related toxicities until the se toxicities resolve, return to 
baseline or are deemed  irreversible. All t oxicities will be doc umented for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_703948] dose of study medication.
•PRO instruments will be completed according to the schedule in Table 5.1-6.

•Any Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the foll owing exceptions:
−Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or l aboratory abnormalities do not  require dose omission
−Please note that endocrine abnormalities, eg, TSH depression, are not considered isolated 
laboratory abnormalities since they involve symptoms at Grade 2 .  Therefore, endocrine 
adverse events of Grade 2 should lead to dose omission
•Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related adverse event 
•Any Grade [ADDRESS_703975], ALT, or total bilirubin: 
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require dose omissio n
−If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, omit 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥2 toxicity
−If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within t he Grade 1 toxicity range, 
omit dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity
−Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnor malities that are not associated with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis do not require a dose omissi on. It is recommended that the 
BMS medical monitor be consulted f or Grade 3 amylase or lipase a bnormalities. 
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants omitting the dose of study medicatio n.
If the criteria to resume treatment (specified in  Section 4.5.6 ) are met within the dosing window 
(Day 1, Week X ± 3 days, Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48 ± 7 days), th en the dose may be given.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with adverse events that can differ in severity and 
duration than adverse events caused by [CONTACT_102439] s. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482510]-oncology agents in this protocol. Early recog nition and management of 
adverse events associated with immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. 
Management al gorithms have been developed to assist investigato rs in assessing and managing 
the following groups of adverse events: gastrointestinal, renal , pulmonary, hepatic, 
endocrinopathies, skin and neurological. The management algorith ms can be found in Appendix [ADDRESS_703976] dose (which 
includes pneumonitis, diarrhea/coli tis, hepatitis, nephritis/re nal dysfunction, rash, and endocrine 
abnormalities [adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism/thyroiditi s, hyperthyroidism, diabetes 
mellitus, and hypophysitis]), regardless of causality, for which  subjects received 
immunosuppressive med ication for treatment of  the event.  The e xception to the 
immunosuppressive medication criteria for IMAEs is endocrine ev ents

Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion inte rruption not ind icated; intervention not 
indicated)
Revised Protocol No: 06
Date: 14-Oct-[ADDRESS_703992] until recovery from sympt oms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydr amine 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 mi nutes before additional 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782].
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or i nfusion inte rrupti on but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inf lammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophy lactic medications indicated for ≤24 
hours).
Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] i nfusion, begin an IV infusion  of normal saline, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until re solution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administer ed as appropriate. If the i nfusion 
is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; 
if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may  be increased to 100% of the 
original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114569]. Administer diphe nhydramine [ADDRESS_703993] be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The  following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydr amine 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or paracetamol 325 t o 1000 mg ( acetaminophen) should be admin istered at least 30 minutes 
before additional nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782]. If n ecessary, corticosteroids 
(recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalen t) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_441803]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327620] [eg, 
renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life-threa tening; pressor or ventilat ory support 
indicated). 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Be gin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodila tors, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a

IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored unti l the investigator is comfortable 
that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102341]. 
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for t he treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain 
at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. In  the case of late-occurring 
hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or gen eralized pruritis within 1 week 
after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral a ntihistamine, or corticosteroids).
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity o f this clinical study. The management 
of adverse events for either nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_540103] e, according to the harmonized 
Revised Protocol No: 06
Date: 14-Oct-[ADDRESS_703994]'s management, 
the blind for that subject may be broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety takes priority 
over any other considerations in determining if a treatment ass ignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment,  the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it w ill alter the  subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is c learly not related to the 
investigation al product, the  problem may be properly managed by  [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly desirable that the decis ion to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the i nvestigator alw ays has ultimate authority for the 
decision to unblind. 
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency purposes sho uld be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor. For example, for subjects that have recurrence and discontinue treatment the 
investigator may require knowledge of which treatment arm they were assigned to in order to 
appropriately select any post-recurrence subsequent therapy. Se e Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
For this study, the method of unblinding is IVRS.The Principal Investigator [CONTACT_210068] d only call in for unblinding A FTER the decision to discontinue 
the subject has been made.
For information on how to unblind for emergency, please consult  the IVRS manual.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_122382].
In addition, designated staff o f [COMPANY_016] Company ma y be unblinded prio r to database 
lock to facilitate the bi oanalytical analysi s of pharmacokineti c samples and immunogenicity. A 
bioanalytical scientist in the Bioanalytical Sciences departmen t of [COMPANY_016] Company
(or a designee in the external cen tral bioanalytical laboratory ) will be unblinded to the randomized 
treatment assignments in order to minimize unnecessary bioanaly tical analysis of samples.
To further minimize bias, the sponsor central study team and the investigative clinical site staff are 
blinded to results from PD-L1 analysis.

•Records are maintain ed that allow for traceability of each cont ainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identif ication of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Stu dy Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study drug.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal  of all empty containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are

of oxygen saturation at two different activity levels is import ant because drug-related pulmonary 
toxicity can present initially as lower than baseline oxygen sa turation.  A reading at rest and on 
exertion should be obtained at each time point. The extent of th e exertion should be based on the 
judgment of the investigator, but should remain consistent for each individual subject throughout 
the study. If the  subject’s status changes, the investigator ca n alter the extent of exertion based on 
their medical j udgment. If a subject shows changes on pulse oximetry or other pulmonary related 
signs (hypoxia, fever) or sympto ms (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) consistent with possible pulmonary 
adverse events, the subject should be immed iately evaluated to r ule out pulmonary toxicity. An

5.4.1 Definitions 
Recurrence is defined as the appearance of one or more new mela noma lesions, which can be local, 
regional, or distant in location from t he primary resected site .  
Local Cutaneous Recurrence :
Local cutaneous recurrence after adequate excision of the primary melanoma is associated with 
aggressive tumor biologic features and is frequently a harbinger of metastases.
Regional Lymphatic and Nodal Recurrences:
The neoplastic nature of the re gional recurren ces should be att empted and confirmed by 
[CONTACT_27183]/cytology.

metastases can also occur distal to the site of the primary lesion as a result of reversed 
lymphatic flow.  In transit metastases occur in 10% to 15% in p atients with Stage III disease.  
Although previous staging systems distinguished between the sma ll satellitosis (within 2 cm 
of the primary tum or), pat hophysiologically these two events represent different points o n a 
continuum of the same biologic process.  When present, in transit metastases are usually 
multiple, evolve over time, and, as previously stated, are ofte n the harbinger of subsequent 
systemic disease.
•Regional Node Recurrences: Regional node failure in a previousl y dissected basin is usually 
found at the periphery of the prior surgical procedure.
Patterns of Metastases:
Melanoma is well known for its ability to metastasize to virtua lly any organ or tissue.  The most 
common initial sites of distance metastases are the non-viscera l (skin, subcutaneous tissue, and 
lymph nodes), which are recurrence sites for 42% to 59% of subj ects in various studies.  Visceral 
locations are the lung, brain, liver, gastrointestinal tract, a nd bone; the visceral sites are the initial 
sites of relapse in approximately 25% of all melanoma patients who experience recurrence.
Measurable Disease per RECIST 1.1:
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of :
•[ADDRESS_704013]/MRI scan - (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater th an 5 mm)
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions whic h cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
•[ADDRESS_704014] x-ray.
Malignant lymph nodes: to be cons idered pathologically enlarged  and measurable per 
RECIST 1.1, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_704015] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
If the measurable disease is res tricted to a solitary lesion (v isceral or nodal), its neoplastic nature 
must be confirmed either by [CONTACT_3973]/histology or by [CONTACT_540131]/MRI examination.
Nonmeasurable Disease per RECIST 1.1:
Nonmeasurable lesions include all other lesions, including smal l lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 and < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly 
nonmeasurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include: leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of

skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly ident ified by [CONTACT_236942].
Note:
•Cutaneous relapses occurring beyond the periphery of the previo us surgical bed (ie, over 2 cm) 
are considered distant metastases.
•Node relapses occurring beyond the anatomical compartment of th e dissected basins are 
considered distant metastases.
•Node relapses in nodal basins situated in a different anato mical compartment or beyond the 
previously dissected basin or in two nodal basins (even if cont iguous; ie, 2 pelvic nodal basines, 
2 mediastinal nodal basins) are considered distant metastases.
5.4.2 Methods of measurements 
•CT and MRI are an essential part of the work-up to establish recurrence. Conventional CT with 
IV contrast and MRI gadolinium should be performed with contigu ous cuts of [ADDRESS_704016] should be performed using a 3- or 5-m m contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm; this sp ecification applies to the tumors of the chest, abdomen and pel vis while head 
& neck tumors and those of the extremities usually require spec ific protocols. In each institute 
the same technique for CT/MRI should be used to characterize eac h new lesion.
−For subjects allergic to contrast media, they may have a CT perf ormed without contrast 
after discussion and agreement with the medical monitor
•PET alone will not be considered for the disease assessment. Co mplementary CT and/or MRI 
or biopsy must be performed in such cases.
•Cytology and/or histology are mandatory to confirm recurrence i n solitary or in doubtful 
lesions, cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph node lesions. Histolo gical or cytologi cal evidence 
of recurrence should be attempted in all cases except for brain metastases when safe and 
clinically feasible.  An example when obtaining a biopsy to con firm recurrence may not be 
safe and clinically feasible is brain metastases.
•Clinically detected new lesions:
−Superficial cutaneous lesions: the neoplastic nature must be confirmed by
[CONTACT_3973]/histology.
−Deep subcutaneous lesions and lymph node lesions s hould be documen ted by [CONTACT_540132]/cytological evidence should be attempted. In a bsence of pathology report, 
lesion recurrence will be documented with a CT scan/MRI.
•Tumor markers or auto-antibodies  alone cannot be used to assess  recurrence.
5.4.[ADDRESS_704017] date when recurrence was observed is taken into account regardless the method of 
assessment. Therefore recurrence will be declared for any lesion  when:
•Only imaging was performed and recurrence c onfirmed

•Only pathology was done and malignancy confirmed (in solitary o r in doubtful lesions, 
cutaneous, subcutaneous or lymph node lesions)
•Both pathology and imaging were  done and recurrence/malignancy confirmed. In this case, the 
date of whichever examination comes first is considered the date of recurrence.
Pathology reports of biopsies confirming recurrence should be s ent to a central vendor.
Note: for documentation, the date of recurrence is the date tha t the pathology and/or imaging 
confirms recurrence--not the date that the information was comm unicated to the subject.

ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (s uch as an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or no t considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent r eporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20345] (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] t o prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the defin ition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug i nduced liver injury (DILI) is  also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infect ious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, a nd potential drug induce d liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_540133], these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpoint, if death o ccurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section  6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_193581] c linical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
−routine h ealth assessment requi ring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason) .
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s or the legal representative’s written consent to participate in the study, all 
SAEs, whether related or not related to st udy drug, must be collected, including those thought to 
be associated with protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during 
the screening period and within [ADDRESS_704020] be collected tha t relate to any later protocol-
specified procedure (eg. a follow-up skin biopsy).

Clinical Protocol CA209238
BMS-936558 nivolumab
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exi sts regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrati ve section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_704021] b e recorded on the SAE Report
Form; pregnancies on a Pregna ncy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are onl y intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email o r confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission to:SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number:  Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC ), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used a nd submitted immediately, only 
in the event the electronic sy stem is unavailable for transmiss ion. When paper forms are used, the 
original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only limited information is  initially available, follow-up r eports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initia lly reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within  24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the in itial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and ReportingThe collection of nonserious AE (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) i nformation 
should begin at initiation of study drug and continue until [ADDRESS_704022] dose of study 
drug . Non-serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
withholdi ng or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at th e end of study treatment as 
Revised Protocol No: 06
Date: 14-Oct-[ADDRESS_704023] be recorded and  described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study. Every adverse event must be assessed by [CONTACT_540134]. For events which are 
potentially immune mediated, additional information will be coll ected on the subject’s case report 
form.
6.[ADDRESS_704024] result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to have study drug omitted or 
discontinued 
•Any laboratory test result abnorm ality that required the subjec t to receive specific corrective 
therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .
6.[ADDRESS_704025] immed iately notify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregn ancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee within [ADDRESS_704026] cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion 
of benefits and risk with the subject 
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and follo w-up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x-ray studies) . Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monit or of this event 
and complete and forward a Pre gnancy Surveillance Form to BMS ( or designee) within 24 hours 
of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in 
Section 6.1.1.  
Revised Protocol No: 06
Date: 14-Oct-[ADDRESS_704027] be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occ urrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
•AT (ALT or AST) elevation > [ADDRESS_704028]
AND
•Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_704029], without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),AND
•No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation a nd hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by [CONTACT_61892] a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate,  and reported accordingly. 
7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) w ill be established to provide oversight of safety and 
efficacy considerations in protocol CA209238. Additionally, the  DMC will provide advice to the 
sponsor regarding actions the co mmit tee deems necessary for the continuing protection of subjects 
enrolled in the study. The DMC w ill be charged with assessing s uch actions in light of an 
acceptable benefit/risk profile for nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The  DMC will act in an advisory 
capacity to BMS and will moni tor subject safety and evalu ate the available efficacy data for the 
study. The oncology therapeutic area of BMS has primary respons ibility for design and conduct 
of the study.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
As of Revised Protocol 06, all planned analyses were conducted based on the 48-month minimum 
follow-up database lock, whic h occurred in Jan-2020. No additio nal formal efficacy analyses will 
be conducted for new ly collected efficacy d ata. Explor atory analysis on these new efficacy d ata 
will be conducted using similar analyses described in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) for the 48-month minimum follow-up database l ock. Exploratory analyses 
will be performe d, eg, every other year, though the analysis schedule might be adjusted based on 
the additional number of events accumulated.

sided) with approximately 85% power. The number of events and p ower were calculated assuming

Approximately [ADDRESS_704031] been randomized to the two trea tment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Based 
on current accrual and revised pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]-wise accrual r ate assumptions, accrual duration was 7.5 
months. Taking into account the actual AJCC disease stage distr ibution, slower event rate, higher 
cure rates, and some early drop-out, the original planned 507 e vents might not be reached by [CONTACT_540135] (ie, after all sub jects have a minimum of 36 months of follow-up). 
Approximately [ADDRESS_704032] 85% 
power to detect a hazard rati o of 0.75 (critical hazard ratio o f 0.83) with an overall type I error of 
0.05 (two-sided). Sample size calculations for this study desig n were done using EAST 6 (v 6.3.1) 
and R.
An interim analysis of RFS will take place after all sub jects have a minimum of [ADDRESS_704033] numb er of RFS events at interim using 
Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundar ies. With an interim RFS 
analysis at 350 RFS events (about 78% information fraction), the critical h azard ratio would be 
0.78 and the type I error would be 0.022 (two-sided). The type I error to be used for final RFS 
analysis would be 0.043 (two-sided). 
8.2 Populations for Analyses
•All enrolled subjects: All subjects who signed an informed cons ent form and were registered 
into the IVRS.
•All randomized subjects: All subjects who were randomized to an y treatment arm in the study.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary endpoint is RFS. The primary endpoint of RFS will b e programmatically determined 
based on the disease recurrence date provided by [CONTACT_540136] r andomization and the da te of first recurre nce (local, regional or distant 
metastasis), new primary melanoma, or death (whatever the cause) , whichever occurs first. (Note: 
a subject who dies without reported recurrence will be consider ed to have recurred on the date of 
death.) For subjects who r emain aliv e and whose disease has not rec urred, RFS w ill be censored 
on the date of last evaluable disease assessment. For those subj ects who remained alive and had 
no recorded post-randomization tum or assessment, RFS will be ce nsored on the day of 
randomizatio n. Censoring rules for the primary analysis of RFS are presented in  Table 8.3.1-1 .

RFS, recurrence-free survival
As of Revised Protocol 06, since no study-specified surveillance assessments are to be collected 
beyond Year 5, the censoring rules for defining RFS will be diff erent from the primary definition 
above. RFS will be defined as the time between the date of rand omization and the date of first 
recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis), new primary  melanoma, or death (whatever the 
cause), whichever occurs first. (Note: A subject who dies withou t reported recurrence will be 
considered to have recurred on the date of death.) For subjects  who remain alive and whose disease 
has not recurred, RFS will be censored on the last date the sub ject was known to be alive. 
Censoring rules for the exploratory analysis of RFS are presente d in Table 8.3.1-2.

8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The first secondary endpoint (OS) is defined as the time betwee n the date of r andomization and 
the date of death. For subjects without documentation of death,  OS will be censored on the last 
date the subject was known to be alive. OS w ill be followed continuously wh ile subjects are on 
the study drug and every [ADDRESS_704034]  after subjects discontinue the 
study drug.
The second secondary endpoint (to assess the safety and tolerab ility o f nivolumab a nd ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) 
will be measured by [CONTACT_20497], serious adverse events, deaths, and laboratory 
abnormalities.
The third secondary endpoint (to evaluate PD-L1 expression as a  predictive biomarker) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_540137]-L1 expression level.
The fourth secondary objective (to evaluate HRQo L) will be measured by [CONTACT_540138]-QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL composit e scale and by [CONTACT_540139]-C30 scales in all rand omized subjects.

To evaluate PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker, a Cox p roportional hazards model will 
be used to test the interaction b etween PD-L1 expression (posit ive vs negative) and treatment arm 
for the RFS endpoint. Additionally, RFS will be analyzed within  each PD-L1 e xpression subgroup 
(positive and negative ) including log-rank tests and hazard rat ios with corresponding confidence 
intervals. RFS curves and medians will be estimated using Kapla n-Meier methodology. These 
analyses will be descriptive a nd not adjusted for multiplicity. Other exploratory analyses, such as

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete Abstinence Complete Abstinence is defined as complete a voidance of 
heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of 
contraception for all study drugs. This also means that 
abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sym ptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry 
into a clinical trial, post- ovulation met hods) and wit hdrawal, 
which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women 
must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate 
methods of highly or less effective contraception’s must be 
discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego 
complete abstinence.

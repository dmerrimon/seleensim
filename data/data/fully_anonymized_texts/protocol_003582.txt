b. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential defined as 
physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant (i.e. post-
menopausal or permanently sterile as per definitions given 
in Appendix 2). Tubal ligation or partial surgical 
interventions are not acceptable.  If indicated, as per 
investigator’s request, post-menopausal status may be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_96879]-stimulating hormone levels (according

randomization visit prior to dosing.
Study plan A total of 6 clinic visits (V0 to V5) and a follow-up call will be performed 
during the study, as follows: 
•A pre-screening visit (V0) will be carried out in order to fully explain 
the study to potential subjects, to obtain the written informed consent 
from the subject and to instruct the subject on screening visit procedures 
(such as medication restrictions). Eligible subjects entering the study 
will be instructed t o refrain from taking their current asthma medication 
morning dose in addition to rescue medication as well as all non-
permitted medications in accordance with section 5.2 unless absolutely 
necessary prior to the screening visit (V1).
•A screening visit (V1) will help establish the eligibility of subjects for 
inclusion in the study (including routine hematology and blood 
chemistry, medical history, physical examination, vital signs, a 12-lead 
ECG, spi[INVESTIGATOR_675696] 1 reversibility after albuterol intake, and 
training for the use of inhalers and diary/peak flow meter). 
•This visit will be followed by a 2-week open-label run-in period, where 
subjects entering the study on ICS/LABA therapy will be switched to a 
similar dose of extrafine BDP as the ICS dose contained in the 
ICS/LABA combination for the full run-in period. Subjects on ICS 
alone will be switched to similar dose of extrafine BDP during the run-
in. 
•After the run-in period, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 
the 2 study treatment arms (V2, Day 1). 
•After the randomization visit (V2), subjects will be assessed after 4, 8 
and 12 weeks of treatment (from V3 to V5) at the clinic. At visit 2 (Week 
0) and visit 5 (Week 12), ACQ-[ADDRESS_1031280]-dose. At Visits 3 (Week 4) and 4 (Week 8), only 
pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_10239] (i.e., no serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_91369]), pre-dose vital signs and 12 lead ECG, as well as ACQ-7 
will be performed. 
•A safety follow-up phone call will be done by [CONTACT_093] 1 week 
after V5 or Early Treatment Discontinuation visit to check the status of 
unresolved adverse events (AEs) and to record any new AEs that have 
occurred after the last visit as well as the related concomitant 
medications. 
•AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study. 
 
The study duration from V0 to V6 will be about 16 weeks. 
The subjects who discontinue study drug should not be considered 
automatically withdrawn from the study (except if the reason is consent 
withdrawal or lost to follow up). These subjects will be encouraged to remain

in the study and complete all remaining protocol-specified visits (while off 
study drug) to assess lung function, adverse events, serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and concomitant medications post investigational treatment.
Most relevant allowed 
concomitant treatmentsThe following medications are allowed during the study (run-in and 
randomization periods):
1. Inhaled short-acting β2-agonist, SABA, (albuterol) as rescue 
medication.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_1031281] be postponed. 
2. Other asthma treatments (e.g., leukotriene modifiers, theophylline) 
if already taken at stable doses for at least 2 months prior to screening 
visit (the dose must remain constant for the entire study period).
3. Nasal corticosteroids and antihistamines for the treatment of hay-
fever during the randomized treatment-period.
4. Treatment for allergic desensitization at the “maintenance” phase if 
already taken at stable doses for at least 1 month prior to screening 
visit (the dose must remain constant for the entire study period).
5. One short course (<10 days) of oral/parenteral corticosteroid and/or 
brief use of short-acting β2-agonists, and/or ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (via 
nebulizer or inhaler) and/or steroids (via nebulizer), for asthma 
exacerbation during the randomized treatment-period. 
In the case of a concomitant disease, appropriate treatment will be permitted 
if it does not interfere with the study drugs or the study evaluation parameters 
and does not qualify under the section “non permitted medications”.
Most relevant forbidden 
concomitant treatmentsThe following medications are not permitted during the study (run-in and 
randomized treatment periods). Intake of such a drug during run-in 
constitutes a screening failure and the subject will not be randomized into the 
study. If any of these medications are taken during the treatment period, the 
subject will be carefully evaluated by [CONTACT_753345], but they may remain in the study.

Sample size calculation Sample Size 
The sample size has been calculated to demonstrate the superiority of CHF 
1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD over CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD in terms of 
the primary and key secondary endpoint. 
A discontinuation rate from the randomized study drug of approximately 
10% at Week 12 has been considered. 
A total of 580 subjects will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio to either 
CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD or CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD (i.e., 290 
subjects per group). This sample size will provide, using the main estimand:
Approximately 89% power to detect a mean difference of 108mL in 
favor of CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD on change from baseline 
in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12 at a two-sided significance level of 
0.05, assuming a SD of 409mL. The assumed mean difference of 
108mL represents a weighted average between two means: a mean 
difference between groups of 120mL while on treatment (assuming 
90% of the randomized subjects) and a mean difference between 
groups of 0mL while off-treatment (assuming 10% of the 
randomized subjects).
Approximately 90% power to detect a mean difference of 117mL in 
favor of CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD on change from baseline 
in peak FEV [ADDRESS_1031284] dose at Week 12 at a two-
sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a SD of 434mL. The 
assumed mean difference of 117mL represents a weighted average 
between two means: a mean difference between groups of 130mL 
while on treatment (assuming 90% of the randomized subjects) and 
a mean difference between groups of 0mL while off treatment 
(assuming 10% of the randomized subjects).
Thus, considering the main estimand analysis, an overall study power of at 
least 80% for the primary and the key-secondary efficacy endpoint will be 
ensured.
Statistical methods Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets will be considered: 
Safety set : all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study drug (analyzed as treated).
ITT set: all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of the 
study drug (analyzed as randomized).

Main Estimand
Population: Subjects with asthma.
Treatment: Randomized study drug (CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD or 
CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD) including rescue medication and any other 
asthma treatments that may be administered during the study.
Variable: Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week  12.
Population-level summary: Adjusted between treatment difference 
comparing CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD vs. CHF 718 pMDI 800µg 
TDD.
Strategy for intercurrent events and events leading to missing data:
Early discontinuation from the randomized study drug: Data 
collected after discontinuation from the randomized study drug (i.e. 
off-treatment data) will be included in the analysis (i.e. targeting a 
treatment policy strategy).
Early discontinuation from the study: The collected off-treatment 
data observed on all subjects will be used for the imputation of 
missing data after study discontinuation for both treatment arms [1]. 
Note: In case of collection of very few off-treatment data such that the 
planned imputation cannot be performed, the imputation of missing data 
after study discontinuation will be based on the Copy Reference (CR) 
approach (i.e. considering the data distribution of the CHF 718 pMDI 800µg 
TDD arm, including both on-treatment and off-treatment data) for both 
treatment arms.
Use of not allowed medications and other important protocol 
deviations: Data will be used regardless of whether or not the 
intercurrent event occurs (i.e. targeting a treatment policy strategy).
Wrong study drug intake : If a subject takes the wrong study drug, the 
data will be analyzed as if the intercurrent event had not occurred, 
thus considering the randomized study drug (i.e. targeting a 
treatment policy strategy).

of missing data assumptions under which the conclusions change 
(i.e. under which treatment effect is no longer statistically 
significant).
Analysis
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12 will be analyzed on the 
ITT set using an ANCOVA model including treatment, US region and prior 
asthma therapy as fixed effects and baseline (i.e. pre-dose FEV 1 at Week 0) 
value as covariate. The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted 
mean difference between treatments and their 95% CIs at Week 12 will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. Superiority of CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD will 
demonstrated by a statistically significant difference between treatments at 
Week 12 (defined as p<0.05) favoring CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background Information and Study Rationale
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by [CONTACT_753348](s) [2], [3]. Airway remodeling is also a cardinal 
histologic feature of asthma [3].  The clinical presentation typi[INVESTIGATOR_232826] a history of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_374867], shortness of breath, chest tightness, or cough and 
variable airflow obstruction.  Asthma symptoms can vary over time and in intensity depending 
upon the presence of classic triggers like exercise, environmental/occupational exposures or 
viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] [4], [5].  
According to the World Health Organization, asthma affected an estimated 262 million people 
in 2019 and led to 461,000 deaths [6].  It impacts people of all races, ages and both sexes 
although there are ethnic and sex disparities with higher death rates in minority groups and in 
women [7], [8]. 
Current 
consensus guidelines for asthma management [9] have as a major goal to achieve 
disease control and to minimize future risk of asthma-related mortality, exacerbations, 
persistent airflow limitation and side effects of medications.  Figure 1 shows the step therapy 
for starting treatment in adults and adolescents who carry an asthma diagnosis.  It is apparent 
from the figure that the combination of Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) and Long Acting β2-
adrenergic receptor Agonists (LABA) plays an important role in asthma treatment as both 
maintenance and reliever therapy (MART).  Notably, formoterol is the only LABA 
recommended by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1031299].
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_753302]/LABA therapy, 30-50% of patients with asthma remain symptomatic 
and poorly controlled [10], [11], [12].  GINA 2021 guidelines recommend triple therapy 
[addition of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) to ICS-LABA] for patients ≥18 years 
old at step 5.  Evidence suggests that addition of LAMA therapy to medium or high dose 
ICS/LABA can improve lung function and in some cases, lead to a reduction in exacerbations 
[13], [14]. Single inhaler triple therapy (SITT) is more convenient for patients than taking 
multiple inhalers and can potentially improve adherence [15].  Currently there is only one SITT 
marketed in the [LOCATION_002] under the name [CONTACT_753397]® Ellipta® (fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol), a dry powder inhaler.
In January 2021, Chiesi’s SITT, CHF 5993 with the trade name [CONTACT_753398]® [medium strength 
(beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide, BDP/FF/GB 
100/6/12.5mcg) and high strength (BDP/FF/GB 200/6/12.5mcg)] pMDI was approved for the 
asthma indication in the European Union (EU).  Trimbow® is not yet approved for asthma in 
the [LOCATION_002].
A fixed dose combination (FDC) consisting of the ICS BDP at 100µg and LABA FF at 6µg 
(Foster® or CHF 1535) was developed by [CONTACT_753349] (HFA) pMDI 
solution formulation as CHF 5993, with a high extrafine inhaled particle fraction (i.e., mass 
median aerodynamic diameter [MMAD] around 1.1µm) for both active ingredients. CHF 1535 
pMDI was nationally approved in Europe for asthma in 2006.

Clinical Study Code No.: CLI-05993AB8-02 Version No. 2.0 
IND N

CONFIDENTIAL Page 23/93
The FORCE2 study was designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_753303] (FF) within BDP/FF to serve as a key pi[INVESTIGATOR_753304] 
a new drug application (NDA) for the BDP/FF/GB triple combination product for
asthma in the [LOCATION_002].
1.2 Study Rationale
CHF 1535 pMDI is a FDC consisting of the ICS beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (BDP) and the 
LABA formoterol fumarate (FF) developed by [CONTACT_753350] a high extrafine inhaled particle 
fraction (i.e. mass median aerodynamic diameter [MMAD] around 1.1 µm) for both active 
ingredients. CHF [ADDRESS_1031300] for adults with asthma in 2006 
and then, in 2014 via a Type II variation for adults with COPD under several brand names 
(Foster®, Fostair®). Currently the 100/6 mcg/actuation dose strength pMDI is approved in 77 
countries and the 200/6 mcg/actuation dose strength pMDI in 39 countries. CHF 1535 is not 
FDA-approved for any indication.
At the time of its initial development, CHF 1535 100/6μg was a new HFA134a pMDI 
formulation of known active constituents, BDP and formoterol, which were individually 
marketed as pMDIs (both CFC and HFA) and dry powder inhaler (DPI) products. A clinical 
“bridging” strategy undertaken within the CHF 1535 HFA pMDI 100/6μg clinical development 
program confirmed the suitability of the use of the comparators in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_753305]03 and CT04.  CT03 demonstrated the non-inferiority of CHF 1535 HFA pMDI 100/6μ g to 
corresponding equipotent daily doses of the free combination of BDP CFC pMDI plus 
formoterol DPI (as dry powder capsules), the superiority of CHF 1535 HFA pMDI 100/6μg 
over monotherapy with the corresponding equipotent daily dose of BDP CFC pMDI, and the 
safety and tolerability profile of CHF 1535 100/6μ g.  CT04 established the superiority of CHF 
1535 HFA pMDI 100/6μg over double the equipotent corresponding daily dose of BDP CFC 
pMDI.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 24/[ADDRESS_1031301] reimbursement. In one study, CHF 1535 100/6 
μg 2 puffs bid (total daily dose BDP/FF 400/24μg) was demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
Symbicort® Turbuhaler® DPI (Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate 640/18µg TDD) based on 
morning pre-dose peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PEF) rate in adult patients with moderate-to-severe 
asthma without any difference in frequency of AEs [16].  CHF 1535 was also found to be non-
inferior to Seretide® pMDI (Fluticasone Propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]/Salmeterol 500/100µg TDD) in a second 
phase III trial based on changes in lung function measured by [CONTACT_753351]-dose peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_17175] (PEF) rate in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [17].
The clinical program in support of the high strength CHF 1535 pMDI 200/6μg (developed as 
“step-up” in therapy in those patients not adequately controlled either on high dose ICS 
monotherapy or on moderate doses of ICS within a fixed combination ICS/LABA, with the aim 
to get better asthma control) was based on two single dose PK studies investigating the dose 
proportionality of Beclomethasone 17-Monopropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (B17MP) total systemic exposure and 
lung bioavailability, respectively, after administration of CHF 1535 at increasing dose strengths 
(BDP/FF 50/6, 100/6 and 200/6μg per actuation) in healthy subjects and on the following two 
clinical studies: 1) A 6-month study demonstrated that CHF 1535 pMDI (BDP/FF 200/6μg per 
actuation, 2 puffs bid), administered at 800/24μ g/day, is as safe as fluticasone 500μg + 
salmeterol 50μ g/actuation (Seretide®) at 1000/100μg/day in patients with severe asthma [18], 
and 2) a 12-week clinical study that established the superiority of CHF1535 200/6µg 
(800/24µg/day) vs. extrafine BDP (QVAR®, 800µg/day) in terms of the primary lung function 
outcome [19]. Although this data package was acceptable at that time for a European 
registration of the FDC BDP/FF (CHF 1535 pMDI), it does not meet today’s FDA’s 
requirement of FDC product development due to the differences in the devices between 
QVAR® and CHF 1535 pMDI. 
FORCE2 was therefore designed to fulfil the FDA’s regulatory requirement for combination 
product development in order to adequately characterize BDP/FF as an acceptable ICS/LABA 
comparator as used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_753306]/FF/GB (CHF 5993 
pMDI) [20].  If the study meets its specified primary and key secondary endpoints, it will 
provide support for the NDA for the BDP/FF/GB triple combination product for asthma in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
1.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment
1.3.1 Risk Assessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies conducted with CHF 1535 
can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. Several findings were identified as potential risks 
associated with the mono-components of CHF 1535 which will be monitored in the study. 
 
Risk of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis with ICS: Local effects of ICS include oropharyngeal 
candidiasis and assessment for this will be performed on a regular basis at each study visit.  As 
a mitigation strategy, subjects will be instructed to gargle with water and to rinse out their 
mouths each time they use their ICS.

IND N

CONFIDENTIAL Page 25/93
Risk of Systemic Effects with ICS: Systemic effects such as bone disorders, bone mineral density 
decrease and associated fractures, and cortisol suppression have been described with the use of 
corticosteroids.  Although a decrease in bone mineral density and the risk of fractures is a class 
concern for ICS containing medications, the proposed dose of inhaled BDP in this study is 
considered unlikely to have a clinically significant impact on hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_753307]-term nature of the study and the fact that the described systemic 
effects will be monitored during ongoing assessment of AEs and SAEs. In addition, systemic 
ocular effects of corticosteroids, including glaucoma and cataract formation, have been 
described although these effects are much less likely to occur with inhaled corticosteroids 
compared with oral corticosteroids and will be monitored during AE/SAE reviews.
Risk of Cardiovascular Events with LABAs: Cardiovascular events are a documented class
effect associated with LABAs, including FF. The randomized controlled trial, TRIGGER, 
provides extensive long-term safety data to support the safety of FF 24µg TDD when used as a 
component of BDP/FF in subjects with uncontrolled asthma using high dose ICS in 
combination with a LABA [20].  This high range of ICS dose is consistent with other FDA-
approved ICS/LABA combination products for asthma (e.g., DULERA®, SYMBICORT®, 
ADVAIR® DISKUS®, and BREO® ELLIPTA®).  To mitigate potential cardiovascular risks 
associated with FF, subjects with clinically significant cardiovascular disease (as outlined in 
section 4.3, Exclusion Criteria) will be excluded from the study and ECGs and vital sign 
assessments will be performed as per protocol.
1.3.2 Benefit Assessment
A previously completed 12-week, multinational ex-US randomized phase III study with CHF 
1535 demonstrated the clinical benefit of using pMDI BDP/FF 200/6µg (two actuations bid) 
compared to BDP 100μ g (QVAR®, four actuation bid) in a population of 376 adult asthmatics 
not adequately controlled with high dose of ICS or medium dose of ICS plus LABA (the 
primary endpoint was improvement in lung function) [19].  BDP/FF and BDP showed a 
comparable safety profile, with no adverse events of clinical concern observed with either 
treatment.  CHF1535 is commercialized as Foster® in more than 50 countries ex-US since it 
launched 15 years ago.
1.3.3 Overall Risk: Benefit Conclusion
Current risks that have been identified for the BDP/FF (200/6μg) combination are based on
the known pharmacology of the individual active components BDP and FF. These include risks 
of oropharyngeal candidiasis, ocular effects and bone disorders/fractures from ICS and the risk 
of adverse cardiovascular effects from LABA. The BDP/FF combination is widely 
commercialized ex-US.  A comprehensive safety monitoring strategy is being proposed for all 
the risks. Given the overall clinical experience with BDP and FF and the fact that that the 
associated risks with these compounds are anticipated from their known pharmacology, the 
risk: benefit ratio of using CHF 1535 in subjects with asthma on medium or high-dose ICS in 
order to provide support for the NDA for the BDP/FF/GB triple combination product for asthma 
seems justified.

PopulationSubjects with asthma. Further details about the population are 
provided in Section 4.
TreatmentsRandomized study drug (CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD vs. CHF 
718 pMDI 800µg TDD) including rescue medication and any other 
asthma treatments that may be administered during the study.
Variable Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12.
Early discontinuation from the randomized study drug: Data 
collected after discontinuation from the randomized study drug (i.e. 
off-treatment data) will be included in the analysis (i.e. targeting a 
treatment policy strategy).
Early discontinuation from the study: The collected off-treatment 
data observed on all subjects will be used for the imputation of 
missing data after study discontinuation for both treatment arms [1]. 
Note: In case of collection of very few off-treatment data such that 
the planned imputation cannot be performed, the imputation of 
missing data after study discontinuation will be based on the Copy 
Reference (CR) approach (i.e. considering the data distribution of 
the CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD arm, including both on-treatment 
and off-treatment data) for both treatment arms.
Use of not allowed medications and other important protocol 
deviations: Data will be used regardless of whether or not the 
intercurrent event occurs (i.e. targeting a treatment policy strategy).Strategy for

3. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, 2-arm parallel group study to 
demonstrate the superiority of CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg total daily dose (TDD) compared 
to CHF 718 pMDI 800µg in terms of change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12 at Week 12.  
Approximately 580 subjects over the age of 18 will be randomized into the study.  
A total of 6 clinic visits (V0- V5) and a follow-up call (V6) will be performed during the 
study as noted in section 7.  
Screened subjects who were on a medium dose ICS or medium dose ICS-LABA prior to the 
study will be put on CHF 718 pMDI 100µg 2 inhalations BID (TDD 400µg) during the 2-
week run in period.  Screened subjects who were on a high dose ICS prior to the study will be

Exclusion criteria # 1, 2, 4, 5, [ADDRESS_1031311] who discontinues study drug should not be considered automatically withdrawn 
from the study (except if the reason is consent withdrawal or lost to follow up). The 
investigator and study staff must discuss with the subject who will be asked to continue 
attending the remaining study visits while off study drug.
Protocol Defined Criteria for Discontinuation from Study Drug:
Occurrence or initiation of an adverse event, non-permitted concomitant medication, 
pregnancy, premature unblinding or other event at the investigator’s discretion, for which 
remaining on study drug would create a safety risk for the subject. Any of the criteria listed in 
protocol section 4.5 may lead to discontinuation from study drug.
In accordance with ICH E9-R1 and corresponding guidance from regulatory agencies it is 
understood by [CONTACT_96910]; therefore, unnecessary withdrawals of subjects should be avoided.
However, should a subject discontinue the study drug, all efforts will be made to complete the 
study procedures per protocol and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.
It will be the Investigator’s judgement to withdraw the subject from the study drug if he/she 
deems it will place the subject at undue risk by [CONTACT_753354]/her participation.

will be performed: 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (pre/post of the subject’s maintenance inhaled therapy for asthma, 
including the serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_753309]).
The subject should continue to complete eDiary data (except for the study drug 
questions) and to measure PEF at home.
The investigator (or designee) will check the concomitant medications and adverse 
events that occurred since last visit.
Urine or serum pregnancy tests in all women of childbearing potential.
Questionnaires- subjects will complete the ACQ-7 questionnaire (section 7.2.1).
4.[ADDRESS_1031313] be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:
The subject is lost to follow-up
The subject withdraws consent  
The subject experiences an adverse event which makes participation in the study not 
possible
Chiesi or the regulatory authorities or the Institutional Review Board(s),  for any 
reason, terminates the entire study, or terminates the study for this trial site or this 
particular subject. 
The subject is unwilling or unable to adhere to the study requirements, i.e. non-
compliance. 
It is understood by [CONTACT_96910]; therefore, unnecessary withdrawals of subjects should be avoided. Every effort 
will be made to retain the subject in the study.
The investigator must document the reason (if specified by [CONTACT_423]) for withdrawal of 
consent in the eCRF. Subjects who wish to withdraw from further participation in the study 
should be encouraged to return to the clinic as soon as possible to complete the Early 
Termination Visit and to complete the follow-up phone call in order to collect important safety 
information. If a subject is lost to follow-up or withdraws consent no further information will 
be collected.
If a subject is withdrawn/dropped-out of the study, the subject number should not be reassigned 
to another subject.  
The investigator is responsible for the optimal individual treatment prescription after the study 
discontinuation. The post study drug asthma medications should be recorded in the eCRF.

The evaluation of compliance will be done using the following formula:
 
The total number of scheduled doses will be calculated on the basis of the extent (days) of 
exposure of each subject. A range of 65-135 % will be taken into account for a satisfactory level 
of compliance, while a level of compliance equal or superior to 50 % will be considered as 
satisfactory for the run-in medication. Subjects with compliance levels less than 75% will 
receive additional coaching from the site staff. 
To optimize subjects’ compliance to study medication, a compliance check using metrics will 
be periodically reviewed. 
6.[ADDRESS_1031331]/Investigator will be responsible for the safe storage of all medications assigned 
to this study, in a secure place with restricted access, and maintained within the appropriate 
ranges of temperature.
Handling of the study drugs must be according to the package instruction leaflets. A package 
leaflet will be included in each kit.
• Run-in and Treatment kits 
Run-In and Treatment kits must be stored between 2˚C (36˚F) and 8˚C (46˚F) by 
[CONTACT_753362]/investigator at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753314].
At the clinic visit, the kit to be dispensed must be removed from the refrigerator before priming 
and administration.  Once dispensed, the subjects will be instructed to keep the box at ambient 
temperature not above 25°C (77 ˚F).  At this temperature condition the residual shelf life of the 
pMDI kits will be three months (90 days).  Therefore, the pharmacist/investigator must write 
the use-by-date on the labels of each pMDI once the kit is removed from the refrigerator, before 
assigning it to the subject.  The use-by-date corresponds to the dispensing date plus three 
months (90 days). Please note that the use-by-date must not exceed the total shelf life of the 
product.
• Training Kits 
Training kits must be kept on site and not dispensed to the subjects. Training kits must be stored 
between 2˚C (36 ˚F) and 8˚C (46 ˚F) by [CONTACT_753362]/investigator and they must be removed from

A pre-screening visit (Visit 0) will be carried out in order to fully explain the study to potential 
eligible asthmatic subjects. The investigator or his/her designee should provide the subject with 
ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the trial and to decide whether or not to 
participate.
If subject agrees to participate, the signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before 
any study related procedures.
This visit can be the same day as Visit 1 (V1) if the washout period has been respected.  
The following procedures will take place:
As soon as the informed consent is signed, the investigator (or his/her designee) will 
connect to IRT to assign a unique subject number. This number will be sequentially 
assigned.
Demographic data: Recording of demographic data including sex, race date of birth 
(real or dummy depending on country privacy restrictions) and height (for spi[INVESTIGATOR_753317]), and childbearing potential status (for female only).
Before leaving the site:
An appointment for Visit 1 will be made within 1 week (maximum) in the morning. 
A subject card with the Investigator’s contact [CONTACT_96933].
Subjects will be instructed:
oTo fast overnight (at least 8 hours) before the next visit in order to perform blood 
sampling (only water is allowed);
oTo refrain from taking their current asthma regimen morning dose before the 
screening visit.
oTo refrain from taking rescue medications (albuterol), caffeinated substances in 
the 6 hours preceding the next visit, and to abstain from all non-permitted 
medications in accordance with section 5.2 unless absolutely necessary.
Note: Visit [ADDRESS_1031335] has not taken his/her usual 
asthma treatment when he/she arrives at the clinic, the wash-out period is respected as well

Medical History: The medical history including asthma history will be recorded.
Smoking history: smoking status with all the data needed to calculate the pack year will be 
recorded.
Previous and concomitant medication: all medications taken by [CONTACT_753365] 3 
months will be recorded. Intake of non-permitted medication constitutes non-eligibility 
criterion for enrollment in the study.
Adverse Events (AEs): The occurrence of any AE between informed consent signature [CONTACT_753399]. In case of any clinically significant abnormality revealed 
during the physical examination or screening procedures, it will be recorded in the subjects’ 
medical history, unless its onset date is after the informed consent signature [CONTACT_753400] a pre-existing condition. In this case it will be recorded as an AE.
A full physical examination ( section 7.2.4) will be performed.
Oropharyngeal examination (section 7.2.4)
Vital Signs: Pre-bronchodilator vital signs will be recorded (pulse rate, systolic [SBP] and 
diastolic [DBP] blood pressure, after [ADDRESS_1031337], in sitting position) (section 7.2.2). 
12-Lead ECG: Single pre-bronchodilator 12-lead ECG will be recorded after at least [ADDRESS_1031338] (section 7.2.3). 
Eligible subjects must have a mean QTcF ≤450 ms (males) and ≤470 ms (female). (criterion 
not applicable for subjects with pacemaker or permanent atrial fibrillation) (exclusion 
criterion #14).
Blood samples:  A blood sample will be collected before albuterol administration and after 
an overnight fasting for the assessments of:
standard hematology and blood chemistry;
serum β-HCG  tests in women of childbearing potential.
The blood samples must be collected after vital signs and 12-lead ECG recording. The

7.2 Study Assessments and Procedures
7.2.1 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7)
Asthma control will be evaluated by [CONTACT_753367]© 
(ACQ-7) [21], [22]. The ACQ-[ADDRESS_1031349] 6 items of the questionnaire refer to symptoms and rescue use in the previous 
7 days while the 7th item (related to FEV 1), is completed by [CONTACT_49885].
The ACQ-7 is administered at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 5/ET. 
Subjects are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respond 
to the symptom and bronchodilator use questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6= 
maximum impairment).
Item 7 should be populated using the pre-dose FEV 1 % predicted (-15 minutes from V2 to 
V5). If the -15 minute FEV1 % predicted is missing, the -[ADDRESS_1031350] before the 
pulmonary function testing, only question 7 will be completed after the testing.
The investigator (or designated site-personnel) should check that all items have been completed 
by [CONTACT_423], but the response to each item should not be questioned. 
Missing data should be avoided; therefore, the investigator (or designated site-personnel) will 
check the questionnaire for completeness before the subjects leave the clinic and if necessary, 
encourage the subjects to complete any missing responses. Anyway, the response to each item 
should not be questioned. 
The ACQ-[ADDRESS_1031351] five questions of the ACQ-7 questionnaire administered to subjects.
7.2.2 Vital signs
Pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) will be measured after [ADDRESS_1031352] 
in sitting position:
Visit 1 - pre-albuterol 
Visit 2 & [ADDRESS_1031353]-dose
Visit 3 & 4 pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]
ET visit (if applicable, pre-dose)
The vital signs should be assessed before the blood sampling.

7.2.3 12-lead ECG
A centralized vendor will provide standardized ECG equipment to all the sites.  A 12-lead ECG 
will be performed at the site for eligibility check (all subjects). The evaluation will be done by 
[CONTACT_779].
Visit 1 - pre-albuterol 
Visit 2 & [ADDRESS_1031354]-dose
Visit 3 & 4 pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]

Before recording, subjects should be resting in a quiet setting with minimal stimulation (e.g. no 
television, loud music, computer games) and in a resting position for [ADDRESS_1031355] be performed (with the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) before the 
blood sampling.
Standard electrode placement will be used for these ECG, including placing the limb leads, dual 
snap electrodes will be used for the precordial leads. 
Single 12-lead ECG tracing will be recorded according to the study schedule. QTc value will 
be calculated using the Fridericia formula (Fridericia-corrected QTc=QT/3√RR). It will be 
calculated automatically by [CONTACT_4635]. Heart rate (HR), PR and QRS values will be also 
evaluated from ECG at all visits.
ECGs with computerized protocol interpretation are considered normal if: 
-45≤ Heart rate ≤110 bpm
- 120 ms ≤ PR ≤210 ms
- QRS ≤120 ms
ECG will be evaluated and interpreted at ERT and in case of any abnormality requiring urgent 
action ECG should be also evaluated on site (before sending to central vendor).
In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities (as reported by [CONTACT_093]) not set as 
exclusion criteria, the inclusion of the subjects will be judged by [CONTACT_753368]. ECG abnormalities in eligible subjects may be 
investigated at all times by [CONTACT_753369]. In any case, the trace must have 
QTcF values ≤ 450ms (males) and ≤ 470ms (females) at screening and randomization. The 
final decision for enrollment would be documented in the source documentation.
Clinically significant abnormalities evaluated by [CONTACT_301802] 1 not due to a pre-
existing condition or clinically significant changes at subsequent visits, in the medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574], will be reported as adverse events in the eCRF.

cardiovascular, renal and urinary, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and nervous 
systems will be performed at the site by [CONTACT_1719]. 
Oropharyngeal Examination:
Oropharyngeal candidiasis is a condition commonly associated with the use of ICS and is 
caused by [CONTACT_96938]. This side effect may be attributed to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_753322] [23]. Generalized immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory 
effects of steroids are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of candidiasis [24]. 
The subject’s mouth and throat will be visually inspected by [CONTACT_63376] V1- V5/ET to 
look for the presence of characteristic-looking white lesions / oral thrush. If deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_96940], the suspected lesion should be swabbed/scraped 
with a sterile cotton and the tissue sample sent to a laboratory for microscopic and culture 
identification.  
Appropriate treatment of oropharyngeal thrush (e.g. using topi[INVESTIGATOR_96838]-fungal 
agents) can be prescribed at the discretion of the study investigator as deemed necessary 
throughout the study.
7.2.[ADDRESS_1031356] will be administered at V1 to V4 (V5 only if serum is not collected) for 
WOCBP, using a commercial urine β-HCG pregnancy test strip. This test strip is used to obtain 
a quick (within a few minutes), visual, qualitative result for the early detection of pregnancy. 
The test performed at V1 will allow confirmation that the woman tested is not pregnant before 
the serum pregnancy results are made available by [CONTACT_2237].  
7.2.6 Blood Hematology and Chemistry
Blood samples of approximately 9 mL (total) will be collected at the site for hematology and 
serum chemistry, after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_1031357] in women

7.2.7 Daily PEF measurements with Electronic Peak Flow Meter
PEF (L/min) will be monitored twice daily in the morning and in the evening (during the run-
in and the study periods, from V1 to V4) by [CONTACT_753371] a portable electronic Peak 
Flow Meter. 
This will be done before the intake of the study drug for both morning and evening PEF 
assessments.
A specific question will be included in the eDiary to ask if PEF measurements have been 
performed before the intake of study medication.
Subjects will be educated on the purpose and technique of PEF measurements. Specific 
instructions for use will be made available to the subjects.
During each measurement session (morning or evening before the intake of the study drug) the 
subjects will perform 3 blows. Data will be recorded in the device.
Morning measurements should be done between approximately 7:00 am and 9:00 am and 
evening measurements should be done between approximately 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm. An alarm 
will remind the subjects to perform measurements.
Data from the Peak Flow Meter will be automatically transmitted from subjects’ home to ERT’s 
central database on a daily basis. A regular check of the recorded data will be done by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) through a dedicated portal to verify the correct use of the device, to 
detect any clinical abnormality and to check subjects’ compliance. In case of poor compliance

The derived variable of asthma control days will be calculated according to the following 
definition (both the two conditions below should occur to define an asthma control day): 
Days (night-time plus daytime) with a total asthma symptom score = 0.
Days with no rescue medication use.
7.2.[ADDRESS_1031359]. Subjects will be instructed 
on recognition of symptoms and signs signaling a developi[INVESTIGATOR_753323].
Asthma exacerbations (as per ATS/ERS guidelines and Virchow paper [25], [26]) are defined 
as follows: 
A moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as ≥ 1 of criteria fulfilled and leading to a change 
in treatment*:
a) Nocturnal awakening(s) due to asthma requiring SABA for 2 consecutive nights or 
increase of ≥ 0.75 from baseline in daily symptom score on 2 consecutive days.
b) Increase from baseline in occasions of SABA use on 2 consecutive days (minimum 
increase: 4 puffs/day)
c) ≥ 20% decrease in PEF from baseline on at least 2 consecutive mornings/evenings 
or ≥ 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline
d) Visit to the ER/trial site for asthma treatment not requiring systemic corticosteroids
* A sustained increase of at least 1 puff of SABA for 2 consecutive days is considered 
as a change in treatment. Asthma worsening requiring the initiation of treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids for < 3 days is considered a moderate exacerbation.

Note: courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more should be treated as separate 
severe exacerbations. A severe exacerbation requiring an emergency room visit or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753324]. Asthma worsening treated with depot 
corticosteroids (for sustained systemic effect of at least 3 days) are considered as severe 
exacerbations.
Eligible subjects should remain free of exacerbation requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room 
admission or use of systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening and during the 
run-in period (according to exclusion criterion #4).
During the run-in period, if the subject experiences any asthma exacerbation the subject will 
not be randomized in the study. In this case, the subject could be re-selected at a later stage (one 
month minimum after recovering) with a new subject number (the subject should sign a new 
informed consent), providing the subject meets the inclusion criteria for the study according to 
the investigator. 
After randomization, if the subject experiences a severe asthma exacerbation requiring systemic 
corticosteroid and/or use of nebulizer containing β2-agonists and/or corticosteroids and/or 
antibiotic therapy, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753325], the following study visit should only 
occur after subject’s stabilization. In addition, a minimum timeframe of [ADDRESS_1031361] 
from the study treatment.
At each visit (starting Visit 1), the investigator will assess the occurrence of any asthma 
exacerbation since the last visit. If not already notified by [CONTACT_423], the investigator will also 
check whether the subject has taken systemic corticosteroids meeting the criteria for a severe 
exacerbation or whether the subject has been in the emergency room or been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753326]. 
The investigator should detect any asthma worsening during the study and decide whether to 
ask the subjects to come to the clinic for an unscheduled visit and whether the subjects are 
experiencing a moderate or severe exacerbation as per protocol definitions.
The investigator is supported in the detection of asthma worsening by [CONTACT_753374].  
In case of asthma exacerbations during the study, the subjects will be allowed to receive short 
courses (≤ 10 days) of systemic corticosteroids (section 5.1). 
The intake of study medication should be maintained in case of asthma exacerbation to the 
extent possible. Only in case of absolute need, a temporary discontinuation of study treatment 
intake no longer than 2 weeks is allowed (if longer, the subjects will be withdrawn). The

necessary unscheduled visit will be performed in order to evaluate the subjects’ clinical 
condition. 
In the recovery period from the exacerbation epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], if the condition of the subjects allows, 
every possible effort should be made to remove all additional medications used in the treatment 
of the exacerbation and to restart the treatment of the subjects according to the protocol as early 
as possible.
An asthma exacerbation is not a reason to withdraw the subject from the study treatment, unless 
the investigator deems it necessary.  The decision to withdraw the subject from the study drug 
will be at the investigator’s discretion, however the subject may stay on study, but off study 
drug.
Asthma exacerbations interpreted as due to lack of efficacy of the study medication should not 
be classified as “drug related.”
7.2.10 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_753327] [27]. All sites will be provided with a spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]. It is 
recommended that, in each center, the same spi[INVESTIGATOR_753328] a given subject during the 
course of the study. Calibration of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_753329] (to the extent possible) at each visit prior to any spi[INVESTIGATOR_753330].

Throughout the study, the clinic visits and the lung function measurements will start in the 
morning between 7:00 and 09:[ADDRESS_1031363].
The following parameters will be recorded at Visits V1 to V5/ET (if applicable):
Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_96843] 1st second (FEV 1, L)
Forced Vital Capacity (FVC, L)
Predicted values of FEV 1 and FVC will be calculated according to formulas reported by [CONTACT_753375] [28]. 
Subjects should be relaxed (shoulders down and relaxed) with the nose clipped after at least [ADDRESS_1031364] and asked to breathe regularly for several breaths until the end expi[INVESTIGATOR_753332] (this usually requires at least three tidal maneuvers).  They are then urged to

adequate test requires a minimum of 3 acceptable FVC maneuvers [27]. Acceptable 
repeatability, for the purposes of this study, is achieved when the difference between the two 
largest FEV [ADDRESS_1031367] FVC values is ≤ 200mL). If these criteria are not met in 3 
maneuvers, additional trials should be attempted, up to, but usually no more than 8.
The rescue medication (albuterol) must be withheld as much as possible for at least 6 
hours prior to starting the pre-dose assessment at each visit.
The run-in or the study drug should not be taken at home in the morning of the visit. If 
the drug is taken at home, the measurements should be deferred (i.e. the visit needs to be 
re-scheduled to take place within 2 days). If rescue or study drug intake occurs again in the 
previous 6 hours before the re-scheduled visit:

The daily use of rescue medication will be recorded as follows: the number of puffs taken during 
the night will be recorded each morning on awakening before taking the morning dose of the 
study drug while the number of puffs taken during the day will be recorded each evening before 
taking the evening dose of the study drugs.
In case of Early Treatment Discontinuation, if the subject agrees to continue with the study 
assessments as planned in the study protocol, the daily use of rescue medication will continue

9.2 COVID-19 Infection 
COVID-19 is a contagious illness caused by a coronavirus.  It may present with a wide range 
of symptoms from mild to severe and the investigator/site staff should maintain vigilance in 
detecting these symptoms which include, but are not limited to cough, shortness of breath, 
difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell.  
A person can become infected from respi[INVESTIGATOR_753334], sneezes, or talks or from inhalation of the aerosolized particles that may linger in the 
air for extended periods of time. One may also be able to get it by [CONTACT_354133] a surface or object 
that has the virus on it, and then by [CONTACT_753377], nose, or eyes. Everyone is at risk of 
getting COVID-19. Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical 
conditions may be at higher risk for more severe illness.
The investigator/site staff must take all necessary precautions to minimize and avoid the risk of 
transmission and exposure to study subjects and site staff, according to local guidelines. 
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_753378]-19 in 
accordance with local diagnostic guidelines. Documentation of testing and results obtained 
outside the clinical site, should be collected within 14 days of confirmed diagnosis (or whenever 
possible) and recorded in the eCRF. All incidences of COVID-[ADDRESS_1031371] or discontinuation of study treatment.  It will be up to the investigator’s judgement 
to withdraw the subject from the study if he/she deems that remaining in the study will place 
the subject and/or the clinical site at undue risk by [CONTACT_753379].  All efforts 
should be made to keep the subject on study treatment, if possible. 
In case study visits or procedures are modified or missed due to COVID-19, the relevant 
information will be recorded in the eCRF.  
To date, there are several vaccines approved for prevention of COVID-19 caused by [CONTACT_7544]-
CoV-2. For all confirmed cases of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1031372] be recorded in the eCRF.
10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
10.1 Definitions
An Adverse Event  is “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment”.
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
An Adverse Drug Reaction is an “untoward and unintended responses to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered”.
Clinical
 Study Protocol
Clinical Study Code No.: CLI-05993AB8-02 Version No. 2.0 
IND N
o.: 153868 Date: 01Jun2023
CONFIDENTIAL Page 69/[ADDRESS_1031373] qualify as adverse reactions. The 
expression “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts 
(evidence), or arguments meant to suggest a causal relationship.
The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, 
including misuse and abuse of the product.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence or effect that at any dose falls in one or more of the following categories:
- Results in death
Death is not an adverse event but an outcome. It is the cause of death that should be regarded 
as the adverse event. The only exception to this rule is “sudden death” where no cause has been 
established; in this latter instance, “sudden death” should be regarded as the adverse event and 
“fatal” as its reason for being serious.
- Is life-threatening
Life-threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event (e.g., aplastic anemia, acute renal failure, and anaphylaxis). The term does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
- Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96855] a situation whereby [CONTACT_753380][INVESTIGATOR_307], usually for purpose of investigating and/or treating the AE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_721182] a medical condition that occurs on an “elective” or 
“scheduled” basis or for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study should 
not necessarily be regarded as an AE. Complications that occur during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is an SAE. Emergency room visits 
that do not result in a formal admission into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753335] (e.g., life-threatening; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
medically significant).
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
The term significant disability should be viewed as any situation whereby [CONTACT_96951] a clinically 
important effect on the subject’s physical or psychological well-being to the extent that the 
subject is unable to function normally.
- Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
-Is a medically significant adverse event
This criterion allows for any situations in which important adverse events/reactions that are not 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753336]’s health or may require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 70/[ADDRESS_1031374] of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
A Non-Serious Adverse Event/Non-Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is an adverse event or 
adverse drug reaction that does not meet the criteria listed above for a serious adverse 
event/serious adverse drug reaction.
10.2 Expectedness
An expected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent 
with the applicable reference safety information (included in the Investigator’s Brochure for 
CHF 1535 pMDI and CHF 718 pMDI). Otherwise, it is considered unexpected.
Reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented serious adverse drug reaction constitute unexpected events. For example, an event 
more specific or more severe than described in the reference safety information would be 
considered as “unexpected”. Examples of such events are: (a) acute renal failure as a labeled 
ADR with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report 
of fulminant hepatitis.
In the event an exacerbation is interpreted as due to lack of efficacy, it should not be classified 
as drug related.
10.[ADDRESS_1031375] be rated on a 3-point scale of increasing intensity:
Mild: The event causes a minor discomfort or does not interfere with daily activity of the 
subject or does not lead to either modification of test treatment dosage or establishment 
of a correcting treatment.
Moderate: The event perturbs the usual activity of the subject and is of a sufficient 
severity to make the subject uncomfortable. The event leads to a diminution of dosage of 
the test treatment, or a temporary interruption of its administration or to the establishment 
of a correcting treatment.
Severe: The event prevents any usual routine activity of the subject and causes severe 
discomfort. It may be of such severity to cause the definitive interruption of test treatment.
10.4 Causality Assessment
The following “binary” decision choice will be used by [CONTACT_96952]:

The expression “reasonable possibility of relatedness” is meant to convey, in general, that there 
are facts (evidence) or arguments meant to suggest a causal relationship.
The Investigator will be asked to consider the following before reaching a decision on causality 
assessment:
Time relationship between study drug intake and event’s onset;

Up to the closure of the site, SAE reports should be reported to the Parexel Safety Contact. 
New serious adverse events occurring after the site is closed should be reported directly 
to the Chiesi Safety Contact.
10.10 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and IRBs
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs/IND safety reports which occur with the investigational medicinal products within 
or outside the concerned clinical trial, if required, will be reported to Regulatory Authority  in 
compliance with the timelines and standards for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs/IND safety reports set out 
in the 21CFR Part 312.32 IND Safety Reporting and linked FDA guidance [Guidance for 
Industry and Investigators, Safety Reporting Requirements for INDS and BA/BE Studies] and 
according to local reporting requirements. 
Investigational Review Boards/Ethic Committees and Investigators will also receive the report, 
if required. 
With regard to regulations in force for Pharmacovigilance, the Investigator must fulfill his/her 
obligation according to the law in force in his country.
10.11 General Notes
In case of death, a comprehensive narrative report of the case should be prepared by [CONTACT_753381], retaining a copy on site.
If an autopsy is performed, copy of autopsy report should be actively sought by [CONTACT_753382], retaining a copy 
on site.
All documents provided by [CONTACT_753383]. All personal subject’s data must 
be redacted.
In case of pregnancy, the subject will be immediately discontinued from the study drug 
and she will be asked (with a separate consent) to be followed with due diligence until 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known and until the age of one year to detect any 
congenital anomaly or birth defect. The pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_249305] 24 hours by [CONTACT_6791]/e-mail/via Monitor to the Parexel Safety Contact [CONTACT_753384]. The Parexel Safety Contact [CONTACT_753385].

collected in specific sections relative to the pregnancy will be recorded in the form only 
upon signature [CONTACT_753401] [CONTACT_423]/subject’s partner. The third page will be 
completed as soon as the investigator has knowledge of the pregnancy outcome, together 
with a follow-up of the first two pages, if necessary (e.g. an update in the medications 
received during pregnancy by [CONTACT_23169]). If it meets the criteria for immediate

classification of a SAE (e.g. spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) the Investigator should follow the procedure for 
reporting SAEs. 
If it is the partner, rather than the subject, who is found to be pregnant, the same procedure 
regarding pregnancy reporting is to be followed and the Pregnancy Report Form should 
be completed, but the subject participating to the study should not be discontinued from 
the study. 
If the pregnancy is discovered before taking any dose either of study drug or of the run-
in/rescue medication, or if the pregnancy occurs after the follow-up call (i.e, at least [ADDRESS_1031378] study drug intake) the pregnancy does not need to be reported and 
followed.
Any Adverse Drug Reaction occurring with any marketed non-investigational medicinal 
product and/or concomitant medication during the study must be reported by [CONTACT_6973]/her concerned Health Authority and/or to the relevant Marketing 
Authorisation Holders of the involved medicinal products, according to the applicable 
laws. Additionally, also conditions of use outside the marketing authorisation of the 
medicinal products (i.e. off-label, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors) or from 
occupational exposure, as well as cases of suspected drug interaction, pregnancy, breast-
feeding exposure and lack of efficacy should be reported.
11. DATA MANAGEMENT
An electronic CRF (eCRF) will be filled-in by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her representative 
designee.
All subjects who sign the informed consent will be databased. For subjects who are screened 
but not randomized a minimum set of information is required: date of informed consent signed, 
demography, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria when applicable, primary reason for 
not continuing, adverse events and concomitant medications if taken due to an adverse event or 
if they are the reason of discontinuation.
Front-end edit checks will run at the time of data collection and back-end edit checks will be 
used by [CONTACT_753387].
Medical history, adverse events and concomitant procedures will be coded using the MedDRA 
dictionary; medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary and Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC).
External data (ECG readings, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], laboratory samples, eDiaries, electronic 
questionnaires and IRT) will be processed centrally, sent to the designated CRO and reconciled 
with the corresponding information recorded in the CRF. Access to electronic systems used for 
data collection will be granted to the study personnel only after appropriate training.
After the completion of data collection and cleaning, a review meeting will be held to determine 
the occurrence of any protocol violation and to define the subject populations for the analysis. 
Once the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, the 
randomization codes will be opened, and the planned statistical analysis will be performed.

12. STATISTICAL METHODS
12.1  Sample Size
The sample size has been calculated to demonstrate the superiority of CHF 1535 pMDI 
800/24µg TDD over CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD in terms of the primary and key secondary 
endpoint. 
A discontinuation rate from the randomized study drug of approximately 10% at Week 12 has 
been considered. 
A total of 580 subjects will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio to either CHF 1535 pMDI 
800/24µg TDD or CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD (i.e., 290 subjects per group). This sample size 
will provide, using the main estimand:
Approximately 89% power to detect a mean difference of 108 mL in favor of CHF 1535 
pMDI 800/24µg TDD on change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12 at a two-
sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a SD of 409 mL. The assumed mean 
difference of 108 mL represents a weighted average between two means: a mean 
difference between groups of 120 mL while on treatment (assuming 90% of the 
randomized subjects) and a mean difference between groups of 0 mL while off-
treatment (assuming 10% of the randomized subjects).
Approximately 90% power to detect a mean difference of 117 mL in favor of CHF 1535 
pMDI 800/24µg TDD on change from baseline in peak FEV [ADDRESS_1031380] dose at Week 12 at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a SD of 434mL. 
The assumed mean difference of 117 mL represents a weighted average between two 
means: a mean difference between groups of 130mL while on treatment (assuming 90% 
of the randomized subjects) and a mean difference between groups of 0mL while off 
treatment (assuming 10% of the randomized subjects).
Thus, considering the main estimand analysis, an overall study power of at least 80% for the 
primary and the key-secondary efficacy endpoint will be ensured.
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested for statistical significance 
following a hierarchical strategy to control the familywise type I error rate using the main 
estimand. Each test will be considered confirmatory only if the tests at all the previous steps are 
successful. The hierarchy for the primary and key secondary endpoints is as follows:
Step 1:  Primary endpoint (i.e. change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12) 
using the main estimand - Tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level.

A detailed statistical analysis plan will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The 
plan might be reviewed and updated as a result of the blind review of the data and will be 
finalized before breaking the blind. 
12.3.1 Descriptive Statistics 
General descriptive statistics for numeric variables will include the n (number of observed 
values), the mean, the standard deviation, the median, the minimum, and the maximum values. 
For categorical variables, the number and percent of subjects with a specific level of the variable

FEV 1 AUC 0-12h: In the calculation of FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalised by [CONTACT_5586], missing values 
will be replaced as follows:
oIf the pre-dose FEV 1 value is not available, the entire curve will be considered 
as missing.
oIn case the 12h value is missing, the value of the previous timepoint will be 
carried over; the time associated with this timepoint will be the time of study 
medication intake plus 12 hours.
oSingle, isolated missing FEV 1 values (not pre-dose or last value) will be replaced 
by [CONTACT_753388].
oIf [ADDRESS_1031382] missing FEV 1 values, the 
FEV 1 AUC 0-12h will be considered as missing.
Pre-dose FEV 1: Pre-dose FEV 1 is defined as the mean of 45 minutes and 15 minutes 
pre-dose FEV 1 measurements. If one of the measurements at 45 minutes and 15 minutes 
pre-dose is not available, then the non-missing measurement will be taken as the pre-
dose value. If no pre-dose measurement is available, then the pre-dose FEV 1 value will 
be considered as missing.

Trough FEV 1: Trough FEV [ADDRESS_1031383]-dose is not 
available, then the non-missing measurement will be taken as the trough FEV 1 value. If 
no measurement is available, then the trough FEV 1 value will be considered as missing.
Peak FEV 1: Peak FEV [ADDRESS_1031384]-dose are not available, then the peak FEV 1 
value will be considered as missing.
Daily data: A minimum of 7 days with available measurements will be required in the 
run-in period and in each inter-visit period (i.e. [Week 0 – Week 4]; [Week 4 – Week 
8] and [Week 8 – Week 12]) to consider the following variables as non-missing: 
morning and evening PEF, use of rescue medication, daily asthma symptoms, 
percentage of rescue medication free days and asthma symptom free days.
ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 questionnaire: For ACQ-7 and ACQ-5 questionnaire, the total score 
will be calculated only if all the scores derived from all the seven items (for ACQ-7) or 
from all the five items (for ACQ-5) are recorded.
Further details on dealing with missing data, along with the handling of possible outliers, will 
be described in the SAP. Other critical missing data, if any, will be discussed during the blinded 
review of the data. Decisions will be fully documented in the Data Review Report.

Early 
discontinuation 
from the 
randomized study 
drugTreatment policy: Data collected after 
discontinuation from the randomized study 
drug (i.e. off-treatment data) will be included 
in the analysis.
Early 
discontinuation 
from the studyHypothetical: The collected off-treatment data 
observed on all subjects will be used for the 
imputation of missing data after study 
discontinuation for both treatment arms [1].
This approach targets the off-treatment effect 
that would have been observed if all subjects 
discontinued from study drug had consented 
to continue the study.
Note: In case of collection of very few off-
treatment data such that the planned 
imputation cannot be performed, the 
imputation of missing data after study 
discontinuation will be based on the Copy 
Reference (CR) approach (i.e. considering the 
data distribution of the CHF 718 pMDI 800µg 
TDD arm, including both on-treatment and 
off-treatment data) for both treatment arms.Sensitivity 1: A two-
dimensional tippi[INVESTIGATOR_753338] (i.e. 
under which treatment 
effect is no longer 
statistically significant).
Use of not allowed 
medications and 
other important 
protocol deviationsTreatment policy: Data will be used regardless 
of whether or not the intercurrent event 
occurs.
Wrong study drug 
intakeTreatment policy: If a subject takes the wrong 
study drug, the data will be analyzed as if the 
intercurrent event had not occurred, thus 
considering the randomized study drug.
Analysis
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12 will be analyzed on the ITT set using an 
ANCOVA model including treatment group, US region and prior asthma therapy as fixed 
effects and baseline value (i.e. Week 0, FEV 1 pre-dose) as covariate.. The adjusted means in 
each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference between treatments and their 95% CIs at 
Week 12 will be estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. Superiority of CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD will 
demonstrated by a statistically significant difference between treatments at Week 12 (defined 
as p<0.05) favoring CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD.

12.3.5 Key-Secondary efficacy variable
The attributes of the main estimand in terms of population, treatments, variable and population-
level summary are provided in section 2.1. The strategy for intercurrent events and events 
leading to missing data for the key-secondary efficacy analyses and the sensitivity analyses 
targeting this estimand is the same as the one reported for the primary efficacy variable (section 
12.3.4).
Analysis
Change from baseline in peak FEV [ADDRESS_1031386]-dose at Week 12 will be 
analyzed on the ITT set using an ANCOVA model including treatment group, US region and 
prior asthma therapy as fixed effects and baseline value (i.e. Week 0, FEV 1 pre-dose) as 
covariate.. The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference between 
treatments and their 95% CIs at Week 12 will be estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. Superiority of CHF 
1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD will demonstrated by a statistically significant difference between 
treatments at Week 12 (defined as p<0.05) favoring CHF 1535 pMDI 800/24µg TDD.
12.3.6 Secondary efficacy variable
Analyses of secondary efficacy variables are planned to target the same estimand as described 
for the primary and key-secondary efficacy variables in sections 12.3.4 and 12.3.5 (i.e., with 
collected off-treatment data included in the analysis and used to impute possible missing off-
treatment data) with:
Early discontinuation from the randomized study drug managed with a treatment 
policy strategy with off-treatment data included in the analysis.
Early discontinuation from the study managed with a hypothetical strategy with off-
treatment data observed on all subjects used for the imputation of missing data after 
study discontinuation for both treatment arms [1]. 
Note: In case of collection of very few off-treatment data such that the planned 
imputation cannot be performed, the imputation of missing data after study 
discontinuation will be based on the Copy Reference (CR) approach (i.e. considering 
the data distribution of the CHF 718 pMDI 800µg TDD arm, including both on-
treatment and off-treatment data) for both treatment arms
Use of not allowed medications and other important protocol deviations managed 
with a treatment policy strategy, with data used regardless of whether or not the 
intercurrent event occurs.
Wrong study drug intake  managed with a treatment policy strategy, with data used 
regardless of whether or not the intercurrent event occurs (i.e. considering the 
randomized study drug).
No sensitivity analysis will be performed for the secondary efficacy analyses.

 APPENDIX 2 – RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO 
CONTRACEPTION AND PREGNANCY TESTING IN 
CLINICAL TRIALS
Birth control methods, which may be considered as highly effective
For the purpose of this guidance, methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per 
year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control 
methods.  
Such methods include:
combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:
ooral
ointravaginal
otransdermal
progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
ooral
oinjectable
oimplantable3
intrauterine device (IUD)3
intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)3
bilateral tubal occlusion3
vasectomized partner1,3
sexual abstience2
1Vasectomized partner is highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success. 
2Sexual abstinence is considered as highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
3Methods with low user dependency.
Definition of women of childbearing potential and of fertile men
For the purpose of this document, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), 
i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile.  
Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_96821].  A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.  However, in the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  For the purpose of this 
document, a man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_25297].

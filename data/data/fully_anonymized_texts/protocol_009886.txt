Patients who are eligible for participation in the study will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
600 mg miricorilant, 900 mg miricorilant, or placebo, for 26 weeks of treatment. Randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_16746] (3 strata: olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone or paliperidone, 
or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) to ensure approximately equal numbers of patients in  each stratum are assigned to the 
600 mg miricorilant, 900 mg miricorilant, and placebo groups. 
Patients will be encouraged to volunteer for the PK substudy, which will be conducted at the 
Week  4 visit. Approximately 45 patients are expected to participate. In patients who consent to 
participate, blood samples for the measurement of miricorilant plasma concentrations will be collected according to the PK plan.

Mode of Administration: oral administration with 8 oz (240 mL) of water, along with food.  
Criteria for Evaluation 
Study endpoints corresponding to study objectives are listed below. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Change from Baseline to Week 26 in body weight for both dose levels of miricorilant versus placebo. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The following endpoints will be assessed:  
• Change from Baseline in body weight for both dose levels of miricorilant combined versus 
placebo.  
• Percentage of pati ents achieving a ≥5% weight loss for miricorilant versus placebo. 
• Change from Baseline in waist- to-hip ratio for miricorilant versus placebo. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
The following endpoints will be assessed relative to Baseline: 
• Change in body weight for miricorilant versus placebo in each subgroup of patients taking: - Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
- Risperidone or paliperidone 
- Quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
• Change in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients who 
are not treated with insulin. 
In all patients: 
• Changes in ACTH, serum cortisol, and serum aldosterone (pharmacodynamic assessments). 
• Changes in BPRS, C-SSRS, CGI, OWLQOL, and WRSM . 
In patients with diabetes:  
• Change in HbA1c. 
• Change in fasting blood glucose. 
In patients with high blood pressure: 
• Change in blood pressure. 
Safety Endpoints 
The following endpoints will be assessed for miricorilant versus placebo: 
• Incidence of TEAEs, AEs, and SAEs.  
• Changes from Baseline in clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry panels). 
• Changes from Baseline in physical examinations and vital sign. 
• Changes from Baseline in ECG parameters. 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
• Key PK parameters estimated from steady-state plasma concentration. 
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  [ADDRESS_15942] model with repeated measures (MMRM) with change in body weight at each visit as the outcome variable; baseline body weight as a covariate; and antipsychotic 
medication (stratification factor), randomized treatment (600 mg or 900 mg miricorilant or placebo), 
visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects.  
The difference in body weight change at Week 26 between each miricorilant treatment group and 
placebo will be estimated from the model along with its associated 95% confidence interval (CI).  
The primary efficacy analysis will use the Efficacy Evaluable population. Neither CIs nor p-values will 
be adjusted for multiplicity.  
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints For the first secondary endpoint, the 2 miricorilant dose groups will be combined into a single 
treatment group and assessed using a similar  model as the MMRM for the primary analysis. The other 
factors in the model will remain the same. The difference in body weight change at Week 26 between 
the combined miricorilant treatment groups and placebo will be estimated from the model along with its associated 95% CI.  
The percentage of patients in each treatment group who lose ≥5% of their baseline body weight will be 
presented along with its 95% CI. In addition, a logistic regression model with baseline body weight as a 
covariate, and antipsychotic medication and randomized treatment as fixed effects, will be used to 
compare each miricorilant dose group to placebo. 
Waist -to-hip ratio will be analyzed using similar models as the primary analysis of weight change. 
Differences between each miricorilant dose group and placebo will be estimated along with 
corresponding 95% CIs. Waist -to-hip ratio data may require a log-transformation prior to analysis. 
Analyses of Exploratory Endpoints 
The relationship between background antipsychotic medication and efficacy will be explored through 
subgroup analyses. Specifically, 3 MMRM analyses will be performed, one for each subgroup of 
patients taking olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone or paliperidone, or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Each MMRM will be similar to 
the primary analysis except all miricorilant dose groups will be combined into a single treatment group. 
Each model will use change in body weight at each visit as the outcome variable; baseline body weight 
as a covariate; and treatment (miricorilant or placebo), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects. For each background medication, the difference in body weight change at Week 26 between the 
combined miricorilant dose groups and placebo will be estimated from the appropriate model along 
with its associated 95% CI and p-value.  
Analyses of continuous endpoints assessed at multiple post-treatment timepoints, such as the change in 
BPRS, CGI, OWLQOL, and WRSM  from Baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed using models similar 
to the primary analysis of body weight change. C-SSRS results will be summarized descriptively. 
Endpoints like ACTH, serum cortisol, and serum aldosterone that are measured only at Baseline and Week 26 will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models that include the change in 
the endpoint between Baseline and Week 26 as the outcome variable, baseline body weight as a covariate, and antipsychotic medication and randomized treatment as factors. Changes in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose within patients with diabetes will employ pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to 
compare treatment groups. A similar strategy will be used to compare groups on the change from Baseline in blood pressure among patients with high blood pressure. 
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 9 HOMA -IR will be analyzed using similar models as the primary analysis of weight change. 
Differences  between each miricorilant dose group and placebo will be estimated along with 
corresponding 95% CIs. HOMA -IR data may require a log-transformation prior to analysis. 
Dose response will be evaluated using an MMRM identical to that used for the primary analysis except 
that the placebo group will not be included. The difference between the miricorilant dose groups in the change in body weight at Week [ADDRESS_15943]. The 
difference will be accompanied by [CONTACT_16748] 95% CI and p-value.  
Safety Analyses Adverse events will be mapped to system organ classes and preferred terms using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall and displayed by [CONTACT_6657], as well as by [CONTACT_926], seriousness, and 
relationship to the study treatment. Serious AEs and AEs that lead to study treatment discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be listed by [CONTACT_16749]. 
Clinical laboratory test results (chemistry, hematology, and coagulation), vital sign measurements, 
physical examination findings, and ECG results will be summarized by [CONTACT_16750]. 
Shift tables will be constructed that describe changes from Baseline in clinical laboratory values. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK data obtained from the PK substudy, including the PK parameters of miricorilant estimated by 
[CONTACT_16751], will be summarized descriptively. The 95% CIs for the PK parameters 
will be presented. Additionally, plasma concentrations of miricorilant will be plotted over time. 
Details of the PK analyses will be described in a PK analysis plan finalized before database lock. 
Sample Size 
The planned sample size is 150 subjects randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_15944] 90% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_15945]. A drop- out rate of 40% from Baseline to Week 26 is assumed in this calculation. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_16752] (one stratification factor 
with 3 levels). If ≥20 patients complete 26 weeks of treatment (10 patients treated with miricorilant and 
10 patients treated with placebo) in one of the allowed antipsychotic medication groups (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone  or paliperidone, or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), this sample size provides 60% power to detect a difference 
in body weight change of 5 kg between the miricorilant and placebo groups, at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_15946] not been adjusted for multiple comparisons.

SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
1.1 Therapeutic Area 
Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a condition in which patients with schizophrenia 
and other disorders treated with antipsychotic medications gain weight, leading to increases in 
diabetes mellitus, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], cardiovascular disease, and mortality.  
There are currently no approved treatments for AIWG; adjunctive pharmacological treatment, 
behavioral therapy, and antipsychotic medication switch have limited efficacy ( Maayan et al. 
2010, Mukundan et al. 2010, Mizuno et al. 2014). Dietary counseling and exercise programs 
have shown only modest effects on weight in these patients ( Dayabandara et al. 2017).  
1.1.1 Background 
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16702]  
(e.g., tardive dyskinesia) associated with first-generation antipsychotic medications. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16703], although efficacious, tend to cause significantly more weight gain in 
patients than first-generation medications. Among the commonly used atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16704], clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_16705], followed by [CONTACT_16754][INVESTIGATOR_16706] ( ADA/APA/AACE/NAASO 2004). In one study, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16707] 4.[ADDRESS_15955] dose over the course of 10 weeks (Allison and Casey 2001 ). In addition to weight gain, patients on atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16708]-induced metabolic changes including increased insulin resistance and 
elevated levels of cholesterol and serum triglycerides that significantly increase their risk for 
cardiovascular disease ( Dayabandara et al. 2017).  Consequently, patients with schizophrenia 
have a 2–3 fold increased risk of mortality compared with the general population, corresponding 
to a 10–25 year reduction in life expectancy ( Laursen et al. 2012). Furthermore, weight gain is 
also associated with discontinuation of antipsychotic medications, leading to a decrease in their 
effectiveness ( Liebermann et al. 2005).   
1.1.[ADDRESS_15956] on multiple neuroreceptors, and may increase appetite and decrease energy expenditure ( Gothelf et al. 2002, 
Graham et al. 2005). Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis has also been 
implicated with the use of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709]. For example, rats treated with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_16710] ( Tulipano et al. 2007).  
In humans, there is evidence for a role for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in AIWG. 
In healthy volunteers treated with either olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16711], mifepristone, a GR 
antagonist, ameliorated the weight gain from the antipsychotic medication ( Gross et al. 2009, 
Gross et al. 2010).  
More recently, miricorilant, which is a mixed agonist/antagonist of the GR and an antagonist of 
the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), has been shown to mitigate weight gain in healthy volunteers taking olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Study CORT118335-852).

Confidential  Page 21 1.2 Miricorilant: A Mixed Agonist/Antagonist of the Glucocorticoid-Receptor and 
Antagonist of the Mineralocorticoid-Receptor 
Miricorilant, a mixed agonist/antagonist of  the GR and an antagonist of the MR, is currently 
being developed for the treatment of AIWG. The goals of this  study (CORT118335-877) are to 
evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of miricorilant in reversing AIWG in 
obese patients (body mass index [ BMI ] ≥30 kg/m2) with schizophrenia currently taking 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, paliperidone (active metabolite of risperidone), or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Further information about miricorilant is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .  
1.2.1 Nonclinical Summary 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology 
This section summarizes in vitro and in vivo data on the pharmacology of miricorilant as a 
high-affinity, mixed agonist/antagonist of the GR. In most models, mifepristone, which is an 
antagonist of the progesterone receptor ( PR), androgen receptor ( AR), and GR was used as an 
active comparator. Miricorilant has similar GR antagonism without effects on the PR  or AR . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 In Vitro Pharmacology 
Miricorilant binds competitively and reversibly to the GR with high affinity (1.2 nM). Functional 
GR antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro by [CONTACT_16755] (a potent and selective GR agonist) on tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) 
activity in a human liver carcinoma cell line (inhibition constant [K
i], 100 nM) and a rat 
hepatoma cell line (K i, 11 nM). Miricorilant prevented the dexamethasone-induced increase in 
TAT activity in primary hepatocytes from mice, monkeys, and humans. Miricorilant is also an antagonist of the MR, and has shown activity in both a reporter gene assay (K
i, 148 nM) and a 
protein:protein interaction assay (K i, 140 nM). Both GR and MR antagonism are considered to 
contribute to the in vivo pharmacological activity of miricorilant. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_15957] reported differential effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16712], the route, frequency and duration of drug administration, and the sex of the animals 
(reviewed in Van der Zwaal et al. 2014).  Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16713] a robust and reproducible increase 
in body weight in female rats but results in male rats are less reliable. Thus, female rats were 
used in the studies reported here. 
Three studies (MPI 950-033, MPI 950-034, and MPI 950-035) evaluated the ability of 
miricorilant, at various doses, to prevent weight gain in female rats (10 per group) that were administered the antipsychotic medication olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16714] a normal diet. In  all 3 studies, 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16715] a dose of 1.2 mg/kg twice a day, 12 hours apart (i.e., 2.4 mg/kg/day, for 21 consecutive days ). This series of studies shows a dose-dependent 
ability of miricorilant to prevent olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced increases in body weight, food consumption, and abdominal fat content in female rats (Miricorilant IB).

Abbreviation: O, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
 
The ability of miricorilant to reverse (rather than prevent) olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced weight gain in 
female rats was investigated in 3 separate studies ( MPI 950-144, RenaSci  RS1738, and 
RenaSci RS1854).  
In the first study ( MPI 950-144), rats were fed a normal diet, and were either administered 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16717] a dose of 1.2 mg/kg twice a day, (i.e., 2.4 mg/kg/day, for 56 consecutive days) or 
received only vehicle throughout the duration of the study.  
A statistically significant increase in body weight was observed in all rats treated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16718], and this effect was maintained for the duration of the study in rats that received only vehicle in the treatment phase ( Figure 2). Miricorilant at all doses completely 
abrogated olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced increase in body weight and food consumption. The effects noted with a total daily dose of 2 mg/kg, regardless of whether t his was administered as a single dose 
of 2 mg/kg or a split dose of 1 mg/kg twice a day, were similar. Effects were observed from the first week of dosing and persisted through the remainder of the study.

The administration of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16719] a high-fat diet result ed in a rapid increase in 
body weight, with a statistically significant effect noted by [CONTACT_2006] 5. The ability of miricorilant to 
reverse the effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16720] (RenaSci RS1738 
and RS1854), and doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg/day fully reverse d the effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
1.2.2 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination 
The plasma protein binding of miricorilant in rat and human was >99.9% (Corcept PK -118335-008) and in mouse and monkey w as >99% (Corcept  PK-118335-013). 
In vitro studies with human cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isoforms indicated that miricorilant was 
metabolized almost exclusively by [CONTACT_097]2C19 (94%) (Corcept PK -118335-012). Additionally, 
in vitro data showed the potential for modest inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 by 
[CONTACT_16756]  (Corcept PK-118335-004 and Corcept PK-118335-009).  
Fecal elim ination represented the principal route of elimination with 98.7%  ± 2.48% recovered.

Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 24 1.2.3 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety of miricorilant was evaluated in preliminary ascending single- and 
repeat-dose studies followed by [CONTACT_16757] (GLP) 28-day, 91-day repeat-dose 
and chronic toxicology studies in mice and monkeys. Definitive GLP reproductive toxicology studies were conducted in mice and rabbits, and standard packages of GLP safety pharmacology 
studies (in vitro human ether-à-go-go related gene [hERG] assay, cardiovascular effects in 
monkeys, respi[INVESTIGATOR_16721], and neurobehavioral effects in mice) and genotoxicity studies (in vitro bacterial and mammalian cell assays ; in vivo assay in mice), were performed. 
All safety pharmacology and toxicology studies used oral administration, the intended clinical route.  
Miricorilant was not genotoxic in any study. There were no adverse findings in any safety 
pharmacology study up to the highest dose studied (500 mg/kg in mice , 400 mg/kg in monkeys). 
In the GLP hERG assay, 0.9 μM miricorilant (the highest concentration studied, limited by 
[CONTACT_16758]) produced a maximum inhibition of hERG- mediated potassium currents of 23.8%.  
Mouse and monkey GLP 28 day (1 month), 91 day (3-month), 179 day (6-month; mice) and 270 day (9-month; monkey) general toxicology studies were conducted with miricorilant, which was dosed daily by [CONTACT_16759]: 
• Mice were administered doses of 30, 100, 300, or 500 mg/kg for 28 days (MPI 950-126) 
and 30, 100, or 500 mg/kg for 91 days (MPI 950-140). No adverse effects were observed at any dose in either of these two studies. Therefore, the no-observed-adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL ) was 500 mg/kg.  
• Monkeys administered doses of 20, 100, or 400 mg/kg for 28 days showed no adverse effects at any dose in this study. Therefore, the NOAEL was 400 mg/kg (MPI  950-127). 
Monkeys were administered doses of 20, 50, or 200 mg/kg for 91 days. Although no adverse effects were noted in female monkeys (for a NOAEL of 200 mg/kg), t he NOAEL 
was 50 mg/kg for male monkeys, because adverse clinical effects, specifically abnormal feces, decreased activity, lack of appetite, hunched posture, dehydration and ataxia, were noted at the highest dose (MPI 950-139). 
• Mice were administered doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg for 6 months. No adverse effects were observed, and the NOAEL was 300 mg/kg in both sexes (MPI 950-155).
 
• Monkeys were administered doses of 15, 50 and 150 mg/kg for 9 months. No adverse effects were observed, and the NOAEL was 150 mg/kg in both sexes (MPI 950-156). 
Other treatment-related findings in the nonclinical studies are considered related to the mode of 
action of miricorilant as a GR mixed agonist/antagonist and MR antagonist. Although the risk of 
clinically significant safety concerns is considered to be low, potential adverse effects of 
miricorilant, based on the pharmacological effect of GR antagonists, may include signs and symptoms consistent with excessive GR antagonism (e.g., weakness, tiredness, dizziness, 
orthostati c hypotension, hypoglycemia, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle 
aches). Potential adverse events of miricorilant, based on the pharmacological effects of an 
MR antagonist, may include signs and symptoms of excessive MR antagonism (e.g., 
hyperkalemia or hypotension).  
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  [ADDRESS_15959] been completed in mice and rabbits as follows: 
• In the definitive GLP reproductive toxicology study conducted in pregnant mice, 
miricorilant was administered daily by [CONTACT_4644] 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg/day (MPI 950-177) from gestation day (GD) 6 through 15. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day due to reduced body weight gain at the 100 mg/kg/day dose. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 1 mg/kg/day. At higher doses skel etal 
malformations were observed, including cleft palate.  
• In the definitive GLP reproductive toxicology study conducted in female rabbits (MPI  950-178), miricorilant was administered daily by [CONTACT_4644] 1, 3, 
and 10 mg/kg/day from GD 7 through 19. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 1 mg/kg/day. A dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in adverse pregnancy outcomes (abortions, resorbed fetuses, postimplantation loss), decreased gravid uterine weights and decreased fetal body weight. Skeletal abnormalities were also observed at this dose, although these were considered non-adverse. A dose of 3 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased uterine weights and decreased fetal weights. 
These data indicate that miricorilant should not be administered to pregnant women due to 
adverse effects on fetal development (mice) or adverse pregnancy outcomes (rabbits). Therefore, 
women of childbearing potential and men with partners of childbearing potential in clinical 
studies must use highly efficacious forms of birth control as outlined in Section 4.6.4. 
Additional information is provided in the current Miricorilant IB. 
1.3 Clinical Summary 
Clinical experience in humans with miricorilant is derived from four Phase 1 studies conducted 
in healthy adult subjects (Studies CORT118335-850, CORT118335-851, CORT118335-852, and ongoing Study CORT118335-853) and one Phase 2 study (Study CORT118335-876; 
GRATITUDE) . Study CORT118335-[ADDRESS_15960]- in-human study of miricorilant, was an adaptive-dose, 
single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study of the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and food/ pharmacological effects of orally administered miricorilant in male 
and female healthy subjects. 
Drug product was administered as a hot melt extrudate (HME) capsule, a suspension of 
spray-dried dispersion (SDD) with vehicle in bottle, or as a 100 or 300 mg tablet. The HME 
capsule and 300 mg tablet led  to lower than expected miricorilant exposures and will not be 
evaluated further in clinical development. Thus, only the efficacy, safety, and PK results of the 
suspension (SDD) and 100 mg tablet formulations are summarized below. 
In the SAD portion of the study, miricorilant was administered under fasting conditions as 100, 
300, 900, or 1500 mg in suspension. The SAD/suspension portion of the study also evaluated 
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  [ADDRESS_15961] versus 900 mg 
miricorilant administered under fasting conditions. 
In the MAD dose portion of the study, miricorilant was administered once-daily under fasting 
conditions for 14 days as 150, 450, or 900 mg in suspension. 
In addition, 2 × 100 mg miricorilant tablets and 2 × 300 mg miricorilant tablets were evaluated 
as single doses under both fasting and fed conditions. 
Safety Results  
Drug-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Across all SAD /suspension cohorts, 1 of 7 (14.3%) fasted and 1 of 1 (100%) fed placebo subjects 
reported one or more TEAEs. Of subjects treated with miricorilant, the proportion reporting at 
least 1 TEAE ranged from 0 to 60% across all dose s. No trend in the proportion reporting TEAEs 
with dose was apparent. In the MAD /suspension part of the study, 4 of 8 (50.0%) placebo treated 
subjects reported at least 1 TEAE. Across all doses of miricorilant, 3 of 8; 33.3% (150 mg and 450 mg) or 3 of 9; 37.5% (900 mg) subjects reported at l east [ADDRESS_15962] 
(FE)/suspension part of the study, [ADDRESS_15963] experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of non-fatal, acute myocardial infarction 
[ADDRESS_15964]’s underlying coronary 
artery disease.  
No deaths were reported during the study.  Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation 
No AEs leading to discontinuation were reported.  
Vital Signs, Laboratory Evaluations, and Physical Examinations 
There were no clinically significant findings in any of the vital signs or laboratory evaluations. 
During physical examinations, a mild cardiac murmur was observed at the follow-up 
examination in a subject who had been treated with a single dose of miricorilant 900 mg in 
suspension under both fasted and fed conditions. The finding was not noted on previous 
examinations; the Investigator considered this asymptomatic finding most likely to be a pre-existing condition and not related to study drug. 
12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
Electrocardiogram s (ECGs) were obtained in triplicate in the MAD/suspension parts of the 
study. Single ECGs were obtained in the SAD/suspension and FE/suspension parts of the study 
unless abnormalities were detected. No subject recorded QT interval corrected for heart rate 
using Fridericia’s equation ( QTcF ) intervals that were >[ADDRESS_15965] had increases in QTcF interval from baseline that were >30 msec.

Holter monitoring was conducted in the MAD/suspension parts of the study. No subject had an 
increase in QTcF >30 ms based on Holter readings.  
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Plasma concentrations of miricorilant increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner 
following single-dose administration of 100 to 900 mg under fasting conditions, and in less than dose-proportional increases for doses of 900 or 1500 mg of the SDD-suspension formulation. 
Based on the concentration-time profile following administration of single 100 or 300 mg doses, 
the terminal half-life of miricorilant was estimated to be approximately 21 ‒23 hours. 
Administration of 900 mg miricorilant suspension under fed conditions (with a high- fat 
breakfast) resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations versus fasting administration, with geometric mean (coefficient of variation [CV%]) relative bioavailability values (fed versus fasting) of 245% (24.5%) based on the maximum concentration (C
max) and 
345% (28.8%) based on and AUC 0-inf.  
In the MAD portion of the study, following once-daily administration of miricorilant suspension under fasting conditions for 14 days, the plasma concentrations of miricorilant increased in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner. The overall accumulation ratio (AUC
0-tau) were 2.17 
for the 150 mg dose, 1.81 for the 450 mg dose, and 2.40 for the 900 mg dose.  
Following a single oral administration of 200 mg miricorilant (2  × 100 mg tablets) in the fasted 
state, the mean miricorilant C max, AUC 24, and AUC inf were 105 ng/mL, 996 ng∙h/mL, and 
1790 ng∙h/mL respectively. These were contained within the exposures observed following the 
100 and 300 mg miricorilant doses. Based on the previously observed Part 4 (SAD /suspension) 
PK data, and the dose-proportional increases in miricorilant exposures to 900 mg (suspension), the exposure of 200 mg miricorilant (fasted), was  modestly lower than expected. The geometric 
mean C
max of 105 ng/mL  for 200 mg miricorilant (2  × 100 mg miricorilant tablets) is 
approximately 25% lower than the predicted C max of 140 ng/mL based on dose -proportionality.  
Following administration of 200 mg miricorilant (2  × 100 mg tablets) under fed conditions 
(a high-fat breakfast), miricorilant C max, AUC last and AUC inf increased by 1.8-, 2.2- and 2.1-fold, 
respectively, compared with 200 mg miricorilant administered under fasting conditions.  
1.3.2 Phase 1 Study CORT118335-851 
CORT118335-851 was an open-label study conducted with [14C]-miricorilant to assess the 
absolute oral bioavailability (Part 1) and the mass balance recovery, absorption, metabolism 
and elimination, and metabolite profile and identification (Part 2) of miricorilant in healthy 
male  subjects. 
Subjects were healthy men, aged 18 to 65 years (Part 1) and 30 to 65 years (Part 2), with a BMI 
in the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2. In Part 1, 6 subjects received a single oral dose of 900 mg 
miricorilant in suspension followed by a microdose (100 µg) of [14C]-miricorilant containing a 
microtracer amount of 14C given as an intravenous infusion. In Part 2, 6 subjects received a 
single oral dose of 150 mg [14C]-miricorilant oral solution in caprylic acid.

QTcF intervals that were >[ADDRESS_15967] had increases in QTcF interval from baseline that were >30 msec. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
PK analysis in Part 1 (absolute bioavailability) was performed in 6 subjects who received a 
single oral dose of 900 mg miricorilant in suspension under fasting conditions and a microdose 
of 100 μg miricorilant containing a [
14C] microtracer by [CONTACT_5204]. The geometric 
mean absolute bioavailability of miricorilant was determined to be 16.9%.   
PK analysis in Part 2 (mass balance) was performed in 6 subjects who received a single oral administration of 150 mg [
14C]-miricorilant as a solution in caprylic acid (5 mL) under fed 
conditions. (Note: Exposure with this formulation was higher than that observed in Study 
CORT118335-850 for the same dose of the suspension).  Following administration of this single 
oral dose of 150 mg [14C]-miricorilant, total [14C]-radioactivity was quantifiable in whole blood 
in all subjects for 2‒12 hours and remained so  for 12‒24 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations 
of total radioactivity were evident for 1‒4 hours postdose. Maximum plasma concentrations 
occurred 2‒12 hours postdose. Concentrations then declined in a biphasic manner and remained quantifiable for between 24 and 48 hours postdose. In comparison with the total 
[
14C]-radioactivity observed in plasma, the total [14C]-radioactivity observed in whole blood was 
lower at all time points where radioactive levels were detectable. The whole blood:plasma 
concentration ratio based on total [14C]-radioactivity ranged from 0.613‒0.763. Administration 
of a single oral dose of 150 mg [14C]-miricorilant resulted in the majority of total radioactivity 
being recovered in the feces (mean, 89.1%), with much lower amounts (mean, 4.6%) in the urine. These results suggest that the predominant route of elimination is hepatic.

This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the ability of

that GR antagonism may alleviate AIWG. In healthy volunteers treated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_16711], mifepristone (a GR antagonist) ameliorated weight gain associated with these 
medications ( Gross et al. 2009, Gross et al. 2010). Additionally, results from the Phase 1 
Study CORT118335-852 show that miricorilant has been shown to mitigate weight gain in 
healthy volunteers taking olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
The ongoing Phase 2 Study CORT118335-876 (GRATITUDE) is designed to investigate 
the ability of miricorilant to treat recent AIWG in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

with long-standing weight gain due to antipsychotic medication will be treated for a longer 
duration (26-week regimen) with miricorilant to evaluate its ability to reverse AIWG. 
Specifically, this  study will compare 2 doses of miricorilant (600 mg and 900 mg) to placebo, 
and determine whether once daily dosing of miricorilant for 26 weeks results in reversal of 
AIWG in obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m

35 sites and will randomize approximately 150 obese patients to a 1:1:[ADDRESS_15976] of 4 weeks of Screening, 26 weeks of Treatment, and 4 weeks of 
Follow-up. The efficacy of miricorilant versus placebo in reversing AIWG will be assessed. 
Clinical benefit will also be assessed through patient-reported outcomes such as the Obesity Weight Loss Quality of Life scale (OWLQOL) and Weight-Related Symptom Measure ( WRSM ) 
questionnaires. Routine assessments of safety will consist of AE monitoring, measurement of vital signs, 12-lead ECG recordings, physical examination, and clinical laboratory safety tests. In the PK substudy, to be conducted in a subgroup of approximately [ADDRESS_15977] PK parameters for miricorilant. 
1.4.2 Rationale for Dose Selection and Regimen 
Miricorilant is effective at mitigating and reversing weight gain in rat studies described in 
Section 1.2.1. In a Phase 1, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, miricorilant 
administered at 600 mg once daily for 14 days demonstrated efficacy in mitigating olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-
induced weight gain; likewise miricorilant at 900 mg as a divided dose for 14 days confirmed these weight mitigation results (CORT118335-852, summarized in Section 1.3.3). Study 
CORT118335-877 is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of miricorilant in reversing 
long-standing AIWG with the same total doses used in Study CORT118335-852. The 600 mg dose is predicted to be a minimally effective dose. The 900 mg dose given once daily is included 
as a second dose in this study to evaluate the efficacy and the dose/exposure  relationship. The 
safety of 900 mg has been previously established in Phase 1 Studies CORT118335-850 and 
CORT118335-852. 
1.5 Benefits and Risks 
Miricorilant has shown efficacy in rat models of AIWG and has also been shown to mitigate 
weight gain in healthy volunteers taking olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Weight gain is especially of concern in the background of increasing rates of obesity and diabetes among the general population, both risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease and early death. Patients with schizophrenia on atypic al 
antipsychotic medications develop drug-induced metabolic changes that significantly increase 
their risk for cardiovascular disease ( Dayabandara et al. 2017).  Consequently, patients with 
schizophrenia have a 2–3 fold increased risk of mortality compared with the general population, 
corresponding to a 10–25 year reduction in life expectancy ( Laursen et al. 2012). Reversal or 
possibly prevention of AIWG is expected to provide a clinically meaningful improvement in general health outcomes and life expectancy in patients taking antipsychotic medications. 
Based on the totality of data for miricorilant, the potential for clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions in this study is low. The elimination of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone, paliperidone, and 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_16724]1A2, CYP2D6, 
and/or CYP3A4. Although miricorilant has shown modest inhibitory potential of CYP3A4 in vitro (Corcept PK -118335-004), miricorilant can be used in combination with these 
antipsychotic medications. Additionally, there is no evidence that GR antagonism interferes with the efficacy of these antipsychotic medications.

Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 32 The risk of clinically significant safety concerns is considered low. However potential adverse 
effects of miricorilant may include a combination of signs and symptoms consistent with 
excessive GR antagonism (e.g., weakness, tiredness, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches) and excessive MR antagonism (e.g., hyperkalemia and hypotension).

who are at risk for clinically significant leukopenia/neutropenia or clinically significant orthostatic hypotension will be excluded from the study. Orthostatic vital signs will be measured at each study visit, including follow-up. 
Patients will be closely monitored during the study. Standard safety tests such as chemistry 
panels (refer to Table 4) will be performed at scheduled visits as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (SoA) ( Appendix A ); additional safety tests can be performed at the discretion of 
the Corcept Medical Monitor.  
The effects of any excessive GR or MR antagonism should be reversible by [CONTACT_16763]. Further information for monitoring and treating excessive GR or MR antagonism is provided in Section 5.3.2 and 5.4.3.

within the 28-day screening period if the Investigator believes the result was spurious or otherwise confounded. 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of 
laboratory abnormalities alone may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator with the approval of the Corcept Medical Monitor. Rescreened patients should be assigned a new patient number. Rescreened patients should meet all of the entry criteria outlined in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. 
4.4 Early Patient Discontinuation or Withdrawal  
In this study, patient “discontinuation” refers to early discontinuation of the study drug while 
remaining on study; that is, the patient may wish to stop treatment early but may agree to continue with study visits and/or assessments . 
Early patient “withdrawal” refers either to patient withdrawal of consent to any further study participation or to an Investigator/Sponsor decision to permanently withdraw the patient and 
cessation of administration of the study drug, procedures, and assessments without further 
follow-up. If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to further participation in the study entirely, this should be clearly documented (1) in the patient’s medical record and signed by [CONTACT_11219] (2) in the clinical study database (electronic case report form [eCRF]). 
4.4.1 Early Patient Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug may be discontinued in the event of any of the following occurrences: 
• Unacceptable toxicity. 
• The Investigator decides it is in the patient’s best interest to discontinue treatment and/or 
participation in the study. Reasons may include but are not limited to  the following: 
– The patient requires prohibited medications. 
– The patient is not compliant with protocol requirements. 
• Patient becomes pregnant. 
If a patient discontinues early from the study drug, that patient will complete an Early 
Termination (ET) visit at the time of the last dose of the study drug or soon thereafter. The Follow-Up visit will be conducted 28±[ADDRESS_15992] dose of the study drug. Investigators 
should encourage these patients to continue with all study visits and/or assessments per the 
patient’s original study schedule through Week 26 (end-of-treatment). If the Follow-Up visit coincides with any other study visit, the assessments performed at the se visits will be combined. 
If a patient is unable to continue with all study visits, they will be encouraged to complete the end-of treatment Week [ADDRESS_15993] be recorded on the eCRF.

A patient may be withdrawn early from the study for the following medical or administrative 
reasons: 
• Withdrawal of consent. 
• Noncompliance, including refusal of the study drug and/or failure to adhere to the study 
requirements, as specified in protocol. 
• Lost to follow-up (before a patient is determined to be lost to follow-up, reasonable efforts will be made to contact [CONTACT_16767]).  
• Early termination of the study by [CONTACT_16768]. 
The date the patient is withdrawn from the study and the primary reason for withdrawal must be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Patients may withdraw voluntarily from the study at any time. For patients who withdraw consent to participate in the study, every effort should be made to determine whether the 
withdrawal of consent was related to an AE or a specific aspect of the study. As noted above, if 
a patient wishes to withdraw consent to further participation in the study entirely, including follow-up, this should be clearly documented (1) in the patient’s medical record and signed by [CONTACT_11219] (2) in the clinical study database (eCRF).

Confidential  Page 43 4.6.4 Childbearing Potential and Contraception  
Miricorilant should not be administered to pregnant women due to adverse effects on fetal 
development (mice) or adverse pregnancy outcomes (rabbits). Men and women of childbearing 
potential who participate in this study must agree to use effective contraception.  
All female patients of childbearing potential (including all women <50 years old, women whose 
surgical sterilization was performed <[ADDRESS_15994] 12 months) will take pregnancy tests at scheduled visits (Appendix A ). The Screening pregnancy test will be a blood test. All subsequent pregnancy tests 
will be urine tests. 
• A female patient is of childbearing potential if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], she is 
biologically capable of having children. 
• Female patients who are considered not of childbearing potential must meet at least 1 of 
the two following criteria: 
a. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. 
b. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure or have reached postmenopausal status, 
defined as cessation of regular menses for at least [ADDRESS_15995] a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory’s reference range for ovarian failure or postmenopausal women. 
Female patients of childbearing potential are required and must agree to use a highly effective 
method of contraception throughout the study and for at least [ADDRESS_15996] dose of study drug administration.  
Highly effective forms of contraception include: 
a. Abstinence 
Abstinence is only acceptable as true abstinence (i.e., when this is in line with the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal do not constitute abstinence. 
b. Intrauterine device or intrauterine system 
c. Oral contraceptive plus a barrier method 
d. Diaphragm with vaginal spermicidal cream 
e. Vaginal spermicide with a condom  
f. Surgical sterilization (≥6 months postsurgery)

5.2 Non-Investigational Medicinal Agen t  
Not applicable.  5.3 Safety Assessments  
5.3.1 Monitoring of Liver Injury 
Any patient experiencing signs and symptoms consistent with liver injury, such as a combination 
of nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, and/or right upper quadrant abdominal pain or discomfort, should undergo immediate testing prior to their next scheduled visit for ALT, AST, GGT, total 
and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time ( PT) and international normalized 
ratio ( INR). Should the patient have laboratory evaluations consistent with suspected liver injury, 
actions as outlined in Table 2 should be taken.  
5.3.2 Excessive GR/MR Antagonism  
Based on the mechanism of action of miricorilant, there is a theoretical risk of excessive 
GR antagonism and excessive MR antagonism. Excessive GR antagonism could manifest as  a 
combination of findings such as weakness, tiredness, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, 
hypoglycemia, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle aches. Excessive 
MR antagonism could manifest as hyperkalemia, dehydration, and hypotension; hypotension 
may be seen in the absence of antihypertensive medication. These symptoms should be 
monitored throughout the duration of the clinical trial both during T reatment  (including 
Baseline) and in the follow-up period. If excessive GR and/or  MR antagonism is suspected, 
patients should discontinue the study medication, and administration of intravenous fluids, and intravenous or oral hydrocortisone should begin without delay and the actions outlined in 
Table 2 should be taken. The half-life of miricorilant is approximately 21 to 23 hours (Study CORT118335-850). Symptoms should continue to be monitored even after the last dose of study medication in the follow-up period.

5.4.1 Dose Reduction 
No dose reduction will be allowed. 
5.4.2 Dose Interruption and/or Discontinuation: General Criteria 
Treatment with study drug should be temporarily interrupted if deemed medically necessary by 
[CONTACT_737]. On interrupting treatment, the Investigator should notify the Corcept Medical Monitor.  
Before restarting treatment with study drug, the Investigator must obtain approval from the 
Corcept Medical Monitor. If the event that necessitated treatment interruption recurs after study drug is restarted, the patient should be permanently discontinued from treatment. 
In addition, patients will be permanently discontinued from treatment if they experience any of 
the criteria listed for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16728] 2. 
5.4.3 Dose Interruption and/or Discontinuation: Special Safety Events 
Guidelines for temporarily interrupting and restarting, and for permanently discontinuing study 
treatment due to safety events (excessive GR or MR antagonism; hyperkalemia; hypotension; 
suspected liver injury, or significant trauma, surgery, or medical illness) are outlined in Table 2.

Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to patients. However, study drug brought back by [CONTACT_16771]. 
5.7 Blinding /Unblinding  
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Tablets (miricorilant,150 mg or placebo for 
miricorilant tablet, 150 mg) are identical in appearance.  
The Sponsor or designee, the Investigator, the Corcept Medical Monitor, study-site personnel, 
and the patient will be blinded to the study drug and will not be allowed to view the results of 
laboratory tests that have the potential to reveal a patient’s treatment arm due to the expected 
effect of the active treatment on the analyte involved. 
The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. The blind may be broken if, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is in the patient’s best interest for the Investigator to know the 
study drug assignment. To maintain the overall quality and legitimacy of the clinical trial, unblinding should only occur in exceptional circumstances. These circumstances could include 
but are not limited to pregnancy of the patient or pregnancy of the patient’s partner. The Corcept 
Medical Monitor must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study drug is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study

Medical Monitor for further discussion.  
5.8 Dosing Diary 
A dosing diary will be provided, and patients will be instructed to return all unused study 
tablets and the dosing diary at their visits. Patients should complete an entry in the diary for 
each self -administered dose of the study drug and note the names and doses of any concomitant 
medications taken. Entries will include the number of tablets and the date and time of the study drug administration. Time and dose administered should be documented in the clinic charts. 
5.9 Study Drug Accountability and Treatment Adherence  
Study drug adherence will be determined by [CONTACT_16772] (Section 5.8) and counting 
returned tablets. 
A patient who is assigned a study drug (i.e., to 600 mg miricorilant, 900 mg miricorilant or 
placebo, for 26 weeks of treatment ) will be considered nonadherent if he or she misses >30% of 
the prescribed doses during the study, unless the patient’s study drug was withheld by [CONTACT_16773]. Similarly, a patient will be considered nonadherent if he or she is 
judged by [CONTACT_16774]. Patients found to be nonadherent with their assigned treatment regimen 
should be assessed to determine the reason for nonadherence and educated and/or managed as 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_16775].

Confidential  Page 54 6 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES AND 
APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS 
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA ( Appendix A ). Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed. 
The Investigator and Sponsor will conduct the study in accordance with International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ( ICH) guidelines 
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local regulations. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct, and the Investigator must ensure that trial procedures are performed as described in the protocol. 
During the study, procedures and observations will be monitored to confirm that study 
requirements are being followed as outlined in the SoA ( Appendix A ). 
In the event that a patient is unable to come to the clinic to participate in study-related visits or 
procedures, sponsor-approved alternative options may be provided to the Investigator sites based 
on the needs and safety of patients. This may include the provision of study drug dispensation and delivery outside of a clinic visit. 
6.[ADDRESS_16003] reasons for screening failure (see 
Section 4.3), as applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and 
obtained before signing of the informed consent form (ICF) may be used for Screening or 
Baseline purposes, provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA ( Appendix A ). 
6.2 Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics 
Patient demographic data, including age, sex, and race, and baseline disease characteristics will 
be documented at Screening.  
6.3 Medical and Medication History 
Medical history, including details regarding surgeries, illnesses and allergies, date(s) of onset, 
and whether conditions are currently ongoing, and medication history will be collected on all patients during Screening. Medical history will be updated at the Day 1 Visit and will then serve as the baseline for other clinical assessments. 
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 55 6.4 Safety Assessments  
Safety will be determined from evaluation of AEs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs, and ECGs. 
6.4.1 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations including a basic neurologic examination will be performed as indicated 
in the SoA ( Appendix A ). 
If clinically significant abnormalities are observed during Screening, they should be reported in the patient’s medical history; if observed any time after the first dose of study drug (Day 1), they 
will be considered TEAEs. 
Vital signs will be measured at every visit during the study and include resting heart rate, blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured in mm Hg, will be measured after patients have been at rest (seated) for ≥ 3 minutes. Heart rate, 
measured in beats per minute, will be taken after the patient has been in a resting state (se ated) 
for ≥ [ADDRESS_16004] (lying for ≥ 3 minutes). Patient should then 
be instructed to stand, and heart rate and blood pressure should be repeated within 1–3 minutes 
after the patient has stood. 
Unscheduled assessments of vital signs can be performed as necessary.  
6.4.2 Height  
Height will be measured once, at Screening. 
6.4.3 Electrocardiogram 
Twelve-lead ECG tracings will be obtained in triplicate from all patients at every visit as 
indicated in the SoA ( Appendix A ). At Baseline, the 12-lead resting ECG (in triplicate) will be 
performed both before and after dosing. 
Patients should be lying down resting for approximately 15 minutes before each ECG evaluation. 
A central reviewer will be used; instructions will be provided in the imaging manual.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_16005] dose of the 
study drug. Patients should be monitored for AEs and AEs assessed for expectedness consistent 
with the current IB for miricorilant. To help characterize any possible relationships between drug exposure and the clinical event, when an SAE occurs, ACTH, cortisol, and aldosterone levels 
should be assessed as close to the time of the event as possible, and a PK sample may be drawn 
at the discretion of the Investigator.

[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Parameters 
Blood samples will be collected for the analysis of safety in all patients at the times indicated in 
the SoA ( Appendix A ). Laboratory samples will be analyzed at central or local laboratories as 
appropriate. 
Laboratory values for an analyte that are outside of the normal range per the central or local 
laboratory will be identified and should be assessed as clinically significant or not and repeated 
at the Investigator’s discretion (see Section 8.8). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grading for severity of abnormal labs should be applied for consistency in the 
evaluation and grading assessment.  
The Investigator will review all laboratory reports, evaluate the results, and sign/date the report.  
Laboratory tests to be performed are listed in Table 4 and should be performed according to the 
schedule provided in the SoA ( Appendix A ).

[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Volume Summary 
Blood samples will be taken for analysis of safety laboratory, efficacy, and PK parameters, at the 
time points indicated in the SoA ( Appendix A ). The total volume of blood to be collected from 
each patient will be specified in the ICF. 
6.[ADDRESS_16006] -to-hip ratio. 
Body weight will be measured as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix A ). Body weight will be 
measured without overcoat and shoes, and with only light clothing.  
Waist circumference will be measured for all patients as indicated in the SoA ( Appendix A ). 
Clinical sites will be provided with tape measures to ensure consistency of circumference 
measurements. Waist circumference should be measured midway between the lower rib margin 
and iliac crest. Hip circumference should be measured at the level of the widest circumference 
over the greater trochanters. Detailed instructions for measurements of the waist and hip 
circumferences will be provided in the study manual. 
The waist- to-hip ratio will be autocalculated in electronic data capture (EDC) as the ratio of the 
circumference of the waist to the hip. 
6.6 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of miricorilant as 
specified in the SoA ( Appendix A ). Instructions for the collection and handling of biological 
samples will be provided in the study manual. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of 
each sample will be recorded. 
Miricorilant plasma concentration will be used to estimate relevant PK parameters, which will be 
reported as applicable ( Table 5). PK data may also be used in  safety and/ or efficacy evaluations 
related to concerns arising during or after the study. Drug concentration information that would 
unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study 
has been unblinded.

The development and improvement of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16736]. During this study and with the consent of patients (see Section 10.3.1), biological samples (e.g., blood, plasma, serum, or tumor tissue) will be obtained, some for 
analysis during the study and others for future analysis of genes or proteins at the time points 
specified in the SoA ( Appendix A ). These samples will be used to develop a better understanding 
of the mechanisms of both treatment response (predictive biomarkers) and disease processes 
(prognostic biomarkers) and ultimately to identify patients who do or do not have a high 
probability to benefit from treatment with miricorilant. 
6.8 Other Assessments 
6.8.1 Clinician Assessed Outcomes 
The clinician assessed outcome assessments in the study include the BPRS, C-SSRS, CGI, and 
MINI. A brief description of each is provided below. 
The BPRS is a scale used to track changes in schizophrenia symptoms over time. The scale 
involves an interview of the patient by [CONTACT_16776] 24 different symptom areas 
in which the Investigator ranks the severity of each symptom using a scale of 1 (symptom is 
absent) to 7 (symptom is severe). 
The C- SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale used to evaluate suicidality ( Posner et al. 2011). 
The C-SSRS consists of a series of questions to patients that can help identify patients at risk for 
suicide, assess the severity and immediacy of that risk, and gauge the level of support the patient may need. 
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 60 The CGI is a scale used to assess the patient’s global functioning. The CGI has 2 components—
the CGI-Severity (CGI- S), which rates illness severity, and the CGI-Improvement (CGI -I), 
which rates change from the initiation (baseline) of treatment. The CGI-S asks the Investigator 
one question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how 
mentally ill is the patient at this time?”, which is rated on the following 7-point scale: 1=normal, 
not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients. The CGI-I also asks the Investigator 
1 question: “Compared to the patient's condition at Baseline, this patient’s condition is: 
1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from Baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 
6=much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment. Both ratings are based on 
observed and reported symptoms. 
The MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Psychotic Disorders is a brief structured 
interview for the major psychiatric disorders in DSM-5 and ICD-10. 
6.8.2 Patient Reported Outcomes  
Health -related quality of life scores will be measured using self-reported OWLQOL 
questionnaire and WRSM. Both the OWLQOL and the WRSM are intended to be administered 
together. The 17-item OWLQOL measures behavior and feelings that are associated with obesity 
and weight loss using a 7-point response scale that ranges from 0 “not at all” to 6 “a very great deal”. The WRSM is a 20-item measure of the symptoms associated with obesity and obesity treatment, along with the degree to which each symptom “bothers the individual”.  
The questionnaires will be completed from Baseline until Follow-up and should always be 
conducted prior to dosing when conducted on study drug administration days.

8.1 Investigator’s Responsibilities 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study 
and for providing appropriate medical care. By [CONTACT_16779], the 
Investigator remains responsible for managing AEs. All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours from awareness of the event.  
The Investigator (or medically qualified designee) is responsible for determining whether 
an AE is clinically/ medically significant. All available information regarding the AE must be 
documented on the eCRF (or in the patient’s medical record). 
8.2 Monitoring Safety Data During the Study  
Safety results collected during the study (e.g., AEs, laboratory results, physical findings) will 
be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_16780]. All abnormal laboratory results, and ECG and exam findings will be assessed for clinical 
significance. The use of CTCAE severity grading will be implemented for systematically and 
consistently evaluating abnormal laboratory results, and ECG and vital-signs findings. All Grade [ADDRESS_16012] periodic reviews of data to ensure the safety 
of patients ( see Section 5.11).  
8.3 Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding that is inconsistent with the patient’s baseline findings), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether considered related to 
the study drug or not. 
Examples of AEs include: 
• New conditions recorded after signing the ICF. 
• Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either the study drug or a concurrent medication.

• Results in death. 
• Is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16737] (i.e., the patient is at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1666]. 
a 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. b 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening, result in death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. 
a  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16738]/or 
treatment (usually involving at lea st an overnight stay)  that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or in an outpatient setting. 
b  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions (or substantially different from their pre -treatment, baseline functional abilities). This definition is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively uncomplicated influenza and accidental trauma (e.g. , a sprained ankle)  that 
may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do n ot constitute substantial disruption . 
The following are NOT considered SAEs: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
the patient’s baseline. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience considerations. 
• Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for transfusion support or convenience. 
The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE 
information. In the case of patient death, any post- mortem findings/reports will be requested.  
8.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
A suspected unexpected adverse reaction is a serious adverse reaction that is both unexpected, i.e., not present in the product’s Reference Safety Information (RSI) and meets the definition of an SAE, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with those specifically noted in the RSI . 
8.6 Expectedness 
An SAE  is considered unexpected if not reported in the RSI section of the IB or if the event is of 
greater severity or frequency than described in the IB .

Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 72 8.7 Clinical Significance 
The Investigator (or medically qualified designee) is responsible for determining whether 
an AE is clinically significant for the patient. Clinical significance will be documented in the 
patient’s medical records with the AE information. 
8.8 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
All out-of-range laboratory values will be determined to be clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_737]. An abnormal laboratory value that meets any of the following 
criteria will be recorded as an AE on the eCRF: 
• Leads to dose modification or patient withdrawal from the study. 
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]. 
• Requires a change in concomitant medications. 
Other clinically significant laboratory values should be reported as AEs at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Patients with a clinically significant out-of-range laboratory value will be followed until the 
laboratory value returns to normal, or the patient’s baseline value, or the value becomes 
medically stable, or the patient is deemed by [CONTACT_16781]-up. The Investigator will treat the patient as medically required at appropriate intervals until this 
occurs. All Grade 3 and above findings will immediately be reported to the Corcept Medical 
Monitor within 24 hours. 
8.9 Documentation of Adverse Events 
Patients will be evaluated and questioned to identify AEs during the study. Grade 3 and above 
AEs are to be reported to the Sponsor as soon as the Investigator becomes aware. 
Collection of AEs will start immediately following signing of the ICF and will continue 
throughout the study (including the 28 day Follow-up period) as noted in the SoA ( Appendix A ). 
AEs that occur after start of study treatment following randomization to the study drug and up to 
and including [ADDRESS_16014] treatment and medications required for treatment on the appropriate 
eCRF(s).  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the event must be recorded on the Termination eCRF as the reason for discontinuation. 
All AEs that are drug-related and unexpected (not specified in the RSI section of the 
Investigator’s Brochure) or if the event is of greater severity or frequency than that described in 
the Investigator’s Brochure) must be reported to the governing IRB and governing health 
authorities as required.  
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 73 All AEs will be documented on the AE eCRF and in the patient’s medical record. The following 
attributes must be assigned: (1) description, (2) dates of onset and resolution, (3) severity 
(see Section 8.10.1), (4) relationship to the study drug (see Section 8.10.2), (5) seriousness 
criteria if applicable (see Section 8.4), and (6) action taken. The Investigator will actively solicit 
this information and assess the AEs in terms of severity and relationship to the study drug. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a unifying diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  
8.10 Adverse Event Classification 
8.10.1 Intensity Grades of Adverse Events 
The seriousness and severity of an AE are different assessments. To describe the maximum 
severity of the AE on the AE eCRF, the Investigator will use the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0 ( NCI 2017).  For 
events not listed in the NCI -CTCAE, the definitions from the NCI -CTCAE provided in Table 6 
should be used to evaluate the grade of severity for the AE.  
Table 6 Adverse Event Grades Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated  
2 Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (e .g., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, and managing money)  
3 Severe : severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting selfcare  activities of daily living (e.g. , 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden)  
4 Life-threatening: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death: Death related to AE

8.10.2 Assessment of Causality: Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Drug or 
Study  Procedure 
The Investigator responsible for the patient’s care (or qualified designee) will assess causality of 
AEs and SAEs based on the causal attribution guidance in Table 7. The Investigator’s 
assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious) as required for 
safety reporting to health authorities. 
Alternative causes, such as the natural history of the underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug should be 
considered and investigated. 
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  09 June 2022 
Confidential  Page 74 There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is critical that the 
Investigator assesses causality for every SAE prior to the transmission of the SAE report to the Sponsor, since the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_16740]-up information received, amending the SAE report accordingly. 
Several factors should be considered in making this assessment, including: 
• Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of the study treatment/study 
procedure. 
• Whether an alternative etiology has been identified. 
• Mechanism of action of the study drug. 
• Biological plausibility.

Possibly related to study drug An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in  time is 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. An alternative explanation is inconclusive, e.g., concomitant drug (s), concurrent disease (s).  
Probably related to study drug An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. The re lationship in time is 
suggestive. An alternative explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s) or concurrent disease(s).

groups. Each of the 2 hypotheses will be assessed at a 2- sided α=0.05 significance level with no 
adjustment to α for multiplicity. 
9.4 Sample Size Calculation 
The planned sample size is 150 subjects randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_16027] 90% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_16028]. A drop- out rate of 40% from Baseline to Week 26 is 
assumed in this calculation. 
Power is greater if the difference in change from Baseline in body weight between treatment and 
placebo is greater than 5 kg. For example, assuming there is a dose-response relationship where the difference between treatment and placebo is 6 and 7 kg in the 600 and 900 mg miricorilant 
groups, respectively, power would be 97% and 99% for detecting a difference between each 
miricorilant group and placebo. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_16752] (one stratification 
factor with 3 levels). If ≥20 patients complete 26 weeks of treatment (10 patients treated with 
miricorilant and 10 patients treated with placebo) in one of the allowed antipsychotic medication 
groups (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], risperidone or paliperidone, or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), this sample size provides 
60% power to detect a difference in body weight change of 5 kg between the miricorilant and 
placebo groups, at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_16029] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Summarizes will be presented by [CONTACT_16786].

other factors in the model will remain the same. The difference in body weight change at Week  26 between the combined miricorilant treatment groups and placebo will be estimated 
from the model along with its associated 95% CI . 
The percentage of patients in each treatment group who lose ≥5% of their baseline body weight will be presented along with its 95% CI. In addition, a logistic regression model with baseline body weight as a covariate, and antipsychotic medication (stratificati on factor) and randomized 
treatment as fixed effects, will be used to compare each miricorilant dose group to placebo.

Analyses of continuous endpoints assessed at multiple post-treatment timepoints, such as the 
change in BPRS, CGI, OWLQOL , and WRSM  from Baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed using 
models similar to the primary analysis of body weight change. C-SSRS results will be 
summarized descriptively. Endpoints like ACTH, serum cortisol, and serum aldosterone that are

11.3 Documentation 
11.3.1 Source Documentation 
Source documents provide all original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
information from a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial (e.g., a patient’s medical records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, the Investigator’s patient study 
files, results of diagnostic tests, including x-rays, laboratory tests and ECGs). All source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and completed. Changes 
to source data should be traceable (i.e., dated and initialed), should not obscure the original entry, 
and should be explained, if necessary.  
Investigators must retain all original source documents. The Sponsor or its designee will notify 
Investigators in writing when the trial-related records are no longer needed.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_16037]. All data entered into CRFs (paper or electronic) must be substantiated by [CONTACT_16793] a source document.  
Discrepancies between CRFs and their respective source documents should be explained.  All changes in eCRF data entry at the study site will be performed by [CONTACT_16794]. In the event paper CRFs are utilized, any change or 
correction to a CRF should be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not 
obscure the original entry. 
All changes in CRF data entry at the study site will be performed by [CONTACT_16795]. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_16038] (i.e., patient names 
and corresponding study numbers), should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_16039] elapsed 
since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427].  
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  [ADDRESS_16040] be submitted to the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the 
Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
11.3.4 Sample Collection, Preparation, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_16734], preparation, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_16735]. 
11.4 Long-Term Retention of Biological Samples 
All biological samples will be retained by [CONTACT_16796]. Samples will be held for a period up to 15 years 
after completion of the clinical study report. The Sponsor or the designee may store the patient’s 
sample(s) longer if required to address regulatory agency questions; in this event, the patient’s 
sample(s) will be destroyed after all questions are adequately answered.  
An individual patient can choose to withdraw consent to have his/her samples used for future 
research at any time without affecting their participation in the study, or their care by [CONTACT_16797]. After  receipt of a request for sample destruction, that patient’s sample(s) will then no 
longer be used for future research purposes beyond the current study, and their sample(s) will be destroyed. However, if there are ongoing regulatory questions, the patient’s sample(s) will be destroyed after all questions are adequately answered. 
The long-term retention samples will be coded to allow de-identification according to applicable 
regulatory guidelines. It is the responsibility of the trial site to ensure that samples are appropriately labelled in accordance with trial procedures to comply with all applicable laws. 
Biological samples collected from participants as part of this trial will be transported, stored, 
accessed, and processed in accordance with all applicable laws relating to the use and storage of human tissue for research purposes. 
11.5 Clinical Supplies 
11.5.1 Inventory, Reconciliation, Return, and Disposition of Clinical Supplies 
All study drug and related materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or 
returned according to applicable state and federal regulations /government health authorities  and 
study procedures. Storage of study drug is described in Table 1. 
11.5.[ADDRESS_16041] be dispensed only by [CONTACT_16798].  
Protocol CORT118335 -877 
Corcept Therapeutics   Amendment 5  |  [ADDRESS_16042] provide an explanation for any destroyed 
or missing study drug or study materials. 
The Investigator or their designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including 
dates and quantities) of study drug(s) received, patients to whom study drug is dispensed 
(patient-by-patient dose-specific accounting), and study drug lost or accidentally or deliberately destroyed. The Investigator or their designee must retain all unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_16741] (on-site clinical research associate) has confirmed the accountability data 
and Sponsor has approved return or destruction. 
11.5.3 Return or Destruction of Study Drug and/or Supplies 
At the end of the study, after final drug-inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_11200], the study 
site will either return study drug and/or supplies to the Sponsor or designee, or destroy all unused 
study drug and/or supplies, including empty containers, according to institutional policy. 
11.5.4 Study Drug Destroyed by [CONTACT_16799]/undispensed study drug and/or supplies  may be destroyed on site, per the site’s SOPs, 
but only after Sponsor has granted approval for drug destruction. The study monitor must 
account for all study drug in a formal reconciliation process, before study-drug destruction.  
Any destruction of study drug on site must be documented. Documentation must be provided to 
the Sponsor and retained in the Investigator study files. 
11.5.5 Study Drug Returned to Sponsor for Destruction 
If a site is unable to destroy unused/undispensed study drug and/or supplies appropriately, the 
site can request return of study drug and/or supplies to the Sponsor or designee.  
The return of study drug and/or supplies must be accounted for on a Study Drug Return Form 
provided by [CONTACT_16015] 
11.5.[ADDRESS_16043] (quantity and 
condition), patient dispensing records, and returned, lost, or accidentally or deliberately 
destroyed study product.  
Dispensing records will document quantities received from the Sponsor (or designee) and 
quantities dispensed to patients, including lot number, date dispensed, patient identifier number, 
patient initials, the initials of the person dispensing the drug, quantities of drug returned by [CONTACT_16800]/return of returned study drug.

Confidential  Page 88 11.7 Protocol Noncompliance  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with requirements in the clinical-trial protocol, GCP, 
or the manual of procedures (MOP). The noncompliance may be on the part of the patient, the 
Investigator, or the study-site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions consistent with ICH E6(R2) may be implemented.  
Prospective approval of deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria, known as protocol 
waivers or exemptions are not permitted. Changes to the conduct of the protocol may not be made, except to address an immediate risk to the subject, unless the change has been submitted to the regulatory authorities for review and the change has been approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
Sponsor clinical-study staff and contractors may acknowledge, but not approve, protocol 
deviations reported by a site that have happened or are planned to happen.  
Any significant protocol deviations affecting patient eligibility and/or safety or data integrity 
must be submitted to the IRB and regulatory authorities, as applicable, prior to implementation.  
After the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_16801], any change that might affect the 
approval of the IRBs must be documented in the form of a protocol amendment. The amended 
protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_16802], as local regulations require.  
11.[ADDRESS_16045] editorial and ethical practice and with 
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) requirements.

be validated and in compliance with 21 CFR Part 11. The validation documentation should be made available at all times during inspection or Sponsor audits. Any modification to the 
validated system should be documented via a quality change control process and justified to their 
intended use.

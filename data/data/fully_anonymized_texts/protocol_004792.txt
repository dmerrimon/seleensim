Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 11 of 87 Key Assessments:  Safety will be monitored through AEs, application site assessments, vital 
signs, physical examinations, safety labs, C-SSRS  (12 years and older) , 
either PHQ -8 (in adults) , modified version of the PHQ -A (in adolescents) or 
Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI -2), parent report for children (6-11 
years old, inclusive), assessments . 
Efficacy assessments will include IGA, I-IGA, PASI/mPASI, BSA, WI- NRS 
(12 years and older), PSD (adults only) , and DLQI  (>17 years of age 
)/CDLQI  (subjects 2 to 16 inclusive) .  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected at pre -dose (trough) on days 
1 (baseline), 29 (week 4), and 57 (week 8)  for all subjects. Refer to the 
Schedule of Visits and Assessments ( Section 2) for detailed schedules of the 
study assessments.  
Study Endpoints  The Primary Efficacy Endpoint is IGA success, defined as  an IGA score of 
‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ PLUS a 2 -grade improvement from Baseline at 
week 8. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will include:  
• Achievement of Psoriasis Area Severity Index 75 ( PASI -75; subjects 
who achieve a 75% reduction in PASI from Baseline) at week 8 
• For subjects with intertriginous area involvement, and with severity of 
the intertriginous lesions at least ‘mild’ (intertriginous IGA (I -IGA) ≥2) 
at Baseline, achievement of ‘I- IGA’ score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ 
PLUS a 2 -grade imp rovement from Baseline at week 8.  
• In subjects with WI -NRS pruritus score ≥ 4 at baseline, achievement of a 
4-point reduction in WI -NRS pruritus score at week 8  
• In subjects with WI -NRS pruritus score ≥ 4 at baseline , achievement of a 
4-point reduction in W I-NRS pruritus score at week 4  
• In subjects with WI -NRS pruritus score ≥ 4 at baseline , achievement of a 
4-point reduction in WI -NRS pruritus score at week 2  
• Change from Baseline in t otal Psoriasis Symptoms Diary (PSD) score at 
week 8. 
• Change from Baseline  in PSD score at week 4. 
• Time to  achieving Psoriasis Area Severity Index -50 (PASI-5 0) 
• For subjects with intertriginous area involvement, and with severity of 
the intertriginous lesions at least ‘mild’ (I -IGA ≥2) at Baseline, 
achievement of ‘I -IGA’ score of ‘clear’ at week 8.  
• Achievement of Psoriasis Area Severity Index -90 (PASI- 90; subjects 
who achieve a 90% reduction in PASI from Baseline) at week 8.  
Statistical 
Considerations : Approximately 400 subjects are planned for this study.   
Approximately 267 subjects will receive ARQ -151 cream 0.3%  QD; 
approximately 133 subjects will receive matching vehicle cream QD.  
The randomization scheme will be 2:1 (ARQ -151 cream 0.3%  QD : 
matchin g vehicle QD ) stratified by [CONTACT_82385], baseline IGA (IGA=2 vs. 
IGA≥3), and intertriginous involvement at baseline (I -IGA>2, yes vs no) . 
This sample size provides >99% power to detect a 22.4% difference between 
treatment groups on IGA success at α=0.[ADDRESS_212277].  
The results from a recent phase 2b study (ARQ -151-201) of ARQ -151 
Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 12 of 87 compared to vehicle treatment were used  to estimate the treatment 
difference .  Specifically, in th e phase 2b trial, 32.2% of subjects 
demonstrated IGA success in the ARQ -151 0.3% group and 9.8% of subjects 
demonstrated IGA success in the vehicle group.  
The number of subjects to be enrolled will  also provide sufficient power for 
the first 5 secondary endpoints .  Additionally, the larger study size  is 
included in order to provide additional/sufficient numbers of subjects on 
ARQ- 151 treatment for a safety database.  
Descriptive statistics will be pr esented for the endpoint  and safety  data 
collected in the clinical trial. This includes the number and percentage of 
subjects for binary endpoints/categorical data,  and mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum for continuous data.  
The primary endpoint of ‘IGA success at week 8’ will be analyzed using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test  stratified by [CONTACT_3885] , IGA at baseline, and 
intertriginous  involvement  at baseline . The analysis will be performed on the 
Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population and missing data will be imputed using 
multiple imputation.  
Continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using Analysis of 
Covariance with treatment and stratification factors as independent variables.  
The ITT population will be used and missing data will be imputed us ing 
multiple imputation.  Binary secondary endpoints will be analyzed similarly 
to the primary endpoint.   Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using the 
Kaplan- Meier estimator. Treatment group comparisons will be performed 
using the log -rank statistic.  
Secondary endpoints will only be tested statistically if the primary endpoint 
is considered statistically significant.  To control for multiple comparisons 
among the secondary endpoints , the following multiplicity procedure will be 
used: 
• Upon successful t esting of the primary endpoint, the alpha will be 
partitioned to test secondary endpoints families 1 and 2 (partition 1) 
and to test additional WI -NRS timepoints (partition 2)  
• Partition 1 of a lpha = 0.[ADDRESS_212278] secondary 
endpoint family 1 and secondary endpoint family 2.  The endpoints 
in family 1 will be tested independently using a Bonferroni split of 
the alpha; the next 5 secondary endpoints (secondary endpoint 
family 2) will be tested using the alpha available after testing 
endpoint family 1.  The Holm procedure will be used to control for 
multiple comparisons in secondary endpoint family 2.  
• Partition 2 of a lpha = 0.[ADDRESS_212279]  or vehicle cream  will be included in the safety 
population.  
Adverse events  (AEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_180394], system organ 
class, and treatment group for all treatment -emergent AEs, serious AEs, 
related AEs, AEs leading to  withdrawal from investigational product , and 
AEs leading to withdrawal from study .  
Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 13 of 87 Safety laboratory  parameters and vital signs wil l be summarized at each visit 
using descriptive statistics or frequencies and percentages, as appropriate. 
Changes from baseline in laboratory values and vital signs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_765]. In addition, changes from baseline in weight and 
laborat ory values will be summarized using shift tables.  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the PHQ -8 (adults) or Modified 
PHQ- A (adolescents)  and CDI -2 (children) . 
The C -SSRS will be analyzed per the Scoring and Data Analysis Guide from 
the Columbia Lighthouse Project.

Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212287] is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approved globally to reduce the risk of 
exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated 
with chronic bronchitis.  Roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide, are high 
affinity selective inhibitors of PDE-4 (a major cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate 
(cyclic AMP)-metabolizing enzyme), whose activity leads to accumulation of intracellular 
cyclic AMP.  There are four different subtypes of PDE-4: PDE-4a, PDE-4b, PDE-4c, and 
PDE-4d, each with several isoforms (splicing variants).  IC [ADDRESS_212288] N-oxide for the different PDE-4 isoforms and subtypes are mostly sub-nanomolar and single digit nanomolar (Hatzelmann 2010).  The PDE-[ADDRESS_212289] suggested a 
deficiency of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in human psoriatic skin ( Brion 1986).  
More recently, various cytokines produced by [CONTACT_78443]1 and Th17 cells have been shown to play a 
crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  It has been postulated that the anti-inflammatory 
effects of PDE-4 inhibitors may provide a beneficial therapeutic intervention in the treatment of 
chronic plaque psoriasis, and recently Otezla
® (apremilast) a PDE-[ADDRESS_212290] and its active N-oxide 
metabolite in multiple species via the oral route of administration was conducted to support 
registration.

6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled study in which ARQ-151 cream 0.3% or 
vehicle cream QD is applied for 8 weeks to subjects with between 2% to 20% (inclusive) BSA of 
chronic plaque psoriasis. 
 
Approximately [ADDRESS_212292] an Investigator’s Global Assessment of disease severity (IGA) of at least Mild (‘2’) at Baseline.  Subjects must have at least 2% and no more than 20% 
Body Surface Area (BSA) of chronic plaque psoriasis.  All psoriasis lesions on a subject will be 
treated including the face, trunk, genitals/skin folds, or limbs (excluding the scalp).  The palms 
and soles will be treated but will not be counted towards any measurements of efficacy (IGA, 
BSA, PASI/mPASI ).  For subjects with intertriginous area involvement, and with severity of the 
intertriginous area lesions at least ‘mild’ (IGA≥2) at Baseline, ‘I-IGA’ score will be recorded at subsequent visits.  The same IGA used for the primary endpoint (whole body) will also be used 
for ‘intertriginous area lesion IGA score’ (I-IGA), but only intertriginous areas will be evaluated 
for I-IGA, not the rest of the body.

approval, to participate in an open-label extension study (ARQ-151-306) of up to 6 months. 
The Week 8 visit of the present study would be the Day 1 visit for ARQ-151-306 and there 
would not be a Week 9 follow-up visit. 
 
For subjects who do not enter ARQ-151-306 there will be a minimum of 7 clinic visits, including 
Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8 of treatment, as well as a Week 9 
follow-up visit ([ADDRESS_212294] dose).  Since the interval between the Screening and Baseline 
visits may be up to [ADDRESS_212295] participation is 
~[ADDRESS_212296] has been assigned to one of the treatment groups. 
 
Assignment of drug or vehicle will be made at a 2:1 ratio to ARQ-151 cream 0.3% or vehicle 
cream QD according to a computer-generated randomization list.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_3885], baseline IGA (IGA=2 vs. IGA≥3), and intertriginous involvement at 
baseline (I-IGA>2, yes vs no). 
 Kits containing tubes of investigational product will be assigned to each subject using an 
internet-based randomization system (IWRS). A subject may receive more than one kit for the 
treatment period. The kits and tubes are blinded and each kit is assigned a unique kit number.  
 
Subjects will apply ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD or vehicle cream QD to psoriatic plaques of 
2% BSA up to a maximum application area of 20% BSA.

Generally, the addition of new medications, including nonprescription medications, during the 
course of the study is discouraged.  However, the short-term use of a medication may be 
authorized by [CONTACT_737].  The Investigator must make the decision to authorize the use of 
any such a medication only after consideration of the clinical situation, the potential for masking 
symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether the use of the medication will 
compromise the outcome or validity of the clinical investigation.  If medication is required, 
the name, strength, frequency, duration of use, and reason for use will be recorded in source 
documents and transcribed to Case Report Forms.  Medications which have been used 
chronically by [CONTACT_1766], in particular statins and anti-hypertensives, are allowed for use during the study, except as prohibited in ‘Exclusions’ (Table 1).

unique number. 
 
The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of the investigational product (ARQ-151 cream 
0.3%, and matching vehicle cream) to each site to allow for completion of this study. 
 
Records will be made of the receipt and dispensing of the investigational product supplied. 
At the conclusion of the study, any unused investigational product will be returned to the 
Sponsor or designee, or destroyed, as per Sponsor instructions. 
 
Refer to the current version of the IP Handling Manual for details on the accountability, storage, 
and management of the IP. 
6.6.2 Blinding 
This is a double-blind study, therefore neither the subjects nor the Investigator, clinical 
personnel, or the Sponsor will be aware of which treatment an individual has received. 
6.6.3 Treatment Administration 
At the randomization visit (Baseline visit), the study staff will demonstrate to the subject how to 
apply ARQ-[ADDRESS_212309] at randomization.  Study site staff will be trained to ensure a unit dose (a pea size unit of 
ARQ-151or vehicle cream will cover approximately 1% BSA) is properly squeezed from the 
tube and applied to psoriatic lesion(s) as a thin film and rubbed in using the index and middle 
finger, rubbing in thoroughly but gently, until the ‘white’ has disappeared.  The subject/caregiver 
will then practice squeezing a similar amount on to their index and middle finger and apply a thin 
film to other psoriatic areas to be treated.  The study staff will confirm that the subject’s application technique is correct. 
 
Re-training will be conducted at subsequent visits (weeks 2, 4, and 6) as needed (i.e., if the returned tube(s) weighs substantially different than the expected weight). 
Subjects/caregivers will be instructed to apply investigational product once daily.  All subjects 
should apply investigational product each evening (except on clinic visit days) at least 15 
minutes after showering or bathing (if they take an evening shower/bath) and then not wash areas 
where ARQ-[ADDRESS_212310] 20 minutes before going to bed. 
Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 37 of 87  
Subjects/caregivers should continue to apply investigational product to all treatment areas 
identified by [CONTACT_180397], using a Body Diagram, even if that area has cleared 
during the treatment period.  New plaques that develop during the study should be treated as 
well.  
 Each investigational product tube will be weighed prior to dispensing at the baseline visit and 
subsequent visits.  Investigational product tubes must be returned by [CONTACT_180398], 
both empty and full, and will be weighed.  If the subject’s actual use is substantially different 
than the expected use for the subject’s BSA (see IP Manual), the subject will be retrained on the 
investigational product application technique. 
6.6.[ADDRESS_212311] tubes will be weighed at each follow-up clinic visit. 
Subjects/caregivers will complete a daily diary recording the date and time of each dose applied, 
any missed doses, and a comment section should the subjects have a comment, e.g., record 
potential AEs. Site personnel will review the diaries and use the information to question the 
subject regarding compliance and AEs and then record appropriate information in source 
documents and complete Case Report Forms (CRFs).  If a subject misses a dose, they should be 
instructed to return to the protocol investigational product administration schedule (i.e. if subject forgets a dose they should wait until that evening and apply as usual). 
A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 
80% of the expected applications during the investigational product application period and does 
not miss more than [ADDRESS_212312] returns for the next 
visit.  
If the diary shows less than 80% of expected use, the subject is using too little investigational 
product and retraining must be conducted and documented.  
Compliance will be documented in source and in eCRF.

The CDI-2 Assessment will be performed only for subjects 6-11 years old (inclusive) as follows: 
• Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8  
The CDI-2 quantifies depressive symptomatology using reports from children/adolescents, 
teachers, and parents or caregivers. It is recommended for use in initial evaluation and is 
appropriate when there is a need for an assessment and robust description of a child’s depressive 
symptoms. 
CDI-2 is available as a self report long and short form, and a parent report form:  
• CDI 2: Self-Report (Short) version (CDI 2:SR[S]). The CDI 2:SR(S) Form is an efficient 
screening measure that contains 12 items and takes about half the time of the full-length 
version to administer (5-10 minutes).The CDI 2:SR(S) has excellent psychometric 
properties and yields a Total Score that is generally very comparable to the one produced 
by [CONTACT_152627]-length version.  
• CDI: Parent (CDI:P) Forms consist of items that correspond to the self-report version and 
are suitably rephrased. Item selection for the parent form was guided to maximize 
validity, and thus focused on observable manifestations of depression. 
This study will use the CDI Parent Report Form. An example of the Parent report form is 
presented in Appendix 6.

The 8 item Modified PHQ-A Assessment will be performed in adolescent subjects as follows:  
Screening, Baseline, Weeks [ADDRESS_212315] with a Modified PHQ-A score of ‘15’ or above should be referred promptly to a 
mental health care professional and, if currently applying investigational product, consideration 
be given to discontinuation from investigational product.  
 
 
Modified PHQ-A score is the sum of the responses for the 8 questions. 
 
Five severity categories of depression are defined as follows:  
• None – Minimal depression (0 to 4)  
• Mild depression (5 to 9)  
• Moderate depression (10 to 14)  
• Moderately severe depression (15 to 19)

The administration schedule of the C-SSRS will be: 
 
• The Baseline-Screening version (Appendix 1) will be used at Screening to provide a pre-treatment assessment baseline.  
o If a subject has a score greater than [ADDRESS_212316] in the study.  
• On all subsequent visits, the Since Last Visit version (Appendix 2) will be used. 
o Any score greater than [ADDRESS_212317]. This should result in prompt referral 
to a mental health professional and/or possibly the emergency room. The Medical 
Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
 The trained administrator will conduct the C-SSRS.  The C-SSRS administrator will be trained 
via the C-SSRS training video. A training certificate for the administer(s) will be on file in the 
trial master file at the site. 
 
The Investigator must review the completed C-SSRS.  A qualified mental health care provider 
must be available, immediately if needed, to refer the subject for further evaluation. 
7.1.9 Local Tolerability Assessments  
The Investigator Local Tolerability Assessment will be performed as follows: 
Baseline, Weeks 4, and 8  Application site reactions will be graded at the timepoints outlined in the Schedule of Visits and 
Assessments (Section 2).  Irritation reactions are graded using the scale detailed in the following 
section (Berger-1982).  Reactions at the site of product application, which may occur post-
Baseline, should be differentiated from the preexisting inflammation associated with the 
subject’s psoriasis. 
 
The investigator assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_180399].

7.2.1 Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 
Investigator Global Assessments (‘whole body’ and ‘intertriginous area’) will be performed at 
the following study visits.  The IGA should be completed prior to other physician assessments. 
 Screening, Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 (if applicable) 
 
The IGA is a static evaluation of qualitative overall psoriasis severity.  This global assessment 
scale is an ordinal scale with five severity grades (reported only in integers of 0 to 4).  Each 
grade is defined by a distinct and clinically relevant morphologic description that minimizes 
inter-observer variability.  
 
Note: Palms and soles will be treated in this study with investigational product, but will not be 
counted towards IGA, PASI/mPASI , or BSA assessments. 
 Every effort should be made for the same Evaluator to complete the IGA for the subject at 
every study visit. 
 
Investigator Global Assessment of Disease (IGA) 
 
Scale  Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Plaque thickening = no elevation or thickening over normal skin  
Scaling = no evidence of scaling 
Erythema = none (no residual red coloration but post -inflammatory 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_22765])  
[ADDRESS_212319] 
Clear  Plaque thickening = none or possible thickening but difficult to ascertain 
if there is a slight elevation above normal skin level  
Scaling = none or residual surface drying and scaling  
Erythema = light pi[INVESTIGATOR_22766]  
2 Mild  Plaque thickening = slight but definite elevation  
Scaling = fine scales partially or mostly covering the lesions  
Erythema = light red coloration  
3 Moderate  Plaque thickening = moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges  
Scaling = most lesions at least partially covered  
Erythema = definite red coloration  
4 Severe Plaque thickening = marked or very marked elevation typi[INVESTIGATOR_180391] = non-tenacious or thick tenacious scale, covering most or all of 
lesions  
Erythema = very bright red coloration; ext reme red coloration; deep red 
coloration  
 
The standard ‘whole body’ IGA shown above will be recorded for every subject in the 
study. 
For subjects with intertriginous area involvement of at least ‘mild’ severity by [CONTACT_78442] (I-IGA≥2) at 
Baseline (using the IGA scale shown above but evaluating intertriginous areas ONLY and NOT 
Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc.

weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 (if applicable). 
This ‘intertriginous area IGA’ (I-IGA) should be done AFTER the ‘standard whole body 
IGA’ (primary endpoint) in subjects who qualify.  
7.2.2 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI ) and Modified Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index (mPASI) 
Assessments will be performed as single assessments at each timepoint, from which both PASIs 
and mPASIs will be calculated. 
PASI/mPASI assessments will be performed as follows: 
Screening, Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 (if applicable) Every effort should be made for the same Evaluator to complete the PASI/mPASI for the 
subject at every study visit. 
 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)/Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) 
is used for the measurement of severity of psoriasis.  
 
PASI/mPASI  combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a 
single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease).  
The body is divided into four sections (head (h) (10% of a person's skin); arms (a) (20%); 
trunk (t) (30%); legs (l) (40%)). Each of these areas is scored by [CONTACT_5071], and then the four scores 
are combined into the final PASI/mPASI. For each section, the percent of area (A) of skin 
involved is estimated and then transformed into a grade from 0 to 6 (A):  
0. 0% of involved area 
1. < 10% of involved area 
2. 10–29% of involved area 
3. 30–49% of involved area 
4. 50–69% of involved area 
5. 70–89% of involved area 
6. 90–100% of involved area 
 
mPASI : for subjects with < 10% of an involved anatomic area, the mPASI will be calculated 
using the actual percentage of the anatomical area involved (e.g. 0.1 for 1%, 0.2 for 2%, 0.3 for 3%, … 0.9 for 9%), corresponding to the actual percentage of that particular anatomical area of 
involvement.  
Note: Palms and soles may be treated with investigational product in this study, but will not be 
counted towards IGA, PASI/mPASI , or BSA assessments. 
 
Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 47 of 87 Within each area, the severity is estimated by [CONTACT_78452]: erythema (‘E’; redness), 
induration (‘T’; thickness) and desquamation (‘S’; scaling). Severity parameters are measured on 
a scale of 0 to 4, from none to maximum severity possible. 
 
To calculate the PASI/mPASI, the sum of the severity rating for the three main signs are 
multiplied with the numerical value of the area affected and with the various percentages of the 
four body areas. These values are then added to complete the formula as follows: 
 
PASI = 0.1 (Eh + Th + Sh) Ah + 0.2 (Ea + Ta + Sa) Aa + 0.3 (Et + Tt + St) At + 0.4 (El + Tl + Sl) Al 
7.2.3 Body Surface Area (BSA) 
BSA Assessments will be performed as follows: 
Screening, Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 (if applicable)  
The BSA affected by [CONTACT_78453]’s hand method, where the 
subject’s hand (including fingers) surface area is assumed to equal 1% of body surface area 
(BSA). 
 
Note: Palms and soles will be treated with investigational product, but will not be counted 
towards IGA, PASI/mPASI , or BSA assessments. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_212320] Itch Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS)  
WI-NRS Assessments will be performed for subjects 12 years and older as follows: 
Screening, Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9 (if applicable) 
 
The WI-NRS has been developed as a simple, single item to assess the patient-reported severity 
of this symptom at its highest intensity during the previous 24-hour period. (Naegeli 2015).  
The WI-NRS will be determined by [CONTACT_63397]’s assessment of worst itch over the past 
24 hours.  The scale is from ‘0 to 10’ (“no itch” to “worst imaginable itch”). Subjects will 
complete the WI-NRS pruritus assessment. 
 
 
 
7.2.5 Psoriasis Symptom Diary (PSD)  
The PSD will be completed, by [CONTACT_180400]

21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 48 of 87  
Subjects will complete the PSD. See Appendix 3 for the PSD. 
7.2.6 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality 
Index  (CDLQI) 
The DLQI (age >17 years) and CDLQI (age 2-16 years) will be completed as follows: 
 
Screening, Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, and 8 
 
Subjects/caregivers will complete the CDLQI/DLQI. See Appendix 4 for the DLQI and CDLQI. 
7.2.7 Dermal Imaging 
Medical photography will be performed at all site s using Canfield photography equipment at 
Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. 
 
Photography should be focused on single lesions or specific body sections (e.g. arm). Subjects 
with intertriginous involvement will have also photos of the intertriginous area.  
 
Body or half body photos should only be taken if necessary. All efforts will be made to de-
identify the subjects. Subjects who are unwilling to participate in the medical photography will be allowed to opt out of this procedure and documented on the informed consent.  
 
Refer to the current Photography Manual for instructions regarding photography. 
7.3 Pharmacokinetics Assessment 
PK draws will be performed as follows for all subjects at all sites: 
 
Baseline, Weeks [ADDRESS_212321] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Protocol ARQ-151-301 Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
21 February 2020 Confidential  Page 49 of 87 A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, 
having been absent pretreatment, or worsens relative to the pretreatment state.  
 
The definition of AEs includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  Worsening 
indicates that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  When recording such events, provide 
descriptions that the pre-existing condition has changed (e.g., worsening hypertension for a 
subject with pre-existing hypertension).  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during 
the study or involves an intervention, such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an AE. 
In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the 
investigator’s judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs.  However, abnormal laboratory findings 
that result in new or worsening clinical sequelae, or that require therapy or adjustment in current 
therapy, are considered AEs.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory 
abnormality) are to be recorded as the AE. 
Application site reactions will be considered adverse events if they require intervention, 
suspension or discontinuation of study investigational product. 
7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event  
The definitions and reporting requirements of Health Canada/the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)/ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to.  If any AEs are serious, as defined by [CONTACT_78454], required procedures will be followed.   
All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor (or delegate) via fax or e-mail within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event, whether or not the serious events are deemed IP-related.  All 
serious event reporting will adhere to ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and ICH 
E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.:  
The ERB/IRB will be notified of the Alert Reports as per HC, FDA, ICH and the IRB/ERB’s 
policies and procedures. 
An SAE is any AE that in the view of either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], results in any of the following 
outcomes: Death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events 
that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47022], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212322] caused death. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78428] (e.g. caregiver relief) 
• Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities 
• Emergency room visits 
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures) 
• <24 hour admissions for observation or evaluation 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], social, and/or convenience admissions 
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation for the individual subject. 
• Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs; however, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it occurs during the reporting period and meets the definition of an AE.  
For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be 
reported as an AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE. 
 
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current IND/CTA. 
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact [CONTACT_180401]. 
7.4.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
This is defined as a serious adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the known study treatment information. A serious event or reaction is not defined as a S[LOCATION_003]R 
when: ‘it is serious but expected’ or it does not fit the definition of an SAE, whether expected or 
not.  
7.4.4 Safety Review 
At each follow-up visit, subjects will be queried with an open-ended question such as: 
‘How have you been feeling since your last visit?’  Additionally, the study staff will review 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212323] and determine if an AE occurred. 
 
AEs (whether serious or non-serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value(s) 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78430]/or followed up for up to one month after end of 
treatment until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_1600]. 
 
Where appropriate, medical test(s) and/or examination(s) will be performed to document 
resolution of event(s).  Outcome may be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, 
fatal or unknown (lost to follow-up). 
7.4.[ADDRESS_212324] treatment 
(unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, likely).  Each sign or symptom reported will be graded 
on the NIH NCI CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5-point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).  
The date and time of onset, time relationship to investigational product dosing, duration, and 
outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow-up) of each 
event will be noted. 
 
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product will be assessed using the following definitions: 
Unrelated • The AE must clearly be caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, or the study 
procedure/conditions. 
• Definitely not related to investigational product. 
• Temporal sequence of an AE onset relative to administration of investigational product not reasonable. 
• Another obvious cause of an AE. 
Unlikely • Time sequence is unreasonable. 
• There is another more likely cause for an AE. 
Possibly • Corresponds to what is known about the investigational product. 
• Time sequence is reasonable. 
• Could have been due to another equally, likely cause. 
Probably • Is a known effect of the investigational product. 
• Time sequence from taking investigational product is reasonable. 
• Ceases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81888].

Likely • Is a known effect of the investigational product (e.g., listed in Physicians' 
Desk Reference, Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties, IB). 
• Time sequence from taking investigational product is reasonable. 
• Event stops upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_54489], event returns upon restarting investigational product. 
 
The following CTCAE toxicity grading scale 5-point severity scale definitions for rating 
maximum severity will be used: 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.*  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living.** 
Note: An experience may be severe but may not be serious, e.g., severe headache). 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; ur gent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
Note:  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
*Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
AEs will be coded using the most current MedDRA® version available at the start of the study 
(e.g., 21.0 or higher).

8.1 Statistical Methods 
The methodology presented below is a summary of the more detailed analysis plan that will be 
presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized before the database 
is locked and unblinded.  Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be 
described and justified in the clinical study report. 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS
® (Version 9.4 or later) unless otherwise 
stated.  Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy, safety and 
pharmacokinetic results.  For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in 
each category will be presented.  The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of 
subjects appropriate for the purpose of analysis.  For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics 
will include n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, 
and maximum. 
Missing IGA scores will be imputed using multiple imputation. 
8.1.1 Determination of Sample Size 
A sample size of approximately 400 subjects are planned for the study.  
Approximately 267 subjects will receive ARQ-151 cream 0.3% QD; approximately 133 subjects 
will receive vehicle cream QD.  The randomization scheme will be 2:1 (ARQ-151 cream 0.3% 
QD: matching vehicle QD). 
This sample size provides >99% power to detect a 22.4% difference between treatment groups 
on IGA success at α=0.[ADDRESS_212328].  The results from a recent phase 2b 
study (ARQ-151-201) of ARQ-151 compared to vehicle treatment were used to estimate the 
treatment difference.  Specifically, in this trial 32.2% of subjects reported IGA success in the ARQ-151 0.3% group and 9.8% of subjects reported IGA success in the vehicle group. 
 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212329] 5 secondary 
endpoints.  Additionally, the larger study size is included in order to provide additional/sufficient 
numbers of subjects on ARQ-[ADDRESS_212330] or vehicle cream.  This population will be used for all safety 
analyses. 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects.  This population 
will be the primary analysis population for the analysis of efficacy endpoints. 
The I-IGA population is a subset of the ITT population and includes subjects with intertriginous 
area involvement, and with severity of the intertriginous lesions at least ‘mild’ (intertriginous IGA (I-IGA) ≥2) at Baseline.  This population will be used for the analysis of I-IGA endpoints. 
The Pruritis population is a subject of the ITT population and includes subjects with WI-NRS 
pruritus score ≥ [ADDRESS_212331], completing treatment, 
completing study, and withdrawing prematurely (with reason for withdrawal) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
8.1.6 Protocol Deviations and Eligibility Deviations 
The number of subjects with important protocol deviations and/or eligibility deviations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212332] application compliance will be calculated based on number of 
applications divided by [CONTACT_125094] (amount) of  investigational product applications for each subject.  Compliance will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  
8.2 Efficacy Evaluation 
8.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable in this study is success  in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of 
disease severity, defined as an IGA of ‘Clear’ or ‘Almost Clear’ plus a 2-grade improvement 
from Baseline at Week 8. 
 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_3725] , 
baseline IGA, and baseline intertriginous involvement.  Statistical significance will be concluded at the 5% significance level (2-sided). 
 
Missing IGA scores will be imputed using multiple imputation. 
8.2.2 Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will include: 
• Achievement of Psoriasis Area Severity Index-75 (PASI-75; subjects who achieve a 
75% reduction in PASI from Baseline) at week 8.

Index (CDLQI) 
Both the DLQI and CDLQI will be analyzed by [CONTACT_180408] 2, 4, and 8 as compared to Baseline. 
8.4.3 Psoriasis Symptom Diary (PSD) 
The PSD will be analyzed as the change from baseline in responses to the questions of PSD 
weeks 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_212338] and its N-oxide metabolite 
will be collected at scheduled time points as delineated in the Schedule of Visits and 
Assessments (Section 2). 
A manual for blood sampling, collection, processing, and sample shipment will be provided in a 
separate document. 
[ADDRESS_212339]  
Before enrollment of patients into the study, the current protocol and ICF will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_180409], as required by [CONTACT_8415] (21 CFR § 56), Health Canada, 
and ICH GCP regulations.  A letter documenting the IRB or IEC approval must be received by 
[CONTACT_1034] (or delegate) before the initiation of the study at a clinical site. Amendments to the protocol will be subject to the same requirements as the original protocol. 
The Investigator, Sponsor, or designee will submit a progress report at least once yearly to the 
IRB or IEC. However, the frequency of these reports will depend on IRB or IEC requirements. 
As soon as possible after completion or termination of the study, the Investigator will submit a 
final report to the IRB or IEC per the IRB or IEC requirements, and in compliance with FDA and 
Health Canada regulations and ICH GCP guidelines. 
The Investigator, the Sponsor, or designee shall promptly notify the IRB or IEC of any SAEs, 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs, or any other information that may affect the safe use of the investigational product 
during the study, per the IRB or IEC local requirements, and in compliance with FDA and 
Health  Canada regulations and ICH GCP guidelines. 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212340] of the Study 
This research will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the principles of the 
Tri Council Policy Statement (TCPS), the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and the ICH harmonized tripartite guideline regarding GCP (E6 Consolidated 
Guidance, April 1996). 
9.1.[ADDRESS_212341] Information and Consent 
The purpose of the study, the procedures to be carried out and the potential hazards will be 
described to the subjects in non-technical terms. Subjects will be required to read, sign and date a 
current version of the IRB/EC approved ICF/assent (if appropriate) summarizing the discussion 
prior to screening and will be assured that they may withdraw from the study at any time without 
jeopardizing their medical care. 
Subjects will be given a signed copy of their ICF. 9.[ADDRESS_212342] participating in the study. 
The final data from the investigational site will be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) after 
completion of the final subject visit at that site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_212343] been collected and a site closure visit has been performed. The investigator 
may initiate site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is 
given in advance of the intended termination. 
  
Reasons for the early closure of an investigational site by [CONTACT_79981]: 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the Sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. 
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_093]. 
• Discontinuation of further IP development 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212344], 
all requirements of the investigation to be undertaken, and all of his/her responsibilities as an 
Investigator.  Sponsor representatives will also visit the clinical site at appropriate intervals as 
required to ensure compliance with the protocol and to verify the accuracy and completeness of 
data reported on the CRFs.  The Study Director or designees shall be available for consultation 
with the Investigator and serve as liaisons between the clinical site and the Sponsor. 
The Sponsor or authorized designees may inspect all documents and records required to be 
maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to medical records (office, clinic, 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and investigational product dispensation logs for the subjects in this clinical 
investigation.  The Investigator must permit access to such records.  The Investigator must 
obtain, as part of informed consent, permission for an authorized representative of the Sponsor, 
or regulatory authorities, to review, in confidence, any records identifying subjects. 
9.[ADDRESS_212345] to review by [CONTACT_116778].  
The Clinical Study Report will be audited by [CONTACT_180410]’s Quality 
Assurance (QA) department and the QA audit certificate will be included in the study report. 
All clinical data will undergo a 100% quality control check prior to clinical database lock. 
Edit checks are then performed for appropriate databases as a validation routine to check for 
missing data, data inconsistencies, data ranges etc. Corrections are made prior to database lock. 
9.4.1 Verification of Blinding 
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of 
the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the 
database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the database; and the database is locked. 
9.[ADDRESS_212346] disposition records, correspondence with the 
ERB/IRB and Study Monitor/Sponsor, AE reports, and information regarding subject 
discontinuation and completion of the clinical investigation. 
 
All required study data will be recorded on eCRFs.  Any change of data will be recorded on the 
audit trail and a reason for the change will be entered. 
Protocol ARQ-151-[ADDRESS_212347] article for investigation.  If this requirement differs from any local 
regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local retention policy is less 
than 2 years. 
9.6 Protocol Amendments and Deviations  
No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by [CONTACT_78467](s) or amendment(s) has 
(have) been agreed upon by [CONTACT_8981].  Any change agreed upon will be 
recorded in writing, and the written amendment will be signed by [CONTACT_8981].  
Institutional review board approval is required prior to the implementation of an amendment, 
unless overriding safety reasons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s) will be 
promptly notified. 
 
No deviation from the protocol will be made except to protect the life or physical well-being of a 
subject in an emergency.  Except in such emergencies, prior approval of the Sponsor, and the 
IRB, is required before deviations from the planned protocol.  All protocol deviations that occur 
during the study will be documented and reported to Sponsor and to the IRB(s), if applicable, 
according to regulations.  Further details about the documentation, evaluation, and follow-up of 
protocol deviations are detailed in this study’s clinical monitoring plan.  
 
No waivers to inclusion/exclusion criteria will be granted; subjects need to meet all criteria, 
exactly as specified, to be enrolled.  Additionally, prospective deviations from the protocol or 
investigational plan are not permitted except to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject 
in an emergency.  Deviations that occur unintentionally or are the result of action by [CONTACT_180411](s), if applicable, according to regulations.  
Further details about the documentation, evaluation, and follow-up of protocol deviations are 
detailed in this study’s clinical monitoring plan. 
9.[ADDRESS_212348] assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only an identification code and any other 
unique identifier(s) as allowed by [CONTACT_1769] (such as date of birth) will be recorded on any form 
or biological sample submitted to the Sponsor.

Actua l Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself  Intent does not have to be 100%   If there is  any intent/desire to die associated with the  act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt  There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm  If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an atte mpt    
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances  For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e g , gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a 
high floor/story)  Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred

  SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) Since Last 
Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself  Intent 
does not have to be 100%   If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt  There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm  If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt    
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances  For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e g , gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story)  
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred   
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? Did you______ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  Were you trying to end your life when you _____? Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger  Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt  Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge  Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so

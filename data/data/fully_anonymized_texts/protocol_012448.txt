1 Introduction to RA Pdocumentation
1.1 Scope
The RAP documents contain detailed information to aid the production of Statistics & 
Programming input into the Clinical Study  Report (CSR) for trial “CLFG316A2204”. 
Module 3 
(M3) provides the description of the statistical methodology used to analy ze the 
data, Module 7(M7) details the presentation of the data, including shells of summary  tables, 
figures and listings, and Module 8 (M8) contains programming specifications e.g. for derived 
variables and derived datasets, to su pport the creation of CSR outputs.
1.2 Changes to RA P documentation (M3)
Refer to corresponding guidances and NIBR RAP Addendum template for detailed 
information on the requirements of documenting changes to RAP documentation.
For the statistical meth odology (M3) , any major changes occurring before database lock to 
the statistical methodology  should be reflected in the RAP M3 documentation via version 
control (new document version to be approved by  [CONTACT_883025] .
Major changes include, but are not limited to, changes in protocol that affect study  design and 
statistical methodology . 
Minor changes to the RAP M3 documentation can be captured e.g. by a study note to file / 
note in RAP Addendum or within the CSR itself.  Minor changes includ e,but are not limited 
to, change in statistical model.  Corrections of t ypographical errors or modification of spelling 
(from English to American, for example) do not need to be incorporated into the RAP M3 
documentation.

  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1235479] one eye,requiring intensification of 
systemic immu nosuppressive therap ywill be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive :
  LFG316  administered intravitreally  (n=16) 
Only  one eye (designated as the study  eye)will be dosed per patient. If either eye would 
qualify  as the study  eye, one eye will be selected as the study  eye during the screening period
based on the following criteria:
• Higher vitreous haze score
• If not determined b y vitreous haze score, then b y lower visual acuit y
• If not determined b y visual acuit y, investigator preference.
Throughout the study , the fellow eye (i.e., non-study  eye) should be examined and treated at 
theinvestigator’s discretion. Efficacy  assessments (visual acuity  and ey
e exams) will be 
conducted b y a clinician masked to treatment condition.
For patients randomized to LFG316, three successive doses will be administered on Days [ADDRESS_1235480] dose (Day 1) may occur within 0-[ADDRESS_1235481] dose, 
safet y, efficacy , and PK assessments will occur at 6 scheduled visits over a 12-week period. 
 
 
 
 However, patients canattend for 
unscheduled visits as needed and as determined by  [CONTACT_093]. Patients will be monitored 
for safet y and ocular assessments obtained throughout treatment and follow -
up periods. 
Patient eligibility  will be assessed as outlined in Figure 2-1 below. An overall study  scheme is 
shown in Figure 2- 2 below.
Ocular assessments include:
Best corrected visual acuity  (ETDRS)
Intraocular pressure (IOP)
Slit lamp biomicroscopy
Dilated ophthalmoscopy
Standardized vitreous haze score (Nussenblatt et al 1985)
Color fundus photos *
Spectral domain optical coherence tomograph y (sd -OCT)*
Anterior chamber cells
Chorioretinal lesions (absent/present per PI [CONTACT_1697] )
Vasculitis (absent or present per Investigator)

6 Statistical methods for P harmacokinetic (PK) parameters
Summary  statistics for t otal LFG316 may be anal yzed on the PK analy sis set .
Summary  statistics of total LFG316 concentrations may be provided by [CONTACT_765]/time. Summary 
statistics will include mean (arithmetic and geometric), SD, CV (arithmetic and geometric), 
median, minimum, maximum, and the frequency  (n, %) of concentrations below the LLOQ. A 
geometric mean will not be reported if the dataset includes zero values.
Total LFG316 concentrations may be expressed as μg/mL . All concentrations below the limit 
of quantification (LLOQ ) ormissing data may be labeled as such in the concentration data 
listings. Concentrations below the LLOQ may be treated as zero in summary statistics for 
concentration data onl y.
Arithmetic mean (SD) concentration -time plots as well as overlay ing individual 
concentration -time profiles may be provided.
7 Statistical methods for Efficacy  and Pharmacody namic (PD) 
parameters
7.1 Primary  endpoint
The primary  endpoint sarethe response rate (proportion of patients that respond in the study 
eye) and the remission rate (complete response) at Day  85.
A response will be defined by  [CONTACT_883026] y eye:
An improvement of 2 or more steps in vitreous haze, relative to baseline. For the 
purpose of “step” calculation, 0.5 shall count as one of the increments. Thus, 
improvement from a score of 2 to 0.5 or from 1 to 0 
would constitute a 2-step 
improvement or,
An improvement of 10 or more letters in visual a cuity , relative to baseline or,
An improvement of 2 or more steps in anterior chamber cells, relative to baseline
Resolution of chorioretinal lesions as determined by  [CONTACT_883027] (complete response) will be defined as 
any patient who has avitreous haze score of 0 or 0.5 in the study  eye, who has an 
anterior chamber cell score of 0 and no chorioretinal lesions in the study  eyeand is off 
all immune modulatory therap y (systemic, corticosteroids and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]), without any 
worsening of uveitis during the trial.
The analysis of response rate and remission rate at Day 
85will be carried out on the efficacy
analysis sets (Efficacy  1and Efficacy  2) , with the analy sis on the Efficacy  1analysis set 
being of primary  interest .
The baseline value will be defined as Day  [ADDRESS_1235483].
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 13
TSc RAP Module 3 CLFG316A2204
The response rates and the 90% exact (Clopper -Pearson) confidence intervals in the LFG316 
group will be reported.
 
The response rates at other time points 
(Day s 2, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57) will be reported and analy zed similarl y.
Proportion of responders (90% CI) will be graphically  presented at each time point, by 
[CONTACT_883028].
The same anal ysis will be performed for remission rates as well.
 
 
 
 
At Day 85, the null hypothesis that the response rate ofthe LFG316 arm (pLFG) is less than  
(60% ):  H0: pLFG ≤ 0.60, will 
be tested against the alternative hypothe sis: H1: pLFG >0.[ADDRESS_1235484] (binomial) p-value will 
be reported .  Note that no decision should be made based on this p- value.
No multiplicity  adjustments are required for the primary  anal ysis.
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations
If a subject had missing data for any  of the parameters needed to derive the responder status, a 
subject was :
Considered as a responder if the subject met an y of the responder criteria
Considered as missing if all the parameters for the responder criteria were missing
Considered as a non -responder, if the subject had at least one non
-missing parameter 
needed for the responder criteria and had met no criteria to be considered a responder.
If a subject had missing data for any  of the parameters needed to derive the remission status, a 
subject was:
Considered as a remission if the subject met all of the remission criteria.
Considered as a non -remission, if the subject did not meet at least one of the remission 
criteria.
Considered as missing, if the subject met all the available remission criteria but not all 
the remission criteria were available.
7.2 Secondary  Efficacy and PD endpoints
7.2.1 Efficacy endpoints: Ocular assessments
All analy sesin this section will be anal yzed on the Efficacy 1analysis set.
For vitreous haze score (VHS), the number and percentage of subjects will be listed by [INVESTIGATOR_32005]

performed for anterior chamber cells score (ACCS) with the scores being 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4,
and the category  of improve ment /worsening (change) from baseline being “worsening of 
anterior chamber cells”, “no change”, and “1 –5 steps of improvement”. Frequency  tables and 
histograms for both of the original scores and steps of change will be provided for VHS and 
ACCS by  [CONTACT_72067] (study  and fellow), treatment group at each visit/time .
Visual acuit y will be listed for each visit/time and treatment group, separately for the study

study  eye and fellow eye. Arithmetic mean (SE) will be plotted across time by [CONTACT_3148] 
(overlay ing) for study  eyes and fellow eyes separately . Overlay ing individual profile s will be 
plotted across time by [CONTACT_3148] (separate )for study  eyes and fellow ey esseparately .
A longitudinal analysis ofbest corrected visual acuity will be performed for the study  eye. 
Absolute change from baseline will be analy zed by a
 mixed model with repeated 
measurements. The independent variables will betreatment, time (categorical , i.e. visits until 
Day 85), and treatment -by-time interaction ,with baseline and baseline -by-time interaction as
covariate s, and subject as a random effect. Within treatment arm estimates and 90% 
confidence interval will be reported .

be tabulated using frequency  tables ,and graphically  represented using bar charts, at each visit , 
by [CONTACT_72067] (separate).
Percentage of patients that respond per respon secriteri on(for criterion involving central 
retinal thickness, only  if applicable) will be reported in each treatment group.
A separate set of summary  tables will be produced for those 
subjects who participate in the 
LFG316 treatment extension ,if deemed necessary .
7.2.2 PD endpoint: Total C5 Concentrations
Total C5 will be analyz ed on the PD analysis set. Summary  statistics of total C5 
concentrations will be provided by [CONTACT_10659]/time. Total C5concentrations will be 
expressed as μg/mL . All concentrations below the limit of quantification (LLOQ) or missing 
data will be labeled as such in the concentration data listings. Concentrations below the 
LLOQ will be treated as zero in summary  statistics for concentration data only .

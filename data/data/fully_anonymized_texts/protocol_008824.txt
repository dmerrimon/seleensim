1. OBJECTIVES  
  
1.1  Study Design  
The goal of this exploratory study  is to assess efficacy of adding enzalutamide in the neoadjuvant 
and adjuvant setting in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). The 
population will be prostate cancer patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer, choosing 
radiation the rapy as their primary form of therapy.  This is a phase II single arm trial that has as 
its primary objective to estimate the proportion of patients with PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml at the 
completion of therapy. This endpoint has been shown to be predictive of long ter m response in a 
similar risk -group of patients treated with radiation therapy and LHRH agonists. (1)  Secondary 
endpoints include measurement of serum hormone levels, health -related quality of life (HRQoL) 
and body fat measurements. It is expected that enza lutamide therapy in contrast to LHRH 
agonists has a much better profile for these secondary outcomes. Correlative studies will center 
on understanding enzalutamide’s mechanism of action. Data from this trial, if convincing, would 
lead to a Phase III random ized trial comparing LHRH agonists to enzalutamide as neoadjuvant 
and adjuvant therapy in combination with EBRT.    
  
On this study patients will be treated with 6 months of Xtandi (enzalutamide). Approximately 
one-third of the way through this treatment t hey will receive EBRT. Starting on Day 1, all 
patients will ingest enzalutamide  160 mg/day at the same time each day without breaks (except 
as outlined for toxicity), with or without food, for 6 (28 day +/ -3 days) cycles. Dose reduction of 
enzalutamide to 120 mg/day is allowed with the approval of the Medical Monitor, [CONTACT_737549] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Patients will be instructed to return all unused capsules at each study 
visit to assess compliance and will receive study drug every 28 days (+/ -3 days) for  6 cycles (24 
weeks).   
  
1.2  Primary Objectives  
        1. Estimate the proportion of patients whose  PSA level at the end of six (28 day +/ -3 days) 
cycles of enzalutamide and EBRT is < 0.2 ng/ml.

 1. Assessment of cellular location of androgen receptor expression using              
immunohistochemistry on prostate tissue samples obtained during fiducial placement.   
  
2. BACKGROUND  
  
2.1  Enzalutamide  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for further information on the pharmacology of 
enzalutamide.  
  
Enzalutamide (enzalutamide) is a potent androgen receptor signaling inhibitor that blocks several 
steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. Enzalutamide competitively binds to the 
androgen receptor with an IC 50 of 36 nM, compared to 160 nM for bicalutamide (an androgen 
receptor antagonist commonly used for ADT  [2, 3]). In addition, enzalutamide inhibits nuclear 
translocation of activated recep tors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen 
receptor with DNA, even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate 
cancer cells resistant to anti -androgens. Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate 
cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumor regression.  Effective inhibition of 
androgen receptor signaling by [CONTACT_171313] (observed in vitro) blocks the oncogenic effects of 
androgen metabolism by [CONTACT_737528]. In addition, 
enzalutamide induces immediate prostate cancer apoptosis, an effect not seen with antiandrogens 
(e.g., bicalutamide)  (3) Furthermore, enzalutamide has no known agonist activity when the 
androgen receptor is overexpressed.  
  
Enzaluta mide treatment in a prostate cancer xenograft model resulted in a dose -dependent 
reduction in tumor volume: 1/7 tumors in the low -dose group (1 mg/kg/day) and 3/7 tumors in 
the high -dose group (50 mg/kg/day) became unmeasurable. In contrast, bicalutamide h ad little 
effect on tumor growth.  
  
Enzalutamide was non -mutagenic/clastogenic in in vitro genotoxicity assays (reverse mutation 
and mouse lymphoma). Repeat -dose oral toxicology studies were conducted with durations of up 
to [ADDRESS_1007513] prominent effects of enzalutamide in these 
species were reductions in prostate, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], and/or seminal vesicle weight, all of which are 
consistent with the expected antiandrogen pharmacology of enzalutamide. These decreases were 
accom panied by [CONTACT_737529]/or atrophy, with epi[INVESTIGATOR_737506]. Hypospermatogenesis 
and degeneration of seminiferous tubules in testes have been observed in dogs,  but not in rats. 
The enzalutamide -related male sex organ findings reversed, or tended to reverse, after at least 8 
weeks of recovery.  Reversible hepatocellular hypertrophy, associated with liver weight 
increases, was a consistent finding of enzalutamide in rats, but not in dogs. Several additional 
histopathological findings (mostly in endocrine tissues) definitively related to enzalutamide 
treatment in the 26 -week study in rats included hypertrophy/hyperplasia in adrenals, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], 
and thyroid; atrophy in male mammary gland; gland/lumen dilatation and lobular hyperplasia in

  female mammary gland; and luminal dilatation in the uterus. In a short -term reversibility study 
in male dogs, enzalutamide treatment did not result in detectable permanent effects to male 
reproductive organs.  
  
Cardiovascular safety was evaluated in vitro in patch -clamped mammalian cells expressing the 
hERG channel. The results showed that enzalutamide inhibited the hERG current with an IC50 
of 16.2 μM (7.29 μg/mL). The highest free c oncentration of enzalutamide expected in patient 
plasma at a steady -state dose of 160 mg/day is well below the hERG IC50 value. The major 
active metabolite of enzalutamide (M2) was also shown to weakly inhibit the hERG channel 
with an IC50 of 18.6 μM (8.38  μg/mL).  
  
In mice, rats, and dogs, orally administered enzalutamide had a half -life (t1/2) of approximately 
0.25 to 3 days. The t1/2 did not appear to be affected by [CONTACT_346037]; however, bioavailability 
appeared to decrease with increasing dose size. Plasma protein binding of enzalutamide in 
human plasma ranged from 97% to 98% and was similar in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs.  
  
Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) increased the composite area 
under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl 
enzalutamide in healthy volunteers. Co -administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 
inhibitors should be avoided (see Appendix F).  
  
The effects of CYP2C8 inducers on the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide have not been 
evaluated in vivo. Co -administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., 
rifampin) may alter the plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be avoided (see 
APPENDIX F).   
  
The effects of CYP3A4 inducers on the pharmacokinetics  of enzalutamide have not been 
evaluated in vivo. Co -administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine) may decrease the 
plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be  avoided. (see APPENDIX F)  Moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) and St. John’s 
Wort may also reduce the plasma exposure of enzalutamide and should be avoided.    
  
Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer a nd a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer in 
humans. At steady state, enzalutamide reduced the plasma exposure to midazolam (CYP3A4 
substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate).   
  
Concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fetanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], 
quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin), pentobarbital, 
ketoconazole, sertaraline, di gitoxin, haloperidol, ketamine, doxocycline, isoniazid, ciprofloxacin 
and CYP2C19 (e.g., S -mephenytoin) should be avoided if possible, as enzalutamide may

2.1.1 Previous Human Experience  
The tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of enzalutamide  were studied in 
a multicenter, open -label, dose -escalation study of enzalutamide in 140 patients with advanced 
prostate cancer. Patients were treated with enzalutamide at doses of 30 to 600 mg/day until 
disease progression or intolerable side effects devel oped.  
  
In this study, enzalutamide was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279159], with the median 
time to maximum plasma concentration (C max) after a single dose occurring at 1.00 hour (range 
0.42 to 4.00 hours postdose). The PK of enzalutamide was esse ntially linear with no major 
deviations from dose proportionality in C max or area under the curve values in the dose range of 
30 to 600 mg. The terminal t 1/2 for enzalutamide after a single dose was approximately  
6 days (range 3 to 10 days) and did not ap pear to be affected by [CONTACT_346037]. In accordance with 
the long t 1/2, it took approximately 1 month after the start of a daily dose regimen to reach steady 
state. On achievement of steady state, the mean trough concentrations (Cmin) in individual 
patient s remained constant for several months, suggesting time -linear PK. With daily oral 
administration of 150 mg/day, the mean accumulation index for enzalutamide was approximately 
11, reflecting the long t1/2 relative to the dosing interval. Due to its slow cl earance from plasma, 
the daily fluctuation in steady -state enzalutamide concentrations was low. The mean peak -to-
trough ratios (Cmax/Cmin) was 1.2 (range 1.14 to 1.3), indicating that variability in steady -state 
Cmax, Cmin, and area under the curve values was low (≤ 30% CV).At 160 mg/day, the mean 
steady -state Cmin is expected to be approximately 12 ± 4 μg/mL. Full PK profiles were linear 
and consistent over the dose range studied.  
  
Fatigue was the most frequently reported adverse event, with dose -depende nt increases of Grade 
3 fatigue (0% at 150 mg/day, 9% at 240 mg/day, 15% at 360 mg/day, and 20% at 480 mg/day). 
The dose of 240 mg/day was defined as the maximum tolerated dose. At doses of 240 mg and 
above, an increasing proportion of patients needed dose  reductions for fatigue. Dose reductions 
were needed in 1 of 29 patients (3%) that received 240 mg/day, 3 of28 patients (11%) that 
received 360 mg/day, and 5 of 22 patients (23%) that received 480 mg/day, and 0 of 58 patients 
that received 30, 60, or 150 m g/day. After dose reductions, the symptoms resolved. Only 1 
patient discontinued treatment due to fatigue with an onset coinciding with prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) rise. Overall, the most common mild ( grade 2) adverse events were fatigue (n = 
38 [27.1% ]), nausea (n = 12 [8.6%]), dyspnea (n = 11 [7.9%]), anorexia (n = 8 [5.7%]), and back 
pain (n = 8 [5.7%]). Fatigue, nausea, and anorexia were the only mild adverse events with an 
increasing incidence as the dose of enzalutamide was increased. None of the grade 2 events 
required dose modification or the discontinuation of treatment, apart from 1 patient treated at 
480 mg/day who had nausea at baseline and stopped therapy after 7 weeks.

  In the randomized clinical trial, 7 of 800 (0.9%) patients treated with enzalutamide160 mg once 
daily experienced a seizure. No seizures occurred in patients treated with placebo. Seizures 
occurred from [ADDRESS_1007515] -therapy changes in PSA, soft tissue 
and osseous disease, and circulating tumor cell count. Prostate specifi c antigen declines of ≥ 
50% from baseline were observed in 62% of patients. Radiographic evidence of disease control 
(i.e., no progression) was also observed in the majority of patients ( 3).  
  
Based on these results, 2 placebo -controlled, randomized Phase 3 studies (AFFIRM and 
PREVAIL) were initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with 
advanced prostate cancer. The AFFIRM study evaluated the safety and efficacy o f enzalutamide 
in 1199 patients who progressed on docetaxel (4) This study showed a survival benefit in favor 
of enzalutamide (hazard ratio 0.631 p < 0.0001, median overall survival of 18.4 versus 13.6 
months for enzalutamide and placebo, respectively (4). The PREVAIL study was designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide in patients who have not yet received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease; this study is ongoing. The AFFIRM study, however, 
lead to the approval of this drug for the  indication for CRPC with metastatic disease following 
docetaxel in September 2012.

  Definitive treatment is generally recommended for men with a good life expectancy without 
potentially life shortening co -morbidities with Intermediate Risk prostate cancer. The addition of 
hormonal treatments (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737507] e) has been shown to be efficacious to 
external beam in several prospective randomized trials. The reason for this beneficial effect is 
not understood.  One explanation for this effect is the cytoreductive effects of hormonal therapy 
which increases the pr obability of local tumor control with external beam radiotherapy.  These 
trials where initiated in the era when the total dose external beam dose was low by [CONTACT_737531].  In fact, the RTOG is revisiting the role for androgen ablation with high d ose 
radiotherapy in the intermediate risk prostate cancer patient (RTOG 0815).  
  
A barrier to treatment with androgen ablation with external radiotherapy are the toxicities 
associated with low serum testosterone levels.  These include loss of libido, erec tile dysfunction, 
hot flashes and weight gain.   Since serum testosterone levels are not affected by [CONTACT_737532], hot flashes, loss of libido and sexual side effects are less 
common.  As stated above, these are nearly uni versal side effects of LH -RH agonist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737508]. However bicalutamide is a partial agonist of the 
androgen receptor and there is concern regarding its efficacy as monotherapy, particularly at the 
50 mg per day dose (the currently approved dose). D’Amico  et al has shown that PSA nadir after 
external beam and [ADDRESS_1007517] therapy with bicalutamide is predictive of disease 
free survival and metastasis free survival ( 1).  If the PSA nadir is 0.2 ng/ml o r lower, there is 
improvement in outcome. Potentially with longer follow -up in this study, there will be improved 
survival if these low PSA levels can be achieved.  Therefore, PSA nadir at the end of external 
beam and [ADDRESS_1007518] shown that 
the addition of HT improves survival to external beam radiation ( 5,6) However androgen 
deprivation  induced by [CONTACT_437146] -RH agonists consistently results in hot flashes, loss of libido, loss of 
sexual functioning, weight gain, changes in m etabolism, loss of muscle mass and fatigue (7, 8)  .    
  
In contrast, treatment with the anti -androgens bicalutamide or flutamide has minimal side 
effects, likely related to the fact that these agents do not suppress serum testosterone.  
Enzalutamide  has the potential to have similar anti -tumor effects as LH -RH agonist without the 
toxicity associated with castrate testosterone levels. If it were shown that enzalutamide 
(enzalutamide) could be used as an effective adjuvant treatment for prostate cancer witho ut 
androgen deprivation it would have dramatic and significant impact, including expanding its use 
to those patients who may have more intermediate risk and/or are unable to tolerate the toxicities 
associated with androgen deprivation  
  
We have chosen as the primary endpoint the assessment of the proportion of patients whose PSA  
level is <0.2 ng/ml at the conclusion of therapy.  This endpoint was chosen because patients that

excellent prognosis compared to patients that demonstrate higher PSA levels (1, 9). Furthermore, 
demonstration of PSA levels of ≤0.2ng/ml in a significant number of patients treated on this 
study would be strong motivation to perform a phase III random ized trial comparing 
enzalutamide to LHRH analog therapy in the same setting.

radiation treatment. These are placed in th e outpatient setting and require exactly the same 
efforts as does a prostate biopsy (pre -treatment antibiotic therapy, ultrasound guidance, patient 
positioning etc.). Fiducials are routinely placed [ADDRESS_1007521] that one of the mechanisms 
behind enzalutamide’s ’ effectiveness is to trap the AR in the cytoplasm and block its access to 
the nucleus where it can act as a transcription factor. (3).  The pattern of expression from these 
samples can be compared to the pattern of AR localization in the patient’s  pre-treatment core 
biopsies and from patient samples available to us from our tumor bank. The latter patients have 
been treated wit h or without LHRH analogs, both of which would be important controls.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES   
    
4.1  General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
  
Institutions will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system. Registration must occur 
prior to the initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol bef ore 
treatment begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.   
  
A member of the study team will confirm eligibility criteria and complete the protocol -
specific eligibility checklist.  
   
Following registration, participants may begi n protocol treatment. Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a 
participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s 
protocol status must be changed. Notify the QAC T Registrar of participant status 
changes as soon as possible.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
  5.2.2 Patients will be treated in 6 (28 +/ -3 days) cycles. EBRT will be initiated 7 -10 weeks 
into enzalutamide therapy. Patients will be seen every 28 (+/ -3 days) days for history and 
physical, adverse event and concomitant medication assessment. At these visits routine 
laboratory parameters will be obtained and a subset of these must be reviewed prior to 
dispensing the investigational agent. The routine laboratories at the beginning of each cycle 
should be completed per the Study Calendar in section 8.   
The criteria to treat at the beginning of each cycle are:  
• ANC greater than 1,000mm3  
•  Hgb greater than 8.0 g/dL  
•   Platelets greater than or equal to 50,000  
•  ALT less than 3.5x upper limit normal  
•  AST less than 3.5x upper limit normal

resolved to (grade 1 or less) in order to continue therapy. The Medical Monitor should be 
notified of any adverse events that require holding, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_737509].   
  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Identity of Investigational Product  
The study drug, enzalutamide, has the chemical name 3 -(4-cyano -3-trifluoromethylphenyl) -1- 
[3-fluoro -4-(methylcarbamoyl) phenyl] -5,5-dimethyl -2-thioxoimidazolin -4-one. The drug 
substance  has no chiral centers and no salt forms are available at ~ pH [ADDRESS_1007532] been shown to improve survival in castrate resistant prostate cancer 
(4).  In an unpublished recently completed study, enzalutamide was shown to be safe in 
hormone -naïve prostate cancer patients with mi nimal toxicity.  Effects on serum PSA levels and 
clinical outcome in this population are presently unavailable. \  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Product Characteristics  
The drug substance is formulated in the surfactant Labrasol. The drug product is provided as 40 
mg soft gel atin capsules in 124 -count bottles with induction -sealed, child -resistant caps.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Directions for Administration Enzalutamide   
  Study participants will self -administer the total daily dose (160 mg) of enzalutamide as a 
single dose, once daily. Enz alutamide can be taken with or without food. Enzalutamide may be 
taken at any time during the day, but should be taken at the same time each day. A missed dose 
should be taken as soon it is remembered. If twelve or more hours have lapsed since their 
regula rly scheduled time , patients should not take the missed dose; rather the patient should

  resume dosing at the next scheduled dose. Patients should not double up or take more than 1 
dose of enzalutamide per day. Vomited doses should not be made up. Enzalutam ide should not 
be crushed.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage and Labeling   
Enzalutamide should be stored in a secure location with limited access at 77°F (25°C), with 
excursions permitted to 59°F to 86°F (15°C to 30°C). Bottles will be labeled with the study 
protocol num ber, medication or bottle number, contents, directions for use, storage directions, 
clinical trial statement, and Medivation Inc. as supplier. Patients will be instructed to store 
bottles containing enzalutamide capsules at room temperature  
  
5.2.3 Extern al Beam Radiation  
  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Specifications: 3D Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) or IMRT   
Dose will be normalized such that exactly 98% of the PTV (planned target volume) receives the 
prescription dose and will be scored as per protocol. The maximum a llowable dose within the 
PTV is 107% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc. The minimum allowable 
dose within the PTV is >95% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc.  
  
EBRT shall receive prescription doses to the  PTV 75.6 - 79.2 Gy delivered in 1.8 Gy fractions.  
All attempts should be made to deliver the  
PTV dose with the above heterogeneity constraints with adherence to the critical structure 
parameters listed below:

    RT will be delivered with megavoltage equipment at energies ≥6 MV.  
  
  [IP_ADDRESS] EBRT Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
Simulation will be CT -based in all cases. The use of urethral contrast at the time of simulation 
is recommended but not required. The degree of bladder fullness should be made to duplicate 
that which is anticipated for daily treatment, i.e., if the patient  is instructed to maintain a full 
bladder for treatment, he should be simulated as such (CT images should be acquired at a 
slice thickness of ≤3 mm from the top of the iliac crests superiorly to the perineum inferiorly. 
Target volumes and normal critical s tructures will be defined in the slices in which they are

Version 13.0 Protocol Version Date: 1/09/[ADDRESS_1007533] utilize “beam’s eye view” representations to define final 
beam aperture.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Fiducial Placement:  
Fiducial markers placed within the prostate are required for  this protocol. This procedure is 
routinely performed to permit pre -treatment imaging and position corrections to improve the 
precision of the external beam delivery (Image Guided Radiation Therapy).  The placement of 
the three gold markers is performed by  a Urologist.  The fiducials are placed under transrectal 
ultrasound guidance.  The fiducials are placed in the prostate so they do not overlap in the 
anterior and lateral x -ray projection.  
  
Patients will be asked to participate in a procedure for correl ative studies.  This is not 
mandatory for participation.  Two routine transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies will be taken 
in the location of previously identified disease on the diagnostic core biopsy report.   These 
tissues samples will be stored for cor relative tissue analysis.    
  
  [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Planning/Target Volumes   
  The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the ICRU Report #50: Prescribing, 
Recording, and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy. The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is 
defined by [CONTACT_3433] e physician as all known disease as defined by [CONTACT_279200], urethrogram, 
and clinical information. If a urethrogram is used, the GTV will encompass a volume 
inferiorly [ADDRESS_1007534] scan.  
    
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is the GTV plus areas considered to contain microscopic 
disease, delineated by [CONTACT_1963], and is defined as follows:  
CTV is the GTV (prostate) plus areas at risk for microscopic disease extension plus the 
proximal bilateral seminal vesicles. Only the proximal 1.0 cm of seminal vesicle tissue 
adjacent to the prostate shall be included in the clinical target volume. This 1.0 cm of seminal 
vesicles refer s to both radial (in plane) and superior (out of plane) extent. If both prostate and 
seminal vesicle are visualized in the same CT slice, this seminal vesicle tissue will contribute 
to the 1.0 cm of tissue. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will provide a m argin around the 
CTV to compensate for the variability of treatment set up and internal organ motion. A range 
of 5-10 mm around the CTV is required to define each respective PTV. Superior and inferior 
margins (cappi[INVESTIGATOR_007])should be [ADDRESS_1007535] scan will include the 
following: bladder, rectum (from its origin at the rectosig moid flexure superiorly or the 
bottom of the SI joints, whichever is more inferior to the inferior -most extent of the ischial 
tuberosities), bilateral femora (to the level of ischial tuberosity), penile bulb and skin. Any

  small bowel within the primary bea m aperture should be defined as well. All structures will 
be contoured in their entirety as solid organs.   
Superior and inferior margins (cappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) should be [ADDRESS_1007536] scan.  
Careful consideration sho uld be made when defining the 5 -10 mm margin in 3 Dimensions. 
The PTV forms the entire target as described. No extension of fields to specifically treat 
regional lymph nodes is permitted. 3D conformal beams will be shaped to include the entire 
PTV and mini mize dose to surrounding critical structures as described. Intensity modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT) using inverse planning is permitted with constraints placed to adhere to 
critical structure dose limitations as defined above.  
  
  [IP_ADDRESS] Critical Structur es   
Every effort should be made to deliver prescription doses to the PTV as specified while 
adhering to these constraints, it is recognized that certain anatomical factors may prevent this.   
  
For purposes of compliance, up to a 5% absolute increase in t he volume of critical structure 
receiving greater than the specified dose will be considered” variation acceptable,” e.g. up to 
20% of the rectum may receive a dose of > 75.6 Gy without a protocol deviation. Any 
increase in critical structure volume greate r than 5% receiving more than the specified dose 
will be considered a “deviation unacceptable". The prescription dose should be the maximum 
deliverable up to 79.[ADDRESS_1007537], result in a reduction of the prescription dose or compromised dose coverage of the 
target volume.  
     [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Verification  
First day port films or portal ima ges of each field along with orthogonal isocenter verification 
films (or images) must be obtained. If modifications are made in field shapi[INVESTIGATOR_279166], a 
port film of each modified field along with orthogonal isocenter verification films (or images) 
is required on the first day’s treatment of that field. Thereafter, weekly verification films or 
images of orthogonal isocenter views (anterior to posterior and lateral projection) are 
required. The intensity profiles of each beam must be independently verified  and compared to 
the planned field intensity. Portal films are not required for IMRT but orthogonal verification 
films are required. Daily on -line target localization (kV or MV imaging with fiducials) should 
be performed.  
  
    [IP_ADDRESS] Quality Assurance   Documentation 
Requirements:  
The institution will archive treatment prescription and verification images for later review by 
[CONTACT_79501]. At least one port film or pretreatment alignment film per field 
along with the digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the t reatment planning program 
or, alternatively, a simulation verification radiograph shall be acquired and kept for evaluation 
if requested except where geometrically impractical

      [IP_ADDRESS] Compliance Criteria   
The minimum allowable dose within the PTV is >95% of the prescribed dose to a volume that 
is at least 0.03cc. Cases in which this small volume of at least 0.03cc receives a minimum 
dose that is <95% but >93% or a maximum dose that is >107% and <110% of the  prescribed 
dose will be scored as a variation acceptable. Cases in which such a small volume receives 
less than 93% or >110% of the prescribed dose will be scored as a deviation and 
unacceptable. Acceptable dose heterogeneity will be as follows: This maxi mum dose 
volume of the PTV must not be shared by a normal critical structure. The maximum 
point dose to normal critical structures outside the PTV should not exceed the prescription 
dose.  
  The treating physician must carefully consider the tolerance dose /volume to each critical 
normal structure and unspecified tissue.

(requiring intravenous fluids or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or resulting in hemodynamic collapse), or 
any other toxicity where patient safety is jeopardized, hold enzalutami de. When the 
toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 1, resume study medication at the full dose. Prophylactic 
medications should be considered as appropriate. If toxicity recurs, hold study medication 
and adjust or add medications to mitigate the toxicity. When the recurrent toxicity has 
resolved to ≤ Grade 1, resume enzalutamide at 120 mg/day (3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] /day). This should be 
done with the approval of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_523248].

       9.1 Primary endpoint:    
The primary endpoint is measured by [CONTACT_40609]. Patients achieving a PSA level <0.2 ng/ml at the end of six cycles 
of enzalutamide and EBRT treatment are considered successes.  
  
9.2 Secondary endpoints   
  
9.2.1. Safety and Tolerability  
Safety and tolerability will be documented throughout the study by [CONTACT_436975], vital signs and 
laboratory assessments as defined in the Schedule of Activities (Section 8). Adverse events will be graded 
according to the National Cancer Ins titute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 
(NCICTCAE v4.03). Only toxicity with attribution of possibly, probably or definitely (‘treatment -related’) will be 
reported. Adverse events will be monitored and recorded until the safety follow -up visit (3 months after the 
completion of the drug therapy). Any glucose tests collected under previous protocol amendments will not be 
assessed for adverse events.   
  
9.2.[ADDRESS_1007545] N -terminal peptide, bone specific alkaline phosphatase. 
Should be done while fasting. Please see study calendar.   
  
The Expanded -Prostate Index Composite – 26 (EPIC 26)   
EPIC -26 evaluates patient’s urinary incontinence (4 items), urinary irritation/obstruction (4 items), bowel (6 
items), and vitality/hormonal function (5 items).  All doma ins are reported on a scale of 0 – 100. EPIC is a robust 
prostate cancer HRQoL instrument that measures a broad spectrum of symptoms and has 50 items; however, to 
decrease patient burden only the domains most pertinent to this study will be used as represe nted in the EPIC -26. 
EPIC -26 has been validated in men with localized prostate cancer who underwent surgery, external beam 
radiation, or brachytherapy with or without the use of hormonal adjuvants. Further information on EPIC can be 
found at the University  of Michigan website: http://www.med.umich.edu/urology/research/epic.html .  
  
Patient -Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) -Fatigue Short Form    
PROMIS was developed as part of the NIH Roadmap Initiative, focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a publicly  available 
resource of standardized, accurate, and efficient PRO measures of symptoms, distress, and functioning. Two 
content domains of fatigue, experience and impact, were identified by a panel of experts. An item pool of [ADDRESS_1007546] c overage across 
the fatigue continuum (i.e., high to low), and good precision of measurement (discrimination function).

Sleep quality will be measured by [CONTACT_212456], a self -rated questionnaire which measures sleep qua lity and 
disturbances. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_737514]. 
The PSQI has good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0.83), stability (test -retest reliability=.85, P<.001) and 
discriminant validit y. It has been used in patients with cancer and demonstrated sleep problems as expected  
  
9.3 Serum Hormone Levels  
Serum hormone levels include DHEA sulfate, estrone, free testosterone, total testosterone, estradiol (estrogen),  
androstenedione. These sh ould be done while fasting.                                                                                                             
See Study Calendar (Section 9) for the measurement time points.  
  
9.4 Anthropomorphic  Measures   
Anthropomorphic measurements include Triceps skin fold, mid -upper arm circumference (biceps), shoulder blade 
and waist.  (Section 8). Skin measurements will be done using Slim Guide Skinfold Caliper. Skin Measure will be 
taken at four different areas as be low. A standard caliper will be supplied to all sites.   
  
Measurement of body fat percentage is done using skinfold caliper by [CONTACT_737537] (Triceps, Biceps, Shoulder blade and Waist).    
  
Back of Upper Arm (right):    
The back of upper arm (Triceps) is located halfway between the shoulder and elbow joints. The skinfold is taken  
in a vertical direction on the center of the back of the arm.   
  
Front of Upper Arm (right)  
The Front of upper arm (Biceps) is located halfway between the shoulder and elbow joints. The skinfold is taken 
in a vertical direction on the center of the front of the arm.

This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
  Upper Back (right):  
Located just below the shoulder blade (Subscapular). The skinfold is taken at a 45° angle.  
  
Waist (right):   
Waist (Suprailiac) is located just above the iliac crest, the protrusion of the hip bone, a little towards the front from 
the side of the waist.  The skinfold is taken horizontal.  
  
Skinfold Testing Technique  
  
Use your thumb and index finger of your left hand to pi[INVESTIGATOR_737515] a good fold.  
  
  
 
Pull out the fold of skin and underlying layer of fat with your left hand  away from the body. You do not have to 
worry about getting any muscle as the muscle is firm and will not come into a fold with the skin and fat.  
  

  Version 13.0 Protocol Version Date: 1/09/[ADDRESS_1007547] the jaws of the calipers about 1/4" from the finger s of the left 
hand. Release the trigger of the caliper so the entire force of the jaws are on the skinfold. Without releasing the 
skinfold with the left hand, let the force of the caliper creep a bit for a few seconds to settle to the correct reading. 
Write down the measurement and proceed to the next location.  
  
  
Measurement of lean muscle mass is done by [CONTACT_737538] (in lbs.) by [CONTACT_737539].  See 
Appendix G.  
  
The breast enlargement assessment will be done with calipers. The maximum diameter of the larger breast (if there 
is asymmetry) at Baseline (Day One Cycle 1) , Cycle  4/day 1, End of Cycle 6  and assess it according to these 
parameters: grade 1 (<=2cm), grade  2 (>2 -<=4cm), grade 3 (>4 -6cm), and grade 4 (>6cm).  
  
Technique for measuring male breast tissue:   
Proper technique is needed to examine the male breast. The thumb and index finger are used to grasp and gently 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_737516] d to palpate glandular breast tissue, which is rubbery in consistency and 
firmer than the surrounding adipose tissue. With this technique, gynecomastia can usually be distinguished from 
excessive breast adipose tissue, called pseudo gynecomastia , which is often associated with generalized obesity. 
Gynecomastia is usually bilateral and relatively symmetric, but occasionally it is asymmetric and more prominent 
on one side. If present, asymmetric gynecomastia may suggest breast carcinoma, which is usually rock -hard and 
irregular and may be associated with skin dimpling (peau d’orange), nipple retraction or discharge, and axillary 
lymphadenopathy. The diameter of palpable breast tissue is used as an objective measure of gynecomastia. 
Gynecomastia of recent onset  is usually tender on palpation, and men usually complain of nipple irritation 
associated with rubbing against clothing. The proper method of examining the male breast is to use the thumb and 
index finger to grasp the periareolar area of the breast and to gently pi[INVESTIGATOR_737517]. Glandular breast tissue feels like a rubbery disc of tissue that extends 
concentrically from under the nipple and subareolar area and is firmer than the surrou nding adipose tissue. The 
size of gynecomastia is estimated by [CONTACT_737540].10

10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.1 Definitions 10.1.1  Adverse 
Event (AE)   
  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure 
specified in the protocol, even if  the event is not considered to be related to the study.   
  
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  10.1.2  Serious ad verse event 
(SAE)   
  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that:   
• Results in death  

  Version 13.0 Protocol Version Date: 1/09/2015   
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
  • Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death 
from the reactio n as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -hour 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_737518] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based up on appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an e mergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• routine treatme nt or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above 
and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
  
10.1.3  Expectedness  
  
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adverse event   
  
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered 
expected  when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigato r’s Brochure, the 
package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.     
  
Refer to Section 6.1 for a partial listing of expected adverse events associated with the 
study agent(s). [IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected adverse event   
    
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  when it varies in 
nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list,

  the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included i n the informed 
consent document as a potential risk.    
10.1.4  Attribution  
  
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study 
treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.   
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

participating investigator is required to abide by [CONTACT_102841]/HCC. The 
study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting requirements, and 
reporting requirements of the  principal investigator.   
  
Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their respective 
IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse events to the study 
sponso r and/or others as described below.   
  Version 13.0 Protocol Version Date: 1/09/[ADDRESS_1007551] be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141752]. This inclu des events meeting the criteria outlined 
in Section 10.1.2, as well as the following:  
  
• Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are unexpected and 
possibly, probably or definitely related/associated with the intervention.  
  
• All Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling) Events – Unless expected AND specifically 
listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting.  
  
• All Grade 5 (fatal) Events – When the participant is enrolled and actively participating in 
the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_1007552] study intervention.   
  
Note : If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time of continuing 
review.   
  
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC Overall Pr incipal 
Investigator as well as the Astellas Safety Department within 24 hours of learning of the 
occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious 
adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatmen t elsewhere), the participating 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_1007553] awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_756], email or

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
13.1 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of patients having intermediate risk CaP treated with external 
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and enzalutamide whose PSA level at the en d of six cycles of enzalutamide and 
EBRT is ≤0.2 ng/ml. In a single stage design, seventy -one patients will be enrolled. Assuming 10% ineligibility, 
the target evaluable sample size is 64 patients. The null hypothesis is 60% of patients achieving PSA nadir  ≤0.2 
ng/ml. The historical rate will serve as the alternative in this design. Based on research by D’Amico et al, the 
proportion of patients achieving PSA level <0.20 ng/ml at the end of EBRT and 6 months of leuprolide acetate 
neo-adjuvant/adjuvant treatm ent is 75%. With a sample size of 64 evaluable patients, if the number achieving PSA 
level <0.2 ng/ml is 44 or more, then the hypothesis that the percentage achieving PSA level <0.2 ng/ml is ≤60% is 
rejected with a target error rate of α=0.10 (actual error  0.095), whereas if the number is 43 or less, then the 
hypothesis that the percentage achieving PSA level <0.2 ng/ml is ≥75% is rejected with a target error rate of 
β=0.10 (actual β=0.099). We also will report exact binomial 90% confidence intervals on the  observed proportion.  
Patients that discontinue early or are missing the end of treatment (cycle 6) PSA will be considered failures. 
Sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint that includes counting a patient as a success if there is record of PSA 
level <0.20 ng/ml ever on tr eatment will be performed. We expect to accrue 2 -3 patients per month at the three 
DF/HCC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] , BWH  and DFCI and therefore accrual duration is expected to be 24 -36 months.

  13.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
13.2.1 Health related quality of life   
The primary HRQoL aim is to assess the change from baseline to the end of cycle 6 in the vitality or hormonal 
function score as well as the sexuality score on the EPIC -26 questionnaire. It is anticipated approximately 75% of 
patients will have both scores  for each domain. A one -sample t -test will be used to assess the overall change in 
score. To be considered a clinically meaningful difference will be defined as half historical standard deviation for 
the specific domain. Given 48 evaluable patients, there is 80% power to detect a 0.41 change in the hormonal 
domain score of the EPIC -26 assuming 2 -sided 5% alpha. Results in this study will be evaluated in the context of 
past research by [CONTACT_737545] -hormonal  therapy had a score on 
the vitality or hormonal function domain of approximately [ADDRESS_1007565] of time on quality 
of life adjusting for prognostic baseline factors.  
  
13.2.2 Safety and Tolerability: We will monitor toxicities experienced by [CONTACT_737546]. Frequ ency and 
severity of worst grade 3 or higher treatment -related AEs by [CONTACT_737547] 3 or higher treatment -related AEs. With 71 treated patients, the maximum width of a 90% CI for a 
given toxicity is 21%. Th e probability of observing one rare severe toxicity (true rate=5%) is 97%. Tolerability 
endpoints include the number of dose reductions and treatment interruptions as well as the number of patients that 
discontinue treatment due to AEs. The safety summary will include clinical laboratory, ECG and vital signs data.   
  
13.2.3 Hormone Levels:  Descriptive statistics at each time point and changes over time will be provided for all 
hormone measures. Paired t -tests and two -sample t -tests (or non -parametric equiv alents) will be used to assess 
significance of change over 6 cycles of treatment in hormone levels for the overall cohort and by [CONTACT_737548] (yes or no achieving PSA level <0.20 ng/ml at the end of 6 cycles of treatment with enzalut amide 
and EBRT).   
   
13.2.4. Anthropomorphic Measurements: Descriptive statistics at each time point and change over 6 cycles will be 
provided for all anthropomorphic measures.   
13.3 Analysis  of Correlative Endpoint   
We anticipate that at approximately 75% of patients will consent to have prostate samples removed at the time of 
the fiducial placement. We expect to detect tumor from samples from at least half of these patients. Therefore we 
expect that we will have cons ervatively ~[ADDRESS_1007566] samples that are evaluable. Nuclear expression 
grade will be tabulated. This unique resource will serve as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_737521] c ompared to pre -treatment biopsy samples and samples 
from other patient tumors.

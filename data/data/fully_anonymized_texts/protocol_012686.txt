Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Amendment 5 ( 23-May -2017)
Amendment rationale
As of 04-May-2017, enrollment is ongoing with 35 patients randomized, and 4 patients currently  
receiving stud y treatment. The purpose of this protocol amendment is to:
-To add duration of response among the secondary  study objectives to better characterize 
the clinical benefit in patients responding to treatment. This information may contribute to 
define the benefit/risk profile in this patient population. 
-To provide clarification in the description of the secondary  objective on the assessment of 
genot ype/phenot ype relationships of VEGF or other members of the VEGF signaling 
pathway .
-To add the option of closing recruitment of further patients in a given study  cohort if no 
objective responses are observed in patients treated in two out of the three cohorts of 
primary  interest during stage 1 of the study . 
-To update the allowed timeframe for prior use of monoclonal antibodies under eligibility  
criteria. 
-To update the contraception/pregnancy language to align with the most recent Investigator 
Brochure version 15 (IBv.15) referring to specific requirements in male and female patients 
while receiving study treatment as well as during follow up period. 
-To remove the exclusion criterion on concomitant treatment with anti-inflammatory  and 
anti-platelet agents. Based on clinical data in adult patients a drug -to-drug interaction when 
pazopanib is co- administered with anti -inflammatory  agents is not expected.
-To modify  the criteria for starting subsequent treatment cycles. This modification will 
clarify  the criteria for starting subsequent cycles when no radiological tumor assessments 
are performed and align the conditions to resume/interrupt study  treatment with toxicity  
management guidelines.
-The sentence on “medications that increase gastric pH” is now updated to Proton Pump 
Inhibitors (PPI). This change is reflected in the protocol section on “Prohibited 
medications.”
-To add anti-inflammatory  and anti-platelet agents in the protocol section “Permitted 
medication to be used with caution”. The use of these agents as a concomitant treatment 
should be monitored since pazopanib may result in an increase of blood pressure and 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
-To clarify  that re-initiation of study  treatment following hepatotoxicity  requires approval 
from the Study  Chair.
-To clarify  that PK sampling is not required beyond Cycle 11 since it is unlikely  that data 
beyond cy cle 11 will provide any modification in the clinical pharmacology assessment of 
the study  drug.
-To define the Per Protocol population and specify which anal ysis will be c onducted in the 
different protocol defined datasets (Per Protocol Population and mI TT population).

smal l-molecu letyrosine kinase inhibito r24thathasbeen shown toprevent ligand induced receptor 
autophosphorylation ofVEGF R-1, -2, -3, PDGF R-α,-βand c-Kitwith an IC 50< 0.085 μmol/L in 
invitrostudies. It alsohas modest activit yagainst FGFR1 , –R3 and c-fms but is ot herwise highly  
selective. Pazopanib ishighl yprotein bound ( > 99.9%) thus ininvivo studies, steady state 
concentrations exceedin g 18 μg/mL were required toprevent VEGFR2 signaling.24Pharmacokinetic 
studies in adults have shown that these concentrations are readily achievable.
2.2 Precl inical Studies
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity
Pazopanib treatment has been shown to inhibit thegrowth ofa variety of
established (100-250 µL) huma ntumor xenografts inmous emodels including renal
cellcarcinom a (Cak i-2),colon carcinom a (HT29), non-small-celllung carcinoma
(NCI-H322), melanoma (A375), prostate carcinom a(PC3), and breast carcinoma
(BT474). Pazopanib demonstrated a wide therapeutic index asithad noeffec t on
mous e body weight and all animals appeared activ e and healthy throughout
preclinical studies. Histological analysis following pazopanib administration
demonstrate dapoptosis ornecrosis oftumo rcells; TUNEL assays confirmed
increased apoptosis. This effect correlated with reduced angiogenesis asmeasured
by [CONTACT_107399] (CD31) stainin g.Theanti-angiogenic activity 
ofpazopanib has also been demonstrated inmous e corneal micropocket and 
Matrigel plug analyses .24
There hasbeen limitedpediatric pre-clinical testin g ofpazopani b;however, growth
delay was observed inone subcutaneous modelofneuroblastoma and was
significantly enhanced by [CONTACT_107400].25
The pediatric preclinical testing progra m(PPTP) also tested the activity of
pazopanib against alimited panel ofpediatric sarcom axenografts and observed
delayed time to progression, butno tumor regression.26Other multi-targeted
tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been screened by[CONTACT_107401] . Thepan-VEGFR inhibitor cediranib demonstrated
broad invivoantitumor activity (78%; primarily tumor growth delay) including:
3/3 rhabdoid, 2/3 Wilms' ,3/3 Ewing, 5/5 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1/3
medulloblastoma, 2/4glioblastoma, 5/6neuroblastoma, 4/5osteosarcoma, with one 
complete response each in a rhabdoid andosteosarcom axenograft. Similarly the
multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitini b(VEGF R-1,-2,-3, PDGF R-α,-β,c-Kit,

and FLT3receptors) showed intermediate (13/34) andhigh (1/34) levels of
activit yagainst 14of34evaluable solid tumo rxenografts, including [ADDRESS_119303] 
potential of pazopanib for pediatric anti -tumor activity.
2.2.2 Animal Toxicology
Inmonkeys, nospecific toxic effects were seen after 1mont hwith oraldoses of 
up to 500mg/kg/day , adose resultin g in a C max andAUC 0-t of 36 μg /mLand 
316 μg•h/m L respectively. However, a dose of 500 mg/kg/da ycould not be
tolerated formorethan 34weeks due to severe toxicity, consistin g of diarrhea, 
anorexia, moribundit yandaccumulation of crystalline material in a number of 
organs. Monke yswere given 5 or 50 mg/kg/da ypazopanib for1 year, without 
observed toxicity. The noobserved adve rseeffect level (NOAEL) after 1 year 
was50mg/kg/day .Mean plasma Cmax andAUC 0-t values at 50 mg/kg/da ywere 
31.8 μg/mL and235 μg•h/mL, respectively, inmale monkey sand44.0 μg/mL
and 289 μg•h/mL , respectively, in female monkey s after 1 year (Pazopanib 
GW786034 Investigator's Brochure).
There arenopublished datadescribing thetoxicity ofpazopanib injuvenile 
primates. However, doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day were not tolerated in juvenile rats with 
marke dreductions inbodyweight aswell asmortality seen. These effects occurred
atexposures that were simila r to or below those expecte d in pediatric cancer
patients. The specific nature of the effects in these animals is not currently know n
butispresume d to be related tovasculogenesis incritical organs such as the heart, 
liver, or kidney. In the two surviving groups, 0.3 and 3mg/kg/day there did not 
appear to be an effect on body weigh t although one anima l at 3 mg/kg/da yhad
bilateral broken incisors. Hypertroph y of epi[INVESTIGATOR_33949], andtooth
abnormalities (includin gexcessively long, brittle, broken andmissing teeth, and
dentin eand enamel degeneration and thinning) werealso observed during
repea teddose administration inmature ratandmurine models butnotabl ynotin
adult monkey s (Pazopanib GW786034 Investigator's Brochure).
These findings are consistent with previous observations of physeal dysplasia and 
ovarian anduterine changes injuvenile animals, including cynomolgus monkeys, 
during thepreclinical testin g ofother potent VEG Fblocking agents raising concern 
ofpotential pediatric -specific adverse effects onlong-term growth and 
development.27,28Nonetheless, atleast inmurine models, thechanges inbone 
growth appeared reversible after cessation of therapy .27Consistent with the know n
roles of VEGF infollicle maturation and corpus luteu mformation there were
significant reductions infemale ratfertilit y at pazopanib doses > 30 mg/kg/day .
Inmales, reductions intesticular andepi[INVESTIGATOR_107342]≥30 
mg/kg/da yand spermproduction, motility and concentration were reduced at
100 mg/kg/day, butthisdid notresul t in a functional effec ton matin g or male
fertility. Consistent with thecritical role ofVEGF in embryogenesis, cardiac 
malformations were observed inratfetuses at maternal doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day.
Delayed ossification (≥ 3 mg/kg/day) , embryo lethality and reduced fetalbody
weight were observed at 10 mg/kg/day .The NOAE L for developmental toxicit y 
inthe ratwas 1 mg/kg/da y(Pazopanib GW786034 Investigator's Brochure).
2.2.3 Preclinica l Pharmacology
14C-pazopanib demonstrates wide tissue distribution. Themajority ofpazopanib 
measured in plasm ais unmodified, minor metabolites including mono-oxygenated
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 22

and de-methylated forms . In ratsandmonkeys ,pazopanib is predominately 
excreted inthe feces with asmall amount eliminated inthe urine. Following
absorption inthemonkey ,pazopanib isprincipall ymetabolized inthe liver by
[CONTACT_107402] d i-demethylation with glucuronidation. In vitro studies indicate that
theoxidative metabolis m of pazopanib inhuma nliver microsomes isprimaril y
mediated by[CONTACT_097]3A4, with minor contributions fromCYP1A 2and CYP2C8.
There appears to be minima lpotential forinductive effects onCYP enzym e
activities inrats or monkey safter oraldoses (300 and 500 mg/k g, respectivel y) of
pazopani bfor1month. (Pazopanib GW786034 Investigator's Brochure)
In order to optimiz e in vivodosing for pazopani band determ ine whether Csteady
state or Cmax best correlated with activity, once andtwice daily p.o. dosing was
compared with a continuous infusion of a pazopanib analogue (GW771806). Both
HT29 tumor growt hinhibition and ant i-angiogenic activity inthe Matrigel plug
assay correlated with steady state concentrations of pazopanib and not with Cmax
orexposure (AUC). Complet etumor growth inhibition wasachieved with a steady-
state plasm a concentration of 2.67 μMol/ L pazopanib. This value corresponded
with apazopanib steady- stateconcentration of18 μg/mL .Atthis level, pazopanib
also demonstrate dinhibition of VEGF -induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in vivo,
butiftheconcentration dropped belowthislevel, inhibition was minimal, again 
indicating the need to sustain effective levels .[ADDRESS_119304] received pazopanib asmonotherapy 
or in combination outof approximately 7000 patien tsenrolled inpazopani boncolog yclinical 
studies. Data collected to date showthatpazopanib administration at800 mg daily isassociated 
with a reasonable safety profile and encourag ing efficacy in various oncology settings. Pazopanib 
isapproved forthetreatment ofadult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC )andfor
thetreatment ofadult patients with soft tissue sarcom awho have received prior chemotherapy. 
Results ofpharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrat ethat (a)pazopanib is 
absorbed after oraladministration; (b)aplateau is reached in steady- statesystemic exposure ata 
dose of 800 mg daily; (c)amaximu mtolerated dose hasnotbeen reached atpazopanib doses up 
to 2000 mg daily; and(d)doses ofpazopanib that maintain plasm apazopanib concentrations 
above 15 μg/m L (i.e., 800 mg daily and 300 mg twice daily [BID] ) are associated with 
pharmacodynamic andclinical effects. Pazopanib administered asoraldoses up to 800 mg daily  
is being developed by [CONTACT_107403] a variety of cancer s.
2.3.1 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data in Adults with Cancer
Theoralbioavailability ofpazopani breflects absorption thatislimited by [CONTACT_107404]800 mg once daily; therefore, increases indoses above 800mg, up
tothehighest dose evaluated (2000 mg), inthefasted state willnot result in
increased systemic exposure. Geometric mean pazopanib t½ values ranged from
18.1 to 52.3 hours. The geometric mean t½ was 30.9 hours inthe800 m g once
daily dose group, themonotherap ydose selected foradministration inPhase II and
Phase IIIclinical trials. The tmax was 3 to 4 hours. The oral bioavailability of
pazopani bmay also be affected by[CONTACT_107405].
Oral absorption issignificantly enhanced when pazopanib is dosed with food; 
therefore, it is recommended toadminister pazopanib onan empty stomach, at least 
1 hour before or 2 hours after ameal.
The absolute bioavailability ofpazopan ib(median 21%) suggest s that the majority 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 23
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
(67%) of the oral dose recovered unchanged in feces represents unabsorbed drug.
Pazopanib isnotextensively metabolized andfirst-pass metabolis m is minor,
consi stent withitslowplasm aclearance andsmallvolume of distribution.
Age, race, and gender had no effect onpazopani b PK. Mild/moderate renal 
impairment isnotexpected toinfluence pazopanib exposure, and dose adjustment 
isnot necessary. Based onbasel inehepatic function, 400 mg pazopanib is
recommended forpatients with mild impairment (defined aseither normal bilirubin
andanydegree ofalanine aminotransferase [ALT ]elevation or asanelevation of
bilirubin upto1.5x uppe r limit ofnorma l[ULN] regardless of theALTvalue),
and 200 mg forpatients with moderat eimpairment (defined as anelevation of
bilirubin >1.5 to3xUL N regardless oftheALTvalues) . The maximu m dose of
pazopanib (200 mg) administered topatients with severe hepatic impairment did 
not achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, pazopanib isnot 
recommended inpatients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin 
>3xULN regardless of any level of ALT).
In clinical studies with pazopanib , events of QT prolongation or torsade de pointes 
have occurred. Pazopani bshould beused with caution inpatients witha history of
QT i nterval prolongation, patients takin gantiarrythmics or other medications that
maypotentially prolong QT i nterval, orthose withrelevant pre-existing cardiac 
disease. When using pazopanib, baseline and periodic monitoring ofECGs and
maintenance of electrol ytes(calcium, magnesium, potassium) within normal range 
is recommended.
Pharmacodynamic data indicat ethatpazopanib, atamonother apydose of800 
mgonce daily, results in effects consistent with inhibition of the VEGF receptors 
itwas designed to targe t (i.e., increases inVEGF and decreases insoluble 
VEGFR2). Concentration -effect relationships were observed between trough 
plasma pazopanib concentrations andan increase inblood pressure intheFirst 
Time in Huma nstudy, aswell as in the percent chang e frombaseline insoluble 
VEGFR2 nadir inthePhase II study inrenal cell carcinoma .The trough plasma 
pazopanib concentrations associated with one-halfthemaximal effect (EC50) in 
both concentration effectrelationships were similar (12 to 15.3μg/m L for 
hypertension and 21.3μg/m Lforsoluble VEGFR2), which demonstrates that there
isaconsistent inhibition of VEGF receptor(s) inpatien tswith cancer when plasma 
pazopanib concentrations are maintained abov e 15-20 μg/mL.
2.3.2 Safety Data in Adults with Cancer (adverse events and serious a dverse events)
In a r andomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase III study ofpazopanib 
monotherapy inpatien tswith advanced RCC , themedian time ontreatment was 
approximately twice that on placebo (7.4 months versus 3.8 months) .29 The overall
frequency ofadverse events (AEs) reported during thestudywashigher inthe
pazopanib arm(92%) compared with placeb o(74%). Most commo nAEs reported
in>20% patien ts in thepazopanib arm(asof 23 May2008) were diarrhea
(52%), hypertension (40%), hair color chang e(depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]; 38%), nausea 
(26%), anorexia (22%), and vomiting (21%). These AEs were all reported at a 
higher incidence in the pazopanib arm than in the placebo arm. Most of these events
were Grade 1 or 2 using theNational Cance r Institute Commo nToxicity Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 3.0. More Grade 3AEswere reported
in the pazopani b arm (33% ) compared with the placebo arm (14%) . The frequency
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 24
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
ofGrade 4 AE andGrad e 5events wassimilar between the pazopanib andplacebo
arms: Grad e 4 in 7% and6%,respectively ;Grade 5 in 4% and3%,respectively.29
Atthe timeof the final overall survival (OS) analysis, a subsequent review of
safetydata did not reveal anychanges tothepreviously observed safety profile ; no 
new safety signals were detected.
Based on theanalysis of the safety data integrated across 3RCC studie s, including 
aPhase II study ofpazopani bmonotherap y in patients with advanced RC Canda
single armPhase IIIextension studyofpazopanib monotherap yin patien tswith
advanced RCCasof January 9, 2009 (N=593), themost common AEs andserious 
adverse events (SAEs) were simila r tothoseobserved inthe pazopanib armofthe 
monotherapy Phase IIIstudy.
Ina randomized placebo -controlled Phase IIIstudy of pazopanib monotherapy in 
patien tswith soft tissue sarcom a[STS]) ,themedian time on pazopanib was19.4 
weeks, ascompared with 8.1weeks intheplacebo arm.Themostcommon AEs 
(≥20%) reported in the pazopanib arm (as of May 23, 2011) were fatigue (65%), 
diarrhea (59%), nause a(56%) ,weight decreased (51%), hypertension (42%), 
decreased appetite (40%), haircolor changes (39%), vomiting (33%), tumor pain 
(30%), dysguesia (28%), headache (23%), musculoskeletal pain (23%), myalgia 
(23%), gastrointestinal pain(23%), anddyspne a(20%). Twenty- eight percent of 
patien ts on placebo and63%of patien ts on pazopanib experienced an AE of 
maximu mGrade 3 or higher. Theproportion of patien tswho experienced 
maximum Grade 4 and Grade 5 AEs was similar in both treatment arms. 30
Ananalysis of integrated safetydata from aPhase IIIstudy inpatientswith STS 
andasingle arm Phase II study ofpazopanib monotherap y in patien tswith STS 
showed asafety profile similar tothat observe d in thepazopani barm of the 
Phase IIIstudy alone. Increased rates of myocardial dysfunction, venous thrombo -
embolic events, andpneumothorax were newl y observed intheSTS studies as
compared toRCC .Rare but severe AEspreviously described for VEGFR inhibitors, 
such as cardiac/cerebral ischemia , hemorrhage, and bowel perforation, were 
observed with pazopanib treatme nt.
Areview ofSAEs acros soncolog ystudies revealed that themost frequently 
reported SAEs (≥ 70 events), regardless of causality and treatment regimen, as of 
September 9, 2011 in decreasin g order of frequency were increased ALT, dyspnea, 
vomiting, abdo minalpain, pyrexia, diarrhea, anemia , pneumonia, dehydration, and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased.
2.3.3 Efficacy Data in Adults with Cancer
Pazopanib 800 mg once daily hasshown efficacy and/or encouragin gefficacy 
signals in the following settings:
RCC : The primar y analysis of the primar y endpoint, progression -free survival 
(PFS), revealed alarge andhighly statistically significant improvement inPFS
inthepazopanib -treated patien ts compared toplacebo -treated patien ts (hazard 
ratio [HR] 0.46, 95% c onfidence interval [CI] 0.34 to 0.62, p<0.0000001). The 
median PFS inthepazopanib armwas more than double that in theplaceb o
arm: 9.2months (95% CI, 7.4, 12.9) versus 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8, 4.2),
respectively. The respons erate(RR), define das the percentage of patien ts who 
achieved either a confirmed complete response (CR) orpartial response (PR)
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 25
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
according toResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was 
significantly higher for the pazopanib arm compared with the placebo arm by 
[CONTACT_107406] (IRC )assessment (30% vs.3%,p<0.001). In
thepazopanib arm, themedian duration ofresponse was58.7 week s(95%
CI, 52.1 to 68.1 weeks) and the median time to response was 11.9 weeks (95% 
CI, 9.4 to 12.3 weeks) by[CONTACT_107407] t.29 The median OS at final analysis
was 22.9 months inthepazopani barmand20.5 month s in theplacebo arm.The
final OSwas not statistically different between thepazopanib arm and the
placebo arm in (HR =0.91, stratified log-rank p-value, 0.224). Ofnote, 54% of 
patien ts in theplacebo armreceived pazopanib, many starting early inthe study, 
and an additional 12% received other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Soft Tissue Sarcoma : In a Phase III study a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS but not OS was observed in the pazopanib arm compared
with theplacebo arm. Median progressio n-freesurvival was 4.6 months for
pazopanib compared with 1.6months for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31, 95%
CI 0.24-0.40; p<0.0001) .Overall survival was 12.5months with pazopanib 
versus 10.7 months with placebo (HR 0.86, 0.67- 1.11; p=0.25).30In a Phase II 
Study, the PFS rate at 12 weeks, based on investigator assessment, was 18 of
41patien ts(43.9%) forleiomyosarcoma; 18 of 37 patien ts (48.6%) for synovial 
sarcoma ; 5 of 19 (26.3%) for adipocytic sarcoma; and 16of 41 patien ts(39.0%)
forother types of sarcom a.31
Ovarian cancer: 11 of 36 patien ts(31%) experience d acancer antigen -125 
(CA-125) response to pazopanib, with amedian time to CA-[ADDRESS_119305] dose, thebiochemical
response was 28%(10patien ts).Overall response rate based onmodified
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG )criteria (incorporating CA-125, 
RECIST, and clinical assessment) was 18% in patien ts with measur able disease 
at baseline, and was 21% inpatien tswithout measurable disease at baseline. 
Median PFS was 84 days .32
Early -stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) :30 of 35 patien ts 
(86%) experience da reduction intumo rvolum eafter short-term use of 
pazopanib (media nduration of 16 days) asassessed by [CONTACT_5019]-resolution 
computed tomography (HRCT) after preoperative pazopanib treatment .33
ErbB 2-positive advanced ormetastatic breast cancer: Ahigher response 
rate(36.2% versus 22.2%) by[CONTACT_107408] w at Week 12wasobserved in
patien ts on combination lapatinib 1000 mg once daily + pazopanib 400mgonce
daily compared with lapatinib 1500 mg once daily asamonotherapy, 
respectivel y.34
Cervical cancer: There was a 34% reduction inriskforprogression for 
patien ts receiving pazopanib relative to lapatin ib (hazard ratio: 0.66; 90% CI: 
0.48, 0.91). The median time to investigato r-assessed PFS was 17.1 weeks in 
the lapatinib group and 18.1 weeks in the pazopanib (one -sided p=0.013).35
Pazopanib hasnotshow n signals ofefficacy inPhase II studies conducted in 
multiple myeloma (VEG20006)36orglioma (VEG102857).
Most important to the rational e for this curren t trial are the result s from the study 
ofpazopanib in adult patients with advanced ormetastatic soft tissue sarcoma. 
These combine d findings formthebasis for includin gseveral cohorts forsoft tissue 
andbonesarcom aaswell as the embryonal tumor sspecific topediatrics, which are 
of mesenchymal origin.
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_119306] studies sample platele t-poor plasm a andserum forcytokine/angiogenic factor 
profilin g which include VEGF, sVEGFR1, and sVEGFR2 and whole blood for
circulating endothelial cellsubsets (CECs) . In two separate Phase II studies of
renal cell and NSC LCpresented at the2008annual meeting ofthe American
Society forClinical Oncolog y (ASCO) adecrease in sVEGFR2 compared with
baseline wassignificantly correlated with tumor response (p<0.05).37,38In adult
patients with metastatic imatini b-refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated 
with sunitinib, another VEGF and c-kittargeting multityrosine kinase inhibitor, 
biomarker analysis ofCECs, monocytes, VEGF, and sVEGF R-2 were consistently 
modulated by [CONTACT_3148]. In this study, changes in CECs and monocytes rather than 
plasma markers differed between the patients with clinical benefit andthose with
progressive disease.39In pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors treated
with pazopanib ,baseline levels ofplasma soluble VEGF R-2andendoglin levels
were significantly decreased when measured after 2weeks oftreatment, while
placenta lgrowth factor levels were significantly increa sed over thesametime 
points. There was nosignificant change inVEGF orplasma soluble VEGF R-1
levels with pazopanib therapy.40
This study will continu e to examine the effects of pazopani b therap y on cytokines 
and angiogenic factors.
In part ,genetic predisposition may account forthe variability inbiomarker or 
clinical response toanti-VEGF treatment. Three lines ofongoin ginvestigation 
justify voluntary collection of DNA in this trial to evaluate relationships between 
discovered associations in theadult population andpazopanib effects inthe 
pediatric population, and to assess age as a covariate in these relationships.
1) Recently, Dr. and  colleagues identified asingle nucleotide 
polymorphis m in KDR (thegene thatencodes VEGFR2) that isreproducibly 
associated with thebaselin elevels ofcirculatin gsoluble VEGFR2 inthree 
separate cohorts: healthy volunteers of the Old Order Amish community; 128 
unrelated cancer patients at the ;and adult RCC patients
enrolled onthephase II trials ofpazopanib. Subsequently, they demonstrated
that inthe RCCpatients treated with pazopanib for 4 weeks, this
polymorphis m isassociated with agreater magnitude decline inplasma 
sVEGFR2 (Late Breakin g Abstract, 2011 A m Soc Clin Pharm& Therapeutics
Meeting). This genotype/phenotype relationship iscurrently being studied by 
[CONTACT_107409] (theCALG BPharmacology and Experimental 
Therapeutics Committee) in adult patients who are taking agents in this class.
Determination oftheeffec t ofthis KDR polymorphism and sVEGFR2 degree
ofchange ondisease respo nsetotherapy isongoing.
2) Several genotypes attheVEGF Alocus have been associated with increased 
ordecreased VEGF production andprognostic and predictive markin gof 
treatment outcomes. In most VEGF signaling pathway inhibitor trials 
analyzed sofar,4SNPs in thepromoter region have been evaluated for 
associations with clinical outcomes: -2578, -1498, -1154, and -634. These 
studies have yielded inconsistent findings. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
similar inconsistencies led to confusion onthe predicti verole ofVEGF alleles
until ameta-analysis by[CONTACT_107410], etal.41revealed only -[ADDRESS_119307] pazopanib exposure, response 
rate, and progressio n-free surviva l.
3) GlaxoSmithKline hasrecentl y published results of a candidate gene 
association study in adult RCCpatients treated withpazopanib.25Several 
polymorphisms incandidat egenes demonstrat edassociations withresponse 
rate and progression -free survival. Validation and elaboration ofthese 
findings willbecom eavailable prior tocompletion ofthistrial. Base don the 
adult findings, additional markers maybe explored inthe pediatric 
populat ion.
2.4 Pediatric Studies
2.4.1 Pediatric Phase I Studies
TheChildren’s Oncolog yGroup (COG )conducted aphase Istudy ofpazopanib 
inchildren with STS orother refractory solid tumor s(ADVL0815). This study was
performe d to determin ethemaximu mtolerated dose (MTD) oftwo formulations
oforalpazopanib; todefine anddescribe thetoxicities, pharmacodyamics and
pharmacokinetics (PK) ofpazopanib administered as a tablet (Part 1) or powder 
suspension (Part 2a); and to explore pazopanib induced changes intumo r blood
volum e and vascular permeability (Ki) usingdynamic contrast enhanced MRI
(DCE-MRI) in a subset ofpatients with STS(Part 2b). During part 1,pazopanib 
(tablet formulation) wasadministered once daily in28 day cycles at 4 dose levels 
(275 to 600 mg /m2)using therollin g-six design. Dose determination for a powder 
suspension (Part 2a) was initiated at 50% of the MTD fortheintact tablet. Ten
patients withSTS underwent DCE-MRI scanning at baseline and 15 ± 2 days after 
initiation of pazopanib at thetablet MTD (Part 2b). A total of 53 patien tswere
enrolled; 51were eligible [26 male, media nage12.9 yrs (range 3.8 -23.9)].
Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were generally mild. Diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, fatigue, proteinuria and hypertensi onwerethe most commonly reported
side effects. Onlycycle 1DLTswere considered fordetermination of theMTD 
and included Grade 3lipase ,amylase and ALT elevation, proteinuria and
hypertension. One patient with occult brain metastasis intheimaging expansion
cohort also hadGrade 4intracranial hemorrhage . TheMTD was450 mg/m2/dose
fortable ts,and160mg/ m2/dose forpowder suspension; twoisolated andreversible 
Grade 3ALT elevations were seen at the powder suspension dose of 225 mg/
m2/dose. Toxicit ies requiring dose modification and/or discontinuation in later 
cycles included tumor pain (n=2), ALT elevation (n=2), diarrhea, myalgia 
associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ,handfootsyndrome, weight 
loss, fistula formation at a site of prior RT, growth plate abnormality and recurrent
neutropenia (eachn=1). Three of27patients treated attheMTD had asymptomatic
decreases inleftventricular systolic function; allwere reversible andthe drug was
successfully reintroduced in two. Asymptomat icsinus bradycardia was noted in 4
patients, all≥ 12 years. NoQTc prolongation was observed.
Steady state trough concentration (Ctrough) was reached by [CONTACT_4475] 15 and exceeded
15µg/ml at alldose level s. There wasmarke dinter-patient variability inPK 
parameters resulting in substantial overlap betwee n dose levels and trough 
concentrations did not appear dose-dependent. Patien tsreceived 1-22+cycles 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 28
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
(median = 2). One patient each with hepatoblastoma or desmoplastic small round 
and all 5 who received therapy for a year or more had Ctrough ≥30μg/ml. All 
patients with evaluable DCE-MRI (n=8) experienced decreases in tumor blood

2.4.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative Biological Studies 
Hypertension was seen in several patien ts in the pediatric Phase I dose escalation 
study, which is a class effect seen with other VEGF blocking agents. Suchhypertension has been treatable with anti-hypertensives and may ultimately be a 
biomarker of treatment effect. Pediatric specific guidelines for the management 
of VEGF blocking agent-induced hypertension have been developed for other COGDevelopmental Therapeutics studies (e.g. ADVL0413, ADVL0612, ADVL0714,
and ADVL0815) and will be used fo r this trial. In the adult Phase I pazopanib trial,
a relationship between steady-state trough concentrations and the occurrence ofhypertension could be described by a logi stic regression model. Twenty (77%) of
the 26 patients with Ctrough values > 15 μg/mL on Day 22 developed
hypertension, versus 11 (39%) of the 28 patients who had lower Ctrough values.
42
In the pediatric phase I trial, the mean Ctrough in patients with drug relatedhypertension (n=13) was 42±13 g/ml versus 29±13 g/ml in normotensive patients (n=27; p=0.008), suggesting a relationship between blood pressureelevation and drug exposure. In addition pediatric patients with a best response of 
stable disease had a 30% incidence of blood pressure elevation within the first two 
cycles, and 47% incidence over all cycles. This trial will seek to expand ourunderstanding of the relationship of pazopa nib Ctrough to hypertension, and the 
utility of hypertension as a pharmacodynamic or predictive marker.

rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma (including synovial sarcoma,
alveolar soft part sarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor) and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral
PNET. Tumors of secondary interest include hepa toblastoma, neuroblastoma (measurable and 
evaluable), and osteosarcoma.
Each tumor type defines a cohort resulting in [ADDRESS_119309] 10 evaluable p atients in a cohort, an additional 10 patients will 
be enrolled into that cohort in the second stage of study. Thus, for cohort(s) with one or more
confirmed responses in the first stage of study, a total of 20 patients will be enrolled and evaluated to determine efficacy.
Eligible patients will receive pazopanib monothe rapy. Pazopanib will be dosed daily as an oral 
tablet (450 mg/m
2/dose, maximum 800 mg) or as a powder for oral suspension (225 mg/m2/dose, 
maximum 400 mg) in 28 day cycles.
The MTD for pazopanib tablets was 450 mg/m2/dose as determined by [CONTACT_107411]0815/PZP114411, 
the COG Phase I study in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. For the powder suspension formulation, the selected starting dose is  higher than the protoc ol-defined  MTD of 160 
mg/m
2/dose established in ADVL0815. This decision is driven by [CONTACT_107412] 160

Thefirst patients who are enrolled to receive pazopanib as powder suspension at 225 mg/m2/dose 
daily willbeclosel ymonitored forsafet yandforthe occurrence ofdose-limiting toxicity during 
thefirstcycle(28days) oftherapy . Patient swhoeithe rreceiv e225 mg /m2/dose daily for atleast 24

during thefirst cycle will beconsidered evaluable forthepurpose ofthis safet yreview. Six
evaluable patients are required.
The firstpatients enrolled toreceive powder suspension at225mg/m2/dose willalso beexpected 
tocomplete extended PKsamplin g(Section 7.3.2)withblood samples collected prior todosing, 
and30min, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8hours after thepazopani bdose onDay 1andDay 15 ± 1 day of 
Cycle 1(with nopazopani bdose modification oradjustment inthe10daysbefore Cycle 1Day

pazopanib as powder suspension for the purpose of obtaining the extended PK samples.
Because patients receiving thepowder suspension enrolled inthesafetyreview group may be 
different fromthose inthePKanalysis group, enrollmen tonto powder suspension mayfollow 
several different paths:
If ≥ [ADDRESS_119311] dose-limiting toxicities (DLT andasdefined in

be halted. Subsequent new patients willbeenrolled atthe 160mg/m2/dose level until 6
evaluable patients fromthisdose groupare available forthesafetyreview and 6 patients 
are available for PK analysis at 160 mg/ m2/dose.
If 6 PKevaluable patients areenrolled prior toenrollment of 6 patients whoare

See Section 5for Dose Modifications in Response to Toxicities
4.1.1 Dose Reduction
Forpatients who receive pazopanib tablet s: Dosereductio n(s) in response to toxicity
may be im plemented according toguidance inSections 5.2,5.3,and5.4 oftheprotocol.
Outside thespecific managemen tguidance described in these sections, patients who 
recove r from an adverse ev ent to starting criteria as outlined inSection 4.2withi n 14
days following planned administration willalso bepermitted to receive protocol 
therapy at a reduced dose. Dose reduction (s)will bebased on thestartin gdose and
should follow theDosing Nomogra min Appendix II.
Note :For patient s receivin g pazopani b tablet s at a starting dose of 400 mg, there will 
only be one allowed dose reduction due to tablet size.
For patients who receive pazopanib as oral powder for suspension:
Dose reduction(s) inresponse totoxicity may be implemented according to guidance 
in Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 of the protocol. Outside the specific management guidance
described inthese sections, patients whorecover froman adverse event to startin g 
criteria as outlined in Section 4.2 within 14 days following planned administration will 
also be permitted to receive protocol therapy at a reduced dose. Dose reduction(s)
will bebased onthestarting dose and should follow the guidance in Table 1 and 
Table 1a.

for reasons other than toxicity (unplanned travel or vacation, or lack oftransportation 
to the site), the Study Chair must be notified to review the patient’s condition inorder 
toresum etreatment. Incases oftoxicity, re-challenge ata reduceddose ispossible if 
thepatient’s condition hasbeen stable andhasnot deteriorated and the patient must 
have recovered from thetoxicity (Section 4.2).

4.5 Permitted Medications –Use with Ca ution
4.5.1 Specific recommendations regarding anticoagulants:
Results fromdrug-drug interaction studies conducte d inpatien tswith cancer suggest
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_119341] been reporte d in clinical studies with pazopanib. T herefore, ifthe
investigator decides tocontinue pazopanib and anticoagulants use concomitantly, it
should beused with caution inpatien tswith increased risk of severe bleeding or
who arebenefittin gfromtreatment and require theinitiation ofconcomitant 
anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin orits derivatives, low molecular weight heparin, 
unfractionated heparin) while on study.Note: Patient sare excluded fromenrolling
on thestudy iftheyaretaking therapeutic doses of S- warfarin atthetime ofscreening.
Patients taking concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be monitored regularl yfor
changes in relevant coagulation parameters as clinicall y indicated , as well as for any 
clinical bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
4.5.2 Specific recommendations regarding hypoglycemic therapy including insulin: 
Results fromdrug-drug interaction studies conducte d in patien tswith cancer
suggest thatthere will b e no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between 
pazopanib andhypog lycemi c agents. Transient decreases inserum glucose (mainly
Grade 1and 2,rarely Grade 3) have been observed inclinical studies with pazopanib. 
In addition, decreases in blood sugar have been report ed inpatien ts treated with 
another small molecule tyrosine ki nase inhibitor, sunitinib (British JournalofCance r
2008: 99, 1380). Suchchanges mayrequir ean adjustment inthe dose of
hypog lycemic and/or insulin therapy. Patients should beadvised toreport symptom s
ofhypoglycemi a(e.g., confusion, visual disturbances, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], andsweating). 
Serumglucose should be tested during treatment with pazopanib as outlined in the 
protocol and as clinically indicated.
4.5.3 Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations 
andshould be undertaken with caution andclose monitoring. Ifa patient receiving 
concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow dosing guidelines for 
pazopanib or consider disconti nuing simvastatin.
4.5.4 Concomitant administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the 
bioavailability of pazopani b by 40% (AUCandCmax). Co- administration of 
pazopanib with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) should be avoided. Co-
administration of pazopani b with PPIs is PROHIBITED from [ADDRESS_119342] e iscollected on
Day 15 ± 1 day ofCycl e 1.After this, iftheconcomitant useof a proto n-pump
inhibitor (PPI) ismedically necessary, it isrecommended thatthedose ofpazopanib
be ta kenwithout food once daily intheevenin gconcomitantly with thePPI (Section
4.8). If the concomitant administration ofanH2-receptor antagonist ismedically
necessary, pazopanib shoul d be takenwithout food atleast 2hours before orat
least [ADDRESS_119343] 1hourbefore or 2 hoursafter administration ofshort -acting 
antacids.
4.5.5 Concurrent Anti-Hypertensive Therapy: Thealgorith m in Section 5.4.1 willbe 
used tograde andmanag epazopanib related hypertension. Shoul dinitiation of 
anti-hypertensive therapy berequired, single agent therapy (commonl yincluding the
calciu mchannel blockers amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_107345]) may be started without notifying 
the study chair.
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 45
Amended Protocol Version 05 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
4.5.6 Anti- inflammatory and anti -platelet agents (e.g. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and/or ibuprofen, or other 
NSAIDs) could result in elevated blood pressure or increased bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_107346] -administered with pazopanib and therefore should be used with caution.
4.5.7 Patients’ medications should be reviewed at eligibility, before treatment initiation, 
and during treatment. Any concomitant medications that are “generally accepted” to
cause a risk ofTorsade depointes areprohibited (see Appendix IIIB).Thos e
“associated” with arisk of QTc prolongation and/or Torsades de pointes should be
discontinued orreplaced with drugsthat do not carrythese risks, ifpossible.
Patients who musttake these medications should bewatc hed carefully forsymptom s 
of QTc prolongation, such assyncope. Performing additional EKG son patients who
musttake oneormore ofthese medications is recommended but not required, at the 
investigator’s discretion.

5.4 Potential Pazopanib Specific Side Effects
5.4.1 Hypertension
 Baseline blood pressure (BP) isdefined asthebloodpressure obtained at the
examination used for study enrollment. This baseline BP should be obtained as 
follows:
1) Obtain 3serial blood pressures fromthesameextremity with thepatient in
thesame positio n that are separated b y at least 5 minutes .Avoid using the 
lower extremity if possible.
2) Average the systolic blood pressure from the 2ndand 3rdmeasurements.
3) Average the diastolic blood pressure from the 2ndand 3rdmeasurements.
4) Thebaseline BP is theaverage ofthesystolic over theaverage of the 
diastolic measurements.
 Elevation in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure should be considered 
when following the algorithm below.
 The upper limit ofnormal (ULN )isdefined asa BP equal tothe95th
percentile for age, height, and gender. If ≥ [ADDRESS_119355] will be defined 
as a BP of 140/90. See Appendix V.
 TheNCICTCAE version 4.0will beutilized todetermine thegrade of 
hypertension for reporting purposes.
 Elevated BPmeasurements should berepeated onthesameday to confirm the
elevation. Patients withanelevated BPshould have BPmeasurements performed 
at least twice weekly until BP is≤ ULN.
 The algorithm below will be used to manage pazopanib related hypertension.
 Hypertension shoul d be manage dwith appropriate anti-hypertensive agent(s) as 
clinically indicated. It is strongly recommended that nephrology or cardiology be 
consulted in the evaluation and management of hypertension.
 For patients who were on one anti-hypertensive medication at study enrollment 
and hypertension worsen s while on study , further ant i-hypertensive therapy may
include dose adjustment ofthecurrent medication or the addition of a second 
anti-hypertensive medicatio n.

5.4.2 Abdominal pain:
Abdominal pain is acommo nsympto mwith vascular endothelial growt hfactor 
(VEGF) receptor antagonists such aspazopanib. Bowe lperforations have
been reported inclinical trials ofpazopanib andwithother agents inthisclass.
Bowel perforations have been associated insomepatients with tumor inthe
bowel wall, or diverticul itis, while in others there has been no clear explanation.
Although bowel perforatio nisarare event, investigators andstudystaff at

elevated ALT or other signs/symptoms of liver 
injury) does not require dose modification.
Study treatment inhibits UGT1A1 and
OATP1B1, which can cause elevation of
indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin in the absence 
of liver injury
2. If total bilirubin is >1.[ADDRESS_119367] in the absence of 
ALT elevation, fractionation of bilirubin should 
be performed. 
If the bilirubin is predominantly indirect 
(≥65%) indirect (unconjugated), continue 
study treatment at the same dose.
If bilirubin is >35% direct (conjugated), 
study treatment may also be continued 
however, further evaluation should be 
undertaken for underlying cause of 
cholestasis.

 Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia is Grade 1 or within institutional limits
 Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia is ≤ Grade 2
 Hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia is ≤ Grade 2
 Hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia is ≤ Grade 2.
Eventhough pazopanib administration isallowed atthese lower laboratory toxicity
grades, everyeffor tshould bemade to correct the abnormal labvalues to normal if 
possible.
5.4.5 Proteinu ria:
 Ifurinalysis shows ≥trace protein then obtain a urine protein: creatinine

Guidelines for the management of prolonged QTinterval are as follows: 
Measure theQT i nterval (fromthestart oftheQwave totheendofthe
Twave) andtheprecedin g RR interval. Thecorrected QTinterval using 
the Bazett’s formula (QTcB interva l) will be calculated as the QT
interval (msec) divided by [CONTACT_107432] (msec).
OnlytheBazett’s formula should beused to calculate thecorrected QT
interval.
QTcB interval < 500 msec: No specific therap y needed.
Continue pazopanib at the same dose. Serum K+,Ca++, Mg++,andPhos 
should be monitored and repleted if low (see Section 5.4.4).
QTcB interval ≥ 500 msec: Hold pazopanib, review concom itant

Source and Pharmacology :
The chemical name [CONTACT_107515] b is 5-[[4-[(2,3 -Dimethyl-2H- indazo l-6-

monohydrochloride. Themolecular formula isC21H23N7O2S-HCl. Themolecular
weight is474.0 (monohydrochlorid esalt)and437.5(freebase) .Themonohydrochlorid e
salt isvery slightl ysolubl e in0.1 M HCl(0.65mg/mL) ,practicall yinsolubl e in pH 7.0

(0.000 2mg/mL).
Pazopani b is a multi-targete dinhibito r of vascula r endothelia lgrowt h facto r(VEGF) 
recepto r tyrosin ekinase s (VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 ,andVEGFR3) , platele t-derived growth 
factor receptor kinases (PDGF R-α and–β),fibroblast growth factor recepto r-1 and -3, 
cytokine receptor (Kit), interleukin -2receptor inducible T-cellkinase (Itk),leukocyt e-
specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), and transmembrane glycoprotein receptor 
tyrosine kinase (c-Fms). In vitro, pazopanib inhibited ligand- induced
autophosphoryla tionof VEGF R-2, KitandPDGF R-β receptors. Invivo,pazopanib 
inhibited VEGF -induced VEGF R-2phosphorylation inmous elungs, angiogenesis in a
mous emodel, and the growth of some human tumor xenografts in mice.
Inadults, pazopanib isorally absorbed with median time to peak concentration of 2
to4 hours after thedose. Also in adults, theadministration ofasingle, crushed
pazopanib 400 mg tablet increased AUC(0-72) by46%, increased Cmax by
[CONTACT_3450] 2fold, and decreased Tmaxby[CONTACT_3450] 2hourscompared to
administration ofthe whole tablet. Due tothis potentia lfor increased exposure
(increased bioavailability, increased rateofabsorption), tablets ofpazopanib should
not becrushed. Systemi cexposure is increased when pazopanib is adminis tered with
food. Administration with ahigh-fator low-fatmeal results inanapproximately 2-fold
increase inAUCandCmax .Therefore, pazopanib shoul d be administered at least 1 
hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Pazopanib ismorethan 99% bound tohuman
plasm aprotein invivo. Invitro studies suggest thatpazopani bisa substrate forP-
glycoprotein (Pgp) andbreas tcancer resistant protein (BCRP).
Invitro studie sdemonstrated thatpazopanib ismetabolized by[CONTACT_097]3A 4with aminor 
contribution fromCYP 1A2 andCYP2C8 . Invitrodata alsoindicat e thatpazopani b is

it is a t thediscretio n of theclinicia nbased on thepharmacokineti cpropertie s ofeach
individua lagent .Concomitant useofpazopanib with agents with narrow therapeutic 
windows that aremetabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2C8, orCYP2D6 isnot
recommended. Coadministration may result ininhibition of the metabolism of these 
products and create the potential for serious adverse events.
Inadults, pazopanib hasameanhalf-life of 30.9 hours after administration ofthe 
recommended dose of800 mg.Elimination isprimaril yviafeces with renal
elimination accounting for <4% of the administered dose. Based on baseline hepat ic
function, 800mg pazopanib is recom mended for adult patients with mild impairment 
(defined as either normal bilirubin andanydegree ofalanine aminotransfe rase [ALT]
elevation orasan elevation ofbilirubi n up to 1.5x uppe rlimit ofnorma l[ULN]
regar dlessoftheALT value), and200 mg foradult patients with moderate impairmen t
(defined asanelevation ofbilirubin >1.5 to3xUL Nregardless of theALTvalues) . The
maximu mdose of pazopanib (200 mg) administered to adult patients with severe 
hepatic impairment didnot achieve therapeutic plasm aconcentrations. Therefore,
pazopanib isnotrecommended in adult patient swith sever ehepati cimpairment 
(defined as total bilirubi n>3xULN regardless of any level of ALT).
Pazopanib maycause prolongation oftheQT i nterval andtorsades depointes .Refer
toAppendix I IIBfor agents to avoid during administration of pazopanib.
Pregnancy andlactation : 
Pregnancy Category D
Pazopanib cancausefetal harmwhen administered to apregnan twoman .Based on its 
mecha nism of action, pazopanib is expected toresult inadverse reproductive effects.
In pre-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, pazopanib was teratogenic, embryotoxic, 
fetotoxic, andabortifacient. Inpre-clinical studies inratsandrabbits, pazopanib was
teratogenic, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, andabortifacient. Administration ofpazopani b
topregnant rats during organogenesis at a dose level of ≥ 3 mg/kg/day
(approximately 0.1 timesthe huma nclinical exposure based onAUC )resulted in
teratogenic effects including cardiovascular malformations (retroesophageal 
subclavian artery , missing innominate artery, changes in the aortic arch) and 
incomplet e or absent ossification. In addition, there wasreduced fetal bodyweight, and
pre-andpost-implantation embryoleth ality inrats administered pazopanib atdoses ≥
3 mg/kg/day . In rabbits, maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption, increased
post-implantation loss, andabortion) wasobserved at doses ≥30 mg/kg/da y
(approximately 0.007 times the huma nclinical exposu re).Inaddition, severe 
materna l body weight loss and 100% litter loss were observed at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/da y 
(0.02 times the huma n clinical exposure), while fetal weigh t was reduced at doses ≥3 
mg/kg/day (AUC not calculated).
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies ofpazopanib inpregnant wome n. 
Protocol therapy should beimmediately discontinued if pregnancy occurs while the 
patient is on therapy . Wome n of childbearing potential should beadvised to avoid

1: one sampl eprior to the doseandonesample 3-4 hours after dosing.
Blood samples for analysis of steady -state troug h plasma pazopanib 
concentrations willalsobeobtained prior to the start ofeverysubsequent odd-
numbered cycle (that is,pre-dose prior toCycle 3,pre-dose prior to Cycle 5, 
etc). These stead y-state trough plasma concentration samples can be collected 
between Day 22 of theprevious cycle toDay 1 of theodd-num bered cycle,
and the actual date and time of sample collection recorded on the PK sample 
collection form .NoPK sample s are required beyond Cycle 11.
The pre-dose sample onDay 15 ± [ADDRESS_119388] e for 
analysis oftheplasm apazopanib concentration collected atthefollowing
time points onDay 1 of Cycle 1:pre-dose andat30min, 1hour, 2 hou rs,4
hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours after thedose. Samples will also beobtained on
Day 15 ± 1 day of Cycle 1: pre -dose and at 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours,
6hours, and 8 hours after thedose. If one or moreofthese 6patients fail to
provide blood samples asspecified intheprotocol or if it isknow nthatfor 
somereason a patient’s collected blood sample(s) cannot be analyzed, that 
patient(s) will be deter mined to be non- evaluable for this analysis andone or

patients will also provide bloodsamples foranalysis ofstead y-state trough
plasm apazopanib concentrations prior tothestart ofevery subsequent odd-
numbered cycle as described in the preceding paragrap h.
Pazopanib dosin g ofeithe r tablet or powde rsuspension must have continued 
uninterrupted and at the samedose level foratleast 10days prior to
acquisition of theCycle 1Day 15 P K samples. Ifpazopanib dosin ghasbeen
interrupted or modified <[ADDRESS_119389] 10consecutive days ofdosin g atthesame

time ofsample collections should berecorded in the eCRF.
If ≥2 out of 6evalu ablepatients havedose-limiting toxicities as define d in 
Section 5.1)during the first cycle, then enrollment at the 225 mg/m2/dose dose 
level ofpazopanib oral suspension will behalted. Subsequent new patien ts
will beenrolled atthe160mg/m2/dose level until 6evaluable patients from this
dose group areavailable forthesafety review and6patients areavailable for
PK analysis.

 Investigato rdiscretion
9STATISTICAL CONSIDE RATIONS
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration
9.1.1 Review ofpatient accrual onto recent Phase IIsolid tumo rstudies indicates the 
following entry rates for the various tumors under study can be expected:
Disease Group /Cohort s Patients/Year
Osteosarcoma 24
Ewing sarcoma 18
Rhabdomyosarcoma 18
Neuroblastoma (measurable disease) 12
Neuroblastoma (evaluable disease) 12
Non-rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcomas 10 
(including synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part 
sarcoma)
Hepatoblastoma 7
With these entry rates, theprobability ofaccruin g 10 patients tocomplete
the initial stage ofevaluation intheseven name [CONTACT_107516] 24
month sis88%. Thecorresponding probability forenrollin g 20 patients inthe
seven named disease categories in 48 months is95%. The study will likely
require 2 to 3.5years for sufficient patient enr ollments to evaluate pazopanib in 
the stated disease groups. A minimu m of 77 patients and a maximu m of 154 
patients are anticipated, after accountin gforhistorica lrates ofpatient 
inevaluability for the primary endpoint in phase II studies.
9.2 Study Design

9.3 Analysis Populations
The modified Inten t-to-Treat (mITT) population is theprimar yanalysis population. The 
mITTwill consist of all patients who have received at least one dose of protocol therap y.
The Safety population will comprise allpatien ts in themITT population. The safety  
population will be used for the analysis of safety data.
The Per Protocol (PP) population is a subset of the mITT population who meet all eligibility 
criteria .
ThePharmacokinetic (PK) population willcomprise allpatients inthemITT population
for whom a pharmacokinetic sample is obtained and analyzed. The Pharmacokinetic 
Extended Samplin g(PKES) population will comprise all subjects in the Pharmacokinetic 
population who received powder suspension and hav e atleast one non-predose sample 
collected and analyzed using the extended sampling schedule in Section 7.3.2. PK analysis 
summaries, figures and listings will be based on PKand PKES population s.
9.4 Analysis Data Sets
Theprimar ydata setfor assessing efficacy willcomprise themITT population. The PP and 
mITT population swill be used for objective response analysis. All other efficacy analyses 
will be based on mITT only.
The primar ydata set for assessing safetywill comprise thesafety population define din
Section 9.3 (Analysis Populations ).

given tumor specific cohort will not be expanded if all the patients in the cohort hav e:
Progressed
Discontinued therapy
Withdrawn consent
Been determined to be lost -to-follo w-up
Orhave been treated for at least 20 w eekswithout aresponse, makin g
it unlikely that a response will occur.
Theprimaryanalysis will beperforme d 20 week safterthelastpatient’s firstvisit inthe 
three cohorts of primar y interest (rhabdomyosarcoma, non -rhabdomyosarcomatous soft 
tissue sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET).
Thestudywill becomplete d one year fromthedate ofthelastpatient’s firstvisit and 
the end of study analysis will be performed atthetime ofstudy completio n.
Anyadditional data collected after theprimaryanalysis will be included ina 
suppl ementary analysis and reported in a final Clinical Study Report.
9.7 Key Elements of Analysis Plan
9.7.1 Study Withdrawal
Allpatien tswho withdraw fromthestudy willbeincluded inanalyse suptothe 
time of withdrawal, regardless oftheduration oftreatment.
9.7.2 Missing Data
As the period of treatment for anypatient will be dependent ontreatment efficacy 
andtoxicity, theduration offollow-up will varybetween patien ts.Consequently,
there will benoimputatio nformissi ngdata. Where appropriate, available data 
will be summarized over specified intervals (e.g. from study entry until withdrawal
fromthestudy )using suitable summar ystatistics. Detail swillbe given in the 
Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP).
For the second ary PFS endpoint, the date associated with the last adequate disease
assessment will beused forthose patien tswhoarealive andhave notprogressed
atthetime of analysis; such patien tswillbeconsidered censored in the analysis.
9.7.3 Other Issues
Data from all participatin g centers will be poole d prior to analysis. It is anticipated 
that patient accrual will be spread thinly across centers andsummaries ofdata by
[CONTACT_107441] y to be informative andwill not, therefore, be provided.
Demograph icandbaseline characteristics willbesummarized.
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 76
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Two- sided 90% confidence limits willbeused intheestimation ofresponse rates 
and viewed as descriptive.
Anydeviations from ,oradditions to, the original analysis plan described inthis 
protocol wi ll be documented in the RAP and final study report.
9.8 Methods ofAnalysis
9.8.1 Primary Endpoint: Objective Response Rate (ORR)
This is defined as the percentage of patien ts achieving either a complete or partial 
tumor response as per response criteria. The response rate will be calculated from  
theinvestigator review. Confirmatio nwill bebased onthediseas eassessment 
performed 1cycle after theinitial response. Theobjectiv eresponse ratewill be 
computed for the [ADDRESS_119392].
Patients in the mITT population withunknown ormissing response will be treated
asnon-responders (i.e.,they will be include d inthedenominator when calculating 
the percentag e).
In other words, ORR = (number of patien ts with a confirmed best overall response 
of CR +number of patien tswith a confirmed best overall response of PR) divided 
by [CONTACT_107442] t.
The assessment ofactivit y of treatment within each histolog ycohort will be 
based on the decision rule outlined in Section 9.2.
90% confidence intervals will be provided tocharacterize thevariab ilityaround 
the response rate. The data will be presented for each cohor t.
9.8.2 Secondary Endpoints:
[IP_ADDRESS] The objective response ratewill becomputed forthe4tumortypes of 
secondary interest. The analysis method will be the same as thatdescribed 
in Section 9.8.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] If recruitment is stopped in the non-primary histology group(s) andithas 
lessthan 10 patien ts,theresponse datawill display summar ystatistics 
and the rule in the table under Section 9.2 will not apply.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression -free survival (PFS) andoverall survival (OS)
Theanalysis willevaluate the mITT population onPFSusing data from 
the investi gator review. PFS is defined as the interval between the date 
of first dose ofprotocol therapy and theearliest date of disease
progression ordeath due to anycause. Patients areconsidered tohave
progressive disease if they have documented progression based on
radiologic assessment as determined by[CONTACT_107443] (defined in
Sectio n10). Forpatien ts who do no t progres s or die, progression -free 
survival will be censored at thedate oflastadequate assessment ordate

[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of response (DoR)
For the subset of patient s with a confirmed CR/PR, D oR isdefined as the 
time from first documented evidence of complete or partial response to 
theearliest dateofdisease progression ordeath due to anycause. For 
confirmed responders who have not experienced progression or death 
prior to the date of data cut-off for analysis or starting other anticancer 
therapy, duration of response will be right -censored on the date of their 
last adequate post -baseline tumor assessment prior to the cut -off or start 
of other anticancer therapy.
Duration of response will be summariz ed descriptively for each cohort 
using medians and quartiles if there are 5 or more responders (confirmed 
CR/PR) in one cohort, otherwise, only a listing with subject level details 
will be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Measures:
Safety data will bepresen ted for all patien ts in the safety population 
(mITT) regardless of cohor t. If there aremultiple dose levels for the 
powder suspension formulation group,then data foreach dose level will 
be presented in separate columns.
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Hematology ,coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry, lipase and 
amylase, thyroid function tests, andUPCdata will besummarized at 
each scheduled assessment. Hematology ,coagulation parameters and 
clinical chemistry willbesummarized by[CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE version 4.0and 
by [CONTACT_107445].
Other Safety Measures
Vital signs(blood pressure, heart rate, temperature ),height andweight 
willbe listed for each patien tandchang efrombaseline willbeincluded 
for blood pressure and heart rate. A descriptive summar y including 
change frombaseline pre-dose willalso be presented. Individual profiles 
of blood pressure will be plo ttedby[CONTACT_5586].
The corrected QTcBinterval (QTc B)willbelisted for each patien tand 
summarized ateach scheduled assessment time. Change from baseline 
will be summarized and an analysis of central tendency (means, medians)
willbepresented. A categorical analysis foreach QTcB parameter will
beperforme d todetermine thenumbe r ofpatien ts at each time point for 
the following categories:
QTcB. <450, 450 to <480, 480 to 500, and >500 msec.
QTcB change from baseline, 30 to <60 msec, and ≥ 60 msec.
9.9 Evaluability for Response
Response will be determined on the m odified intent to treat (mITT) population consisting  
of all patients who are eligible and received at least one dose of protocol therap y.
Forhepatoblastoma patients, RECIST criteria asdescri bedbelow willbeused to provide 
anevaluation ofRECIS T-based response. For patients without serumalpha fetoprotein 
(AFP) elevated beyond theinstitutional upper limit of normal forage atthe time ofthe start
ofprotocol therapy ,theRECIS T-based respo nse will determine therespons eforthe 
application ofthestatistical rule described inSection 9.Patients whose serumAFP level 
iselevated beyond theinstitutional upper level ofnorma lforage atthestart of protocol 
therapy wil l also beassessed forAFP-based response. Anysuch patient considered 
evaluable for response as described in Sectio n 9.8 will be considered: (1) an AFP complete
responder (AFP -CR) ifanyserumAFPobtain ed on or after thestart ofCycle 3 but before
thestart ofCycle 7 is considered at or belowtheinstitutional upper limit of normal for 
age; or (2) an AFP partial responder (AFP -PR) if any serum AFP obtained on or after the 
start of Cycle 3 but before the start of Cycle 7 is50% or lessthan that individual’s initial 
AFP but is still considered abov e the institutional upper level of normal age; and (3) AFP -
non-responder in any other case. The initial AFP obtained onDay 1 of protocol therapy or
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 79
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
theAFPobtained during enrollmen t(seeNote in Section [IP_ADDRESS]), if the Day 1 AFP is not 
available.
For patients evaluable for both RECIS T-based andAFP-based response, theoverall 
response forapplication of thestatistical rule will becalculated as: (1) RECIS T-CR or 
RECIS T-PR,AFP-anyresponse categor y –response; (2)RECIS T-SD,AFP-CR or AFP-
PR – r esponse; (3)Anyother combination ofRECIS TandAFP response –non-responder.

10 EVALUA TION CRITERIA
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events (CTCAE)
Thisstudy will utiliz etheCTCA E of theNationa lCance rInstitut e(NCI )fortoxicit y
andperformance reporting. The descriptions andgradin gscales found intherevised 
CTCAE version 4.0willbeutilized forreporting . All appropriate treatment areas shoul d
have access to a copyoftheCTCA Eversion 4.0,which can be downloaded fromthe
CTEP web site(http://ctep.cancer.go v). Additionally, toxicities areto be reported on
the appropriate case report forms.
10.2 Response Criteria
Asoutlined ,patient swill beassigne d toone of the followin g categorie s for assessmen tof 
response : a)solidtumo randmeasurabl ediseas e (Sectio n10.3); b) neuroblast oma with 
MIBGpositiv elesion s(Sectio n10.4)c)hepatoblastom a(Sectio n10.6)
Note:Neuroblastom apatient swho do nothave MIBG positiv elesion s shoul d be assessed 
forrespons e assolidtumo rpatient swithmeasurabl edisease.
10.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors and Measurable Disease
Response andprogression will beevaluated inthisstudy usingtherevised Response 
Evaluation Criteria inSolidTumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1)[Eur J Ca 45:228 -
247, 2009].[ADDRESS_119395] diamete r(unidimensional measurement) ofthetumor lesions areused in
the RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_119396] 10 mm (CTscan slice
thickness nogreater than 5mm).Theinvestigator will identify up to 5
measurable lesions tobefollowed forresponse. Previous ly irradiated lesions
mustdemonstrate clear evidence of progression to be considered measurabl e.
Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with appropriate imaging 
modalities (e.g., CT or MRI).Bone scans cannot be used to measure lesions. The 
same method ofassessment is to be used tocharacterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline a nd during follo w-up.
10.3.2 Quantification of Disease Burden
The sum of the longes t diamete r (LD) for all targe t lesion s will be calculate d 
and reported as the disease measurement.
10.3.3 End-of-Cycle Response
Note: Please also see Table 1 in Section 10.7.
a. Complete Response (CR)
Disapp earance ofalltarge tand non-target lesions. Normalization of
urinary catecholamines (for patients with neuroblastoma), immunocytologic 
findings, or other tumor markers if abnormal or elevated at study enrollment.
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 82
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
b. Partial Response (PR)
Atleast a 30% decrease inthedisease measurement, taking asreference
the disease measuremen t done to confir m measurable disease at study
enrollment. No new lesions orprogression ofanynon-target measurable 
lesion.
c. Stable Disease
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since
the treatment started.
d. Progressive Disease (PD)
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements for 
measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest disease
measurement recorded since thestart oftreatment, ortheappearance of
one or morenew lesions.
10.3.[ADDRESS_119397] Assessment Response
Each patient willbeclassified according totheir “best response” forthepurposes 
ofanalysis oftreatment effect. Best response isdetermined fromthesequence
ofthe objective statuses descri bed in Table [ADDRESS_119398] oma.
10.4.2 The following criteria will be used toreport MIBGresponse by[CONTACT_107449]:
Complete Response: Complete resolution of all MIBG positive 
lesions
Partial Response :Resolutio n of at least one MIBGpositive
lesion, with persistence of ot her MIBG positive lesions.
Stable Disease: No chang e in MI BG scan innumber of
positive lesions (includes patients who havesamenumber of
positive lesions but decreased density).
Progressive Disease: Development ofnewMIBG positive lesions.
10.4.3 Theresponse ofMIBGlesions willbeassesse dusingtheCurie scale asoutlined 
below.
The body is divided into 9anatomic sectors forosteomedullar ylesions, with
a 10thgeneral sector allocate dforanyextra -osseous lesion visible onMIBG
scan. In each region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension 
score is graded as:
0 = no site per segment,
1 = 1 site per segment,
2= more than one site per segment,
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 83

3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).
The absolute score isobtaine d by [CONTACT_107450].
See diagram of sectors below:
Therelative scoreis calculated by[CONTACT_107451]-treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient iscalculated ateach response assessment compared tobaseline and 
classified as below:
1. Complete response: allareas ofuptake onMIBGscan completely resolved.

3. Stable diseas e: Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakl y but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).
4. Progressive diseas e: New lesions on MIBG scan
10.4.[ADDRESS_119399] Response Assessment
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the 
purposes of analysis oftreatment effect. Best response isdetermined fromthe
sequence ofthe objective statutes described in Table 3 inSection 10.7.
10.5 Response Criteria for the Bone Marrow in Neuroblastoma Patients

The investigator orsitestaff isresponsible fordetecting, documenting andreporting even ts
that meet thedefinition ofanAE or SAE.
AEs will becollected fromthestartofprotocol therapy and until [ADDRESS_119406] 
dose ofprotocoltherapy.
SAEs willbecollected overthesametimeperiod as stated above forAEs.From the time 
a patient consents to participate in and completes the study, allSAEs assessed asrelated 
tostudyparticipation (e.g., study treatment, protoco l-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or 
change in existing therapy)  will be reported promptly to [COMPANY_001] as indicated in Section 
11.8.
Medical occurrences that beginprior tothestart ofprotocol therapy butafter obtaining 
informed consent shoul d be recorded on theMedical History/Current Medical Conditions 
section oftheeCRF.
Anynew primary cance rmust berecorde d as an SAEand will be recorde dfromthetime a

All SAEs will be recorded and reported to [COMPANY_001] andCOG w ithin 24 hours, as indicated 
in Section 11.8.
Investigators arenotobligated toactively seek AEs orSAEs informer study participants.
However, ifthe investigator learns ofanySAE, including adeath, atanytime after a patient
hasbeendischarged fromthestudy ,andhe/she considers the eventreasonably related tothe
studytreatment orstudyparticipation, theinvestigator should promptly notify [COMPANY_001] and
COG .
11.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is anyuntoward medical occurrence in a patient orclinical investigation patien t, 
temporally associated with the useof amedicinal product, whether or notconsidered related
tothemedicinal product. CTCAEcriteria version 4.0will be used tograde severity 
of adverse events.
Note: An AE cantherefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding) ,symptom , ordiseas e(new orexacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product
Events meeting the definition of an AE includ e:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinalysis)
orother safetyassessments (e.g.,ECGs, radiol ogical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worse n from baseline, and felt to beclinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
Newconditions detected ordiagnosed after studytreatment administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, symptoms , ortheclinical sequelae of a suspected overdose ofeither study 
treatment or aconc omitan tmedication. (Overdose persewillnot be reported as an
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possibl esuicidal/sel f-
harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae .)
"Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharm acological action" persewillnot be
reported as anAE orSAE. However, thesigns and symptom s and/or clinical sequelae 
resultin g from lack of efficacy will be reported if they  fulfil the definition of an AE 
or SAE.
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 89
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
Events that donotmeet the definition ofanAEinclude:
 Anyclinically significant abnormal laboratory findings orother abnormal safety 
assessments thatareassociated with theunderlying disease, unless judged by[CONTACT_107458] t’s condition.
 Thedisease/disorder beingstudied, orexpected progression, signs, orsymptoms of
thedisease/disorder beingstudied, unless moresevere than expected forthe patien t’s 
condition.
 Medical orsurgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy ,appendectomy); the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE.
 Situations wher eanuntoward medical occurrence didnotoccur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
 Anticipated da y-to-da y fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
11.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
Refer toSection 11.8 forreporting requirements including thewithin 24hour timelimit 
for all SAEs as defined below.
If aneventisnotanAEperSection 11.1 then itcannot be an SAEeven ifserious conditions
aremet(e.g.,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107358]/symptom s of thedisease under study, death due to 
progression of disease, etc) .
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life -threatening
NOTE: The term 'life-threatening' inthedefinition of'serious' refers to an ev ent in 
which thepatient wasatrisk ofdeath atthetime of the event . It does not refer t oan
event, which hypothetically migh thave caused death, if it were more severe.
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23916]: Ingeneral, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107359] 
(usually involving atleast anovernig htstay) at thehospi[INVESTIGATOR_107360]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the
physician’s office or out- patient setting. Complications that occur during
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107361]. If a complication prolongs hosp italization orfulfills any
other seriou scriteria, the event isserious. When indoubt asto whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107362] -existing condition that didnot worsen 
from ba seline is not considered an AE.
 Results in disability/incapacity
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct norma llife functions. This definition is notintended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting , diarrhea, influenza, or accidental traum a (e.g.sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruptio n.
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Medical orscientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is
appropriate inother situations, such asimportant medical events that maynot be
immediately life-threatening orresult indeath orhospi[INVESTIGATOR_107363] 90

thepatient ormayrequire medical orsurgical intervention toprevent one of theother
outcomes listed intheabov edefinition. These should alsobe considered serious.
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant c ancers, intensive treatment inan
emergenc y room or at home forallergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or
convulsions thatdonot result inhospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
 All events of possible dru g-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT >3xUL Nandbilirubi n > 1. 5x ULN (>35% of total bilirubin is direct) or ALT
>3xUL N andINR>1.5, ifINRmeasured termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR 
measurement isnot required andthethreshold valuestated willnotapply to patien ts 
receiving anticoagulants).
NOTE: Bilirubin fractionation isperformed iftestin g is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presenc eof detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating 
direct bilirubi nelevations and suggesting liver injury . If testing isunavailable 
and apatient meets the criterion oftotal bilirubin 2xULN, then theevent isstill 
reported asanSAE. IfINR isobtained, include values ontheSAEform . INR 
elevations >1.[ADDRESS_119407] severe liver injur y.
11.3 Method of Dete cting AEs andSAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias whendetectin gAEs and/or SAEs .Open-ended 
andnon-leading verbal questioning ofthepatien tisthepreferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence. Appropriate questions includ e:
 “How are you feeling?” or “How does your child seem to feel?”
 “Have youhadany(other) medical problem ssince your lastvisit/contact?” or
 “Has your child hadany(other) medical problems orseem to actdifferently in 
any way since his/her last visit/contact?”
 “Have youtaken any new medicines, other than those provided inthis study, 
since your lastvisit/contact?” or“Has your child needed totake anymedicines,
other than those provided in this study, since his/her last visit/contact?”
11.4 Disease -Related Events and/or Disease- Relate dOutcome sNotQualifyin g asSAEs
An event which ispart of thenatural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease 
progression orhospi[INVESTIGATOR_107364]) doesnotneed to be reported as an
SAE. Death due to diseas eunder study is to be recorde d on theDeath eCRFform. However,
iftheunderlyin gdisease (i.e., progression) isgreater than that whic hwould normally be
expected forthe patien t, or ifthe investigator considers that there was a causal 
relationship between treatment with study medication(s) or protocol design/procedures and 
the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.
11.5 R ecording ofAEs andSAEs
When anAE/SAE occurs, it is theresponsibility oftheinvestigator torevie w all 
documentation (e.g.,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107365], laboratory, anddiagnostics reports) relative to
theevent. The investigator willthen record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in 
the appropriate data collection tool.
It is not acceptable fortheinvestigator tosend photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_107366] t’smedical 
records to[COMPANY_001] orCOG in lieu of completion ofthe[COMPANY_001] AE/SAE data collection
tool. However, theremay beinstances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_107367] 91
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
requested by[CONTACT_107459]. In thisinstance ,allpatien tidentifiers, with theexception
of thepatient numbe r(both COG and [COMPANY_001] studynumbers),will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_107368] .
The investigator willattem pt toestablish adiagnosis oftheevent based on signs, symptoms ,
and/or other clinical information. Insuch cases, thediagnosis will be documented as the 
AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.
11.6 E valuating AEs and SAEs
11.6.1 Assessment of Intensity
Theinvestigator will make anassessment of intensit yforeach AEand SAE
reported during the study and will assign it to one of the following categories:
Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_11581] t, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with everyday activities.
Moderate: Anevent that is sufficiently discomfortin g to interfere with normal 
everyday activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities
An AE that is assesse dassevere willnot be confuse d with anSAE.Severit y is a 
category utilize d for ratingthe intensit y of an event,and both AEsandSAE scan 
beassessed assevere. Anevent isdefined as‘serious’ when itmeets atleast one 
of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
11.6.2 Assessment of Causality
Theinvestigator isobligated toassess therelationship between study treatment and
theoccurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility" ismeant to conve y that 
there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a
relationship cannot beruled out. The investigator will useclinica l judgment to
determine therelationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and thetemporal
relationship oftheevent tothe study treatment willbe considered and investigated.
The investigator will alsoconsult theInvestigator Brochure (IB)and/or Product
Information, for marketed products, inthe determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE theinvestigator mustdocumen t in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
11.7 Follo w-up of AEs and SAEs
After theinitial AE/SAE report, theinvestigator isrequired toproactively follow each 
patient atsubsequent visits/contacts. AllAEs andSAEswill be followed until resolution, 
until thecondition stabilizes, until theevent isotherwise explained, oruntil thepatient is lost 
to follo w-up.
Theinvestigator isobligated toperfor m or arrange fortheconduct ofsupplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_107460]/or causalit y oftheAE or SAE.The inves tigator isobligated 
toassist. This mayinclude additional laboratory testsor investigations, histopathological 
examinations orconsultation with other health care professionals. If a patient dies during
participation inthestudy or durin g a recognized follo w-up period, the investigator will 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 92

provide [COMPANY_001] with acopy ofany pos t-mortem findings, including histopathology.
New or updated informatio nwill be recorded intheoriginally complete ddata collection tool.
Theinvestigator will submit anyupdated SAEdata to[COMPANY_001] within thedesignated 
reporting time frames
11.8 Prompt Reporting ofSAEs to[COMPANY_001] and COG
Once theinvestigator determines that anevent meet stheprotocol definition of an SAE, 
theSAEwill bereported to [COMPANY_001] andCOG within 24 hours .Anyfollo w-up information 
on a previously reported SAEwillalso be reported to [COMPANY_001] andCOGwithin 24 hour s. If 
theinvestigator does nothaveallinformation regardin ganSAE, he/she will notwait to 
receive additional information before notifyin g [COMPANY_001] and COG oftheevent and 
completing theappropriat edata collection tool. Theinvestigator will always provid ean 
assessment ofcausality at thetime oftheinitial report asdescribed inSection 11.6.2 , 
Assessment of Causality.
Theprimar ymechanis mforreporting SAEs to[COMPANY_001] andCOG wil l be the electronic data

13.6 APPENDIX IV: URINE PROTEIN TOCREATININE (UPC) RATIO
Clinical Meaning of UPC
There isagoodcorrelatio nbetween theratio ofurine protein tourine creatinine concentrations (UPC )in 
arando murine sampl eandtheamount ofprotein excreted in a 24-hour urine collection period.48Thus, 
the UPC ratio from a single random urine sampl e permits estimation ofthe 24-hour urine protein excretion.
Thecreatinine excretion isfairly constant throughout thedayregardless ofchanges inurine flow rate:
Men excrete 20 mg to 25 mg of creatinine/kg of body weight/day
Women excrete 15mgto20mgofcreatinine/kg ofbody weight/day
Normal protein excretion is <100 mg to 150 mg per 24 hours.
The UPC ratio is roughly equal to the 2 4-hour urine protein excretion in g/day
Calculating UPC Ratio
UPCratio =(Urine protei n[mg/dL]) /(urine creatinine [mg/dL]) =numerically equivalent tograms(g)
protein excreted in urine over [ADDRESS_119413] e: If a patient has a urine protein concentration of 90 mg/d Landurine creatinine concentration of
30 mg/dL,
then UPC ratio = 90(mg/dL )= 3
30(mg/dL)
UPC ratio of 3 correl atesto rou ghly 3g of protein excretion in a 24 -hour period.
Units for UPC ratio
UPC is a calculated ratio.Theguidelines intheprotocol arebased onhavin gurine protein andurine
creatinine measured in the same units (e.g., mg/dL). The International System of Un its (SI) units for urine 
protein andurine creatinin eare not thesame ,sothese must be converte d tomg/d Lbefore calculating the 
ratio. For reference, the conversion factors forcommonl yused units forprotei n and creatinine are provided 
below.
Starting units Conversion to mg/dL
Protein (g/L) Multiply by 100
Creatinine (mol/L) Divide by 88.4
Creatinine (mmol/L) Multiply by 11.3

Experimental	Design	Schema	Revised	Text:
Pazopanib will be administered orally once dailyas a tablet at 450 mg/m2/dose or as a powder in suspension
at 225 mg/m2/dose . The maximu mtolerated dose (MTD) fortablets was 450mg/m2/dose as determined by
[CONTACT_107411]0815, theCOG Phase I study, while thedose fororal suspension of225 mg/m2/dose exceeds the
protocol- specified MTD of160 mg/m2/dose established inthat study .The225 mg/m2/dose is where two 
isolated laboratory -defined dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The maximu mdose to be 
administered daily for tablets is [ADDRESS_119430] 6 patients enrolled who receiv e suspension will be expecte d to complete extended pharmacokinetic
(PK)sampling (Section 7.3.2) inorder toobtain PKandsafetydata. These data will be reviewed prior to
further enrollment ofpatients requiring suspension todetermine if225 mg/m2/dose is tolerated and PK
exposur e is similar toexposure in adults associated with clinica lefficacy . Ifthe225 mg/m2/dose isnot
tolerated (≥2dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 6 evaluable patients), thedose for patients who require 
suspension may be reduced to 160 mg/ m2/dose.

CECs, monocytes, VEGF, and sVEGF R-2 were consistently modulated by [CONTACT_3148]. In this study, changes in 
CECs and monocytes rather than plasma markers differed between the patients with clinical benefit andthose
with progressive disease.39 Inpediatric patients with refractory solid tumors treated with the VEGF

Section	4.4	Permitted	Medications –Use	with	Caution,	Added	Text:
Results from drug-drug interaction studies conducted in subjects with cancer suggest that pazopanib has no 
effect onthemetabolis m of S- warfarin. Hemorrhagic events, however, have been repor tedinclinical 
studies with pazopanib; therefore, pazopanib should be used with caution in subjects with increased risk of 
severe bleedin g or whoarebenefitting from treatmen tand require theinitiation ofconcomitant 
anticoagulant therapy (e.g.,warfarin orits derivatives, lowmolecular weigh theparin, unfractionated hepari n)

doses of S- warfarin at thetime ofscreening. Subjects taking concomitant anticoagulant therapy should be
monitored regularly forchange s inrelevant coagulation parameters asclinically indicated, as well as for any 
clinical bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].
Section	4.5.4	Added	Text:
Concomitant administration of pazopanib with esomeprazole decreases the bioavailability of pazopanib by 
40% (AUC and Cmax), and co -administration of pazopanib with medicines that increase gastric pH should be 
avoided. Co-administration of pazopanib with medicines that increase gastric pH isPROHIBITE D from 
[ADDRESS_119441] dose of pazopanib until after the final PK blood sample is collected on Day 15 
± 1 day of Cycle 1. After this, if the concomitant use of a proto n-pump inhibitor (PPI) is medically necessary, 
it is recommended that the dose of pazopanib be taken without food once daily in the evening concomitantly 
with the PPI(Section 4.8). If the concomitant administration of an H2-receptor antagonist is medically 
necessary, pazopanib should be taken without food at least [ADDRESS_119442] 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
administration of short -acting antacids.

Section 2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Phase II Trial, Previous Text:
This is a two- stage open label phase II trialofpazopanib inchildren, adolescents andyoungadults with recurrent 
or refractory solid tumo rs. Tumors of prima ry interest are rhabdomyosarcoma , non-
rhabdomyosarcoma tous softtissue sarcoma (includin gsynovia lsarcoma ,alveolar softpart sarco maand 
desmoplastic smallround celltumor) andEwin g sarcoma. Tumors of seconda ry interest inclu de hepatoblastoma, 
neuroblastoma (measurable and evaluable), andosteosarcoma.
Eligible patients will recei ve pazopanib daily as an oral tablet (450 mg/m2/dose ) or as a powde r for suspension
(225 mg/m2/dose) in 28 daycycles. Themaxim umdose to be administered daily for tablets is
800 m g and for suspension 400 mg. Patients wi ll be closely monitored with clinical and laboratory
observations foradverse effec ts.Response will be evaluated using appropriate imagi ng studies after the
2ndcycle of pazopanib, after the4thcycle, andthen every3rdcycle thereafter (baseline, prior to Cy cle3, prior
toCycle 5, prior to Cycle 8,prior to Cycle 11,etc). In theabsence ofsever etoxicity orprogressive disease, 
patients may continue receiving pazopanib.
This study will dose patients requiring suspension with a startin g dose of 225 mg/m2/dose.. The previously -defined
suspension MTD of 160 mg/m2/dose may resul t in suboptima lexposure todemonstrate efficacy. Two of 4
patients intheprior Phase I study demonstrated DLT s in the formof isolated and reversible Grad e 3 elevations 
in ALT at 225 mg/m2/dose. Given that this toxicity was isolated and reversible, thefirst 6patients receiving
suspension will be dosed at225 mg/m2/doseandassessed forfirst-cycle DLTs befor econtinui ng to enroll
additional patients requiring suspension. If two or more of 6 patients demonstrate DLT, then thedose may be de-
escalated to theprevious ly-defined MTD of 160 mg/m2/dose.
Thefirst6subjects who require thesuspension formulation willhaveextende d PK sampling with blood samples

Section 2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Phase II Trial, Revised Text:
This is a two- stageopen label phase II trial ofpazopani b inchildren, adolescents andyoun g adults with recurrent 
or refractory solid tumors . Tumors of primar y interest are rhabdomyosarcoma, non-
rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcom a(includin gsynovial sarcoma, alveolarsoft part sarcom aand 
desmoplastic small round cell tumor) andEwin gsarcoma/peripheral PNET. Tumors ofsecondary interest
include hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma (measurable and evaluable), and osteosarcoma.
Each tumor type defines a cohort resulting in7total cohorts. The first stage of the study involves enrolling an 
initial 10patients intoeach cohort. The response ratewillbedetermined foreach cohort after thetarget enrollment
of [ADDRESS_119466] 10
evaluable patients in a cohort, an additional 10patients will beenrolled into thatcohort inthesecond stage of
study . Thus, forcohort(s) with one or moreconfirmed responses inthefirst stage ofstudy , atotalof20 patients 
will be enrolled and evaluated to determine efficacy.
Eligible patients will receiv e pazopanib monotherapy. Pazopanib will bedosed daily as an oraltablet (450 
mg/m2/dose, maximu m 800 mg) or as a powder fororalsuspension (225 mg/m2/dose, maximu m 400 mg) in 28 
day cycles.
The MTD forpazopani btablets was 450 mg/m2/dose asdetermined by[CONTACT_107411]0815/PZP114411, theCOG 
Phase I study inchildren with relapsed orrefractory solid tumors. Forthepowder suspension formulation, the 
selected startin gdose ishighe rthan theprotoco l-defined MTD of 160mg/m2/doseestablished inADVL0815. This 
decision is driven by [CONTACT_107412] 160 mg/m2/dose may result in exposure that is suboptimal to
demonstrate efficacy andthat only twoisolated andreversible laboratory -defined DLTs were observed at the 
225 mg/ m2/dose.
The first patients who areenrolled toreceiv epazopani baspowder suspension at225mg/m2/dose daily willbe 
closely monitored forsafetyand for the occurrenc e of dose-limiting toxicit y durin g the first cycle (28 days) of 
therapy. Patients who either receiv e 225 mg/m2/dose daily for at least 24 days(85% ofthedose fora 28- day 
cycle with powder suspension at 225mg/m2/dose) orarewithdrawn fromdosing due to on e ormoreprotoco l-
defined dose-limiting toxicities (Section 5.1) during the first cycle will be considered evaluable for the purpose of 
this safety review. Six evaluable patients are required.
The first patients enrolled toreceive powder suspension at225 mg/m2/dose will also beexpected tocomplete 
extended PKsampling (Section 7.3.2) with blood sample scollected prior to dosing, and 30 m in, 1, 2, 4, 6, and8
hours after thepazopani bdose onDay 1 and Day 15 ± 1 day of Cycle 1(with nopazopanib dose
modif ication or adjustment in the 10 days before Cycle 1 Day 15 sample collection). Patients who can provide 
adequate blood samples forthe2scheduled extende d PK collections will beconsidered to be evaluable 
patients for the purpose of this PK analysis, and PK data are required from [ADDRESS_119467] 6patients fails toprovide blood samples asspecified intheprotocol or if it is know nthatforsome reason
apatient’s collecte dblood sample(s) cannot beanalyzed ,that patient will bedetermined to be non- evaluable 
for this analysis, and one or more additional patients will be enrolled for treatment with pazopanib as powder 
suspension for the purpose of obtaining the extended PK samples.
Because patients receiving thepowder suspension enrolled inthesafetyreview group may be different from those 
in the PK analysis group, enrollment onto powder suspensi on may follow several different paths:
If ≥ 2 outof 6 evaluable patients havedose-limitin gtoxicities (DLT andasdefined in 
Section 5.1) within the first cycle, then enrollment onto 225 mg/m2/dose pazopanib will be 
halted. Subsequent newpatients willbeenrolled atthe160mg/m2/dose level until 6 evaluable
patients fromthisdose group are available forthesafety review and6 patients are available 
[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 140
Amended Protocol Version 0 5 Clean Protocol No. VEG116731
for PK analysis at 160 mg/ m2/dose.
If 6PKevaluable patients areenrolled prior to enrollment of6patients whoareevaluable for 
the safety review, the extended PK sample collection may be suspended.
If < [ADDRESS_119468] cycle in 6 patients evaluable forsafety at 225

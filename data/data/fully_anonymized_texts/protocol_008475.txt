 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Summary  
 
This protocol is a randomized phase II trial of maintenance chemotherapy versus consolidative 
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus maintenance chemotherapy for patients with 
Stage IV non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The core hypothesis to be tested is that the use 
of cons olidative SBRT followed by [CONTACT_572482] 6 metastatic sites (primary + 5) will improve progression free survival (PFS) compared 
to maintenance chemotherapy alone.  
 
Prior to accrual on the trial, patients wi th Stage IV NSCLC will be treated with standard first -line 
chemotherapy.  Patients who achieve a partial response or stable disease by [CONTACT_572483] (followed by 
[CONTACT_572484]’s discretion). Choices of first line and 
maintenance chemotherapy will be determined by [CONTACT_572485].  Preliminary data from an earlier phase II single arm study with SBRT plus 
Tarceva demonstrated significant PFS and OS with limited toxicity in patients with limited 
metastatic stage IV NSCLC who progressed through first line platinum doublet chemo therapy 
when compared to historical findings (unpublished data). The goal of the former study was to 
validate the potential role of cytoreduction in promoting progression free survival.   
 
The primary endpoint of the current proposed study is progression f ree survival. The estimated 
progression free survival is [ADDRESS_751616] with an overall sample size of 36 patients (18 patients in the 
maintenance chemotherapy arm and 18 patients in the SBRT arm) achieves 80% power at a 
10% significance level to de tect a hazard ratio of 0.4000 when the median progression -free 
survival (PFS) times are 4 and  10 months in the maintenance group and SBRT treated group, 
respectively. Patients will be accrued within 24 months with a follow -up period of 12 months 
after the end of the accrual period.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer -related mortality. An estimated 228,190 new cases of 
lung cancer are expected in 2013 in the [LOCATION_002] with an estimate of approximately 
160,000 deaths [1].  While advances in local and systemic therapy have been achieved in 
recent years, there remains a great need for improvement in clinical management. 
Approximately two -thirds of patients present  with advanced stage non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and often are treated with chemotherapy alone [2]. It remains a poorly controlled and 
fatal dise ase, with estimates of median survival of [ADDRESS_751617] line chemotherapy 
with a platinum doublet [3].  
 
The principle of oligometastases was well popularized in 1995 by [CONTACT_572486] a step -wise manner, initially with limited 
metastases followed by [CONTACT_572487]. Early on, met astases may be 
limited in number and location based on interaction of tumor cells with target organs in a “seed 
and soil” pattern [4,5]. With impr ovements in imaging, including PET/CT and MRI, identification 
of isolated metastatic deposits is accomplished with higher sensitivity and specificity than ever 
before. A significantly greater proportion of patients may be identified early in the metastatic  
spectrum and offered potentially curative local treatment, creating a new paradigm in the 
management of limited volume metastatic NSCLC. The traditional groupi[INVESTIGATOR_572446].  
 
Support for the benefit provided by [CONTACT_572488]. Patients treated with surgical resection of hepatic, pulmonary, or adrenal 
metastases have had improved rates of survival with resection [6-8]. Furthermore,  
advancements in systemic therapy may convert a greater proportion of patients with widely 
metastatic disease to a limited volume metastatic state. With current first line platinum doublet 
chemotherapy, up to 70 -80% of patients achieve either a partial res ponse or stable disease [9]. 
In those pa tients who do show progression of disease, up to 65% progress only at sites present 
prior to the start of first line chemotherapy [10]. This represents a large cohort of patients who 
may be candidates for early treatment of oligometastatic disease.  
 
Systemic maintenance therapy with targeted and cytotoxic age nts has now shown statistically 
significant benefits in both progression free and overall survival. By [CONTACT_572489] -
invasive locally ablative stereotactic therapy prior to maintenance chemotherapy there is the 
potential for further benefits in PFS and/or OS. Stereotactic radiotherapy has the advantage 
over surgical metastectomy in that there is minimal toxicity with quicker recovery and limited 
delay in initiation of maintenance chemotherapy.

doublet chemotherapy (Table 1). Drugs used for maintenan ce chemotherapy can be considered 
either cytotoxic or biologic and include Docetaxel, Pemetrexed, Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Gemcitabine, 
and Bevacizumab. Maintenance chemotherapy can be given as continuation maintenance, 
utilizing one or more first line drugs,  or as switch maintenance, utilizing a previously unused 
 drug. A recent meta -analysis has proven the benefit of switch maintenance over continuation 
maintenance in both overall survival and progression free survival in the stage IV NSCLC 
population [11]. Unfortunately, these drugs alone provide modest gains and oblige patients to 
indefinite chemotherapy with their associated toxicities.

1.2 Rationale for Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)  
 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment paradigm defined in the 
American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology guidelines as a “treatment method to 
deliver a high dose of radiation to the target, utilizing either a singl e dose or a small number of 
fractions with a high degree of precision within the body” [12]. 
 
SBRT allows the delivery of ablative treatment doses using highly conformal radiotherapy to an 
increasing number of sites in the body. By [CONTACT_572490] a short course of therapy, 
patients are not subjected to pr olonged treatment times that may compromise quality of life.  
Treatment is delivered non -invasively and with an increasing body of data supporting its 
tolerability with limited toxicity.  
 
To date, there have been no successful, prospective randomized studies which examine the 
role of locally aggressive therapy in limited volume stage IV NSCLC. The NCCTG initiated a 
randomized phase III trial in patients with stage IV NSCLC, treating 1 to 3 sites of metastatic 
disease following 4 -6 cycles of systemic therapy. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was not used. 
Patients were treated with traditional fractionation to 60 Gy in 30 fractions or 45 Gy in 15 
fractions. Unfortunately, this study closed due to poor accrual [13]. A second study from the 
University of Chicago randomized patients with oligometastatic NSCLC to SBRT during the third 
and fourth cycle of docetaxel/cisplatin first line chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this study also had 
difficulty with accrual and closed e arly [14].  Currently, a sin gle arm phase II trial at Wake Forest 
 University is the only SBRT study open and accruing patients with limited volume stage IV 
NSCLC [15].   
 
Preliminary data from our earlier phase II single arm study demonstrated statistically significant 
improvements in both PFS and OS in patients with Stage IV NSCLC treated with SBRT plus 
Tarceva. The patient population chosen in this study was unique, with treatment limited to 
patients who progressed through first line platinum doublet chemotherapy and with limited 
metastases. Historically, the outcomes in this population are extremely poor . Nonetheless, in 
this study progression free survival was 10.7 months with median overall survival of 20.8 
months. Furthermore, in patients tested for the EGFR mutation, 0/[ADDRESS_751619] signific ant in patients who possess the EGFR 
mutation which lends support to the notion that locally ablative radiotherapy proves effective in 
improving progression free and overall survival [16]. 
 
Retrospective data from the University of Chicago is available for patients with oligometastatic 
NSCLC treated with SBRT to [ADDRESS_751620] commonly used fractionation schedule was 50 Gy 
in 10 fractions. A total of 62 lesions were treated in 25 patients with a median of 2 lesions 
treated per patient. T he median lesion size was 2.65 cm. Treatment was well tolerated with only 
2 patients suffering Grade 3 toxicity. With a median follow -up of 14 months, the median PFS 
was 7.6 months and median OS was 22.7 months. Progressive disease was identified in 52% of  
patients following initial first -line chemotherapy. Analysis of PFS and OS in patients with 
progressive versus stable/regressive disease following first line chemotherapy showed the 
former population to possess significantly worse PFS and OS relative to t he latter. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_572447] a PFS that 
is higher than those achieved by [CONTACT_572491] [17].  
 
Further support for selection of patients with stable or partial response to first -line chemotherapy 
is available from the University of [COMPANY_002]ster. Patients with up to five sites of oligometastatic 
disease of  any histology were treated to all sites of disease with SBRT. There were 121 patients 
enrolled prospectively with 74% treated to 50 Gy in 5 fractions. Patients who achieved a 
response or stable disease to initial systemic therapy prior to SBRT showed sign ificantly higher 
rates of overall survival and freedom from distant metastases compared to those with 
progressive disease following initial systemic therapy [18]. 
 
A retrospective review of patients treated at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster compared outcomes of 
patients with stage III NSCLC treated with curative intent radiotherapy against patients with 
limited volume stage IV NSCLC who received SBRT. Oligometastases was expanded in this 
review to fewer than 8 sites of disease. Patients with stage III NSCLC were treated to an 
average dose of 60 Gy via a 3 -D conformal tec hnique with or without chemotherapy. Patients 
with limited volume metastases were treated with SBRT to a dose of 50 -60 Gy in 5 -10 fractions. 
Patients with limited volume stage IV NSCLC treated with SBRT had higher rates of 5 -year 
survival relative to patie nts with stage III NSCLC treated definitively, 14% vs 7%, respectively. 
The 5 -year survival data for Stage III patients was lower than expected in this study, however, 
the survival of patients with limited volume stage IV NSCLC is comparable to historical data of 
patients with stage III NSCLC treated definitively [19]. 
 
 The most commonly treated sites of metastatic disease with SBRT are sites within the lung and 
liver. A recent multi -institutional Phase I/II trial from the University of Colorado enrolled patients 
with 1 -3 pulmonary m etastases from a solid tumor, cumulative tumor diameter < 7 cm, and 
adequate pulmonary function (FEV1 > 1.0 L, DLCO > 40%).  The planning target volume (PTV) 
was constructed from the gross tumor volume (GTV)  by [CONTACT_451398] 5 mm radially and 10 mm 
craniocaud ally, and 7 mm radially and 15 mm craniocaudally, when using active breathing 
control and abdominal compression, respectively. In the initial phase, the SBRT dose was 
escalated from 48 Gy to 60 Gy in 3 fractions. The percent of normal lung receiving more t han 15 
Gy (V15) was restricted to less than 35%.  Dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) included acute grade 3 
lung or esophageal toxicity or any acute grade 4 toxicity. Thirty - eight patients were enrolled on 
the study, 9 patients in the Phase I portion and 29 o n Phase II, receiving 60 Gy in 3 fractions, for 
a total of 63 lesions treated. With a median follow -up of 15.4 months, the actuarial in -field local 
control at 2 years was 96% with a median overall survival of 19 months. Treatment was well 
tolerated with on ly 7.9% of the population suffering grade 3 toxicity with no grade 4 or 5 toxicity 
[20]. 
 
A second multi -institutional Phase I/II trial from the University of Colorado enrolled patients with  
1-3 liver metastases from any solid tumor, cumulative maximum tumor diamet er < [ADDRESS_751621] 700 cc of normal liver had to receive a total dose <15 Gy 
and the sum of the left and right kidney volume receiving 15 Gy had to be less than 35%. With a 
median follow -up of 16 months the 2 year actuarial in -field local control was 92% with a median 
overall survival of 20.5 months. Treatment was well tolerated with 1 patient suffering Grade 3 
soft-tissue toxicity, no grade 4 or 5 toxicity, and no instances of radiation in duced liver 
dysfunction (RILD) [21]. 
 
A recent prospective dose escalation study at the University of Chicago enrolled patients with [ADDRESS_751622] significantly longer PFS than patients with 4 to 5 metastase s. It 
is significant to note in this study that 55% of patients had a limited pattern of progression in [ADDRESS_751623] been amenable to further SBRT [22].   
 
1.3 EGFR Mutation/ ALK -Positive Mutation  
 
Activating mutations in EGFR, which occur with exon [ADDRESS_751624] been identified in up to 26% of patients with non -small cell lung cancer, most commonly in 
patients of Asian descent [23]. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with prov en efficacy include 
gefitinib and erlotinib.  Four prospective randomized trials in the Asian population and one 
randomized trial in the European population have evaluated first -line treatment with gefitinib or 
 erlotinib in EGFR -mutant NSCLC. All five tria ls have shown a significantly improved rate of 
progression free survival in patients compared to chemotherapy [24-28].  
 
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase is aberrantly activated in approximately 4% o f NSCLC, due to 
chromosomal rearrangement leading to the oncogenic fusion kinase EML4 -ALK. These patients 
present with young age of onset, minimal or absent smoking history, and adenocarcinoma 
histology. Crizotinib is an orally available small -molecule inh ibitor of ALK and c -Met receptor 
tyrosine kinase currently in clinical trials. No randomized prospective data yet exists for targeting 
with crizotinib. However, a prospective phase I clinical trial has now shown a 61% objective 
response with median progres sion free survival of 10 months in ALK positive patients with Stage 
III-IV NSCLC [29]. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_751625] to PFS.   
 
SBRT has an acceptable toxicity profile with an increasing number of sites in the body 
amenable to treatment. It has the added benefit of providing a full course of treatment within a 
few fractions, providing an alternative to a protracted course of therapy with a non -invasive 
technique.  By [CONTACT_572492].  
 
For patients with oligometastatic disease, the re exists limited effective treatment beyond second 
line chemotherapy. By [CONTACT_572493], this study will prove practice changing. 
Furthermore, it is anti cipated that short course radiotherapy will not compromise the patient ’s 
quality of life. We hope to show that the ease of delivery of short course ablative radiotherapy 
will increase the percentage of patients with stage IV NSCLC who receive consolidative  therapy 
following first line chemotherapy.  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_751626]’s discretion.  Patients 
receiving first -line erlotinib, crizotinib for EGFR mutant -positive or EML4 -ALK positive NSCLC 
will be excluded. Patients will be assessed within [ADDRESS_751627] or PET/CT. Patients with stable disease or partial 
response with oligometastatic disease, defined by [CONTACT_572494], will be 
randomized within [ADDRESS_751628] ’s discretion.  
This event will not constitute progression if the lesion is treated by [CONTACT_572495]. However, if the lesion 
is not amenable to SBRT, the patient is either unwilling to pursue further treatment or cannot 
tolerate treatment due to coexisting comorbidi ties, then progression will be deemed to have 
occurred.  
 
SBRT, in and of itself, can alter the effectiveness of imaging in determining progression vs. 
response. Imaging at [ADDRESS_751629] of SBRT with or without  
maintenance chemotherapy versus maintenance chemotherapy alone on progression free 
survival

4. SBRT DOSE AND TECHNIQUES  
 
SBRT will begin within 3 weeks after  randomization to the SBRT arm.  
 
Stereotactic treatment is the targeting, planning, and directing of treatment fields guided to a 
target based on known 3 -D coordinates related to reliable fiducial markers. This differs from 
conventional radiation therapy i n which treatment is guided by [CONTACT_572500].  Stereotactic Body Radiation 
Therapy (SBRT) in this study will be delivered with an ablative range of dose per fraction. 
Treatm ent will account for inter/intra -fractional errors with careful dosimetry that delivers an 
ablative dose to the metastatic lesion(s) while respecting normal tissue constraints.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_751639]. 
Based on location of the metastatic lesion(s), dose fractionation will be determined by [CONTACT_572501](s) while respe cting normal tissue 
constraints.  
 
Prescription Dose  
  Total Cumulative Dose Encompassing 95% of Planning Target Volume  
Number of 
Fractions  Protocol Compliant  Variation Acceptable  Deviation Unacceptable  
1 21-27 Gy  <21 Gy but ≥16 Gy  <16 Gy or >27 Gy  
3 26.5-33 Gy  <26.5 Gy but ≥24.5 Gy  <24.5 Gy or >33 Gy,  
5 30-37.5 Gy  ≥28 Gy, <30 Gy  <28 Gy  or >37.[ADDRESS_751640].  
 
If the radiation oncology physician believes that the fractionation schemes listed above for any 
lesion (primarily bulky mediastinal/hilar disease) is not achievable with normal tissue constraints, 
they can treat that site to [ADDRESS_751641] ions.  This decision will be discussed with the PI [CONTACT_403247].  Each treatment may be given once a day for 3 weeks excluding weekends/holidays, 
using standard tissue constraints and PTV coverages for traditional IMRT techniques.  
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_751642] is not established, and patients with 
metastatic disease involving the esophagus, stomach, intestines, or mesenteric lymph nodes 
will not be eligible. Patients with renal or adrenal  metastases are potentially eligible if normal 
tissue constraints are otherwise met.  
 
Cutaneous metastases are an uncommon manifestation of non -small cell lung cancer that are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_572448] [12 -14]. Patients with cutaneous metas tases will be 
 ineligible. As this may represent a group of patients with particularly poor prognosis, again this 
will be considered within any comparison with historical controls.  
 
It is well established that for palliative effect for a painful bone metast asis, a single dose of 8 Gy 
is usually as effective as 30 Gy [15]. Long term survival after bone metastasectomy has been 
reported [17].  Irradiation of non -spi[INVESTIGATOR_572449]. Metastases in major lower extremity weight -bearing bones should 
undergo surgical stabilization if there is plain film evidence of cortical erosion.  
 
Corticosteroid premedication will not be mandated, although it can be used at the discretion of  
the treating oncologist ( in which case, its use needs to be reported). Analgesic premedication to  
avoid general discomfort during long treatment durations is recommended when appropriate.  
 
4.3  Technical Factors  
 
4.3.1  Physical Factors  
Only photon (x -ray) beams produced by [CONTACT_572502] 4 -15 MV will 
be allowed. Cobalt -60 and charged particle beams (including electrons, protons, and heavier 
ions) are not allowed. Restriction of photon beam energies > [ADDRESS_751643] travel to the 
target.  
 
4.3.2  Dose Verification at Treatment  
In-vivo dosimeter measurements (e.g., diode, TLD) may be obtained for surface dose  
verification for accessible beams. This information is not required by [CONTACT_760].  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_751644] commercially available photon producing treatment units except the  
exclusion of units described in Section 4.3.1 (e.g., cobalt units and charge particle  
accelerators). Conventio nal linear accelerators and specialized linear accelerators with  
image guidance (e.g., Novalis, Trilogy, Synergy, Artiste) are allowed. These units can be used  
with conformal dose delivery or IMRT. Other specialized accelerators (e.g., the CyberKnife®  
or Tomotherapy) are allowed as long as they meet the technical specifications of the protocol.  
 
4.4 Simulation/Image Guidance  
 
4.4.1  Patient Positioning  
Patients will be positioned in a stable position that allows accurate reproducibility of the target 
between treatments.  Positions uncomfortable for the patient should be avoided so as to prevent 
uncontrolled movement during treatments.  A variety of immobilization systems may be utilized 
including stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three s ides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] 
(conforming to patients external contours) with reference to the stereotactic coordinate system.  
Patient immobilization must be reliable enough to insure that the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) 
does not deviate beyond the confines o f the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) with any 
significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  
 
At the time of simulation for patients who will receive SBRT to the lung and/or liver, the 
movement of the dome of the diaphragm (superior portion of the liver) is to be observed under 
fluoroscopy or other acceptable means to estimate respi[INVESTIGATOR_572450].  Patients will be assessed for suitability for tolerance of a 
 respi[INVESTIGATOR_572451] a breath -hold tech nique, respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344], or abdominal 
compression to limit diaphragmatic excursion during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Patients with severe lung 
disease and patients who cannot tolerate diaphragmatic or breathing control devices for other 
reasons will be treated without  them. A larger margin to account for breathing related intra-
fractional  organ movement is required.  
 
4.4.2  Image Guidance  
Isocenter or reference point port localization images should be obtained on the treatment unit  
immediately before treatment to ensure  proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e.,  
isocenter) of the simulated fields. These IGRT images can be obtained with planar kV imaging  
devices or cone -beam CT equipment. For treatment systems that use kV imaging but also allow 
EPID imaging using the  treatment beam, orthogonal images verifying the isocenter also should 
be obtained.  
 
4.5 Treatment Planning/Target volumes  
 
4.5.[ADDRESS_751645] to highlight the stomac h and 
duodenum is recommended for patients with medial liver lesions or lesions of the caudate lobe. 
Axial acquisitions will be required with spacing ≤ 3.0 mm between scans. Images will be 
transferred to the treatment planning computers.  
 
4.5.2  Target Vol umes  
The target lesion will be outlined by [CONTACT_572503] (GTV). The target will generally be drawn using appropriate windowing based on 
location of the metastatic lesion(s). [ADDRESS_751646] pulmonary windows; 
however, soft tissue windows with contrast may be used to avoid inclusion of adjacen t vessels, 
atelectasis, or mediastinal or chest wall structures within the GTV. This target will not be 
enlarged whatsoever for prophylactic treatment (including no “margin” for presumed microscopic  
extension); rather, include only abnormal CT signal consi stent with gross tumor (i.e., the GTV 
and the clinical target volume [CTV] are identical). An additional 0.[ADDRESS_751647] (craniocaudal) will be added to the GTV to constitute the PTV.  
 
For treatment to the li ver, the following structures are contoured: entire liver, each individual liver 
gross tumor volume (GTV), each kidney, and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. The planning target volume (PTV) 
is constructed to account for the positional uncertainty of the GTV during treatme nt. The PTV for 
each contoured GTV should be at least 5mm larger than the GTV in the axial plane and 1.[ADDRESS_751648] maneuvers to 
diminish motion.

radiotherapy or intensity -modulated radiotherapy technique suitable for this application with 
performance specifica tions adequate to provide proper tumor dose distribution and normal 
tissue sparing.  
 
 4.6 Dosimetry  
 
4.6.1  3D-Conformal Planning  
Three -dimensional coplanar or non -coplanar beam arrangements will be custom designed for 
each case to deliver highly conformal p rescription dose distributions. Non -opposing, non-
coplanar  beams are preferable. Generally, more beams are used for larger lesion sizes. For this 
protocol, the isocenter is defined as the common point of gantry and couch rotation for the 
treatment unit. Pr escription lines covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 60 -90% line (rather than 
95-100%); however, higher isodoses (hotspots) must be manipulated to occur within the target 
and not in adjacent normal tissue. The isocenter in stereotactic coordinates will be determined 
from system fiducials (or directly from the tumor in the case of volumetric imaging) and 
translated to the treatment record.  
 
The treatment dose plan will be made up of multiple static beams or arcs as described  
above. The plan should be normalized to a defined point corresponding closely to the  
center of mass of the PTV (COMPTV). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be the isocenter of the beam 
rotation; however, it is not a protocol requirement for this point to be the isocenter.  
Regardless, the p oint identified as COMPTV must have defined stereotactic coordinates and 
receive 100% of the normalized dose. Because the beam apertures coincide nearly directly with 
the edge of the PTV (little or no added margin), the external border of the PTV will be c overed 
by a lower isodose surface than usually used in conventional radiotherapy planning typi[INVESTIGATOR_572453] 80% but ranging from 60 -90%. The prescription dose will be delivered to the margin of 
the PTV. As such, a “hotspot” will exist within the PTV central ly at the COMPTV with a 
magnitude of prescribed dose times the reciprocal of the chosen prescription isodose line (i.e., 
60-90%).  
 
4.6.2  Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)  
IMRT is allowed in this study. The use of IMRT in this study is at the discretion of the treating 
physician. However, IMRT should be considered only when target coverage, OAR dose limits, 
or dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_572454] 3D conformal planning. In addition, IMRT plans should 
follow the same planning principles as discu ssed above for 3D conformal planning. The number 
of segments (control points) and the area of each segment should be optimized to ensure 
deliverability and avoid complex beam fluences. Ideally, the number of segments should be 
minimized (2 -3 segments per b eam should be adequate), and the area of each segment  
should be maximized (the aperture of one segment from each beam should correspond to  
the projection of the PTV along a beam’s eye view).  
 
4.6.3   Dose Calculations  
For purposes of dose planning and calcu lation of monitor units for actual treatment, this  
protocol will require tissue density heterogeneity correction.  
 
Successful treatment planning will require accomplishment of all of the following criteria:  
1. Maximum dose: The treatment plan should be creat ed such that 100% corresponds to 
the maximum dose delivered to the patient. This point must exist within the PTV.  
2. Prescription isodose: The prescription isodose surface must be ≥ 60% and < 90% of 
the maximum dose.  
3. Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage : The prescription isodose surface will be  
chosen such that 95% of the target volume (PTV) is conformally covered by [CONTACT_122923] (PTV V95%RX = 100%) and 99% of the target volume 
(PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of the prescription dose (PTV V90%RX > 99%).  
 
  
4.7 Normal Tissue Dose Constraints  
In accordance with the prior Phase I studies [7, 8], certain normal tissue dose constraints must 
be respected.  
 
The possibility that SBRT -induced fibrosis might cause occlusion of large central airways, thus 
impeding ventilation distal to the occlusion has been well considered. [22] An adjustment to the 
fractionation scheme may be made if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_572455], the 
following conditions apply: (1) the location of a lung lesion is close enough to a large proximal 
bronchial airway such that occlusion might occur, and (2) compromised ventilation to the 
segment(s) of lung potentially affecte d would cause clinically significant adverse consequences.  
 
The same special condition applies in the setting of a patient whose primary lung disease has 
not been irradiated previously but is present as a PET -positive site of disease, often in proximity 
to mediastinal structures which is a dose -limiting concern.  These patients will be considered by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a case -by-case basis.

5.1 Erlotinib  (Tarceva®)  
 
5.1.1  Formulation  
 
The pharmaceutical p reparations of Tarceva® are formulations containing the hydrochloride salt.  
Tarceva® is supplied as tablets containing erlotinib hydrochloride equivalent to 150 mg, 100 mg, 
and 25 mg of erlotinib.  All tablets are round, white, film -coated, bi -convex tabl ets without 
markings.  Additional information regarding Tarceva® can be found in the Package Insert. 
Tarceva® tablets are supplied in blue -white, high -density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles of 30 
tablets each.   
 
5.1.2  Storage and Handling  
 
Tarceva® tablets s hould be stored between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).  
 
5.1.3  Administration  
 
Tarceva® tablets should be taken at approximately the same time of day.  Each Tarceva® dose 
is to be taken with up to 200 mL (~ 1 cup or 8 oz) of water, and should be taken [ADDRESS_751653] be taken at one time.  If the patient vomits after taking the tablet(s), the 
dose is replaced only if the tablet(s) can actual ly be seen and counted.  
 
5.1.4  Potential Drug -Drug Interactions   
 
Erlotinib is both protein bound (92% to 95% in humans) and metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_097]3A4 
and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, and in the lungs by [CONTACT_097]1A1.  A potential for drug -drug 
intera ction exists when erlotinib is co -administered with drugs that are highly protein bound or 
that are CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors/inducers.   
 
For patients who are being concomitantly treated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a dose 
reduction should be consid ered in the presence of severe adverse events.  For patients who are 
being concomitantly treated with a potent CYP3A4 inducer, alternative treatments that lack 
potent CYP3A4 -inducing properties should be considered.  
 
Common CYP3A4 inhibitors include but ar e not limited to  Amiodarone , Cannabinoids  
Miconazole , Erythromycin, Fluconazole,  Norfloxacin , Fluoxetine , Omeprazole (slight), Quinine,  
Ritonavir , Indinavir , Ketoconazole, and  Metronidazole . Common CYP3A4 inducers include but 
are not limited to Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Dexamethasone, Rifabutin, Ethosuximide, Rifampin, 
Phenobarbital, and  Phenytoin . 
 
In addition, altered coagulation parameters and bleeding have been reported in patients 
receiving erlotinib alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic  agents and 
concomitant warfarin -derivative anticoagulants.  The mechanism for these alterations is still 
unknown.  When warfarin is  coadministered  with erlotinib (anytime after Day 5), international 
 normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time should be cl osely monitored and the anticoagulant 
dose should be a djusted as clinically indicated.  
 
5.2 Pemetrexed  (ALIMTA)  
 
5.2.1 Formulation  
 
ALIMTA is a white to either light -yellow or green -yellow lyophilized powder available in sterile 
single -use vials containing  100 mg or 500 mg pemetrexed. Each 500 -mg vial of ALIMTA 
contains pemetrexed disodium equivalent to 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg of mannitol. 
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH.  
 
5.2.2 Storage and Handling  
 
ALIMTA, p emetrexed for injection, should be stored at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 -
30°C (59 -86°F).  
 
5.2.3 Administration  
 
The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 
[ADDRESS_751654] dose of ALIMTA; and dosing should continue during the full course of therapy and for [ADDRESS_751655] also receive one (1) intramuscular injection of 
vitamin B12 during the week preceding the first dose of ALIMTA and every [ADDRESS_751656] commonly used dose of oral folic acid in clinical trials was 400 mcg  
 
5.2.4 Potential Drug -Drug Interactions   
 
ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and  tubular 
secretion. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result  in delayed  clearance of 
ALIMTA. Concomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted   (e.g., 
probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA.  Although ibuprofen (400 
mg qid) can be administered with ALIMTA in pa tients with normal  renal function (creatinine 
clearance ≥80 mL/min), caution should be used when administering  ibuprofen concurrently with 
ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 
mL/min). Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency  should avoid taking NSAIDs with 
short elimination half -lives for a period of [ADDRESS_751657] 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following ALIMTA administration. If 
concomitant administration of an NSAID is necessary, patients should be mo nitored closely for 
toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.  
 
 5.3 Docetaxel   
 
5.3.1 Formulation  
 
TAXOTERE (docetaxel) Injection Concentrate is a clear yellow to brownish -yellow viscous 
solution. TAXOTERE is sterile, non -pyrogenic, and is available in single -dose vials containing 
20 mg (0.5 mL) or 80 mg (2 mL) docetaxel (anhydrous). Each mL contains 40 mg docetaxel 
(anhydrous) and 1040 mg polysorbate 80. TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate is supplied in a 
single -dose vial as a sterile, pyrogen -free, non -aqueous, viscous solution with an accompanying 
sterile, non -pyrogenic, Diluent (13% ethanol in water for injection) vial.  
 
5.3.2 Storage and Handling  
Store between 2°C and 25°C (36°F and 77°F). Retain in the original package to  protect from 
bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product.  
After initial puncture, Docetaxel Injection multiple dose vials are stable for 28 days when stored 
between 2oC to 8oC and at room temperature, with or without protection from light.  
 
5.3.3 Administration  
 
Docetaxel should be administered when the neutrophil count is ≥1,500 cells/mm3. In patients 
who experienced either febrile neutropenia, neutrophil < 500 cells /mm3 for more than one 
week, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactio ns or severe peripheral neuropathy during 
docetaxeltherapy, the dose of docetaxel should be reduced from 100mg/m2 to 75mg/m2 and/or 
from 75 to 60mg/m2. If the patient continues to experience these reactions at 60mg/m2, the 
treatment should be discontinued.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_751658] shown that the metabolism of docetaxel 
may be modified by [CONTACT_23622], inhibit, or are 
metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4.  In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel 
increased 2.2 -fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant  
use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel 
and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection, close 
monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be co nsidered if systemic 
administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided  
 
5.4 Gemcitabine   
 
5.4.1 Formulation  
 
Gemzar (gemcitabine for injection, USP) is a white to off -white lyophilized powder available in 
sterile single -use vials containing 20 0 mg or 1 g gemcitabine. Gemzar (gemcitabine for injection, 
USP), is available in sterile single -use vials individually packaged in a carton containing: 200 mg 
white to off -white, lyophilized powder in a 10 -mL size sterile single -use vial - 1 g white to of f-
white, lyophilized powder in a 50 -mL size sterile single -use vial .  
 
5.4.2 Storage and Handling  
  
Unopened vials of Gemzar are stable until the expi[INVESTIGATOR_572457] 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) a nd that allows for excursions 
between 15° and 30°C (59° and 86°F).  
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_751659] been investigated and the optimum schedule has not been determined 
(see Clinical Studies (14.3)) Withthe [ADDRESS_751660] ered 
intravenously at 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. With 
the 3 -week schedule, Gemzar should be administered intravenously at 1250 mg/m2 over [ADDRESS_751661] been conducted.  
 
5.5 Bevacizumab  
 
5.5.1 Formulation  
 
Bevacizumab is available in 100 mg/4 mL single use vial (3)  and 400 mg/[ADDRESS_751662] be refrigerated at 2°C –8°C (36°F –46°F). Avastin vials should be protected 
from light. Store in the original carton until time of use.  DO NOT FREEZE. DO NOT SHAKE.  
Diluted Avastin solutions for infusion may be stored at 2°C –8°C (36°F –46°F) for up to 8 hours  
 
5.5.3 Administration  
 
Avastin should be diluted for infusion using aseptic technique. Withdraw the necessary amount 
of Avastin to obtain the required dose and dilute in a total volume of 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP.  Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no 
preservatives. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
Avastin infusions should not be administered or mixed with dextrose solution. DO NOT 
ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS. ADMINISTER ONLY AS AN IV SOLUTION. Stop 
infusion if a severe adverse reaction occurs and administer appropriate medical therapy  
 
5.5.4 Potential Drug -Drug Interactions   
If used along with chemotherapy drugs known as anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin 
(Adriamycin), daunorubicin (Cerubidine, Daunomycin), epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] (Ellence), or mitoxantrone 
(Novantrone), this drug may increase the risk of congestive heart failure. Bevacizumab may 
cause irinotecan (Camptosar) to stay i n the body longer, and may raise your risk of severe 
diarrhea. Bevacizumab given with carboplatin (Paraplatin) and paclitaxel (Taxol) may cause less 
paclitaxel to stay in the body. This may keep paclitaxel from working as it should. Any drugs or 
supplement s that interfere with blood clotting can raise the risk of bleeding during treatment with 
bevacizumab.

Patients should be discontinued from the study in the following instances:  
a. Inability to tolerate maintenance chemotherapy at prescribed dosing.  
b. Disease Progression on maintenance chemotherapy. If the patient develops only a 
limited number of new discrete lesions potentially suitable for eradication with SBRT, 
the decision to continue maintenance chemotherapy or not would be made  by [CONTACT_572504], 
tolerating maintenance chemotherapy without unacceptable toxicity, and wished to 
continue maintenance chemotherapy rather than either discontinue it or switch to 
another systemic agent. In such cases the PI [INVESTIGATOR_188739], and documentation 
will be placed in the research chart that the new sites will be aggressively treated with 
additional SBRT

8.  DATA AND SAFETY MONI TORING  
 
8.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
8.1.1 Data Management and Monitoring /Auditing  
 
Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval review of 
trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_375298]/or the CRO Multi -Center IIT 
Monitor. This review includes but is not limited to accuracy o f case report forms, protocol 
compliance, timeless and accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE management and reporting. 
Documentation of trial monitoring will be maintained along with other protocol related documents 
and will be reviewed during internal audi t.   
 
For further information, refer to the UTSW SCCC IIT Management Manual . 
 
  
Toxicity and dose escalation reviews will be performed  annually .  These reviews will be 
documented by [CONTACT_572505].  
 
The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center ( SCCC ) Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all UTSW SCCC clinical 
trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local serious adverse events a nd 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_572459] a quarterly basis.  The 
quality assurance activity for the Clinical Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical 
research documents to ensure data integrity and  regula tory compliance.  A copy of the DSMC plan  
is available upon request.  
 
The SCCC  DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of ongoing clinical 
trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as part of the DSMC to conduc t 
regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit findings are reviewed at the next available DSMC 
meeting.  In this way, frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level 
is determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of fact ors such as the phase of the study; the 
type of investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; and monitoring required  to 
ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of the study. Protocol -specific 
DSMC plans must be con sistent with these principles.   
 
Adherence to the Protocol  
 
 
Except for an emergency situation, in which proper care for the protection, safety, and well -being of 
the study subject requires alternative treatment, the study shall be conducted exactly as des cribed 
in the approved protocol.  
 Exceptions (also called single -subject exceptions or single -subject waivers): include any departure 
from IRB -approved research that is not due to an emergency  and is:  
 intentional on part of the investigator; or  
 in the investigator’s control; or  
 not intended as a systemic change (e.g., single -subject exceptions to eligibility  
[inclusion/exclusion] criteria)  
 Reporting requirement : Exceptions are non -emergency deviations that require prospective  IRB 
approval before being implemented. Call the IRB if your request is urgent. If IRB 
approval is not obtained beforehand, this constitutes a major deviation.  
 Emergency Deviations: include any departure from IRB -approved research that is necessary to:  
 avoid immediate apparent harm, or  
 protect the life or physical well -being of subjects or others  
 Reporting requirement : Emergency deviations must be promptly reported  
to the IRB within 5 working days of occurrence.  
 
 Major Deviations (also called violations): include any departure from IRB -approved research that:  
 Harmed or placed subject(s) or others at risk of harm (i.e., did or has the potential to 
negatively  affect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects or others), or  
 Affect data quality (e. g., the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or validity of the data) or 
the science of the research (e.g., the primary outcome/endpoint of the study)  
 Reporting requirement : Major deviations must be promptly reported to  
the IRB within 5 working days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_38417].  
 
  Minor Deviations: include any departure from IRB -approved research that:  
 Did not harm or place subject(s) or others at risk of harm (i.e., did not or did not have 
the potential to negatively affect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects or others), or  
 Did not affect data quality (e.g., the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or validity of the 
data) or the science of the research (e.g., the primary outcome/endpoint of the study)  
 Reporting requirement : Minor deviations should be tracked  and summarized in the progress report at 
the next IRB continuing review.  
 
8.1.2 Internal Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
 
The Radiation Oncology Clinical Research Office (CRO) reports serious adverse events 
(SAEs) to Radiation Oncology Data Safety Mo nitoring Committee (DSMC) monthly. 
These SAEs are also reported to the University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center 
(UTSW) IRB per IRB guidelines and SCC DSMC.   
 
All clinical trials are reviewed on monthly basis for enrollment. These trials are assesse d 
for safety on a continual basis throughout the life of the trial.  For investigator -initiated 
trials, all SAEs are monitored – both local and at affiliated institutions.   
 
A data safety monitoring committee including radiation oncologists not participat ing in this 
trial will be formed to review toxicity endpoints and efficacy data. In particular, this 
committee will scrutinize the grading of adverse events and the attribution to therapy 
previously assigned by [CONTACT_473].  This panel will have acce ss to basic patient 
information so as to have the ability to critically review toxicity events.  This study wil l use 
this committee to perform ongoing safety assessment at regular defined intervals defined 
in the statistics section of this protocol.  Unexp ected toxicities occurring between defined 
interim analyses points will be reported to the treating center’s IRB and also to the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Institutional Review Board.  
 
8.2 Adverse Events: Definitions and Reporting  
Adverse Events will be reported as indicated by [CONTACT_114641] (see below).   
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_751664] or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for exam ple, abnormal physical 
exam , imaging finding or clinically significant  laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, or 
disease, temporarily associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is 
considered related to the subject ’s participation in the research.  
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events occur most 
commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they can occur in the 
context of social and behavioral re search. Adverse events may be expected or unexpected.  
Acute Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring in the time period from the signing of the informed consent, through [ADDRESS_751665] treatment will be considered acute adverse events  
Late Adverse Events ( as applicable ) 
Adverse events occurring in the time period from the end of acute monitoring, to [ADDRESS_751666] 
treatment, will be defined as late adverse events. Radiation Oncology and Hematologic Oncology 
office notes will be reviewed for adverse events.  
 Seve rity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0 . Adverse events not specifically 
defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log a ccording to the general 
guidelines provided by [CONTACT_114642].   
 Grade 1: Mild  
 Grade 2: Moderate  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
 Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
 Grade 5: Death relat ed to the adverse event  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those events, occurring at 
any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results in death   
 Immediately life -threatening  
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]1,2 or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_572506]. 
Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A serious adverse event 
determination does not require the event to be related to the research. That is, both events 
completely unrelated to the condition under study and events that are expected in the context o f 
the condition under study may be serious adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study 
itself. As examples, a car accident requiring >24 hour inpatient admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114577] 
a serious adverse event for any research participant; lik ewise, in a study investigating end -stage 
cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263997] -specified period of 
monitoring for adverse and serious adverse events would be a serious adverse event, even if the 
event observed is a pri mary clinical endpoint of the study.  
1Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114579]. Note: If events occur 
during a pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64329], that prolong the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], those 
events should be evalu ated and/or reported as SAEs.   
2 NCI defines hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572460] 24 hours. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572461]. For example: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114582] a patient is admitted for 
observation or minor treatment (e.g. hydration) and released i n less than 24 hours. Furthermore, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572462] a 
routine AE or in an expedited report.  
8.2.2 Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]):  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to 
ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies. 
Adverse events are reported in a routine  manner at scheduled times during a trial. Additionally, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of subject safety 
and care.  
 
All subjects experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship  to study therapy, will be 
monitored until:  
  the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event 
return to baseline or is stable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871];  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study  therapy for the changes observed; 
or 
 death.  
The phrase  “unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others ” is found, but not defined 
in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56. 108(b)(1) and [ADDRESS_751667], which is 
defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s).  Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated 
problems to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL three (3)  of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency  given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the c haracteristics of the subject population being studied;   
    AND  
• Related  or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]);  
 AND  
• Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Note: 
According to OHRP, if the  adverse event is serious, it would always suggest a greater risk of harm.  
 
Follow -up  
All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.  
  
8.2.3  
Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting to the SCCC  DSMC and/or 
HRPP  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE v5).  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v5.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the p rotocol therapy.  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE may NOT be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur to the end of the acute adverse events reporting period as 
defined in section 8.2.1 . Any event that occurs during the late adverse event period as defined in 
section 8.2.1  and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be 
reported as indicated in the sections below.  
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. E xpected events are those that have 
been previously identified as resulting from administration of the treatment. An adverse event is 
considered unexpected, for expedited reporting  purposes only, when either the type of event or the 
severity of the event is not listed in:  
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this protocol (if 
applicable);  
 the drug package insert (if applicable);  
  the current Inv estigator’s Brochure (if applicable)  
the Study Agent(s)/Therapy(ies) Background and Associated Known Toxicities section of this protocol  
 
8.2.4 Reporting SAEs and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_264002] (SCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (D SMC)  
 
All SAE/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114585], which occur in research subjects on protocols for which the SCCC is 
the DSMC of record require reporting to the DSMC regardless of whether IRB reporting is required. 
All SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114586] -specifi ed monitoring period should be submitted 
to the SCCC DSMC within 5 business days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572463](s). In addition, for participating centers other than UTSW , local IRB guidance should 
be followed for local re porting of serious adverse events.  
 
The UTSW study team is responsible for submitting SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_572464].  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_572465]; FDA Form 
#3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if appli cable; and/or any other supporting documentation 
available should be submitted  to the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC Coordinator forwards the 
information onto the DSMC Chairman who determines if immediate action is required.  Follow -up 
eIRB reports, and all s ubsequent SAE /UPI[INVESTIGATOR_572466]. (See Appendix III of the SCCC DSMC 
Plan for a template Serious Adverse Event Form which may be utilized when a sponsor f orm is 
unavailable and SAE submission to the eIRB is not required).  
   
If the event occurs on a multi -institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_572507], the DOT Manager or lead coordinator ensures that all participating 
sites are notified of the event and resulting action, according to FDA guidance for expedited 
reporting. DSMC Chairperson reviews all SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_572467].  The DSMC Chairperson determines whether action is required and either takes 
action immediately, convenes a special DSMC session (physical or electronic), or defers the action 
until a regularly scheduled DSMC meeting.

Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) to the UTSW 
HRPP/IRB  
 
UTSW reportable event guidance applies to all research conducted by [CONTACT_264025], its affiliates, and investigators, sites, or institutions relying on the UT Southwestern 
IRB. Additional  reporting requirements apply for research relying on a non -UT Southwestern IRB.  
 
According to UTSW HRPP/IRB policy, UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114591], experiences, outcomes, etc. that 
meet ALL three (3)  of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpected in nature, frequency, or severity (i.e., generally not expected in a subject’s 
underlying condition or not expected as a risk of the study; therefore, not included in  the 
investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed consent document),AND  
2. Probably or definitely related to participation in the research, AND  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including  
 physical, psychological , economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious, it would always suggest a greater 
risk of harm.  
 
For purposes of this policy, UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114592] (UADEs) and 
death or serious injury related to a humanitarian use device (HUD).

For research relying on a non -UT Southwestern IRB (external, central, or single IRB) : 
 
Investigators relying on an external IRB who are conducting research on behalf of UT 
Southwestern or its affiliates are responsible for submitting LOCAL  UPI[INVESTIGATOR_264010] [ADDRESS_751669] report to their relying 
IRB according to the relying IRB’s policy. In addition, the external IRB’s responses or 
determinations on these local events  must be submitted  to the UT Sout hwestern  IRB within 10 
working days of receipt.  
 
Events NOT meeting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_118278] : 
 
Events that do NOT meet UPI[INVESTIGATOR_114596], evaluated, summarized, and

9. EVALUATION OF PROGRESSION  
  
Patients with evidence of new lesions amenable to SBRT during follow -up imaging not 
previously treated will be treated at the Radiation Oncologist’s discretion.  This will not constitute 
an event if the lesion is both amenable t o SBRT and subsequently treated. However, if the 
lesion is not amenable to SBRT, the patient is either unwilling to pursue further treatment or 
cannot tolerate treatment due to coexisting comorbidities, then progression will be deemed to 
have occurred.  
 
For liver lesions treated with SBRT, RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 
criteria will be used for evaluation of progression. Evaluation of liver lesions within [ADDRESS_751670] diameter 20 
mm using conventional techniques or [ADDRESS_751671] scan. Complete response (CR) is 
the disappearance of the measurable target lesions on relevant imaging studies. Partial 
response (PR) is at least a 30% d ecrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of 
measurable target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progression (PD) is at least 
a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD 
recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Evaluation of lung lesions at any time after SBRT is difficult in view of the expected fibrotic 
reaction. Bone lesions seen only on PET are also not well scored by [CONTACT_572508]. For these reasons certain study -specific definitions of response 
and local control will apply. For lung lesions a complete response (CR) will be defined as the 
absence of abnormal metabolic activity on PET scan; a partial res ponse (PR) will be defined as 
residual metabolic activity on PET scan in the absence of progressive disease. Fibrosis within 
the lung volume that receives a dose on the order of 18 Gy or more (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 2 -3 cm outside the 
PTV) has been commonly observed. T he characteristic pattern is a gradual dissolution of a 
discrete mass and formation of a scar that recapi[INVESTIGATOR_572468]. In this study progressive disease (PD) will be defined as residual increased 
metabolic PET scan i n combination with expanded parenchymal opacity that retains mass -like 
discrete borders and extends outside the volume of lung that received at least 18 Gy.  
 
All types of lesions will be scored at the six month time point for local control (LC) versus PD. LC 
for lung and liver lesions will be either CR or PR as described above. Progressive disease (PD) 
for bone lesions will be residual or increased metabolic activity on PET scan relative to baseline 
imaging with complementary CT or MRI that indicates residu al solid tumor distinct from and lack 
of biopsy -proven pathologic fracture in the interim.  
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Study Endpoints  
 
10.1.1 Primary Endpoint: Progression -free survival (PFS)  
 
10.1.2 Secondary endpoints:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rate in -field local control and rate of out -of-field disease progression.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety of SBRT with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall survival  
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of maintenance of chemotherapy and time to initiation of thir d line systemic 
agent (chemotherapy or biologic agent)  
 
10.2 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint, progression -free survival, and the 
assumption that patients are randomized until the end of accrual. The sa mple size is calculated 
with the 2 -sided significance level of 0.1 and 80% statistical power using a two -sample log rank 
test. We assume that the progression -free survival function follows an exponential distribution 
for each arm. Accrual to the study is a ssumed to be uniformly distributed. The null hypothesis is 
that the there are no difference in median survival rates between two arms.  We assume that 
patients will be accrued for [ADDRESS_751672] ratio of 0.400. 
The total sample size of 36 patients (18 in the SBRT arm and 18 in the maintenance the rapy 
arm) will be accrued to achieve the desired 80% statistical power and 2 -sided significance level 
of 0.10. Sample size was estimated using the sample size software PASS 2008.  
 
10.3 Patient Accrual  
Patient accrual is projected to be 2 patients per mont h. This trial should complete the accrual 
phase in 24 months   
 
 10.4 Randomization Scheme  
Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block. There will be no 
stratification factor in randomization.  
 
10.5 Analysis Plans  
All eligible patients who are randomized to the study will be included in the comparison of 
treatment arms, regardless of treatment compliance (intent -to-treat analysis).  
Progression -free survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier approach. The log -rank 
test will be used to test for a statistically significant difference in survival distributions. The null 
and alternative hypotheses are H 0: S1(t) = S 2 (t) vs. H A: S1 (t) ≠ S2 (t), where S i (t) is the 
distribution of progression -free survival times for patients in arm i. The Cox proportional hazard 
regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the 
treatment difference in progression -free survival. Unadjusted ratios and ratios adjusted for 
covariates of inte rest will be computed.  
 
Overall survival will be analyzed in the same way as progression -free survival. In -field local 
control and rate of out -of-field disease progression will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
approach.  
 
For safety of SBRT, only advers e events assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related 
to protocol treatment will be considered. The rates of all Grade [ADDRESS_751673] line systemic agent.  
 
10.5.1 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572469]. If at any point during the study more 
than 1/6 of patients treated to date experience study treatment -related grade 4 -5 toxicity of any 
kind, study enrollment will be suspended. Depending on the nature of the toxicity and whether it 
is believed to be related maintenance chemotherapy or SBRT, the d ose of one or the other 
might be modified by [CONTACT_339889], which would require review and re -approval of 
the amended protocol by [CONTACT_572509].  
 
Please also see section 6.2 for clarification of start of primary end point.

II.I Tarceva  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_572470], including 
fatalities in the treatment of non -small cell lung cancer or other advanced solid tumors. Dyspnea 
(41%) and cough (33%)  have also been reported.  
Dermatologic  
Dermatologic side effects including rash (75%), pruritus (13%), dry skin (12%), alopecia, 
hirsutism, eyelash/eyebrow changes, paronychia, and brittle and loose nails have been 
reported. Bullous, blistering and exfolia tive skin conditions have been reported including cases 
suggestive of Stevens -Johnson syndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], which in some cases were 
fatal. Cases of rosacea -like folliculitis and Malassezia sympodialis have also been reported.  
Treatment shou ld be interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering, or 
exfoliating conditions.  
 
The appearance of a rash in cancer patients treated with erlotinib is strongly associated with longer 
survival, according to researchers from the drug's developer, OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
Rash resulted in study discontinuation in 1.2% patients. Dose reduction or interruption for rash 
was needed in 5.1% of patients. In erlotinib -treated patients who developed rash, the onset was 
within two wee ks in 66% and within one month in 81%.  
Gastrointestinal  
The median time to onset of diarrhea was 12 days. Diarrhea resulted in study discontinuation in 0.5% of 
patients. Dose reduction or interruption for diarrhea was needed in 2.8% of patients.  
 
Patients receiving concomitant antiangiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and/or taxane -
based  chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease are at 
an increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation. Erlotinib (the active ingredient contained in 
Tarceva) should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal 
perforation.  
Gastrointestinal side effects including diarrhea (54%), nausea (33%), vomiting (23%), stomatitis 
(17%), and abdominal pain (11%) have been reported. Gastrointestinal perforation has been 
reported in patients receiving erlotinib, including fatalities. Gastrointestinal bleeding has been 
reported infrequently.  
Hepatic  
Hepatic side effects including hepatic failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and  liver function test 
abnormalities such as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), and bilirubin have been reported. A case of hepatitis has also been reported.  
These elevations were mostly transient or associated with li ver metastases.  
 
STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   A pharmacokinetic study in patients with advanced solid tumors and moderate hepatic impairment 
according to the Child -Pugh criteria has been reported. In this study, [ADDRESS_751676] abnormalities (including elevated alanine aminotransferase (A LT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin) were observed in patients receiving single -agent erlotinib 
150 mg in the Maintenance study. Grade 2 (>2.[ADDRESS_751677]) ALT elevations occurred in 2% and 
1%, and Grade 3 (>[ADDRESS_751678]) ALT elevations were observed in 1% and 0% of erlotinib and 
placebo treated patients, respectively. The erlotinib treatment group had Grade 2 (>1.[ADDRESS_751679]) bilirubin elevations in 4% and Grade 3 (>[ADDRESS_751680]) in <1% compared with <1% for both 
Grades 2 and 3 in the placebo gro up.

Immunologic  
Immunologic side effects including infection (24%) have been reported.  
Ocular  
Ocular disorders including abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivit is sicca, or keratitis are known 
risk factors for corneal ulceration/perforation.  
 
Erlotinib (the active ingredient contained in Tarceva) therapy should be interrupted or 
discontinued if patients present with acute/worsening ocular disorders such as eye pa in. 
Ocular side effects including conjunctivitis (12%), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (12%), corneal 
perforation and ulceration, abnormal eyelash growth, and keratitis have been reported.

STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   Hypersensitivity  
Hypersensitivity side effects including allergic reactions (2%) have been reported.  
Other  
Side effects belo w show the incidence of CTC grade 3/[ADDRESS_751681] been the major dose -limiting 
toxicity. A reversible and not cumulative neutropenia has also been reported. A median of 8 
days to nadir and median duration of severe neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) of 7 days 
has been reported. A fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with thrombocytopenia has 
been reported in one patient. Three patients with severe liver dysf unction developed fatal 
gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug -induced thrombocytopenia. Disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure, has been 
reported during postmarketing experience.  
Patients carrying the GSTP1 A/B and 3435TT genotypes may have excessive hematologic toxicity.  
 
In a summary of 37 clinical trials (n = 1,495), neutropenia (less than 2,000 cells/mm3) has been reported 
in 96.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 96% of patients with elevated LFTs. Neutropenia 
(less than 500 cells/mm3) has been reported in 76% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 86% of 
patients with elevated LFTs.  
 
Leukopenia (less than 4,000 cells/mm3) has been reported in 96.5% of patien ts with normal LFTs at 
baseline and 98.1% of patients with elevated LFTs. Leukopenia (less than 1,000 cells/mm3) has been 
reported in 31% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 44.2% of patients with elevated LFTs. 
Thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000  cells/mm3) has been reported in 7.5% of patients with normal LFTs 
at baseline and 27.3% of patients with elevated LFTs.  
 
Anemia (less than 11 g/dL) has been reported in 89.5% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 
92.7% of patients with elevated LFT s. Anemia (less than 8 g/dL) has been reported in 8.4% of patients 
with normal LFTs and 30.9% of patients with elevated LFTs.  
 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 11.8% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 
26.4% of patients with elevated LFTs.  
Hypersensitivity  
In one institution's experience with 623 courses of docetaxel therapy (n = 168), hypersensitivity 
reactions decreased from 50% to 5% once patients began receiving systemic prophylaxis 
including corticosteroids and antihistamines.  
Hypersen sitivity side effects may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel 
infusion. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by [CONTACT_13199]/or bronchospasm, 
STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   or generalized rash/erythema occurred in 0.9% of patients who received th e recommended 
dexamethasone premedication. Hypersensitivity reactions requiring discontinuation of therapy 
have been reported in [ADDRESS_751682] been reported in 49% of patients treated with docetaxel 60 mg/m2 compared 
to 55.3% and 65.9% treated with 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Discon tinuation due to 
adverse events was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m2 versus 6.9% and 16.5% 
for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively. Deaths within [ADDRESS_751683] 
treatment occurred at a rate of 4.0% in patients treated  with 60 mg/m2 compared to 5.3% and 
1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 respectively.  
Cardiovascular  
Cardiovascular side effects including hypotension have been reported in 3.6% of patients (3.4% required 
treatment). Heart failure, sinus ta chycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable 
angina, pulmonary edema, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, 
pulmonary embolism, syncope, myocardial infarction, and hypertension have also been 
reported.  
Renal  
Renal side effects including severe fluid retention (generally renal in origin and generally after 
four to five courses of therapy) have been reported in patients using a five day dexamethasone 
premedication regimen. The fluid retention was characterized b y one or more of the following 
events; poorly tolerated peripheral edema, generalized edema, pleural effusion requiring urgent 
drainage, dyspnea at rest, cardiac tamponade, or pronounced abdominal distention (due to 
ascites). Renal insufficiency has been r eported during postmarketing experience with the 
majority of these cases associated with concomitant nephrotoxic drugs.  
Moderate fluid retention (17.4%), severe fluid retention (6%) and discontinuation (1.7%) have 
been reported among 229 patients with norm al liver function using a five day dexamethasone 
premedication regimen. Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly reversible 
resolving in a median of 29 weeks following discontinuation. The median cumulative dose to the 
onset of moderate or seve re fluid retention was 705 mg/m2 (in patients receiving 
premedication). In a summary of 37 clinical trials (n = 1,495), fluid retention was reported in 
48.5% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 66.7% of patients with elevated LFTs. In the 
same tri als, severe fluid retention was reported in 5.2% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline 
and 33.3% of patients with elevated LFTs. Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_572472], diuretics (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_107169]), etc.  
STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   Nervous system  
Spontaneous reversal of symptoms occurred in a median of 9 weeks from onset. Approximately 
3.8% of the 134 patients required discontinuation of therapy due to neurotoxicity. In a summary 
of 37 clinical trials (n = 1,495), ne urosensory symptoms were reported in 53.7% of patients with 
normal LFTs at baseline and 41.8% of patients with elevated LFTs. In the same trials, severe 
neurosensory symptoms were reported in 3.9% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 
none of the pa tients with elevated LFTs. In a study (n = 46) of 209 cycles, peripheral 
neurotoxicity was reported in 30% of patients. In another study (n = 186), 11% of patients 
developed mild to moderate sensory neuropathy at cumulative doses ranging from 50 to 750 
mg/m2 and doses of 10 to 115 mg/m2.  
Nervous system side effects including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain (7%) have been 
reported in one study (n = 134). Confusion and rare cases of seizures or transient loss of 
consciousness have been reported, sometimes appearing during the infusion of the drug.  
Hepatic  
Hepatic side effects including various increases in blood levels have been reported. In patients 
with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
occurred in 8.9%  of patients. Increases in SGOT or SGPT greater than 1.[ADDRESS_751684] were observed in 18.1% and 7.6% of 
patients, respectively. Increases in SGOT and/or SGPT greater than 1.[ADDRESS_751685] occurred in 4.5% of 
patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Rare cases of hepatitis have been reported during 
postmarketing experience.  
Gastrointestinal  
In a summary of 37 clinical trials (n = 1,49 5), nausea has been reported in 40.4% of patients with normal 
LFTs at baseline and 40% of patients with elevated LFTs. Diarrhea has been reported in 40.4% of patients 
with normal LFTs at baseline and 32.7% of patients with elevated LFTs. Vomiting has been reported in 
24% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 25.5% of patients with elevated LFTs. Severe GI 
reactions were reported in 8.2% of patients.  
 
Stomatitis has been reported in 42.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 47.3% of 
patients with elevated LFTs. Severe stomatitis has been reported in 5.3% of patients with 
normal LFTs at baseline and 14.5% of patients with elevated LFTs. Stomatitis appears to be 
dose dependent.  
Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarr hea, stomatitis abdominal 
pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, GI hemorrhage, GI perforation, 
ischemic colitis, colitis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, neutropenic enterocolitis, ischemic colitis, 
and dehydration as a consequence to G I events have been reported.  
Dermatologic  
Dermatologic side effects including reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash 
including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face or 
thorax (and usually associate d with pruritus) have been reported. Severe hand and foot 
syndrome has been reported. Severe nail disorders (2.6%), alopecia, and localized erythema of 
STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   the extremities with edema followed by [CONTACT_572510]. Very rare cases 
of cutaneou s lupus erythematosus have been reported. Scleroderma -like changes usually 
preceded by [CONTACT_572511]. One case of supravenous 
discoloration of the skin due to docetaxel treatment has been reported.  
Eruptions generally occurred wi thin one week after dosage administration and were not disabling. 
Recovery generally occurred before the next infusion.  
 
In a summary of 37 clinical trials (n = 1,495), cutaneous adverse events have been reported in 58.5% of 
patients with normal LFTs at ba seline and 61.8% of patients with elevated LFTs. In the same trials, severe 
cutaneous adverse events have been reported in 5.6% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 10.9% 
of patients with elevated LFTs. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity  was 1.7%. Alopecia has been 
reported in 80% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 61.8% of patients with elevated LFTs. In 
one study (n = 46) of 209 cycles, alopecia was reported in 91% of patients. In one institution's experience 
with 623 courses of docetaxel therapy (n = 168), dermatologic toxicity decreased from 53% to 14% once 
patients began receiving systemic prophylaxis including corticosteroids and antihistamines.  
 
Severe nail disorder were characterized by [CONTACT_572512] - or hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_572473] (0.8%) and pain.  
Local  
Local side effects consisting of infusion site reactions have been reported. These reactions were 
generally mild and consisted of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], inflammation, redness or dryness of the 
skin, phlebitis, ext ravasation or swelling of the vein. Rare cases of transient visual disturbances 
(flashes, flashing lights, scotomata) typi[INVESTIGATOR_572474]. These 
were reversible upon discontinuation of the infusion.  
Other  
In a summary of 37 clinical trials (n = 1,495), asthenia has been reported in 61.5% of patients with normal 
LFTs at baseline and 54.5% of patients with elevated LFTs. In the same trial s, severe asthenia has been 
reported in 11.1% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline and 23.6% of patients with elevated LFTs. 
In a study (n = 46) of 209 cycles, malaise was reported in 52% of patients.  
Other side effects have included asthenia (11.1% to  61.5%) and malaise (52%). Fatigue and 
weakness have been reported to have lasted a few days to several weeks and were 
occasionally associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive 
disease. Rare cases of ototoxicity, hearing  disorders and/or hearing loss have been reported, 
including cases associated with other ototoxic drugs. A case of docetaxel -induced recall 
dermatitis on previous laser treatment sites has also been reported.  
Ocular  
Ocular side effects including conjunctiv itis and lacrimation have been reported. Canalicular and 
nasolacrimal duct obstruction has been a common side effect of weekly docetaxel therapy and 
has even been reported to occur when docetaxel is used in the neoadjuvant setting according to 
one study. E xcessive tearing which may be attributable to lacrimal duct obstruction has also 
been reported.  
STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   Respi[INVESTIGATOR_572471], acute pulmonary edema, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086], and interstitial pneumonia have been reported. Pulmonary fibrosis has been rarely 
reported.  
 
II.IV Gemcitabine  
Hematologic  
Myelosuppression is the major dose -limiting factor associated with gemcitabine therapy.  
 
Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently necessary. Less than 1% of patients have had 
to discontinue therapy for either anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia 
was more common in the elderly, especially older women.  
 
The risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura increases as the cumulat ive dose of 
gemcitabine approaches 20,000 mg/m2.  
Hematologic side effects including anemia (68%), leukopenia (62%), neutropenia (63%), 
thrombocytopenia (24%), petechiae (16%), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (0.015% to 
1.4%), and sepsis (less than 1%) have been reported. Red blood cell transfusions were required 
by 19% of patients.  
Gastrointestinal  
Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting (69%), diarrhea (19%) and stomatitis 
(11%) have been reported. A case of severe anal pruritus has  also been reported.  
If the patient is not vomiting due to their disease state, nausea can generally be prevented by 
[CONTACT_572513] -dose oral serotonin antagonists and glucocorticoid 
therapy. One study of 790 patients found the r ate of WHO grade 3 nausea and vomiting at a 
frequency of 22% in patients under 65 years of age, and 12% in patients 65 years of age or 
older.  
Hepatic  
No evidence of increased hepatic toxicity has been reported with longer duration or greater total 
cumulati ve dose.  
Hepatic side effects including transient elevations in ALT (68%), AST (67%), alkaline 
phosphatase (55%), bilirubin (13%), and GGT have been reported. Serious hepatotoxicity 
including liver failure and death have been reported very rarely.  
Renal  
Renal side effects including proteinuria (45%), hematuria (35%), renal failure, hemolytic -uremic

The flu -like symptoms u sually take place a few hours after drug administration. The symptoms are 
usually self -limiting and recovery is generally within 24 to 48 hours. Less than 1% of patients 
discontinued use due to flu -like symptoms. Some patients get relief from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs or acetaminophen.  
 
Out of the five reported cases of distal ischemic changes, four of those case related to 
combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine, while one case was of gemcitabine 
as a single agent in first -line t herapy.  
Other side effects including fever (41%), frequently associated with other flu -like symptoms, has been 
reported. There was a 16% incidence of infection among the patients with fever. Both fever and asthenia 
have frequently been reported as isolated  effects. Flu syndrome (19%), including fever, asthenia, 
anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia has been reported. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and 
malaise have been reported infrequently. Vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Fi ve 
cases of distal ischemic changes have been reported.  
 
A pattern of tissue injury typi[INVESTIGATOR_572475].  
Dermatologic  
Rash was generally a macular or finely granular  maculopapular pruritic eruption, mild to 
moderate in severity, involving the trunk and extremities. Alopecia is usually minimal.  
Dermatologic side effects including rash (30%), alopecia (15%), pruritus (13%), and radiation 
recall have been reported. Cellu litis has been reported rarely. Severe skin reactions including 
desquamation and bullous skin eruptions have been reported very rarely. Two cases of 
pseudocellulitis have been reported. A case of linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis has 
also been rep orted.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_572476]. Forty percent of the study 
population consisted of lung cancer patients, while some of the other study patients had pulmonary 
manifestations of other malignancies.  
 
Different patterns of lung injury may be related to gemcitabine. A rapid response following the 
administration of corticosteroids would mean the respi[INVESTIGATOR_572477] a 
hypersensitivity reaction.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_572478]  (23%), sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_315642] (<2%) 
have been reported. Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, 
pulmonary edema, and adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_572479].

Less than 1% of the paresthesias have been severe.  
STU092013 -070, Iyengar, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_31, 10 -10-19 (1)   Nervous system side effects including paresthesias (10%) have been reported.  
Local  
Local side effects including "injection -site-related events" (4%) have been reported by [CONTACT_13989].  
Hypersensitivity  
Hypersensitivity side effects including anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely.  
Cardiovascular  
Many of the patients that suffere d cardiovascular effects had a prior history of cardiovascular 
disease. Two percent of patients discontinued therapy due to these effects. Less than 1% of 
patients discontinued due to edema.  
Cardiovascular side effects including peripheral edema (20%), ede ma (13%), cerebrovascular 
accident, hypotension, hypertension, and generalized edema (less than 1%) have been 
reported. Atrial fibrillation has been reported rarely. Congestive heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, and arrhythmias (predominantly supraventr icular in nature) have been reported very 
rarely.  
Immunologic  
Immunologic side effects including a scleroderma -like reaction have been reported.  
Oncologic  
Long term animal studies to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted.  
Oncologic side e ffects have been reported in animal studies. Gemcitabine induced forward 
mutations in vitro in a mouse lymphoma assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus 
assay.

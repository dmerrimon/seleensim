Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :[ADDRESS_138254] exists for recurrent or metastatic salivary gland 
cancers. There is preliminary data that a minority of patients may respond to single agent 
pembrolizumab (Cohen, 2016). The dual inhibition of PDL-[ADDRESS_138255] pr eclinical data showing 
synergistic antitumor efficacy.   
This data is supported by [CONTACT_122910], in immunotherapy naive 
melanoma patients, wherein improved objective response rates and progression free response rates were observed with the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122870] (Lark in, 2015). Multiple ongoing studies in other tumor types 
are examining the activity of this combination.  
 The role of radiation therapy in transforming the tumor m icroenvironment to increase the 
activity of immune checkpoint inhibition is an area of significant scientific interest. There is preclinical data supporting that the exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors prior to 
therapeutic radiation is associated with increased antitumor activity. The clinical 
observation of the abscopal effect further supports the potential clinical utility of radiation therapy in inducing response s to immune check point inhibition.

Study Design  
This is a single arm, open label, prospective study evaluating the safety and clinical efficacy 
of the combination of nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122873] (SBRT) in patients with advanced salivary gland cancer. 
Patients enrolled will receive the following treatment (see Section 5.1.1): 
1. Nivolumab 3mg/kg IV Q 2 weeks  x 12 doses followed by [CONTACT_88339] 480 mg IV 
Q4 weeks x 8 doses 
2. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV Q 6 weeks  x 4 doses 
3. Hypofractionated radiation therapy (SBRT) given to a total dose of 24Gy given in 
[ADDRESS_138256] dose of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The target lesion will be a local/regional or 
metastatic disease site that per the multidisciplinary head and neck team,  requires 
local control for palliation and/or prevention of impending symptoms.
 
Both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122874] a single agent and 
in combination. However, since the combination of nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122875], the first [ADDRESS_138257] 12 weeks of treatment and acute toxicities will be reviewed. If more than 2 DLTs (to be defined in Section 5.1.2) are noted in this 6 patient cohort, a dose 
modification  will be implemented  (Section 5.1.1) for the remaining 14 patients who will be 
enrolled in the expansion cohort. Enrollment period is 24 months and duration of the trial 48 
months.  
 
 
Study Population 
 The study aims to enroll patients with salivary gland carcinomas (WHO , 2005), who are not 
candidates for curative intent therapy and who have a target lesion (either local/regional or 
distant metastatic site involving the lung and/or bone), that requires local control for 
palliation, as determined by a multidisciplinary team.

Statistical Plan  
 
There are multiple ongoing studies in various tumor types exploring the activity of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In a published report of the combination in patients with advanced NSCLC treated on a phase I study (Checkmate 012), treatment related serious 
adverse events were observed in 28% of patients (Hellmann Lancet Oncol , 2017). This 
study plans to accrue 20 patients, a sample size that would allow us to estimate grade 3 
or higher acute drug related toxicity rate of 30% with a confidence interval of 20% (95% confidence level) or an upper bound of 50%. This would allow us to reasonably exclude 
a clinically significant increase in toxicity with the addition of radiation therapy to the 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122878].  
 
Toxicities will be summarized as the number and percentage of patients with each type 
of toxicity. Responses will be summarized as frequencies and percentages. The Kaplan 
Meier method will be used to estimate overall survival and  progression free survival. 
Outcomes will be calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the 
corresponding event. We will use multivariate statistics to test the hypotheses that pretreatment intratumoral immune cell phenotype and PD-L1expression predict response 
response to therapy, and that therapy alters systemic immunophenotype.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Salivary gland carcinomas represent <5% of all head and neck malignancies and are characterized by [CONTACT_122912].  These arise from the secretory acini and associated myoepi[INVESTIGATOR_110493], and minor salivary glands located throughout the upper aerodigestive epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  The current WHO histological classification 
identifies [ADDRESS_138279] carcinomas 
and adenocarcinomas  (Barnes , 2005).
  The current standard of care for early or locally advanced disease is curative intent resection 
followed by [CONTACT_122913] (Schroeder , 2008). 
 
Currently, there is no standard of care for the treatment of incurable (unresectable and metastatic) salivary gland malignanc ies.  
Clinical trials that have examined the activity of systemic therapy have been difficult to interpret due to small numbers, h eterogeneous 
patient populations, and the frequent observation of prolonged stable disease, a likely reflection of the indolent biology of certain 
salivary gland tumors, such as adenoid cystic carcinomas. Historical regimens tested more than [ADDRESS_138280] employed cisplatin and cisplatin -based combinations (response rates of 20% or lower) (Laurie , 2006).  Two of the largest contemporary studies conducted 
in North America have examined single agent paclitaxel (response rate 26% in non- adenoid cystic carcinoma subtypes, 0 in adenoid 
cystic carcinomas), and a gemcitabine carboplatin combination (response rate 24%) (Gilbert , 2006; Laurie, 2010). In these two studies 
median progression free survival was 5-6 months and median overall survival was 12-14 months, (KM estimates of 1year overall survival 50%, 3year overall survival 25%).  Even lower response rates have been demonstrated with prospective evaluation of the activity of various molecular targeted agents such as trastuzumab, gefitinib, imatinib and lapatinib, with essentially no objective 
response rates noted  (Haddad, 2003; Jakob, 2014; Pfeffer, 2007; Agulnik 2007). 
 
The experience with immune checkpoint inhibitors in this rare  disease is limited. Preliminary reports on the anti-PD1 monoclonal 
antibody pembrolizumab, demonstrated an objective response in approximate ly 10% of patients with salivary gland cancers, among a 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030

20 
 population enriched for >1% PDL1 tumor expression (Cohen, 2016). There is increasing interest in exploring the efficacy of immune 
checkpoint inhibition in this population. 
 The dual inhibition of PDL-[ADDRESS_138281] preclinical data 
showing synergistic antitumor efficacy. This data is supported by [CONTACT_122910], in immunotherapy naive melanoma patients, wherein improved objective response rates and progression free response rates were observed with the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122880] (Larkin , 2015).  Multiple ongoing studies in other tumor 
types are examining the activity of this combination. 
 
The role of radiation therapy in transforming the tumor microenvironment to increase the activity of immune checkpoint inhibition is an area of significant scientific interest. There is preclinical data supporting that the exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors prior to therapeutic radiation is associated with increased antitumor activity  (Twyman -Saint Victor , 2015).  The clinical observation of the 
abscopal effect further supports the potential clinical utility of radiation therapy in inducing responses to immune check point 
inhibi tion (Postow, 2012). 
Therefore this clinical trial aims to ex amine the safety and efficacy of dual immune checkpoint blockade and palliative hypofractionated 
radiation therapy in salivary gland carcinomas. Our institution has had prior experience with implementation and completion of clinical trials in this rare dis ease.

Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :[ADDRESS_138283] 6 patients of this study will represent the initial run -in 
phase of the triplet combination of nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122883].  The 
initial doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b and nivolumab will be administered on day 1 of therapy.  
Stereotactic radiation will be initiated on Week 3 of treatment .  SBRT will be delivered to 
a total dose of 24 Gy, given in 3 fractions of 8Gy every other day.  Treatment will be 
continued according to the study schema unless patient withdraws consent, has confirmed 
disease progression, and/or develops toxicity that results in treatment discontinuation.   
 Enrollment will be halted until these first [ADDRESS_138284] 12 weeks of treatmen t and acute toxicities will be reviewed. If more than 2 DLTs (to be defined in 
Section 5.1.2) are noted in this six patient cohort, a dose modification  will be 
implemented  (Section 5.1.1) for the remaining 14 patients who will be enrolled in the 
expansion cohort. 
 
Serum correlative studies will be collected at the following timepoints: at baseline, prior to week 8 , and prior to week 16 of treatment. Archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded 
tissue (obtained in the 12 months prior to trial enrollment) will be collected from patients 
enrolled. If the patient does not have archived tissue available, a fresh biopsy will be 
obtained. Tissue requirement will be waived if deemed contraindicated or not clinically 
available/accessible for resection per the treating p hysician (PI [INVESTIGATOR_122877]). 
 
4.3 Efficacy Measurements 
 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 
 
Patients will be evaluated every 8 weeks (±  7 days) with radiographic imaging to assess 
response to treatment. CT or MRI will be used, per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], to scan areas of known disease. All imaging will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 for determination of overall response rate (ORR) and progression- free 
survival (PFS).

5.1.2 Definition of DLT  
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated during the run -in phase consisting of 
the first [ADDRESS_138303]. Grading of DLTs will 
follow the guidelines provided in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.0.   
 
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the DLT 
evaluation period. Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to 
another etiology is excluded from this definition. The following will be DLTs: 
• Any Grade 4 irAE  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis  
• Any Grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030

Protocol version 3.0  April  17, 2019 
 
32 
 • Any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days 
of the initiation of maximal supportive care  
• Any Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not 
downgrade to Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_122884] ≤ Grade 1 or 
baseline within 14 days 
• Liver transaminase elevation > 8 × ULN or total bilirubin >  5 × ULN  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 non -irAE, except for the exclusions listed below 
− Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days  
− Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is managed with or without systemic co rticosteroid therapy and/or 
hormone replacement therapy and the subject is asymptomatic 
− Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e .g., 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc .) 
− Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade 
− Grade 3 infusion- related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of 
steroid prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management  
− Grade [ADDRESS_138304] 1 grade within 3 days. Grade 3 or Grade 
4 febrile neutropenia will be a DLT regardless of duration or reversibility 
− Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia 
− Grade [ADDRESS_138305] 1 grade within 3 days 
− Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical interventio n within 3 days 
 
 
• Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, not described in exclusions above 
• Prolonged delay (>2 weeks) in initiating second dose of nivolumab or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122885]- related toxicity

33 
 Immune- related AEs are defined as AEs of an immune nature (i .e., inflammatory) in the 
absence of a clear alternative etiology. In the ab sence of a clinically significant 
abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory 
findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
During this DLT period, patients  who received <90% of the nivolumab OR ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122886] 1 (e.g., because the infusion of either drug had to be discontinued due to 
an infusion reaction) and did not experience a DLT will not be taken into account in the 
assessment of the overall DLT rate for the phase I run- in cohort and will be replaced. 
 
5.1.3 Dose  Delays/Modifications 
Toxicity will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0). The protocol will change to CTCAE version 6.[ADDRESS_138306] both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122887] 1 or baseline and retreatment criteria are met. 
 Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122888] 12 days. This will permit periodic ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122889] -placebo dosing to be synchronized with nivolumab dosing. 
 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122890]. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762], the dosing days of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122891] - 2/+[ADDRESS_138307] 12 days apart . Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102332] -2/+3 
day window if needed to synchronize with the next nivolumab dose 
   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Delay Criteria  
Doses of both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (during study weeks 1-24) or nivolumab alone 
(during study weeks 25-52) should be held if any of the following are observed: 
 
• Any G rade ≥ 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory 
abnormalities  
 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :140818 
Protocol version 3.0  April  17, 2019 
 
34 
 • Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions for 
lymphopenia, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or 
total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or lipase:  
− Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay 
− If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within 
normal limits, delay  dosing for drug- related Grade 2 toxicity  
− If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 
toxicity range ,delay dosing for drug- related Grade ≥3 toxicity  
− Any Grade ≥ 3 drug- related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not 
associated with  symptoms or clinical manifestatio ns of pancreatit is does 
not require dose delay.  
 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for Resuming Treatment  
 
Subjects may resume treat ment with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (weeks 1 -24) or 
nivolumab (weeks 2-52) when  drug- related AE(s) resolve(s) to Grade 1 or baseline value, 
with the following exceptions: 
 
• Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.  
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in  the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity. 
• Subjects with baseline Grade [ADDRESS_138308]/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose 
delays for reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AS T/ALT or total bilirubin may 
resume treatment in the presence of Grade [ADDRESS_138309]/ALT or total bilirubin. 
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to 
baseline before treatment is resumed.  
• Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug-
related toxicity  must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent 
dose of prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day. 
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement may resume treatment.

During weeks 1-24, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102348] 6 weeks (- 2/+3  days) 
after the prior dose.  In general, it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122892] . In order to facilitate this, the 
dosing days of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102350] - 2/+3day 
window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are given at least 12 days apart . 
If an ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102333] 6 weeks from the prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102334], then 
subsequent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122893] 6 week interval between consecutive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria for permanent discontinuation of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122894]: 
 
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) 
withdraws consent. 
• Confirmation of PD and investigator determination that the subject is no longer benefiting from treatment with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
• Dosing delays lasting 12 weeks or more  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone per day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_138310] dose of study drug/study 
regimen  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following resumption of dosing 
• Adverse event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12440], contraindicat es further dosing 
• Subject noncompliance that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], warrants withdrawal; e.g., refusal to adhere to scheduled visits 
• Subject is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria for study participation at study entry and continuing investigational therapy might constitute a safety ris k

 • Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy t est 
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Completed all doses of study drug 
• Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_138311] may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_122918], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.   
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving investigational product will 
be followed for safety, including the collection of any protocol-specified blood 
specimens, unless consent is withdrawn or the subject is lost to follow-up or enrolled in  
another clinical study.  All subjects will be followed for survival.  Subjects who decline to return to the site for evaluations will be offered follow-up by [CONTACT_122919] [ADDRESS_138312] scans (with contrast, unless 
contraindicated) will be required to define the gross target volume (GTV) and planning target 
volume (P TV). PET- CT and/or MRI imaging are preferred to delineate volumes as accurately as 
possible. The treatment planning CT scan should be acquired with the subject in the same position and immobilization device, as for the treatment. Treatment planning will be done using 
a 3D based CT treatment planning system. All tissues to be irradiated must be included in the CT 
scan. Planning CT scan will be done at 1.[ADDRESS_138313] with sufficient margin for treatment planning.

 5.2.1 Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
 
SBRT has now been formally defined and described in a published guideline from the American 
College of Radiology and American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (Potters, 2004). This protocol will respect that guideline. The term stereotactic, for the purposes of this protocol, implies the targeting, planning, and directing of therapy using beams of radiation along 
any trajectory in [ADDRESS_138314] a target of known 3-D coordinates. The coordinate system is 
defined by [CONTACT_122920] “fiducial” markers. This differs from conventional radiation therapy, in which 
therapy is directed toward less -than-reliable skin mark s or bony landmarks that are indirectly 
referenced to the tumor (surrogates). This protocol will require treatments to be conducted with 
the use of a fixed [ADDRESS_138315] a target according to the known 3- D 
coordinates as determined in the process of treatment planning. The nature of the fiducials themselves may include radiopaque markers or rods placed at known locations in a frame or fixed structure adjacent to the patient as well as use of the tumor itself as a fiducial (e.g., 
acquiring tomographic views of the tumor simultaneously with the treatment). Metallic “seeds” 
placed within the tumor will be allowed to c onstitute a fiducial so long as the methods are 
validated and a plan is in place to identify seed migration (e.g., redundant seeds placed).  
 
5.2.2 Target Contouring 
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined as all known gross disease encompassing the selected 
index lesion. The GTV will consist of the index lesion as visualized on CT +/- PET/CT, and/or MRI. Image fusion is encouraged when using multiple modalities to define the GTV.  Clinical Target Volume (CTV) will be the same as GTV for most cases. In case of uncertainty, GTV could be expanded to CTV by 2- 3mm per clinician discretion.  
 Internal Gross Tumor Volume (IGTV) is defined for mobile index lesions at the discretion of the 
treating physician. For mobile index lesions, a 4-D CT scan will be acquired in order to account for the motion of the lesion during treatment. The IGTV will be defined as the union of the visualized index lesion on all gated CT data sets. 
 
Planning Target Volume (PTV) will be defined as per convention for photon beam radiotherapy. A 3-dimensional margin of 3- 5mm will be created on the CTV or IGTV (if available) to allow 
for daily set-up variance. For Proton beam radiotherapy, an additional range uncertainty is added 
during planning. 
 Organ at Ri sk volume (OAR) is contoured as visualized on the planning CT or MR scan.

 Planning organ at Risk V olume (PRV) is the OAR  expanded for setup uncertainty or organ 
motion. The physician will contour the OAR. The dosimetrist will create the PRV by [CONTACT_122921] 1-3 mm, depending on the situation.  
 Pertinent Organs at Risk (OARs) in the index region are contoured as applicable:  
  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], Brain stem, Brachial plexus (roots & trunks)

5.2.3 Trea tment planning, dose fractionation and specification 
Computer based planning & QA will be performed using our standard institutional SBRT 
guidelines, including corrections for tissue heterogeneity, and robustness analysis (for Proton therapy). Treatment planning may be done with IMRT, VMAT, Proton beam RT (Pencil beam 
RT or Uniform scanning). 
The dose prescription will be as follows: 24 Gy given in 3 fractions to PTV (80- 95% IDL) 
delivered at 8 Gy per fraction every other day. Dose rate: For the purpose of this study, dose rate utilized will be that which is commissioned by 
[CONTACT_122922]. There will be no special dose rate modifications required for this study. 
The following PRV dose constraints will be used: (adopted from Timmerman RD. An overview of  hypofractionation. Seminars of Radiation Oncology [ADDRESS_138316];18(4):215-222).

 * avoid circumferential radiation  
Three-dimensional coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements will be custom designed for 
each case to deliver highly conformal prescription dose distributions. Non-opposing, 
noncoplanar beams are preferable. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], ≥ 10 beams of radiation will be used with roughly equal weighting for photon planning. Generally, more beams are used for larger lesion sizes. When static beams are used, a minimum of 7 non-opposing beams should be used. For arc 
rotation techniques, a minimum of 340 degrees (cumulative for all beams) should be utilized. For 
arc rotation techniques, a minimum of 340 degrees (cumulative for all beams) should be utilized.  
Proton beam planning is performed with 2-4 beams.  In order to obtain acceptable coverage, field 
aperture size and shape shou ld correspond nearly identically to the projection of the PTV along a 
beam’s eye view (i.e., no additional “margin” for dose buildup at the edges of the blocks or MLC jaws beyond the PTV). The only exception should be when observing the minimum field dimen sion of 3.5 cm when treating small lesions (see above). As such, prescription lines 
covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 60-90% line (where the maximum dose is 100%); 
however, higher isodoses (hotspots) must be manipulated to occur within the target and not in 
adjacent normal tissue. The treatment isocenter or setup point in stereotactic coordinates will be determined from system fiducials (and can be adjusted pretreatment depending on the results from localization imaging studies) and translated to the treatment record.  
Dose specifications  
Successful treatment planning will require accomplishment of all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Maximum dose: The treatment plan should be created such that 100% corresponds to 
the maximum dose delivered to the patient. This point must exist within the PTV.  
2.   Prescription isodose: The prescription isodose surface must be ≥ 60% and < 90% of 
the maximum dose. 
3.   Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage: The prescription isodose surface will be 
chosen such that 95% of the target volume (PTV) is conformally covered by [CONTACT_122923] (PTV V95%RX = 100%) and 99% of the target volume 
(PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of the prescription dose (PTV V90%RX > 99%). 
4.  High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]: The cumulative volume of all tissue outside the PTV receiving a 
dose > 105% of prescription dose should be no more than 15% of the PTV volume. Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such that the ratio of the volume of the prescription isodose meeting criteria 1 through 4 to the volume of the PTV is ideally <

 1.2 (see table below). These criteria will not be required to be met in treating very 
small tumors (< 2.5 cm axial GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV 
dimension) in which the required minimum field size of 3.5 cm results in the inability 
to meet a conformality ratio of 1.2. The “None” and “Minor” entries in this table define the Per Protocol, Variation Acceptable and Deviation Unacceptable Compliance Criteria.  
5.  Intermediate Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]: The falloff gradient beyond the PTV extending into 
normal tissue structures must be rapid in all directions and meet the following criteria:  
a.  Location: The maximum total dose over all fractions in Gray (Gy) to any point [ADDRESS_138317] be no greater than D2CM where 
D2CM is given by [CONTACT_30557]. 
b.  Volume: The ratio of the volume of the [ADDRESS_138318] be no greater than R50% where R50% is given by [CONTACT_30557] (adapted from RTOG 0915). This table is used for all prescription requirements 
irrespective of calculation algorithm and total treatment dose.

 Image guided RT (IGRT) is required with physician review per institutional QA requirements before each treatment is delivered. Cone beam CT will be matched to target volume to be treated and bony anatomy or other defined fixed fiducials. If CBCT is unavailable, orthogonal pair KV imaging matched to bony anatomy closest to PTV is acceptable.

7.1.1 Administrative  
 
The Schedule of Assessments chart - Section 7  summarizes the trial procedures to be performed 
at each visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1755]/or Sponsor. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The approved informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Investigator obtaining consent must ensure that subjects --or, in 
those situations where consent cannot be given by [CONTACT_1766], their legally acceptable representatives --are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_423]’s dated signa ture or by [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable 
representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature [CONTACT_63564].   A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation in the trial.  The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].    The subj ect or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if 
new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and Sponsor requirements. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_79429].

 PD-L1 Testing  
To ensure comparability of data across all studies of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122898], it is strongly encouraged that all studies that 
include PD -L1 testing utilize the Ventana SP263 assay.  Testing should be restricted to the Ventana 
SP263 assay and should be performed in accordance with the package insert on the Ventana Benchmark platform (Ultra or XT).   
 The Ventana SP263 assay is fully analytically validated test characterized through to the completion of reader precision studies in the non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head & neck (SCCHN).  For these tumors, the Ventana SP263 assay has a 
fully reproducibility data package supporting cut -off and scoring algor ithm.  Following completion 
of ATLANTIC and HAWK clinical trials, the assay will be associated with clinical utility.  In 
other cancer types (bladder, pancreatic, gastric, hepatocellular, triple negative breast, ovarian, esophageal, nasopharyngeal, glioblas toma, soft tissue sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, small cell 
lung, melanoma and cervical HPV+ cancers), the Ventana SP263 assay has only limited clinical performance data.   
 Sample collection for PD -L1 testing  
• The preferred tumor sample for the determination of a patient’s PD -L1 status is the one 
taken following the completion of the most recent prior line of therapy.  Samples taken at this time reflect the current PD -L1 status of the tumor and considered clinically most 
relevant.  
 
• Samples should be collected via a core needle of 18 gauge or larger or be collected by [CONTACT_122925].  Where institutional practice uses a smaller gauge 
needle, samples should be evaluated for tumor cell quantity (i.e., >100 tumor cells) to allow 
for adequate PD -L1 immunohistochemistry analyses.   
• When the collection of a new sample is not clinically appropriate, archival samples may be 
utilized provided the specimen it is not older than12 months .  When archival samples are 
used to assess PD -L1 status, the age of the sample / date of collection should be captured.   
• Samples submitted for PD -L1 testing should be formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin.  
Samples from fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (FNA) or decalcified bone are not appropriate for PD -
L1 analysis.   
Sam ple data collection for PD -L1 testing  
The following fields of data should be collected from the site/institution collecting and if, indicated 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_122899]:   
• Patient identifier (ecode or unique identifier)  
• Specimen identifier (written on the specimen)  
• Site identifier  
• Specimen collection date  
• Type of specimen submitted 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :140818

53 
 • Quantity of specimen 
• Date of sectioning 
• Archival of fresh tumor 
• Tumor type 
• Primary tumor location  
• Metastatic tumor location (if applicable)  
• Fixative  
The following fields of data should be collected from PD -L1 testing laboratory: 
• Are the negative and positive controls stained correctly 
• Is the H&E material acceptable  
• Is morphology acceptable 
• Total percent positivity of PD -L1 in tumor cells  
• PD-L1 status (positive, negative or NA) in tumor cells  
• Total percent positivity of PD -L1 in infiltrating immune cells  
The Ventana SP263 assay to measure PD -L1 in tumors is experimental.  As with all tests, there is 
a chance of false positive (the test shows high PD -L1 when it is not there) or fals e negative (the 
test does not show PD-L1 when it is there) results may occur.   
 
Sample processing and if indicated submission process for PD -L1 testing  
Preparing Stored samples for testing 
• Where samples already exist, they should be retrieved from the Bio- Bank storage location.  
These blocks should undergo quality review, prior to evaluation or shipment.  Where it is not possible or indicated to ship the block to a testing laboratory, unstained slides should be prepared from the paraffin- embedded tumor sample block (described below) prior to 
evaluation or shipment.  
 
Preparing newly acquired samples for PD-L1 testing 
• If patients are undergoing a biopsy procedure that provides the option to submit newly acquired samples, this sample should be used to determine PD -L1 status. Where clinically 
acceptable, a minimum of 2 core biopsies should be collected and processed to FFPE in a single block.  The provision of 2 cores is advised in order to provide sufficient tissue for 
PD-L1 assessment. 
 
• It is recommended that core needle tumor biopsies are collected using an 18 gauge or larger 
needle and the process should be image -guided.  Excisional or incisional samples are also 
adequate.  If this is not per the institutions normal practice and a smaller gauge needle is 
used then the number of cores collected should be increased to allow sufficient material for 
successful PD -L1 testing (>100 tumor cells) and embedded in the same block.  If available, 
a single excisional biopsy of at least 4 mm in diameter may substitute for all core biopsies.  
Fixation of biopsy samples for PD- L1 testing  
• Previously frozen tissue is not acceptable for processing to FFPE for PD -L1 testing.  To 
fix newly acquired tissue, place immediately (within 30 min of excision) into an adequate

54 
 volume of 10% v/v neutral buffered formalin (NBF).  Samples should remain in fixative 
for 24 – 48 hours at room temperature.   
• It is vital that there is an adequate volume of fixative relevant to the tissue (at least a 10 volume excess) and that large specimens (if any) are incised prior to fixation to promote efficient tissue preservation.  
 
Embedding in paraffin for PD- L1 testing  
• An overnight processing schedule into paraffin wax is recommended  
• Below is the suggested routine overnight processing schedule:  
Storage of tumor blocks for PD- L1 testing  
• FFPE blocks should be stored at ambient temperature and protected from light until 
shipment by [CONTACT_122926]. FFPE blocks are stable under these conditions 
for an indefinite period.  
Quality control of samples to be used for PD- L1 testing  
• Tissue should be assessed by [CONTACT_122927]-L1 testing.   
• Each sample should be reviewed for:  
• Adequate fixation  
• Good preservation of morphology 
• Presence of tumor tissue 
• Histopathology consistent with indication  
• Greater than 100 tumor cells are required to determine PD -L1 status – tumor cell 
content must be reviewed prior to testing in order for PD-L1 obtain a valid result.   
If indicated, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_122900] a PD-L1 testing laboratory 
• When submitting sample to for PD -L1 testing the recommendation is to ship the block in 
order for sectioning to occur at the laboratory.  Blocks should be shipped  - containing enough  material to  be provided to allow a minimum of 5, and preferably 10, sections to be cut (each 4  micron thick) to be used for PD-L1 testing.    
Sectioning instructions 
• Where it is not possible or indicated to ship the block to laboratory for PD -L1 testing, 
unstained slides should be prepared from the paraffin- embedded tumor sample block as 
described belo w:   
• A minimum of 5 -10 x 4 micron (μm) thick, unstained sections should be provided 
for PD -L1 testing  
• A new disposable microtome blade must be used for each block to prevent contamination between Slides are stable under these conditions for 6 months.

 • The sections should be dried overnight between room temperature and 37°C. Do 
not dry sections at temperatures above 37°C. 
Sections should be stored at ambient temperature  and protected from light until use or shipment to 
testing lab by [CONTACT_122926].  It is recommended that slides are cut freshly prior to PD-L1 testing and they are used within [ADDRESS_138337]. Venu Pi[INVESTIGATOR_122901]’s  lab will oversee the collection of fresh tissue during this biopsy. Tissue will 
be collected for tumor slice culture (TSC) preparation as described below. In cases where biopsies yield insufficient tissue for both TSC and PDL1 testing, TSC testing will take priority. Any tissue not used for tumor slice culture will be submitted for PDL1 testing.  TSC Preparation  
Fresh treatment biopsy tissue in excess of that required for central IHC will be mounted and sliced (250 µm) using a Leica vibrating microtome. This tissue will be placed in 24- well plates in 
an air -liquid interface culture system using media optimized by [CONTACT_122928]. 
Experiment #1 – Immune cell populations 
TSC will be cultured for 1 to 6 days with control antibody, DMSO control, nivolumab (dose to 
be determined) alone, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 µM) alone, or a combination of both drugs.   IHC for CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD68  
When adequate tissue is available for replicates, we will perform flow cytometry on enzyme-
digested, disaggregated slices to measure:  
Macrophage phenotype (CD68, HLA-DR, CD163, CD115, CD206) T cell phenotype (general): CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25 
T cell memory phenotype (CD45RO, CD127, CD28, CD27, CD62L, CCR7) 
T cell inhibitor phenotype (PD- 1, CTLA -4, LAG3, TIM3) 
Tumor immune related markers (PD -L1, class I MHC, HLA- DR) 
 
Experiment #2 – Induction of CD8+ T cell function 
Upon completion of each culture period after drug treatment, slices will be treated with SR -
FLICA caspase 3/7 assay reagent (Immunochemistry Technologies) for 1 hr, fixed, and then stained with DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_122902]. Fixed tumor slices will then be paraffin embedded and sectioned. IHC will be performed for CD8 and Ki67 
(to measure proliferation) or granzyme B (to measure cytotoxic activity) or cleaved caspase 3 (to 
measure apoptosis). Number of positive cells for each marker will be determined.  Experiment #3 – Correlation of induction of cytotoxic T cell function with PD -L1 
expression  
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :[ADDRESS_138338] access to the centrally determined PD -L1 expression so that we will be able to 
correlate our CD8+ T cell functional data with induction of CD8+ T cell function. 
 
Experiment #4 – Correlation of i nduction of cytotoxic T cell function with clinical response  
We will use multivariate statistics to test the hypothesis that the degree of immune checkpoint inhibition -triggered CD8+ T cell activation and carcinoma cell death in TSC predicts response in 
our ongoing clinical trial.  
  Experiment #5 – Rescue of drug -refractory CD8+ T cell activation   
Biopsies from patients with lack of clinical response will be placed in TSC and treated with 
combinations of nivolum ab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122903] (GITR, LAG-3, TIM- 3, CTLA -4), as this strategy may overcome 
T cell exhaustion.(Lu et al., 2014)  
 
Experiment #6 – Correlation between T cell infiltrate and immunosuppressive signals  
IHC of tumor tissue for cellular subtypes (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD68) and 
immunosuppressive molecules (PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, LAG- 3, CTLA -4, IL -10, TGF- beta1, IDO, 
FASL). We will use multivariate statistics to correlate T cell infiltrate density and level of 
immunosuppressive signaling. Furthermore, we will be able to confirm whether the tumors fall 
into their expected category of level of T cell infiltration, as we believe that the immunophenotype is more important than traditional histology in determining response to immune checkpoint inhibition.  
Experiment #7 – CD8+ T cell suppression  
The proliferation of CD8+ TIL from TSC (cultured with or without exogenous IL- 2 +/- 
CD3/CD28 beads) will be measured in two ways: directly by [CONTACT_15915]67 staining, and indirectly by 
[CONTACT_122929]. In both cases T SC will be 
fixed, embedded and double stained after 1 to 6 days in culture to determine what percentage of CD8+ T cells are cycling. Duplicate slices will be digested with collagenase- DNAse -
hyaluronidase cocktail in rotating flasks to obtain a single- cell suspension. CD8+ T cell 
proliferation and activation state, as well as macrophage polarization, will be tested using a 
multi-color flow cytometry panel. We will correlate these data with those from Experiment #1 to 
determine if high -level expression of multiple immunosuppressive signals has functional 
consequences in the TSC.  
Experiment #8 – Combination immune checkpoint inhibition  
TSC will be cultured for 1 to 6 days with control antibody or nivolum ab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]   (dose 
to be determined). 
Upon completion of each culture period, slices will be treated with SR- FLICA caspase 3/7 assay

8. SAFETY AND REPORTING  
 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_138344] be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified procedure (e.g., a follow-up skin biopsy). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or death related solely to progression of the underlying disease will not be considered an SAE. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specified procedures. The investigator should report any SAE occurring after the se 
aforementioned time periods, which is believed to be related to study drug or protocol- specified 
procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness;  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form. 
An appropriate SAE form (e.g.  ex-US = CIOMS form or [LOCATION_003] = Medwatch form) should be 
used to report SAEs to BMS. The BMS protocol ID number must be included on whatever form is submitted by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator.  
o The CIOMS form is available at: http://www.cioms.ch/index.php/cioms- form -i  
o The MedWatch form is available at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM048334.pdf

• In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all reported SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Investigator notification of these events will be in the form of a S[LOCATION_003]R Report.

 o Other important findings which m ay be reported by [CONTACT_122931] (ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an 
SAE considered associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant safety finding from a nonclinical (e.g., animal) study, important safety recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or sponsor decision to end or temporarily halt a clinical study for sa fety reasons.  
o Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central IRB/IEC for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
o In addition to the Sponsor Investigator’s responsibility to report events to their local HA, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_122932] (either as expedited and/or i n aggregate 
reports).  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS within [ADDRESS_138345] be recorded on either CIOMS or MedWatch form & pregnancies must be reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form or can be submitted on the aforementioned SAE form to BMS.

SAE Facsimile Number:  +[PHONE_1161] 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS (or designee) 
using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
8.1 DEFINITIONS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe)  
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :140818 
Protocol version 3.0  April  17, 2019 
 
63 
 • requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE  below) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgme nt, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
Although pregnancy, overdose, potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI), and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported 
as an SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or death related solely to progression of the underlying disease 
will not be considered an SAE. 
NOTE : (PI [INVESTIGATOR_122905]. This is supplemental information that is included in 
BMS -sponsored trials) 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]:  
− a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life- threatening event)  
− elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
− admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
− routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
− Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentati on is required in these cases.  
− Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
− Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies to oncology protocols)

64 
 − Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or death related solely to progression of the underlying disease will 
not be considered an SAE.  
 
8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. 
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following: 
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administrati on and the AE. 
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and 
the AE.  
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.) 
 
 
 
8.3 NONSERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
• Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or 
final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [e.g., IND 
US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
• Non-serious AE informa tion should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
A non- serious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
Non-serious Adverse Event Col lection and Reporting  
The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. All non-serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment- related) should be collected 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :[ADDRESS_138346] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported to BMS as such. 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately: 
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug discontinued or 
interrupted 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than lab oratory term would be used by 
[CONTACT_9673] (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Specific criteria for identifying potential DILI have not been identified for this protocol. 
Standard medical practice in identifying and monitoring hepatic issues should be followed. 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs. 
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times  upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
2) Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_138347], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase) 
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs. 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :[ADDRESS_138348] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary  for participant).  
The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_555] of this event via either the CIOMS, MedWatch or appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.  
Protocol- required procedures for stu dy discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the 
participant.  
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the CIOMS, MedWatch or appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  A BMS Pregnancy Surveillance Form may be provided upon request. 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.  
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE.  
Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, X -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a non-serious or serious AE, as app ropriate, and reported accordingly.

v. 5) during the trial treatment period or up to [ADDRESS_138350] investigational drug infusion. The likelihood of observing more than 3 Grade 4+ drug- related adverse event s is 80% if the true

 rate is 20% and the likelihood is 91% if the true rate is 25%.   This rule has an 83% chance of 
prematurely discontinuing trial enrollment after the 1st 10 patients are enrolled if the true rate  of 
Grade 4 drug related toxicity  is 40%.  The study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_65564]/Fred Hutch Cancer Consortium Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All patients enrolled in the study, including those in the run-in phase will be included in the 
analysis of toxicity and efficacy.  Safety and tolerability is the primary endpoint of this study, and all patients enrolled will be assessed for this endpoint. Adverse events will be recorded and graded based on CTCAE v. 5, and their relationship to the experimental agents reported.   Similarly, all patients enrolled in the study (i.e. , the initial 6 patient cohort, and the additional 14 
patient expansion) will be included in the efficacy analyses.  Clinical responses to the combination of nivolumab,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122906] 1.1 criteria.  Oncologic outcome endpoints such as progression free and overall survival will be calculated from the date of study enrollment, until disease pro gression or death from any 
cause, respectively. Survival estimates will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
 Exploratory endpoints of this study include correlative work performed on research serum and tissue samples.   
Sample size determination  
There are multiple ongoing studies in various tumor types exploring the activity of nivolumab 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In a published report of the combination in patients with advanced NSCLC treated on a phase I study (Checkmate, 012), treatment related serious adverse events were 
observed in 28% of patients (Hellmann Lancet Oncol 2017). This study plans to accrue 20 
patients, a sample size that would allow us to estimate grade 3 or higher acute drug related toxicity rate of  30% with a confidence interval of 20% (95% confidence level) or an upper bound 
of 50%. This would allow us to reasonably exclude a clinically significant increase in toxicity 
with the addition of radiation therapy to the nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122907].
 
9. STUDY MANAGEMENT  
All investigators on the protocol will receive formal training in the ethical conduct of human research.  Institutional support of trial monitoring is provided in accordance with the C ancer 
Consortium’s data and safety monitoring plan 
Clinical Study Protocol RG1718030  
Drug Substance : Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_122869] :140818 
Protocol version 3.0  April  17, 2019 
 
68 
  
Monitoring of the study  
Institutional support of trial monitoring will be in accordance with the Fred Hutch/University of 
Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Under the provisions of this plan, Fred Hutch Clinical Research Support coordinates data and compliance 
monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_51760], contract research organizations, or Fred Hutch employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the study. Independent monitoring visits occur at specified intervals determined by [CONTACT_122933].  
 In addition, protocols are reviewed as needed by [CONTACT_122934] (DSMC), Fred Hutch Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Review Board (IRB). The review committees evaluate accrual, adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and adherence to the applicable data and safety monitoring plan for studies actively enrolling or treating patients. The 
IRB reviews the study progress and safety information to assess continued acceptability of the risk-benefit ratio for human subjects. Approval of committees as applicable is necessary to 
continue the study. The trial will comply with the standard guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_122935], state, and federal guidelines.  
 
Data Mana gement  
The Protocol Director, or her designees, will prepare and maintain adequate and ac curate 
participant case histories with observations and other data pertinent to the study.  Original source 
documents should be transcribed to Case Report Forms (CRFs) and used to analyze the study data.  Source documents include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical charts, laboratory and pharmacy 
records, and recorded electronic data. 
 All data required by [CONTACT_122936]. Any corrections to data required into the paper case report forms must be made in such a wa y that the 
original entry is not obscured. Only designated study staff will enter data for study participants after study visits. Case report forms will be checked against source document data by [CONTACT_464]. Patient records will be kept in a secure locati on at the University of Washington accessible only 
to research authorized personnel. The patient identity will be kept as confidential as possible as 
required by [CONTACT_2371]. Except as required by [CONTACT_2371], the patient will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social 
security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier. Study subjects will be assigned an ID code. Information about the code will be kept in a secure location and access limited to research study personnel. The results of this research study may be presented at scientific or medical meetings or published in scientific journals. However, the 
patient identity will not be disclosed. The patient's personal data which may be included in the 
investigator’s database shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

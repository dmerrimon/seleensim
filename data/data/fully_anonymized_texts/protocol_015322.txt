1.Objectives
1.1. Purpose, specific aims, or objectives:
Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk for elevated distress related to their 
diabetes.1-3 This is of critical concern as high diabetes distress is strongly associated with poor 
glycemic control, adherence, and other psychological disorders.1,4-11 Given that intensive 
treatment is required  to adequately  manage diabetes,  adolescents with T1D face unique 
challenges at their developmental stage, which universally is a period of increased risk.12,13 
Integrated psychosocial  care is suboptimal despi[INVESTIGATOR_733002]14,15 due to high costs, limited availability of proven interventions,  and a lack of 
trained clinicians  to deliver those  interventions.16 
One barrier to improving  the experiences  and outcomes for adolescents  with T1D may be the 
lack of opportunities for them to develop “resilience resources,” or skills to help manage 
challenges, such as stress-management,  goal-setting, positive reframing,  and meaning-making. 
Promoting resilience resources may mitigate  negative outcomes such  as diabetes distress, 
facilitate adherence,  and help adolescents  better navigate the challenges of T1D, particularly as 
they begin to become more independent  from their caregivers in all facets of their life.17-[ADDRESS_1001419]  developed conceptual frameworks of resilience in 
pediatric illness,20,22,23 affirmed  associations between resilience  resources and outcomes,21,24-28 
and developed  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a novel resilience  resources intervention (Promoting  Resilience in 
Stress Management, PRISM).29 PRISM is a skills-based, one-on-one training  program consisting 
of two, 45-60 minute sessions followed by a family-meeting and supported by [CONTACT_733038] a digital  app designed  specifically for the adolescent population. Feasibility has been tested 
in adolescents with diabetes,29 cancer,29 cystic fibrosis,30 and currently in patients  with craniofacial 
disorder and end-stage  renal  disease.  We recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_733003] (RCT)  comparing PRISM  to usual care among  adolescents with cancer. Results suggest 
PRISM is feasible,  highly acceptable, and associated with higher patient-reported  resilience and 
quality of life, and lower risk of psychological distress  [ADDRESS_1001420] comparing  PRISM to usual care among youth  with 
T1D (13-18  years with suboptimal glycemic control (elevated A1C)  and diabetes distress as 
measured with a validated scale).
  
1.2. Hypotheses to be tested:
  
1.Evaluate PRISM’s efficacy in reducing  A1C. The primary outcome  will be A1C at 6-months 
post-enrollment. Hypothesis: PRISM will be associated with lower  A1C compared to usual 
care at 6-months  post-enrollment. As an exploratory aim, for the subset of participants on 
continuous glucose monitors (approx. 30% of expected population), we will also examine 
PRISM’s effect on sensor glucose time in range. A1C and time in range will be assessed for 
a total duration  of [ADDRESS_1001421]-intervention.
2.Evaluate PRISM’s efficacy in improving diabetes distress.  Self-reported adherence and 
other Patient-Reported Outcomes  (PROs), including resilience and quality of life will also be

2.Background
2.1. Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge:
  
Over a third of adolescents with T1D face elevated diabetes-specific distress.1-3 
Diabetes distress, or negative  emotional response  to the burden of diabetes, is concerning  given  
its strong and established association  with poor glycemic  control.1,9-11 A potential explanation  
for elevated diabetes distress  is that adolescents lack skills to manage their  stressors. 
Several personal  resources  and skills are consistently associated  with resilience to stress, which 
may mitigate  negative  and facilitate positive  outcomes.28,32,33 These  include stress-management,  
problem-solving and goal-setting  skills, cognitive  reframing, and the ability to make  meaning  from 
adversity.17-21,34 We term this group of variables “resilience resources.”   Previous work in youth  
with T1D has shown  resilience  resources relate  to glycemic control, diabetes distress, and other 
important outcomes;17-21 hence,  skills-based  interventions bolstering resilience resources may 
improve both diabetes distress  and A1C.35-38 
The Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) Intervention has the potential 
to reduce distress in a feasible, age-appropriate intervention while improving health 
outcomes in adolescents  with T1D.  PRISM was developed based  on stress  and copi[INVESTIGATOR_733004] a brief, disease non-specific, skills-based intervention  targeting  adolescent resilience 
resources (Table  1). PRISM  teaches 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_733005], goal 
setting, cognitive restructuring  and benefit-finding in a one-on-one  training program consisting  of 
two, 45-60 minute sessions  and supported by 6-months of booster  sessions and a fully developed 
digital app for practice and tracking. A family session  follows the individual  sessions and was 
designed for the adolescent to communicate  to his/her caregiver(s) the skills learned, and how 
the caregiver(s) could best support  ongoing practice. Results from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_733006] (RCT) in cancer suggest PRISM is associated  with improved adolescent distress and 
resilience scores.[ADDRESS_1001422] been  reported  to be desirable in this population.29

2.2. Relevant preliminary data:1
  
 Preliminary  studies. Our central  hypothesis  is that promoting resilience resources will improve  
outcomes for adolescents  with T1D.  We define  “resilience  resources”  as several modifiable 
factors of cognitive,  emotional and physical well-being, including individual  perceptions of stress, 
and abilities to set goals and find meaning  from adversity.[ADDRESS_1001423], we conducted  cross-sectional, mixed-methods studies across 
diverse populations of chronic/serious  illness to explore the construct  of resilience in association  
with distress  and health  outcomes. Our research group consistently  confirmed associations 
between lower  resilience resources,  higher distress,  and worse health outcomes.21,23,25,[ADDRESS_1001424] of stress  on worsening glycemic control, 
thereby [CONTACT_6076] a protective factor.25,26,28,41 Subsequent  thematic analyses in adolescents with 
cancer suggested  that adolescents endorse the need  for strong resilience resources, but that they 
lack the skills.22  
 Intervention Development.  These studies provided rationale for the design  of a novel 
intervention to promote resilience  resources,  “Promoting Resilience in Stress 
Management” (PRISM, Table 1).29 PRISM  is based on stress  and copi[INVESTIGATOR_163648],42 our prior 
research, and successful  interventions  described in other  populations.43-45 It is disease non-
specific and manualized (i.e., it has been standardized  via comprehensive protocols). The initial 
design was refined  with expert  opi[INVESTIGATOR_733008], psychologists, 
and social workers.  PRISM’s overall objective  is to increase  resilience  resources  at times of high 
stress, thereby [CONTACT_733040], and improve health  outcomes.  
Feasibility and Acceptability of PRISM. We completed a formative  study  of PRISM among 
adolescents with T1D and cancer  to determine  the optimal  content and timing of PRISM 
sessions.29 We found it to be feasible  and highly valuable to adolescent patients and 
parents. Eighty percent of participants  completed  the intervention and feedback was universally 
positive. One primary disease-specific difference emerged: participants with diabetes preferred 
fewer but longer sessions whereas  those with cancer  preferred more frequent, shorter  sessions.

Thus, the four PRISM  intervention pi[INVESTIGATOR_733009]. We successfully trained 3 interventionists (all research associates (RAs) with 
undergraduate degrees). Each underwent at least 8 hours of training, and tracking of per-patient 
intervention delivery time suggested  4 hours  of face-to-face time, 2 hours tracking/scheduling, 
and up to 2 hours of fidelity  review (total ~8 hours per patient).
PRISM Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 02340884).  Next, in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_733010] (AYA)  with cancer, we refined processes of enrollment,  
randomization, implementation,  and data collection. We completed our target enrollment of 100 
AYAs with cancer ahead  of schedule, with a 78% enrollment rate. Final  pi[INVESTIGATOR_733011]-reported resilience  and distress with 
moderate effect sizes.31 
 PRISM App Development. Finally,  a digital app has been  designed, developed and beta-
tested specifically  for adolescents, providing  supplemented practice and resources throughout 
the intervention. The app was designed and built by [CONTACT_733041]-based companies  [Artefact 
(artefactgroup.com) and General  UI (generalui.com)], prior PRISM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and the SCH Digital 
Health team.   The current  platform  is available for iOS and Android programs  and includes the 
same practice opportunities  (e.g., directed practice with goal-setting,  journaling of gratitudes, etc.) 
as paper-pencil worksheets.  The digital  interface also allows  study staff to track how frequently  
users open each  practice page, how long they stay on it, and how they use it over time. The app 
is not available on the app store,  so the study  team can closely  monitor  how and when it is 
disseminated.
  
2.3. Scientific  or scholarly background:
  
Practical challenges limit the success and generalizability of traditional behavioral 
interventions. Time commitments  associated with traditional psychological interventions like 
cognitive behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  can be prohibitive for adolescents. The average refusal rate 
for CBT in adolescent chronic disease  settings is 37%;  subsequent attrition  is up to 32%, meaning  
over half of patients  offered  CBT fail to initiate or complete the intervention.[ADDRESS_1001425]-effectiveness. Shorter 
skills-based interventions  with booster content  delivered remotely  may be more successful in 
adolescents.49,50 
Stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_524946]42 provides an excellent model for intervention development . 
The stress  and copi[INVESTIGATOR_733012]-being  during  illness:  1) dispositional factors, 2) situational  factors  such as stress  
management and goal-setting,  and 3) copi[INVESTIGATOR_733013] (i.e., cognitive 
reframing).44 Each of these  impacts appraisals  of stressors and the means to cope effectively with 
stress. While  dispositional  factors  may be difficult to change, the Promoting Resilience in Stress  
Management (PRISM)  intervention will teach  the skills  aligned  with situational factors and copi[INVESTIGATOR_733014]-related stressors  in a more  adaptive way 
and use more  effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_733015]. “Disease outcomes”  in our case  includes  both A1C and diabetes distress and the

for adolescents with T1D posits that enhancing  individual  strengths (referred  to in this 
proposal as “resilience  resources”)  helps  adolescents manage  stressors  and risk factors 
(diabetes-specific and general sources  of stress) in order to achieve positive outcomes. 
The positive outcomes include psychological/behavioral outcomes (e.g., diabetes  
distress) and clinical outcomes (e.g.,  A1C). This diabetes-specific model  complements the

A1C was selected as the primary  outcome as it is the gold standard  of overall diabetes-related  
health status and for its known  association  with diabetes  distress.1,9,11 Given  the known limitations 
of A1C as a clinically meaningful  outcome, however, we will also evaluate participant time in range 
(70-180 mg/dl) for those  using CGM as it is more specific and sensitive than traditional  A1C testing 
(i.e. an intervention  that addresses  acute  instances  of hypo- or hyperglycemia  may be detected  
in a time in range  assessment  but not in an A1C assessment).51 Additionally,  time in range may 
be more likely to associate with PROs compared  with A1C given its overall representation  of 
patient experience.51 Diabetes distress  was selected  given strong evidence  that distress is linked

5.1. Study  design:[ADDRESS_1001427] of PRISM compared to usual care among adolescents with 
T1D and clinically  elevated  distress scores (PAID-T≥307,52). We intend to enroll [ADDRESS_1001428] to randomize 160-176 people.  
We will use a stratified randomization scheme  with 1:1 allocation  to PRISM or usual care (n=80-
88 each).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_733042]-assigned adolescents will be scheduled 
for two PRISM standard  sessions  (one-on-one skills-based sessions directed at stress-
management, goal-setting,  positive reframing,  and meaning-making), followed by [CONTACT_31806] “Coming 
Together” session (facilitated  family-meeting during which the adolescent may share what  was 
learned). All sessions will be offered  in-person,  by [CONTACT_169993]-based  video chat, or over the phone at a 
time interval of every 2 weeks. Boosters (1:[ADDRESS_1001429] probing 
about progress and roadblocks)  will be delivered every [ADDRESS_1001430] enrollment,  
at which  point they will be offered monthly  until the end of month 6. The digital app (and/or  paper 
worksheets) will be available  throughout the intervention, but will not include individualized 
communication through the app. Surveys will be collected from adolescents in both arms upon

enrollment and every 3 months  for 12 months.   Finally, A1C will be collected at each clinic visit 
and continuous  glucose monitor (CGM) data (where applicable) will be collected.  
  
5.2. Research procedures:[ADDRESS_1001431] kit (if A1c is not available  in the chart 
in the prior 4 weeks) and then will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1001432]  psychosocial  support  (usual care) will be offered regardless of 
randomization. In order to provide the blood spot,  the participant or their parent will need to do a 
finger poke using  the lancet provided  within the test kit. The blood collection lancet is an FDA 
510K cleared device,  which is what the patient  will use to poke their finger  and collect the blood 
on the paper. The test itself is cleared  by [CONTACT_4760] a moderately complex test (under lab test 
regulations). The blood spot cards we will be utilizing (Whatman  903 cards)  are approved  by [CONTACT_733043]. 
PRISM Intervention.  The total intervention consists of two, approx. 45-[ADDRESS_1001433] session follows, which includes both the adolescent  and participating 
caregiver(s) (“Coming  Together”).  Although the intervention framework  is not disease-specific,  
diabetes-specific examples  will be provided  for each topic  to enhance the relevance of the skills 
to participants’  daily diabetes-related stressors. A trained research associate  (RA) conducts the 
intervention, as described in previous models and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].29,[ADDRESS_1001434] session occurs  
within 2 weeks of enrollment,  ideally in-person (alternative  formats listed below) and in conjunction 
with the enrollment  visit. The 2nd and 3rd sessions are scheduled approximately  every 2-4 weeks 
around the participant’s preferences. There can be flexibility with combining or separating PRISM  
skills based on patient preference (e.g., participant  becomes fatigued after stress management 
component, goal-setting can occur during a separate scheduled time). When visits cannot  be 
conducted in-person, alternatives include web-based video chat (i.e., webex, skype, zoom, 
whatsapp), or by [CONTACT_648]/conference  call. Following the 3rd session through  week  12, participants 
receive bi-weekly “booster”  contacts (1:[ADDRESS_1001435])  
to practice/refresh skills  and check-ins  on how skills have  been utilized. These boosters will then 
be delivered monthly  in months 4-6. In addition, all AYA PRISM  participants have access  to the 
digital PRISM app, which  offers  an interactive practice and tracking  interface  to continue  
enhancing skills.  While the app provides additional opportunities  to practice the skills they have 
learned in-person, there is no personalized communication provided in the app between  the 
interventionist and participant.  The participant  is not required to use the app (paper-pencil  
worksheets are also available  for those who do not want to use an app).
Interventionist Training  and Fidelity.  PRISM has been standardized through the creation  of 
comprehensive interventionist  protocols. All interventionists  undergo at least 4 hours  of in-person 
training including role-playing, dynamic  feedback, and mock sessions. The fidelity  of sessions will 
be systematically assessed  via audio-recording.  Any session can be audio-recorded with the 
participant’s permission.   A PI [INVESTIGATOR_733018] 3, and then [ADDRESS_1001436]  throughout the course  of the interventions.  
Recordings will be scored  for fidelity with a standardized tool. Interventionists will receive

based screening for psychosocial  stressors  and diabetes-related distress.  For both sites, every  
diabetes patient is cared for by a team of diabetes specialists which includes a provider (MD,  
Physician Assistant and/or  Nurse  Practitioner), diabetes educator,  and social worker. 
Subspecialty referrals  for additional mental  health,  nutritional or other support are made  at the 
discretion of the primary diabetes  provider. 
Upon completion of the study, all participants  in the usual care arm will be given access  to the 
PRISM app. The app contains  self-directed teachings of the [ADDRESS_1001438] data about subjects:[ADDRESS_1001439]  of care across  
both sites from trained medical staff drawing blood  samples using the fingerstick  method. Blood 
assays are analyzed immediately using  the DCA 2000 Hemoglobin HbA1C system  (Siemens-
Bayer). Patients with virtual  clinic visits and/or no Hba1c recorded  within the prior [ADDRESS_1001440]-burden  of a central lab and 
also mimics other large, multisite studies (e.g., T1D Exchange and SEARCH for Diabetes in 
Youth).HbA1C will be tracked  at each visit after enrollment  from their medical  record  or an at-
home A1c blood spot test kit will be provided for the patient, which  has been  routinely incorporated  
into care at Seattle  Children’s  since May of 2020.  Given  recent consensus reports  recommending 
attention to additional glycemic metrics beyond HbA1c,  for those patients using CGMs,  we will 
also collect time in range  (percentage of readings in the range of 70–180 mg/dL).[ADDRESS_1001441] they do with their providers, which is part of usual 
clinical care.

Aim 2 Measures. Diabetes distress  will be assessed with the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale

diabetes.7,[ADDRESS_1001444] been reported52 and this tool is used  as part of 
clinical care in the SCH Diabetes Clinic. It is the only measure of diabetes  distress developed and 
validated purposely for use with adolescents  and measures emotional  distress  related to the 
challenges of living with type 1 diabetes more specifically than measures of general distress  or 
depressive symptoms. The parent-version  will be administered to assess  parental distress  about 
his/her child’s  diabetes.  Self-reported  resilience will be measured with the 10-item version of the 
Connor-Davidson Resilience  Scale  (CD-RISC).54,55 This instrument has excellent psychometric

Adolescents’ diabetes-specific “strengths” (i.e., positive behaviors and attitudes related to the 
challenges of living with T1D)  will be assessed with the Diabetes  Strengths and Resilience 
measure (DSTAR),  a 12-item self-report  measure  with strong psychometric properties.41 Only 
adolescents will complete  the DSTAR, and there are two versions (one for 13-17  and one for 
18+). Adolescent benefit-finding  will be measured with the Benefit Finding Scale For Children 
(BFSC),57 which is a 10-item  instrument with good psychometric properties, which  has been 
utilized to assess benefit-finding in pediatric patients,  including adolescents with type 1 diabetes.58 
Adolescents will complete  the BFSC. Adolescent depressive symptoms  will be measured with the 
8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), a widely  used instrument among general 
populations and patients with chronic  illness.59-61This instrument has excellent psychometric

type 1 diabetes (T1D). Parents will complete the parent-version  which assesses their own 
HRQOL.63 The Self-Care Inventory-Short Form (SCI-SF)  and the Diabetes  Self Management 
Questionnaire (DSMQ)  will be used  to assess self-reported adherence. The SCI-R is a 14-item 
measure assessing perceptions of adherence to diabetes  self-care recommendations over the 
previous 1–2 weeks, which has been  adapted to a 9-item shorter  form to include only the aspects  
of adherence that relate to diabetes  control64,65 SCI-R assesses four domains of adherence

5.4. Data to be collected,  including long–term follow– up data:11
  
Data collection and management. Systematic data collection,  quality control, and data-
management procedures will be implemented including: (1) protocols for data collection; (2) 
rigorous training and oversight  of study staff with ongoing monitoring of adherence to protocols; 
(3) regular  review  of questionnaire  response  rates and missing items  to identify and correct 
problems; (4) verification  of all data through computerized data entry systems restricting 
invalid/out-of-range responses; and, (5) weekly team meetings and progress reports to provide  
feedback to study staff concerning  difficulties  and follow-up to ensure problems are resolved 
quickly. 
A1C and CGM data: Study staff will take extra steps to ensure primary outcome data is 
obtained. This will include careful  tracking of all participants to ensure regular clinic visits are 
scheduled and attended, and reminder  phone  calls and texts prior to the appointment. In cases  
where the 3-month  window  is passed,  participants  will be reminded to schedule their Standard of 
Care appointment  and/or  transferred to Seattle Children’s  scheduling department.  If patients  are 
not scheduled for a standard care appointment and/or the clinic is not offering  labs due to COVID-
19, an at-home A1c test kit will be mailed  to the families to ensure collection of A1c data. Families 
will return  mailed kits  to the CLIA-Certified  laboratory  at each respective institution  (i.e., Seattle 
Children’s or [LOCATION_007] Children’s).

Survey data: To optimize collection, all participant surveys will be available  by [CONTACT_733045],  a secure  HIPAA-compliant,  high-quality  data collection tool. To ensure 
data quality,  a RA will review  surveys for their completion for missing fields or this will be set up 
for automation within RedCap.  
Medical record data:  RAs will collect  and upload  CRF data quarterly during the [ADDRESS_1001448] proximity  
to the date of enrollment  (in instances  in which the patient is not seen  by a provider during the 
enrollment period).  To ensure  reliability and validity of abstracted  medical  record data, we will use 
our current methods for training and quality control, including guided practice  abstraction and 
independent abstraction with reconciliation by a medical Co-I (DeSalvo/Malik). A 10% random 
sample will be dual abstracted.  
  
6.Data and Biospecimen Banking12
6.1. Complete  list of the data and/or biospecimens to be included in the bank:13
  
Surveys, CRFs (e.g., medical record data), a1c results, and audio transcriptions  will be 
coded and labelled with study  ID numbers by [CONTACT_3476]. 
  
6.2. Location of data and/or  biospecimen storage:14
  
All will be stored in original (hard copy) forms in locked  cabinets (where relevant) and/or
password-protected secure databases  (for all electronic survey data). At-home test kit 
A1c data will be stored per laboratory protocols at each respective institution.  
  
6.3. List of those with direct access to data and/or  biospecimens in the bank:
  
Data will not be shared  outside the group of investigators conducting the study at SCH 
and BCM/TCH. When other investigators are interested in new analyses, the PIs will 
verify they have IRB approval to conduct additional  analyses and will be added  to the 
study team. Coded study data will be banked indefinitely for future use by [CONTACT_733046]’s. Future  
studies will formally test the dissemination and implementation potential  of the 
intervention once its efficacy is confirmed.
  
6.4. Length of time data and/or biospecimens will be stored in the bank:
  
Original surveys will be saved for [ADDRESS_1001449], in order to ensure data quality. Coded electronically saved study 
data will be banked indefinitely for future  use by [CONTACT_733047].
  
6.5. Procedures for protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the subjects from whom the data 
and/or biospecimens were collected:15
  
Per 6.1, all banked  data will be coded and labelled with only study ID numbers, not 
identifying information.

There are no restrictions  on future use of de-identified, banked data.
  
6.6.5. Plan for providing data results from banked data/biospecimens:
  
Results of initial analyses will be shared with participants if participants 
request on the consent form that they would like a summary of study results. 
A1C data will be placed in patient’s  chart at Seattle Children’s and sent to 
individual providers  at BCM/TCH with oversight from study site 
endocrinologists Malik  and DeSalvo for each  respective institution.There is 
no plan for results from banked data to be shared with participants.
  
7.Sharing of Results 
7.1. Plan to share  results with subjects/others:18
  
For Phase  1 (Screening),  data will not be shared outside the group of investigators 
conducting the study at SCH  and BCM/TCH. If other investigators are interested  in analyses 
with screening  data,  the PIs will verify  they have IRB approval to conduct analyses. Coded  
screening data will be banked indefinitely for future use by [CONTACT_733047]. Participants will not be informed of their 
specific PAID-T results  in Phase  1, however, participants will be immediately made aware if they 
are eligible  for Phase  2 based  on their survey results. 
For Phase  2 (Full Study), at SCH, data collected from at-home A1c test kits will be 
entered into the patient’s chart as a lab that was performed and will be available to clinical  
providers (as this same test is standard of care for tele-health visits  at SCH). At BCM/TCH,  
data collected  from at-home A1c test kits will be sent to individual providers via EPIC with a 
description of the A1C test, how it was collected, and BCM/TCH laboratory validation  (since this 
test is not standard  of care at BCM/TCHPatients and parents will be notified of this during the 
consent conference.  Other  data will not be shared outside the group of investigators conducting 
the study at SCH and BCM/TCH.When other  investigators are interested  in new analyses, the 
PIs will verify  they have  IRB approval to conduct additional analyses. Coded study data will be 
banked indefinitely for future  use by [CONTACT_733049]’s.   Future  studies will formally test the dissemination  and 
implementation potential  of the intervention once its efficacy is confirmed.  If indicated  by 
[CONTACT_4317], a summary of the primary analyses  will be shared at the study closure.

Aims  [ADDRESS_1001456]  population (e.g., patients, parents,  providers):
  
We will recruit  adolescents and their caregivers from diabetes clinics  at SCH and BCM/TCH. 
Adolescents will be eligible if:

Diagnosed with T1D >=12 months
Elevated distress  score (PAID-T>=30)***** (within the prior 12 months)
Speak  English fluently
Cognitively able to participate in intervention sessions and complete written  surveys.
*****Please note that at BCM/TCH, screening for distress is not Standard of Care.  Therefore, we 
will complete a screening informed consent  (if patient is present in clinic) or an information  sheet 
(if patient is not present in clinic) for patients at BCM/TCH that meet all other  criteria  and then

proceed with the PAID-T screener (via paper/pencil,  verbally,  or REDCap). We call this “Phase 
1” of the consenting process. In Phase 1, PAID-T will only be completed  by [CONTACT_65754].
If interested,  those with an elevated distress score  (PAID-T>=30) will move onto the full informed 
consent process,  will be enrolled on the full study (i.e., “Phase 2” of the consenting process), and 
will go on to complete  baseline questionnaires and be randomized.  Those  who complete the 
screening informed  consent, take the screener (i.e., the PAID-T) and are not eligible for “Phase 
2” of the consent processes (i.e., PAID-T < 30) will be given a $[ADDRESS_1001457].  They will not complete 
the baseline  questionnaires  or be randomized.  At SCH, this process will be followed if a current  
PAID-T (i.e., administered within the prior 12 months) is not available  at the time of consent. For 
all who complete the PAID-T screener as part of “Phase 1” consenting process, PAID-T score  will 
be used as the baseline value. 
Caregivers  will be eligible  for the survey completion if: 
Adolescent of parent or guardian  agrees to participate  in study
Adolescent participant provides verbal  assent or verbal consent  if 18 or

Parent/Guardian is cognitively  and physically  able to participate
Parent/Guardian is able to speak and read English or Spanish  language
Parent/Guardian participant has signed  informed  consent  for study  
participation
Caregivers will be eligible  for the “Coming together” session if: 
Adolescent of parent or guardian  agrees to participate  in study
Adolescent of parent or guardian  has been  randomized to the PRISM 
intervention arm of the study
Adolescent participant provides verbal  assent or verbal consent  if 18 or

9.3. Populations with special considerations, involved in the study:20
☒ Children/Teenagers21
Risk assessment specific to this vulnerable  population  and additional safeguards:22
Individuals who are not yet adults (children,  teenagers): Pediatric patients with serious 
illness are at risk for poor outcomes and may benefit  from resilience-enhancing 
interventions in the future. We justify the inclusion  of children in this project  because  the 
implementation of those interventions requires feasibility information  and patient 
feedback. This study will provide those crucial  data.  Patients enrolling in this study  may, 
in fact, benefit from the intervention; however, at the time of consent, we will ensure  that 
all patients and families  understand  the objective  of this study are to test the feasibility of 
this intervention such that it may be used prospectively in the future (see risks/benefits 
above).

11.Withdrawal of Subjects
11.1. Anticipated circumstances  under which subjects will be withdrawn  from the research without 
their consent:
  
In this intention-to-treat analysis plan, all participants who fill out a baseline  
survey and have a baseline A1c (either collected through medical  record or A1c 
at-home test kit) will be included  in analyses.   As above, withdrawal will be 
determined by [CONTACT_733050]. We 
may also withdraw patients  who do not complete surveys or an A1c within six 
weeks of enrollment.  In rare instances in which the patient/family  encounters a 
mailing issue, we will extend  a 2-week grace  period.  Subjects who withdraw will 
be asked to complete  a short survey  which will simply be a question  as to why 
they have decided to withdraw from the study.
  
11.2. Procedures for orderly termination:
  
We will inform  the family  with a phone  call from an RA or investigator (followed up by 
a written letter or email  from the PI) that they are no longer on study.
  
11.3. Procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including  partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection and withdrawal from 
data/biospecimen banking:
  
Response to the intervention will be determined upon study completion (not in “real-
time,”).  All participants, including those on the intervention arm, will continue  to receive 
usual care, including as-needed referrals  for professional psychology services.  
All participants may choose to withdraw from the study at any time.  We will track date 
of discontinuation  and request a brief reason to be recorded for tracking  purposes.    To 
ensure primary outcome  data, we will offer an abbreviated survey  with only the PAID  
and CD-RISC for those who do not complete  all assessments or who request to drop 
out.
In the event of serious medical complications (or death) precluding participation,  
participants will be censored after 2 months  of missing data. In all other cases (non-
completion of surveys without serious  medical complications or death), staff will 
continue to request  surveys or at-home  A1c test kits until [ADDRESS_1001461] abbreviated survey  packets, we will oblige (see section  
14.2).

12.Risks  to Subjects
12.1. Reasonably foreseeable risks to subjects (include each study population, each arm, and 
optional procedures): 
  
Adolescents with high distress and/or depressive symptoms. Patients who screen 
for high distress and/or high depressive  symptoms regardless of their decision to enroll 
in the study may have their scores shared with a member  of their local diabetes team 
per departmental standard operating procedures. The diabetes  provider  will use relevant 
clinic-specific procedures and his/her discretion  to determine what next steps,  if any, are 
indicated (e.g., social work consult, referral to psychology) with the family. We may also 
reach out to the patient and/or parent to check in and/or provide community/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733019].
Adolescents with high A1c. The study endocrinologist (Malik (SCH) & DeSalvo 
(BCM/TCH)) will be alerted if a patient  takes an at-home A1c test for research purposes  
and score >14%. The study endocrinologist  will then contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary 
diabetes provider to alert the provider of this patient’s score,  and the diabetes provider 
will use relevant clinic-specific procedures and his/her discretion to determine next 
steps. 
A1c At-Home Test Kit. Patients  would  be asked to do a self needle poke on three 
occasions (Baseline, 6 months,  12 months) in order to complete their A1c at home test 
kits. When doing a needle poke, some people  may get a small bruise that will go away  in 
a day or two. Some people may feel dizzy or faint.  There is also a very small chance that 
the patient could get an infection  where the needle pokes  the skin.These risks will be 
outlined in the consent documents  and potential participants would be made aware of 
these risks during  the consent conference. 
PRISM. The intervention (“Promoting Resilience in Stress  Management”, PRISM) and 
our surveys may address sensitive matters  in that it they patients to identify stressors 
and negative thoughts.  Adolescent participants  may be prompted  to think  about the 
threat to their future  posed  by [CONTACT_733051].  During  the coming together  session and/or 
while completing surveys, parent(s)/caregiver(s)  may be prompted  to think about  the 
threat to their child’s future by [CONTACT_37110].  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_493517], 
anxiety, depression, fear or doubt  for adolescents  and/or  their parent(s)/caregiver(s).  
Administrators of the intervention will be trained to immediately inform  the patient’s  
primary social work and/or medical  teams if the patient and/or parents/guardians 
endorses thoughts  of self-harm or harm to others, per the clinic policy for responding to 
suicidal ideation. As part of their informed consent process, participants will be made 
aware of this policy, as well as the fact that confidentiality may be broken in the case that 
providers see an immediate threat to the patient’s or another’s safety. No physical risks 
are expected to arise  from the study.
The primary risk to participants will be concerns  about confidentiality,  and stress of 
discussing the topic of their or their child’s diabetes experience. While the potential risks 
to participants are low, we will take steps to ensure that all potential  risks are handled 
appropriately as described below.
Due to the nature of the PRISM intervention, all staff and participants will be unblinded 
from the time of randomization.

We recognize the unique risks of data collection for an adolescent population. The major 
risk is compromise of personal data. Thus, confidentiality procedures  for all data will be a 
priority for this study.  All  data will be maintained on secure servers accessed by [CONTACT_733052]’s Research  Institute (data collection 
center) or in CLIA-Certified laboratories at SCH and BCM/TCH (for A1c data). Data  and 
paper materials will be stored locally at BCM/TCH as well. The study results will be kept 
for at least ten years or until final analyses  are completed,  whichever occurs  last, in 
order to ensure data quality.  The  subject’s  consent  to use or share PHI does not expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312].  
Access to the buildings  where the study  data will be kept at Seattle Children’s  Research  
Institute and BCM/TCH are limited  to authorized personnel.  The  Lead  RA and other  
researchers involved  in this project  have years of experience and has received ongoing 
training at Seattle Children’s Research Institute or BCM/TCH on confidentiality as well as 
HIPAA confidentiality standards.  Our and other previous trials have kept their data at 
Seattle Children’s Research Institute and BCM/TCH  in the recent  past, and the security 
and confidentiality  of the data have never  been  compromised.
  
12.2. Procedures with unforeseeable risks:
  
Although this study is considered low risk, the study  team has extensive 
experience running  the PRISM  intervention, and we have  not experienced 
unforeseeable risks. IF unanticipated  risks come to the attention  of study  staff,  
the DSMC will be alerted  and if concurrent  with federal law, IRB rules,  and/or 
the investigator manual/SOPs, will be reported as needed to the appropriate 
group(s) (i.e., IRB, DSMC, PI, etc.).
  
12.3. Procedures with risks to an embryo or fetus  should the subject be or become 
pregnant:
  
n/a
  
12.4. Risks to others  who are not subjects:
  
n/a
  
12.5. Procedures performed  to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks:
  
To mitigate  these risks, we will emphasize the voluntary nature of the study to 
adolescents and parents  and that the study will in no way impact or influence  clinical 
care.  We will let adolescents know that their information will be kept confidential and 
that transcripts will be de-identified and audio  recordings destroyed after transcribing. 
We will let patients know that their A1c data may be available to their providers. We will 
let adolescents  know that they can change their mind about participating and may 
decide to withdraw  from the study at any time.  
Each of the participating sites has significant  experience with clinic recruitment  for 
studies and has developed processes to ensure best practices  with each study  
participant recruitment. These procedures and scripts also emphasize that any potential  
coercion on the part of parents should  not take place, and that adolescents’  decision for 
or against participation in the study does not affect  the clinical care they receive.

13.Potential Benefits to Subjects
13.1. Potential benefits that individual  subjects may experience from taking part in the research:[ADDRESS_1001463] better clinical  and 
psychosocial/behavioral outcomes. However, there may be no direct benefit for 
participating in this study if our hypotheses are wrong.  More  broadly, information gained 
from this study may heighten the understanding of the adolescent diabetes  experience  
and elucidate strategies that foster resilience and promote better outcomes in this group 
of high risk patients.   These strategies could be extended to the care of other adolescent 
patients facing  other  chronic diseases. This research has the potential  to contribute to 
the research base concerning the promotion of optimal quality of life and mental  
wellness for all adolescent patients.   
  
14.Data Analysis/Management
14.1. Data analysis plan, including statistical procedures:
  
 Randomization.  The randomization algorithm will be constructed  by [CONTACT_6301] (Zhou 
and Bradford) using  a permuted blocks scheme with varying block sizes; randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. Study  staff will be blinded  to allocation until after enrollment.  
Analysis plan overview.  The primary statistical analyses will be intention-to-treat to avoid 
confounding by [CONTACT_105]-random  participant attrition. Clinical  characteristics including  A1C and time 
in range and items within the surveys will all be summarized at time of enrollment and at 3, 6, 9 
and 12-month  time points using descriptive  statistics:  frequencies and proportions  for categorical 
variables, means and standard deviations for continuous variables, or median and inter-quartile  
range if distribution is skewed.Demographic  characteristics will be collected and summarized  at 
baseline. All analyses  will be adjusted  for site and baseline  A1C,  as randomization is stratified by 
[CONTACT_163669].  In addition,  we will assess for confounding by a priori identified  variables 
associated with distress and A1C including age, gender, race, primary language spoken at home, 
parental education, insurance  status.  If any of these analyses suggest  confounding  or are clearly  
imbalanced between  groups,  subsequent  analyses  will be adjusted accordingly.
 Aim 1 primary  outcome is A1C at 6 months. Because the amount of change depends strongly 
on the initial  value  at baseline  we will control for baseline A1C as a covariate in the regression.  
We will treat A1C as a continuous  outcome and apply  linear regression model to estimate  the 
mean between-arm difference and 95% confidence interval.  The regression models will be 
specified as follows:
 where A1C is the outcome  𝐴1𝐶 ~ 𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆𝑀 +𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝐴1𝐶 +𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 +𝐶𝐺𝑀 +𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠,
at [ADDRESS_1001464] 
repeated measures analysis using linear mixed effects models to examine the trajectories of A1C.  
This allows us a closer  inspection of how participants respond to PRISM over time and examine

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template  Version 4.1: January [ADDRESS_1001465] over time.  The linear mixed  regression models will be 
specified as follows:  where  is 𝐴1𝐶𝑖𝑗~𝑏0𝑖+𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆 𝑀𝑖+𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗+𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆 𝑀𝑖×𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗+𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠, 𝐴1𝐶𝑖𝑗
the A1C level for subject i at time j,  is the subject specific random intercept to account for 𝑏0𝑖
within-subject correlation due to repeated  measures, and  is the group-by-time 𝑃𝑅𝐼𝑆 𝑀𝑖×𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗
interaction term. When  is modelled as a discrete variable and baseline  is the reference time 𝑇𝑖𝑚 𝑒𝑗
point, the coefficients of the group-by-time interaction estimate the amount of differences  in 
changes at later time points relative to baseline. Significance of these coefficients will be assessed 
using confidence intervals, and p-values from F-tests based on ANOVA and Kenward-Roger 
method.73 
For time-in-range  (CGM  data), we will use a 2 group comparison of the change  from baseline 
in the percentage of sensor  values  in the target range (70-180  mg/dL)  using  a linear model  
adjusted for the baseline  value and factors used to stratify randomization.  All subjects with any 
CGM data will be included.   Residual values  will be exam ined for an appro ximate normal  
distribution. If values  are highly skewed then transform ation or non-param etric methods will be 
used instead.
 Aim 2. Secondary outcomes include mean scores at 6-months for the PAID-T, CD-RISC, D-
STAR, T1DAL , PHQ-8, BFSC, and SCI-R. We will model each outcome separately  following a 
similar approach  to the primary  analysis for Aim 1. 
Additional analyses and considerations.  We will conduct a thorough process  evaluation that 
includes: (a) intervention  fidelity; and, (b) satisfaction queries. Multiple comparisons are a concern 
since we are collecting multiple  measures  from participants and are interested  in several 
hypotheses. We minimize this problem  by [CONTACT_312424] a limited  number of main  hypotheses  for 
each aim.  The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure will be used  to control the False Discovery Rate 
criterion at α=0.[ADDRESS_1001466]  for multiple  testing in analyses that are not pre-specified.74 Likewise, 
in manuscripts  and presentations, we will report the number of tests performed and interpret 
results within  this context.   
Heterogeneity of treatment effects  (HTE) analysis.  We will conduct exploratory  analyses for 
additional heterogeneity  of treatment  effects.  This refers  to the non-random, explainable variability 
in the direction and magnitude of treatment effects  for individuals  within a population as we may 
be interested in identifying  subgroups that the intervention works  particularly well or poorly.  We 
plan to conduct  HTE analyses  mostly  through subgroup analysis. Examples of factors, alone or 
in combination,  that potentially could modify the intervention effects include baseline A1C,  CGM, 
language at home, or engagement with the intervention. Regression models similar to those 
outlined for Aims 1 and 2 will be applied to subgroups defined  by [CONTACT_41396]. Note  these  
analyses are confirmatory and should  be interpreted with caution.
 Considerations regarding missing data.   Data  may be missing due to patients/families skippi[INVESTIGATOR_733020], omissions  in medical records,  lack of follow-up, medical complications,  
or death.   We will quantify the amount of missing  data, evaluate the association of participant  
characteristics with missing  data, and minimize bias and increase efficiency in the associations 
of interest by [CONTACT_733053].75-77 For example, for 
outcomes where missing at random (MAR) is a plausible assumption, we will use multiple 
imputation or inverse probability  weighting, depending  on the statistical model being considered. 
For missing  not at random  (MNAR) data,  we will use sensitivity analyses. In all cases,  we will 
assess the robustness of estimates due to assumptions.

14.2. Quality control procedures  for collected data:33
  
For survey data, all participant surveys  will be available by [CONTACT_733054], a secure HIPAA-compliant, high-quality data collection tool. The 
rationale for offering both paper-pencil and electronic versions is based on our prior 
experience where  participants preferred the former,78 which  in turn facilitated  more 
complete data collection.  To ensure data quality, a RA will review for missing fields 
and call participants to clarify  and query/complete  individual missing items verbally.  
Data will be quality controlled by a double-checking mechanism (i.e., data double-
entry via REDCap  or double-entry/checking of manually entered  data).  
For medical record data, RA’s  will collect and upload CRF data at a frequency varying 
between [ADDRESS_1001467] data, we will use our current methods for training and quality control,  
including guided practice abstraction and independent abstraction  with reconciliation 
by a trainer.  A 10% random sample  will be dual abstracted.  A  RA assignment will 
monitor and reconcile case report forms with RedCap  data once  monthly.
 
15.Confidentiality34
15.1. Procedures to secure  the data and/or biospecimens during storage, use, and transmission:
  
All medical  record, health care utilization,  survey  data, and audio  transcriptions will be 
coded and labeled with study  identification  numbers.  All  will be stored in original (hard  
copy) forms  in locked cabinets (where relevant) and/or  password-protected secure 
databases (for all electronic survey data). A1c data will be entered  into the medical 
record (SCH) or sent to individual providers (BCM/TCH)  and stored in compliance  with 
each institutition’s  laboratory’s protocols  and procedures.  At SCH, samples for HbA1c 
(DBS) are stored for 1-[ADDRESS_1001468] of the month.  The storage 
locations are in the clinical  lab in OC.10. Badge access is required to access  this floor. 
At BCM/TCH, samples will be discarded seven days after receipt and processing. 
Storage location is WT.BB1.[ADDRESS_1001469], in order to ensure data quality.  No  identifiable patient information will be 
labeled on the surveys; all will be identified with a study-specific identifier with assigned  
identifier kept on a password protected  encrypted server. Coded electronically  saved  
study data will be banked  indefinitely  for future use by [CONTACT_733055]’s.  PIs  will verify  that 
additional analyses have IRB approval.  Only study  staff with human subjects training will 
have access,  subject to approval by [CONTACT_978].  No data will be withdrawn from the study  
database. Results of initial  analyses  will be shared with participants if participants  
request on the consent form that they would like a summary of study results.  When 
using web-based video chats for participant  interaction, we will not store  patient  data/PHI 
within the web based applications.  
Data will be stored in an electronic database  (REDCap -Research Electronic Data  
Capture) using the participant’s study  identifier. REDCap data collection projects rely on

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template  Version 4.1: January [ADDRESS_1001470] conducted the iterative 
development and testing  process previously, resulting in well-planned data collection. 
REDCap servers are housed in a data center and all web-based information 
transmission is encrypted.  For the present study, we will use the REDCap system 
managed by [CONTACT_733056] 
(ITHS).  REDCap  was developed specifically around HIPAA-Security guidelines and is 
recommended to researchers at various institutions  by [CONTACT_733057]. REDCap has been  disseminated for use locally  and at other  
institutions and currently supports over 300 academic/non-profit consortium partners on 
six continents  and over 20,000 research end-users  (www.project-redcap.org). The 
REDCap data record  may contain  some identifying information. Subjects will be tracked 
using their study identifier. The identifiable  data will be designated as “PHI” in the 
REDCap database which will allow us to exclude  access to the identifiable information 
as necessary.
When Zoom is used,  the following actions will be taken  to protect confidentiality  and 
privacy:
1.The latest version of Zoom that is available will be used.
2.The meeting  room will be set to private.
3.A password/passcode will be required for meeting entry. 
Note: The chat function will be utilized (as needed)  for individual  1:1 communication  
between coach and participant,  including sharing approved resources (e.g.,  PRISM 
cheatsheets), logistical  information about  PRISM  (e.g., PRISM app code), and 
communicating if there  are technical  difficulties. Chat may also be considered for use for 
session content  by [CONTACT_733058] (e.g., patient is 
unable to communicate verbally). No PHI would be communicated via chat at any time. 
  
15.2. Location where the data and/or  biospecimens will be stored:  
All will be stored in original (hard copy) forms in locked  cabinets (at local sites) and/or 
password-protected secure databases  (for all electronic survey data). A1c data will be 
stored in compliance  with each institution’s CLIA-certified laboratory policies and 
procedures.

16.Provisions to Monitor Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects35
16.1. Plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms  and benefits to 
determine whether  subjects remain safe:36
  
This is a small multisite  clinical  trial of a supportive  care intervention  that presents no 
more than minimal risk. As such, data monitoring will be primarily carried  out by [CONTACT_733059] a small Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). 
Safety monitoring will be the responsibility  of a 3-member  Data  Safety and Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC)  composed of professionals  representing different disciplines and 
expertise (see table  below). All members are independent of the protocol.  The  
committee will be convened at the beginning of the study and then twice  annually via 
conference calls, to provide input and guidance on the study evaluation and intervention  
protocols, including quality assurance  and safety issues  related to the protocols, as well 
as data handling activities. As above, in the event of an unanticipated patient death,  the 
committee may convene an ad-hoc session and/or suspend the study to assess  patient  
risk and/or necessary revisions  to the protocol.

16.2. Data reviewed  to ensure safety  of subjects:
  
DSMC members  will provide input and feedback  to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-investigators,  via e-mail and 
conference calls, related to (a) accrual  rate, (b) study eligibility  determination  issues,  (c) data 
completion rates including  conformance with informed consent  requirements, (d) intervention 
fidelity indicators,  (e) adverse events, and (f) compliance with data management procedures.  [CONTACT_733087] (lead statistician) will oversee the summarization of online data to evaluate  data 
completeness and protocol  adherence. The Lead CRA  will also send semi-annual reports 
summarizing recruitment and other site specific data (such as indicators of intervention  delivery, 
occurrence of adverse  events, and conformance with IRB requirements).  
The committee will also receive information  on questionnaire data, presented  for the participants 
overall rather than by [CONTACT_159311]. This study will not have pre-set stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241491],  but the DSMB 
will have the option of requesting  the data be unblinded and considering altering  the study or

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template  Version 4.1: January [ADDRESS_1001472] to assemble the full committee at any time. Because  
committee members may be located  at various  sites, the committee meetings may be conducted 
by [CONTACT_648]. 
Data safety  monitoring for the intervention will focus on assuring that subjects are not 
experiencing any significant or unexpected  distress and that they are satisfied  with the 
intervention components; we will monitor all complaints  about the study.   We do not anticipate 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_733023], but the DSMB will have the option  to consider such 
action in the event of a highly unexpected result. The DSMB will review the draft questionnaires 
to be sent to subjects  and review  any complaints that may be received from patients, family  
members, clinicians, or others.   We do not anticipate any external factors such as findings from 
ongoing trials that will affect the safety  of participants or the ethics of this research study.  
  
16.3. Safety information  collection procedures:
  
The DSMB, Lead RA and study team will regularly assess  confidentiality  of study  participants.  
The following  will be assessed and verified: All data will be maintained on secure computers in 
locked offices  at Seattle Children’s Research Institute (data collection center);  the participant 
(and caregiver) has signed informed consent  and HIPAA  forms; all standard 
confidentiality/privacy rules and guidelines  set by [CONTACT_93749]’s Research Institute are in 
compliance. A Certificate  of Confidentiality  will be obtained.
  
16.4. Frequency of cumulative data review:
  
The committee will be convened at the beginning of the study and then twice annually  
via conference calls,  to provide input  and guidance  on the study  evaluation and 
intervention protocols, including quality assurance and safety issues related to the 
protocols, as well as data handling activities. 
  
16.5. Conditions that trigger an immediate suspension  of the research:
  
Given the non-invasive nature of our proposed  behavioral intervention and based on prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_30274],30,[ADDRESS_1001473] minimal side effects  and safety concerns as a result of the PRISM 
intervention. Thus, there are no pre-planned stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_733024].

There is no compensation for research-related injury.
  
19.Recruitment Methods40
19.1. When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:
  
Recruitment and retention will be promoted through a combination  of clinic-based approaches 
and strategies we have  successfully used previously. 
Research staff at both sites will screen  patients via review of clinic schedules and existing 
databases as well as via communication with clinicians,  followed by a medical chart review to 
verify all eligibility except  for diabetes distress  to inform the in-clinic recruitment. At SCH, diabetes  
distress is typi[INVESTIGATOR_733025]-person visit (standard of care) for all patients  13+ using 
the PAID-T. Clinic infrastructure provides  instantaneous e-mail alerts to providers upon elevated 
scores. Our research team will be included in the e-mail notification  of all patients with elevated 
scores (≥30 per published guidelines  and mean  clinic data).7,52 Research staff will screen  these 
patients for other eligibility criteria and if eligible, will work with the provider team in clinic  (as 
available) or contact  [CONTACT_733060]/video  conference call (WebEx,  Zoom,  or Skype)  to 
conduct a consent conference if the patient/family is interested. 
Both sites may also use a mail approach to aid in in-clinic screening and recruitment. Upon 
reviewing clinic schedules and databases and screening patients for eligibility  on criteria noted 
in the medical  record or clinic databases  (e.g., age, diagnosis, duration),  patients will be mailed 
a letter  in advance  of their clinic visit or sent a letter via myChart in EPIC introducing  them to the 
study and giving them the opportunity to “opt out” of future contacts if desired. If potentially 
eligible patients  who receive the mailing do not opt-out  of being approached about the study, we 
may call them to assess their interest and arrange to discuss  the study  by [CONTACT_648]/video or meet 
them in-person at their upcoming clinic visit. 
Both sites may post the approved flyer in clinic areas. The flyer may also be distributed to 
potential participants  from clinical or research staff via myChart in EPIC or by e-mail if patients 
and families request  more  information.
At SCH, the screening visit will include verification of the PAID-T measure, and if all criteria are 
met,  the full consent conference will take place (i.e., Phase 2 of Consenting; see Figure  2 below). 
At BCM and SCH, if a PAID-T  is not available in the medical record,  the screening visit will include 
verification of all criteria except for the PAID-T. If the patient is approached in clinic  or by 
[CONTACT_648]/video and expresses interest in participating in the study, the screening consent 
conference will take place  (i.e., Phase 1 of Consenting; see Figure  2 in Consent/Assent Section 
below). If the patient is available in clinic,  research staff will obtain written consent/assent for 
Phase 1/Screening prior to administering the PAID-T to the adolescent. If the patient is not in

Page 31 of 59
clinic and research  staff is following up by [CONTACT_648]/video,  verbal consent/assent for Phase 
1/Screening will be obtained via the information sheet prior to PAID-T administration.  The patient 
will only be eligible  for Phase 2 of Consenting and to be enrolled if the PAID-T is elevated (>=30). 
The same two-phase  consenting  process will occur at SCH if a PAID-T is unavailable at the time 
of consent (e.g., patient has opted  out of taking standard  of care measures in clinic, has not 
received the PAID-T as part of a tele-health visit or in-person visit or contacts the study  team  after 
receiving the recruitment letter but does not have a PAID-T  in chart within the prior 12 months). 
In cases where the PAID-T is elevated upon screening and the patient/family  subsequently 
decides not to participate, the provider will be notified (if not already notified). 
  
19.2. Steps that will be taken to protect potential  subjects’ privacy interests:[ADDRESS_1001475] processes for approach by [CONTACT_733061]/or working with the diabetes 
provider team to approach in person. Minimal paper records, such as consent forms, will 
be kept in a locked drawer in the site PIs’ research offices.Surveys will be done either  
electronically via RedCap  or mailed  to participants based on their preferences. A1c at-
home test kits will follow  clinic and laboratory  protocols as defined  by [CONTACT_733062] (Dickerson  & 
Devaraj).  
  
19.3. Sources of subjects:42  
We will recruit  from the diabetes clinics at Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733026]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
  
19.4. Methods  that will be used to identify potential subjects:
  
RAs at each  site will screen  patients  via review of the clinic  lists, communication with 
clinicians, and review  of internal databases,  followed by a medical chart  review  to verify 
eligibility. 
  
19.5. Materials that will be used to recruit  subjects:43 
Recruitment letter and flyer are included in the submission materials. 
  
19.6. Recruitment methods  not controlled by [CONTACT_47255]’s:
  
There are no study wide recruitment  methods (e.g., call centers or national 
advertisements).

instances and in the current circumstances,  it is sometimes impossible to ensure that an in 
person consent  conference occurs if a study  team member is not allowed to be in clinic due 
to institutional safety protocols (e.g., COVID-19 restructions), out for the day or if our team 
has a scheduled  meeting.  Even  if a study  team member is able to be at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  there  
are a number of factors that may preclude  an approach in person, especially in the era of 
COVID-19. Providers may interrupt the consent  conference, staff may advise us that the day 
is not “good” for the family to be approached, illness status may preclude  the patient  from 
being cognitively able to provide consent/assent that day, or patients/families  may not be 
presenting in person in clinic due to COVID-19.  
The RA will contact [CONTACT_733063] a research 
study. The consent meeting between the RA and eligible participants (with parents if 
applicable) will include an explanation of the study in developmentally appropriate lay-
language.  
For Phase  1 (Screening),  participants will provide  either written informed consent (if aged 18 
years) or assent (if <18 years-old) if seen  in-person  or verbal consent (if aged 18 years) or 
assent (if <18 years-old) if screened  by [CONTACT_648]/video. Parents of teens (<18 years-old) will 
provide written informed  consent if the patient  is seen in clinic or verbal consent if screened 
by [CONTACT_648]/video. 
For Phase  2 (Full Study), all participants  approached in-person will provide either  written  
informed consent  (if aged 18 years) or assent  (if <18 years-old). Parents  of teens (<18 
years-old) approached  in-person will provide  written  informed consent. When the consent  
conference is conducted  by [CONTACT_648]/video,  those  who agree to participate will complete an 
electronic consent  form via the REDcap database using the REDCAP e-consent  framework.  
Study staff may also e-mail a copy of the consent form to subjects if requested. The body of 
the consent form will be identical, whether on paper or in REDCap. A link to the electronic 
consent form will be e-mailed to participants prior to the phone/video  consent conference.  A 
short code will be generated  through REDCap to confirm  and verify the identity of the 
person consenting  at BCM/TCH. Study staff will answer any questions about  the study, and 
those who agree to participate will provide an electronic signature, date, and time on the 
REDCap form to indicate their consent. The REDCap e-consent framework allows 
participants to create an electronic signature [CONTACT_733078] a timestamp. 
This framework also automatically  generates an extra certification page for participants  to 
confirm the correctness of their responses before submitting and stores a static copy  of their 
responses as a PDF in the study file’s repository. Subjects will also be prompted to 
download a copy  of their signed consent form from  REDCap or study staff can e-mail  the 
signed form. 
After conducting  the consent conference either  in person or by [CONTACT_648]/video, RAs will create 
a consent process  note for REDCap and the EMR. Included in this note will be the date of

the consent conference, the names of the patient  and parent (if applicable), the name [CONTACT_493598],  the fact that the subject agreed to participate and that all risks 
and opportunities  of the study  were explained, and that the subject had adequate 
opportunity to have  their questions answered. If an interpreter  is used, the name [CONTACT_733079]. 
Consent conferences  will not be recorded. Study  staff will use a guide for consent  
discussions over phone/video. 
After fully enrolled participants turn 18, they will complete a new informed consent form to 
continue participation in the study either in-person (as is possible) or via REDCap. 
As described  in the inclusion/exclusion criteria above, adolescents must speak English 
fluently; however, they are eligible if English is not their primary language spoken  at home 
(or if it is not their first language). In cases where  parent  consent  is required and parents do 
not speak English fluently (or prefer another language),  all conferences  will be held with a 
trained phone or in-person  medical  interpreter.  All participants and parents will be provided 
an opportunity to read the consent/assent forms in their preferred language (English or 
Spanish), to ask questions about  the study and have those questions answered by [CONTACT_733064]/assent form.  Parental  permission for study participation will be obtained first then 
patient assent  will be obtained for all patients 13-17 years of age.  If a patient indicates that 
they do not want to participate in any phase of the study that non-assent  will override the 
parent’s permission and the patient will be recorded  as a refusal.  The  research team 
member will redirect  any parent  who attempts  to convince their child to participate in the 
study and remind  them of their child’s right as a potential research participant  to refuse 
participation without coercion.  Consent to study participation will be obtained from patients 
[ADDRESS_1001478]  how 
their nurses or doctors care for them.  
Parent/guardian separate consent will be obtained  because parents will be completing their 
own study activities and will be disclosing their own financial information in surveys. At the 
time of consent, the study activities associated  with each arm of the study  (surveys  for both 
groups and ‘Coming Together’ for parents/guardians whose child is randomized  to PRISM) 
will be presented, and parents can indicate  on the consent which component(s) they are 
interested in participating in (with the knowledge  that they will not be offered the ‘Coming 
Together’ session  should their child be randomized  to control/usual  care).  Again, 
parents/guardians whose child is randomized to control/usual  care arm will be eligible to 
take surveys but will not have the option of the ‘Coming Together’ visit (as it is a part of the 
PRISM intervention). Parents/guardians whose child is randomized  to the PRISM arm of the 
intervention may choose to be involved in the ‘Coming Together’ portion of the study and not 
want to complete questionnaires and visa versa, they may choose to complete  
questionnaires and not participate in the ‘Coming Together’ portion of the study either by 
[CONTACT_733065]’s choice. It is clearly  delineated  on the parent consent forms both a) that 
the parent  should indicate which component(s) they are choosing  to participate in (if eligible)

and b) that the ‘Coming Together’ session is only offered if the adolescent is randomized to 
PRISM.
Screening Procedures  (Phase 1): 
During each consent  conference at BCM/TCH,  where distress  screening (PAID-T) is not 
standard of care, and for consent  conferences  at SCH in which the patient  has not been 
administered a PAID-T, we will emphasize that they will need  to complete a screening  
consent form or information  sheet (Phase 1) and a brief measure (PAID-T) in order  to 
determine eligibility (see Figure 2 below). If they meet eligibility criteria, they will proceed to 
Phase 2 of Consenting and will subsequently  complete the baseline  instruments and will not 
be given the PAID-T  again (i.e., the PAID-T score  from screening will count as their baseline  
PAID-T value). If they do not meet eligibility criteria, we will thank them for their time and 
confirm they are not eligible  for the study. If they are eligible and interested  in the study, we 
will ask them to complete  the full consenting process (Phase 2; see Figure  2 below) and the 
rest of the baseline  surveys prior to being randomized. The same processes will occur at 
SCH if the potentially eligible patient  does not have  a current  PAID-T available  in their chart 
(i.e., within 12 months of the time of consent).
All potential  participants  who complete the PAID-T as part of the Phase 1 screening process 
(outside of their standard of care PAID-T)  with the intention of enrolling in the study who do 
not subsequently meet the cut-off for enrollment will be given a $[ADDRESS_1001479] for their time. 
They will complete the PAID-T in the run in period via REDCap, verbally, or paper/pencil.

☒  Appendix A-10 of the Investigator Manual will not be followed.   Explanation  of 
procedures not following Appendix  A-10:
Although Spanish  speaking families will be eligible for the study only if the 
adolescent can speak  fluently in English, adolescents who do not speak 
English will be ineligible  for the study  as PRISM is a manualized 
intervention only available and iteratively developed  in English. In cases  
where parent consent is required and parents do not speak English 
fluently (or prefer another  language), all conferences will be done with a 
trained medical  interpreter. All participants  and parents will be provided 
an opportunity to read the consent/assent form in their preferred language

Phase 1 (Screening): Written assent will be obtained for patients 13-17 (Screening  
Consent/Assent/Parental Permission), unless it is not possible for research  staff to 
meet patient/family in person. If patient/family is not able to be seen in person, verbal  
assent will be obtained (Information Sheet). 
Phase 2 (Full Consent): Written assent will be obtained for all patients 13-17 if 
approached in clinic. REDCap e-assent will be obtained  for all patients who are 
approached by [CONTACT_648]/video These consent conferences will be documented in the 
patient’s medical record. A copy of the consent/assent/parental permission form will

If a patient indicates that he or she does  not want to participate in the study  during 
any phase, that non-assent will override the parent’s permission and the parent will 
be recorded as a refusal. The research  team member  will redirect any parent who 
attempts to convince their child to participate in the study and remind them of their 
child’s right as a potential research participant to refuse participation without 
coercion. The CRA  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_493520]-language that being in the study is their choice, that

20.11. Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process
20.11.1. Reasons  for requesting a waiver  or alteration of informed consent:59
  
1)We are requesting a waiver of consent  for patients that turn 18 if no 
further data collection  and study  related activities are occurring (see 
Section 20.9.6) as their data is limited to the continued use of existing 
data. It would not be practical  to seek consent after study activities are 
complete because of the potential difficulty locating subjects. It may be 
inappropriate or unnecessarily burdensome  to patients to re-approach  
them after study activities are complete.
  
20.11.2. Consent  Waiver/Alteration Criteria justifications:60
[IP_ADDRESS]. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects 
because: The waiver  includes  continued use of existing data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. The waiver or alteration will not adversely  affect the rights or welfare 
of the subjects  because:61 Participants  assented to participate  in 
the study.  All publication or presentation of research results will 
be done in a manner that would not reveal an individual’s 
identity. 
  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver 
or alteration because:62
  
We may be unable to locate patients  because of the lengthy 
time period  over which the records will be collected
All eligible  patients (especially those who have  completed 
study activities) must be included  in the study for the results 
to be meaningful

If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable  
biospecimens,  the research  could not practicably be carried  out without using  
such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format  because:  Identifiers 
are necessary so that researchers can link data from multiple sources for 
data analysis.

pertinent information after participation:
  
If indicated by [CONTACT_4317], a summary of the primary analyses 
will be shared at the study closure.

21.Process to Document Consent in Writing
21.1. If consent  will be documented in writing  (check  one):
☒ “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091)” will be followed.
☒ “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091)” will not be followed.  
Process of documenting consent:64
 
HRP-091 will be followed  for  Phase 1 (Screening) if patient/family  are available  in clinic  
to provide signatures. Due to the relative infrequency of clinic visits, for instances in 
which the patient/family are NOT available to meet in-person, we are requesting an 
alteration of consent,  which allows the patient/family to verbally consent and assent 
(e.g., by [CONTACT_756]/video)  to the screening procedures  in Phase 1. 
HRP-091 will be followed for Phase 2 (Full Study)  when  patient can be approached in 
person. We will obtain  written assent/consent  from all participants.  Upon enrollment and 
randomization in Phase 2, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-Is  will place a research note in the medical 
record to document  the discussion and participants. HRP-091 will not be followed for 
Phase 2 (Full Study) when patient  is approached remotely. We are requesting a waiver  
of documentation  of written consent  when approach and consenting are performed via 
telephone or video  conference. Identical REDCap consent forms are drafted for remote 
consenting, which include signature  [CONTACT_733080]. 
We will obtain written assent/consent  from participants whenever possible as a wet ink 
of signature. When this is not possible,  we will obtain a digital signature  [CONTACT_733081]. 
Consent documents, including the identical REDCap  consent forms for remote 
consenting, are attached  in the appropriate  section of the Click smart form.

22.2. HIPAA  Waiver/Alteration Criteria: Explain why:
22.2.1. The use or disclosure of PHI involves  no more  than a minimal risk to privacy  of 
individuals, based on, at least  the presence of the following elements:
[IP_ADDRESS]. An adequate plan to protect the identifiers  from improper use and 
disclosure: 
  
Access PHI for Screening: All screening  will take place using 
secure login  credentials  and databases/medical records  limited to 
access only by [CONTACT_464]. All study  staff and investigators are 
highly trained in HIPAA  compliance, human subjects protection, 
and good clinical  practice.
Remove Signature  [CONTACT_733082]  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Consent (if not seen in-person): We are requesting an 
alteration of HIPAA  authorization to remove the signature 
[CONTACT_733083] 1 Screening  if screening  is done by [CONTACT_648]  
(and a signature  [CONTACT_733084]-person)  and for Phase 2 
Enrollment if done by [CONTACT_648]/video (and a signature  [CONTACT_733085]). All study materials will be filed in locked 
cabinets and study staff and investigators  are highly trained in 
HIPAA compliance, human subjects protection, and good clinical 
practice. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct  of research:
  
Access PHI For Screening: All information  collected for research 
purposes will be coded. Identifying information  (names, addresses 
Principal Researcher: Yi-Frazier

and phone numbers) will be used  initially  only to identify  potential 
patients to approach. The only link between the participant 
identifiers and their study identifier will be kept on a password 
protected database and in a locked filing cabinet.  There are no 
patient identifiers  collected and retained  for research purposes. 
Feasibility data will represent  only frequencies  and percentages. 
Any remaining  identified information  (i.e., databases) will be 
destroyed at [ADDRESS_1001487], in order to ensure data quality.
Remove Signature  [CONTACT_733082]  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  All information 
collected will be coded. The only links between the participant 
identifiers and their study identifiers will be kept on a password 
protected database and in a locked filing cabinet.  There are no 
patient identifiers  collected and retained  for research purposes. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assurances that PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other party or 
entity, except  as required by [CONTACT_733067]:
  
Access PHI for Screening: PHI will not be reused or disclosed to 
any other party or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_733068].
Remove Signature  [CONTACT_733082]  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  PHI will not be reused  
or disclosed to any other party or entity,  except  as required by [CONTACT_733069].
  
22.2.2. The research  could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration of 
authorization:
  
Access PHI for Screening: We need  to have the alteration in order 
to determine potentially eligible participants  for this study. If we did 
not confirm eligibility  with the clinicians  giving care, confirmation of 
eligibility would  be dependent upon the patient and parents.  It is 
likely that they would be able to confirm  the eligibility criteria but 
there is the possibility that some may not be able to do so for all of 
the study criteria.  It is also possible that they may be 
uncomfortable being asked to confirm  the eligibility criteria or 
wonder why it is that they are being  asked to do so.
Remove Signature  [CONTACT_733082]  1 Screening  and 
Phase 2 Enrollment (if not seen in person):  Due to the relative 
infrequency of clinic visits, it may not be possible to screen all 
potentially eligible patients  in person. If the signature [CONTACT_733086]: Yi-Frazier

Page 43 of 59
was not removed for potentially eligible parties,  it would not be 
practicable to be able to screen these patients appropriately. 
Patients may be interested in participating in the study, and it is 
not reasonable to ask interested parties  to wait months until their 
next clinic  visit to engage in minimal risk, brief screening 
processes (<5 minutes) to assess eligbility. 
We also need this alteration to be able to recruit participants 
in cases where in-person  consent conferences may pose 
risk to the patients, particularly within this 
immunosuppressed, higher-risk population. For example, as 
of Spring 2020, the COVID-[ADDRESS_1001488] 
consent conferences  in person;  therefore,  this has led us to 
revisit our previous practices  for in-person consenting and 
determine that, in order to protect patient safety while  still 
giving all eligible  patients  the opportunity to participate in 
this potentially beneficial research, we need  the options to 
enroll patients remotely. 
In addition, both of our previous procedures for remote 
consent conferences  are no longer  feasible in this 
circumstance, as follows: a) when a remote consent 
conference was requested by [CONTACT_493591], we had 
previously mailed  consent forms prior to a phone consent 
conference and requested that families  sign the forms and 
return via mail.  Based  on early  pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], patients  and 
families who were  interested  in the study  found this to be 
particularly burdensome exacerbated  now by [CONTACT_733070]’s health, 
meaning many may prefer to avoid sharing of physical 
documents via mail. Furthermore,  requiring  families to 
return documents via mail may pose additional risk and 
burden as they will need  to leave their homes  to locate 
mailboxes or visit the post office;  b) we had previously  e-
mailed consent forms to families and requested that they 
print, sign, scan, and return to us via email.  However, we 
have found that this is not doable for this population as it 
requires them to have  access to a printer and scanner,  
which the majority do not. Therefore,  in order to recruit for 
this study whilst ensuring patient safety  and minimizing any 
burden or stress  on families, providing  an electronic  means 
for families to review  consent forms and indicate  willingness 
to participate (via digital  signature) is necessary.

Access PHI for Screening: The alteration of HIPAA Authorization 
is being requested  for preliminary screening purposes only.  
Preliminary screening procedures are minimal risk; they include a 
basic review of the patient’s medical records to identify whether or 
not the patient meet basic eligibility  requirements.  No study 
activities occur prior to the documentation  of informed 
consent/authorization by [CONTACT_109796]/or parent participants.

23.Payments/Costs to Subjects72
23.1. Amount, method,  and timing of payments  to subjects:73
  
Patients in both arms will receive a $[ADDRESS_1001489] upon completion of baseline surveys,  
and a $[ADDRESS_1001490] following the completion of the 6-month and also 12-month  
surveys. Because the 3-month and 9-month surveys  are abbreviated, patients will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_1001491] 
distribution. At BCM/TCH,  Clincards will we used for gift card distribution, unless they 
are not available, in which  case, cash or check will be used. Parents  will not be 
compensated.  Subjects will not be compensated for participating in any intervention  
sessions, including  the Coming Together session.
In addition, all participants who contact [CONTACT_733071] “opt in” via the 
recruitment letter, resulting in a screening  visit and/or  a chart  review  will  be entered 
into a lottery to win a bonus $[ADDRESS_1001492]. This is a 
process that has worked well for other researchers
in the diabetes clinic. 
Finally, if the patient completes Phase 1 but does not qualify for the study due to the 
PAID-T score not being elevated, they will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1001493] of care. Phase 1 screening  for elevated PAID-T will occur for every 
participant at BCM/TCH because the PAID-T is not standard of care (A1C  draws are 
standard of care at BCM/TCH). Those  who do not qualify for the study based on their 
PAID-T scores  or are eligible, but do not want to participate in Phase 2 will receive  the 
$5 incentive for completing the screener. Those who do qualify  for the study based on 
their PAID-T  scores  and decide to enroll in Phase 2 will not receive the $5 incentive 
because they will receive the full $20 incentive for completing baseline  
questionnaires.

Fidelity. PRISM has been standardized through the creation of comprehensive 
protocols for those  who implement it.  Session-by-Session  details are provided in the 
PRISM manual; on outline of each section  is listed in Table 1.  All interventionists  
undergo at least 4 hours of in person training including role-playing  and progressive 
mastery of intervention  materials.  The fidelity of sessions will be systematically 
assessed via audio-recording. 
Access to Diabetes Clinics. The research team will work closely with the Diabetes 
Clinics to ensure screening/enrollment is feasible.  Using the eligibility  criteria  age, 
A1C, and language against our existing databases at SCH, we estimate  over 400 
eligible adolescents  per year,  40% of whom  report using  a CGM. At TCH, there  are 
over 500 eligible  adolescents per year, 26% of whom report  using a CGM. Assuming 
an enrollment rate of 50% (based  on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]), we expect it to be feasible to enroll,  
randomize, and conduct the intervention  for at least 80 eligible adolescents at each  
site in 18 months. Appropriate FTE is designated in the budget  for this work. We will 
use the Seattle  Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_733029]. BCM/TCH will also use their Main Campus 
Diabetes Clinic and regional sites.

49 Seattle Children’s IRB prohibits the exclusion  of non-English speaking populations  from research unless there is 
sufficient justification  for the exclusion.  See  Investigator Manual  HRP-103 for more information.  
50 For research conducted in the state,  review  “SOP: Legally  Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  
(HRP-013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “children.”  The age of majority in 
Washington is 18; however,  sometimes younger children  have ability to consent for certain types  of care (e.g. sexual 
reproduction/health; mental health; drug/alcohol treatment).  For research conducted outside  of the state, provide 
information that describes  which persons have  not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures 
involved the research,  under  the applicable  law of the jurisdiction in which  research  will be conducted. One method of 
obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol  along the definition of “children”  
in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and Guardians (HRP-013).”   If the sites in other states in the 
study are conducting their own IRB review,  you do not need to worry about this--type  N/A.  If you are conducting  
research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT coming to SCH  to give consent  
and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol.

52 If parental  permission  will not be obtained, please address  this in the Waiver  or Alteration of Consent Process 
below.
53 See HRP-013 for more information.
54 The IRB generally follows the following  guidelines for written assent: children  7-12 should provide written assent  on 
the “simple” assent form (HRP-502G); children 13-17 should provide written assent  by [CONTACT_3252]-signing the parental  
permission form (HRP-502A).  The IRB will consider other assent scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all 
children; not requiring  assent for some or all children; or waiving assent):  please  provide  details  about the plan for 
your study.   See HRP-090 and HRP-416 for more information on waiving assent  and when assent is not necessary.
55 See Appendix  A-13  of the Investigator Manual  HRP-103 for requirements for re-consent at age 18.  If you think  you 
meet the conditions for a waiver at 18, please  address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.
56 See “HRP-417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.  
57 For example: durable power  of attorney for health  care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, 
and adult child.  If you are following  HRP-013  in order  to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For 
research conducted  in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  (HRP-
013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “legally authorized representative.” For 
research conducted  outside  of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject  to their participation in the procedure(s)  involved in this 
research. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal  counsel or authority review your protocol  along 
the definition  of “legally authorized representative” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and 
Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states  in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need 
to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research  and are actively recruiting participants  outside of 
Washington who are NOT coming to Washington  to give consent  and who will be covered under SCH  IRB approval,  
this section should be addressed in your protocol.
58 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document  assent on the consent document.
59 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed,  the 
research involves deception,  waiver for participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non-present 
parent, or other waivers as necessary.
60 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not 
practicable to do the research without  a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to 
consider whether the waiver  criteria are met. See “HRP-410: Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further  
information.  
61 Possible reasons might  include: a) you are not collecting information that could  put subjects or their families at 
harm, e.g., affect eligibility for insurance,  employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting  information that would  
alter or affect the subject’s  care;  c) any publication  or presentation of research results would  be done in a manner that 
would never reveal an individual’s identity  either directly or indirectly.
62 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate  families because of the lengthy time period  over which  the 
records/samples were created; b) many of the subjects  whose  records, data, or biospecimens will be used may have 
died and contact[CONTACT_733077]; c) all eligible  patients  
must be included in the study for the results  to be meaningful.

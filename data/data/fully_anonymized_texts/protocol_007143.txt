This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International 
Confe rence on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research 
policies and procedures.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_666020] common cause of cancer related mortality in the US.  Radiation therapy 
is a main t reatment modality for lung cancer: for resectable tumors, radiation can be given pre -
operatively or post -operatively to improve local tumor control and outcomes; for unresectable tumors, 
radiation can be given as definitive treatment for the cancer, either  alone or in combination with 
chemotherapy.   
 
Local recurrence remains a significant  cause of treatment failure in lung cancer.  For stage III 
lung cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation, local failure rates range from 30% to 50% [1, 2].  At 
the time of lung cancer recurrence, patients often present as a heterogeneous group, with a mixture of 
local as well as systemic disease, and varying time intervals to recurrence.  Outcomes are generally poor 
with recurrence, however, various treatments are often given to either prolong life or palliate symptoms.  
Depending on specific patient characteristics such as age , stage, histology, and performance status, 
aggressive treatments can sometimes be pursued with superior outcomes to supportive care alone.   
 
External beam radiation is often given to  patients with recurrent lung cancer  to provide local 
tumor control and pal liate symptoms.  This can be challenging in patients who have previously received

v. 6/18/14  revised 5/21/[ADDRESS_666021] already received a significant radiation dose.  Therefore, it is often assumed that thoracic  
radiation cannot be repeated.  Even when repeat radiation is given, it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_514110], due 
to concerns about toxicity if higher radiation doses were attempted, as well as concerns over patient life 
expectancy  [3].   
 
Recent technological advances in radiation therapy and imaging have led to more interest  and 
more feasibility  in the role of repeat radiation for a select group of recurrent cancer patients.  For 
patients with symptomatic locally recurrent tumors, or patients with good systemic disease control but 
persistent or progressive local disease, repeat radiation with moderately high radiation doses can provide 
lasting tumor control and symptom palliation.  Multiple clinical series have been published on thoracic 
re-irradiation, showing safety and efficacy [4-10]. However, the series are typi[INVESTIGATOR_514111], with no prospective guidelines in terms of radiation dose limits for normal 
organs.   Radiation doses and fractionation varies widely.  Toxicity and efficacy information are often 
incomplete.  Table [ADDRESS_666022] be d eveloped.

recurrent lung cancer patients, in terms of normal organ radiation constraints.   
 
  
2.2 Rationale for Use of Proton Radiation   
Proton radiation has unique physical properties compared with photon -based radiation due to the 
Bragg peak [11].  For the more widely available photon -based radiation, th e radiation beams enter the

v. 6/18/14  revised 5/21/15  patient’s body, deposits energy and causes tissue damage, and exists through the body on the other side.  
In comparison, proton radiation beams enter a patient’s body, deposits a relatively small amount of 
energy along the path,  until the beam weakens to the point when it deposits all of its energy immediately 
before the proton particles come to rest.  This is called the Bragg peak.  This physical characteristic of 
proton therapy has the potential for less normal tissue exposure to radiation, and therefore less toxicity.  
Multiple publications have shown that proton radiation have superior normal tissue sparing compared 
with photon -based radiation [12-14].       
 
2.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Proton radiation has been increasingly used for treating lung and other thoracic malignancies in the 
recent years, with multiple published patient series showing safety and efficacy [15-17].  Multiple 
clinical series have also been published on thoracic re -irradiation, showing safety and efficacy [4-7]. 
However, the series are typi[INVESTIGATOR_514112], with no prospective 
guidelines in terms of radiation dose limits for normal organs.  Radiation doses and fractionation varies 
widely.  Toxicity and eff icacy information are often incomplete.   
 
2.4 Risks/Benefits  
The benefit for patients enrolled in this trial is to receive proton radiation treatment to the thorax for 
recurrent tumors, which adheres to strict radiation normal organ dose limits that has been developed 
after thorough literature review and multiple radiation oncology specialists.   
 
The potential harm for patients enrolled in this trial is the radiation toxicity related to re -irradiation.    
 
3.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
3.1 Primary Objective  
To assess the  grade 3 toxicity associated with thoracic re -irradiation with proton therapy, with 
prospectively applied normal organ radiation dose limits.   
 
Hypothesis :  With the normal tissue dose limits listed in this protocol, repeat radiation to the chest can 
be delivered safely without grade 3  or greater  toxicity  exceeding  25%.   
 
3.2 Secondary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of thoracic re -irradiation with proton therapy.   
 
Hypothesis :  We will achieve >80% local tumor control at [ADDRESS_666024] set out specific radiation guidelines for 
normal tissue dose limits and tumor coverage.

7.[ADDRESS_666036] treatment outline for patients receiving radiation treatment, which also applies to patients 
on this protocol, begins with an initial consultation, including history and physical.  Patients’ prior 
radiation  records will be obtained and reviewed.  If patients are eligible and consent to repeat irradiation, 
they are scheduled for a radiation simulation scan, to be used for radiation treatment planning.  
Physicians will delineate the target tumor volume as well  as normal organs to be protected in the region.  
A radiation plan will be generated that meets the normal organ dose limits outlined in this protocol.  The 
plan undergoes quality assurance checks, and patients then start treatment.  During treatment, pati ents 
are seen at least once weekly by [CONTACT_514125].  After completion of radiation, 
patients are seen typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_666037] -treatment .  See Table 1 below for summary.

7.1 Radiation Treatment Parameters  
7.1.1 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
 
Body cradle  or similar immobilization device(s) must be utilized.  A treatment planning CT scan is 
mandatory. CT scan thickness should be 0.5 cm or smaller  (preferably ≤0.3 cm) through the treatment 
volume. Intravenous contrast is recommended in  patients who do not have a contraindication to it. MRI 
and/or PET scans with image fusion also  may be helpful in treatment planning, particularly if these 
scans can be performed with the  same immobilization device as was used for the planning CT scan.   4D 
CT scan with respi[INVESTIGATOR_514115].  Any tumors moving 
more than [ADDRESS_666038] be considered for  motion management for ra diation treatment, 
which can include but not limited to: abdominal compression, respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344],  and active breathing 
control.  These are all standard of care for lung radiation treatment.   
 
7.1.2 Volume Definitions  
 
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) : This is the reg ion of interest that is known to contain gross  cancer. This 
will include all gross tumor as based upon the planning CT scan. This also may  include areas that appear 
“normal” by [CONTACT_514126], PET, phys ical 
examination, endoscopy, etc.  
Clinical  Tumor Volume (C TV): The CTV is defined to be the GTV plus a margin as  appropriate to 
account for microscopic tumor extension.  The exact CTV margin to be used is at the discretion of the 
treating physician, and ca n be as low as 0 mm if microscopic extension is not felt to be of concern in a 
particular patient situation.   
Internal Target Volume (ITV): If 4D CT scans are used to assess for breathing motion, the ITV will be 
used to encompass the CTV and all respi[INVESTIGATOR_514116].  
Planning Tumor Volume ( PTV ): This includes the CTV  (or ITV if appropriate)  plus a margin to 
compensate for various uncertainties, such as  systematic treatment setup variables, organ motion  
(especially with respi[INVESTIGATOR_64947]) , and organ displace ment . A minimum of [ADDRESS_666039]  (in which case, the margin from  CTV to PTV may be as small as 1 mm).

v. 6/18/14  revised 5/21/15  7.1.3 Treatment Planning Dose Co nstraints  
 
 A composite radiation plan that includes the prior thoracic radiation must be generated.  
 Minimum PTV dose should be 90% of the prescription dose and 95% of the PTV  should  receive 
the prescription dose, unless PTV overlaps with a critical normal organ.  In that case, the portion 
of PTV not overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_514117].  Min PTV dose 
<80% will be a major violation, volume of PTV receiving prescription dose <90% will be a 
major violation.   
 Minimum prescriptio n dose to PTV must be at least BED 2Gy 60 Gy. 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] c ord: max point dose 50 Gy (<0.03 cc) or BED equivalent (BED 2Gy 83 Gy) from proton 
radiation plan.  Composite  maximum spi[INVESTIGATOR_514118] 2Gy 90 Gy .  For 
patients who received radiation > [ADDRESS_666040] constraint can be increased with PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_41473].   
 Normal lung: mean dose < 20 Gy and volume receiving 20 Gy (V20)  < 35% for proton radiation 
plan.   
 Esophagus:  mean dose <34 Gy and max dose < 66 Gy for proton plan.  Composite  max poin t 
dose <  BED 2Gy 140 Gy . 
 Heart: mean d ose < 40 Gy and max dose < 66  Gy for proton plan.  Composite  max point dose <  
BED 2Gy [ADDRESS_666041] two physician s will review the patient history, imaging find ings, tumor contours, 
and radiation plan.   
 
7.1.6 Radiation Toxicity  
 
Toxicity will be graded based on CTCAE 4.0.  Grade two and above adverse events will be recorded .in 
a Redcap  database.   The AE ’s will be followed for three months post -treatment.  
 
7.2 Criteria fo r Removal/Withdrawal from Treatment  
Patients will be withdrawn from treatment if their clinical conditions decline so they are no longer able 
to tolerate proton radiation, or are unlikely to clinically benefit from further therapy.  
 
Patients will still rec eive follow up care per standard of care even if they withdraw from the study.  If a 
subject withdraws consent to participate in the study or aspects of the study, attempts will be made to 
obtain permission to record at least survival data up to [ADDRESS_666042]-treatment.   
 
8.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
Oversight for this study at the SCCA and UWMC will be provided by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_514119] -investigators and designated study personnel.  They will 
ensure all entry criteria are met prior to the initiation of the protocol and all study procedures and 
reporting of adverse events are performed according to the IRB-approved protocol.

 Frequencies and severity of  adverse events  
 Compliance rates of treatm ent delivery  
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_666044] criteria.   
 
For tumors targeted by [CONTACT_54615]:  
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions  
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% de crease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatmen t started  
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or 
more new lesions  
 
Patients with a global deteriorat ion of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic 
deterioration”. Every effort will  be made to document the objective progression even afte r 
discontinuation of treatment.

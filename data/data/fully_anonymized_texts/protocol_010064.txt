Protocol  
The protocol recommended tac tile assessments of the adductor pollicis TOF count,  
if feasible, and intraoperative muscle relaxation according to surgical requirement.  
All rocuronium doses were calculated using ideal body weight (IBW). Previous studies indicate  
that NMBDs are more a ppropriately dosed based on IBW than on  
actual body weight,12 and high BMI has been identified as a risk factor for PRNB.13 IBW was  
calculated by [CONTACT_741825] 50.0 + 0.9 kg cm -1 over 152 cm for males and 45.5 +  
0.9 kg cm -1 over 152 cm for  females, with intubation dose calculated as 0.6 mg kg -1 (IBW).  
Doses for women were reduced by 15%, as the ED95 is lower for females, leading to prolonged  
effects if given the same dose of rocuronium as males.14,15 We calculated an additional 1% dose  
reduction per year over [ADDRESS_1014232] in  
older patients,15 with age being a known risk factor for PRNB.16 The protocol recommended  
avoiding deep block (complete absence of the TOF response) because the re is conflicting  
evidence that deep block is of benefit.17 If there was a continued need for muscle relaxation,  
maintenance doses were recommended when the TOF count reached 3; each maintenance dose  
was calculated as 25% of the intubation dose rounded up to the next higher [ADDRESS_1014233] eye -muscle monitoring as a significant risk factor for  
PRNB. 13 Reversal dose of neostigmine was calculated using ideal body weight (IBW) while the  
sugammadex dose was based on act ual body weight. The protocol calls for a minimum of 10  
minutes after neostigmine administration and minimum 3 minutes after sugammadex  administration before tracheal extubation (Table 1).  
Providers were trained regarding the implementation of the new p rotocol and instructed to follow  
the practice suggestions. The research staff assisted the providers with protocol reminders and  
dose calculations.  
 
Study procedures  
We had originally planned to use either acceleromyography (Stimpod 450, Xavant, Pretoria,  
South Africa) or electromyography for research measurements in this study. After trying  
electromyographic measurements for four patients in this study we observed that the new  
electromyographic monitors at our institutions had inconsistent performan ce. We therefore  
decided to exclusively use a Stimpod [ADDRESS_1014234] 15 s. If the  
initial two measurements were not within 10% agreement, additional measurements (up to four  
total) separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1014235] anesthesia care unit (PACU).  
 Baseline measurements were used to normalize all subsequent measurements. This was done to  
correct for the inflated TOFR values that are usually obtained by [CONTACT_741826]. 20,21 As an  
example, if the baseline TOFR is 1.15 and the raw postoperative TOFR is 0.95, then the nTOFR  
is 0.95/1.15 =0.83. Normalization usually yields lower TOF ratios, and it is more likely to  
classify observations as positive for PRNB. Theref ore, the incidence of PRNB is typi[INVESTIGATOR_741824] -normalized (also referred to as “raw”) measurements.  
PRNB was defined as a nTOFR <0.9 on arrival to the PACU.

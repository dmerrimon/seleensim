Optimal Target of Activated Clotting Time During Percutaneous 
Coronary Intervention and Outcomes: The Randomized OPTIMAL -
ACT Trial  
 
The objective  of this proposal  is to identify the optimal range of the activated clotting time 
(ACT) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that is associated with the lowest rates 
of adverse clinical events.  The optimal ACT target during PCI has not previously been investigated in a prospective clinical trial, leaving uncertainty regarding the level of 
anticoagulation intensity during coronary revascularization procedures.  The primary research hypothesis  is that in the modern cardiac catheterization laboratory, where PCI procedural 
duration is relatively short and rates of intracoronary stenting and dual antiplatelet  therapy use is 
high, lower ACT targets, as compared with higher ACT targets, will be associated with lower 
rates of bleeding while having similar rates of ischemic events.

Rationale:   For the past three decades, unfractionated heparin (UFH) has remained the 
mainstay of  anticoagulat ion during invasive cardiac procedures (1-3) and has been the only 
available anticoagulant in interventional cardiology for many years (4) . Advantages to UFH are 
related to availability, familiarity, low cost, point -of-care (POC) testing using the activated 
clotting time (ACT), and  reversibility with  protamine sulfate.  Use of peri -procedural 
anticoagulation with UFH during percutaneous coronar y intervention (PCI) is re commended to 
reduce thrombus formation on interventional devices and thrombotic complications during 
PCI(4-6).POC testing allows targeting ACT values to recommended ranges, gives fairly 
reproducible results, and ACT values increase linearly with UFH supplementation and decrease 
without additional UFH over time(7) .  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_850070] -treated patients undergoing PCI, there  are limited and often conflicting data 
regarding the association of  ACT target values and outcomes(6,8 -10).  Importantly, data for the 
relationship between ACT and outcomes are sparse in contemporary PCI practice that now 
includes the use of lower profile equipment, high rates of intracoronary stenting,  transradial 
procedures,  and dual antiplatelet therapy (10).  Early small studies found low rates of ischemic 
complications with low and fixed dose heparin(11,12), while pooled data from clinical trial 
participants suggested lower ischemic event rates with higher ACT targets of [ADDRESS_1181813] of higher rates of bleeding(8) .  Other studies analyzing low risk 
patients from clinical trials have not observed an association between ACT levels and ischemic endpoints(9,10) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_850071] , uncertainty remains 
regarding the association between ACT cutoffs and outcomes  in contemporary  practice, largely 
related to lack of randomized trials evaluating the optimum ACT target and its relation with 
events.   Practice guidelines conclude that despi[INVESTIGATOR_850072], often 
based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_850073], the utility of ACT in clinical practice remains uncertain (4).  
 
The pO in
t -of-care PracTice to IMP rove use of A nticoaguLation (OPTIMAL) -ACT trial is a 
prospective, randomized , investigator -initiated , trial to determine the optimal  ACT target value in 
patients undergoing PCI.  This will be the first prospective outcomes trial powered to identify the 
optimal  ACT target range for reducing the rate of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850074] (Bleeding Academic 
Research Consortium and EASY grading defined (Appendix  I)).  Different bleeding definitions 
will be used to account for shift in access site practice from femoral to radial, both here at Mayo 
Clinic [LOCATION_012], and in the [LOCATION_002].  In addition, the EASY grading scale is unique to 
transradial catheterization and complications related to bleeding may be more frequent among 
women (13).   Rates of net  adverse cardiovascular events (N ACE) (defined as all -cause 
mortality,  myocardial infarction (MI), stroke , or bleeding) would be identified as a primary safety 
endpoint in the trial.  We a im to test the hypothesis that lower ACT target values, as compared 
to higher ACT target values,  are associated with lower risk of bleeding without compromising 
efficacy as assessed by [CONTACT_87677].  This finding would have significant 
implications for improving the safety of PCI by [CONTACT_850095] .  
 
A. Signific anc e:  The significance of the study proposal can be highlighted by 1) the recognition 
of the burden of coronary artery disease (CAD), 2) the widespread adoption and performance of 
PCI, and 3) the limited data regarding appropriate anticoagulation intensity during PCI. CAD 
causes [ADDRESS_1181814] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850075] -related death (14). 
Improvements in adherence to guideline- recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_850076], including use of coronary revascularization procedures, have impacted the 
decline in deaths related to cardiovascular disease over the past several years.  PCI is 
performed commonly in the [LOCATION_002] with an estimated 490,000 procedures in 2010 alone (15). In patients with acute coronary syndromes, early revascularization with PCI has been 
demonstrated to improve outcomes.  As the technical success rates of PCI have continued to 
remain very high, there has been a renewed interest in delivering PCI safely and reducing 
complications.  This evolution in contemporary PCI includes use of lower profile devices, smaller 
caliber intravascular sheaths, shorter procedural durations, and greater adoption of transradial 
catheterization.  In addition, strategies to mitigate bleeding have garnered greater attention 
given the association of bleeding with adverse short and long-term outcomes.  A fundamental aspect of current PCI practice involves the use of anticoagulants  during the procedure to reduce 
the risk of thrombus formation on interventional devices (i.e., guiding catheters, wires) and reduce the risk of abrupt vessel closure.  The intensity of anticoagulation to reduce thrombotic 
risk is, however, on balance with increased bleeding risk, which have led to recommendations 
on appropriate ACT targets during PCI (4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_850077], bleeding 
events are observed in [ADDRESS_1181815] target ranges  (8).  In 
addition,  due to the limited evidence base, guidelines have also acknowledged that “the utility of 
measured ACT levels in current practice should be considered uncertain”(4).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_850078]’s decision to intensify or reduce the level of 
anticoagulation in the patient, and thus directly impact  the ischemic vs. bleeding risk -calculus , 
optimizing the dose of UFH during PCI has clinical equipoise.  The current gaps in knowledge, therefore, underscores the need for a rigorous  study of anticoagulation intensity during PCI to 
improve patient safety and advance scientific understanding of ACT monitoring.  This  has 
significant public health implications  and tremendous potential to impact the current practice of 
PCI.  In alignment with Mayo Clinic’s commitment to improving the safety of patient care , the 
knowledge gap with regard to intensity of heparinization during PCI remains an important and unanswered question in interventional cardiology.  
 
B. Specific Aims :  
 Anticoagulation is  routinely administered prior to performing PCI in 
interventional cardiology practice and intensity of anticoagulation is monitored using POC 
testing for the ACT.  However, current target values were derived from older, case- control 
studies (6,16), and supported by [CONTACT_447] -hoc retrospective analysis from trials of antithrombotic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (9,10).  In the modern era of high rates of dual antiplatelet therapy use, low profile devices, greater attention to access site management, and shorter procedural duration, the 
optimal ACT target for PCI remains unknown.  The overall objective  of this proposal  is to identify 
the optimal range of the activated clotting time (ACT) during percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) that is associated with the lowest rates of adverse clinical events.  The optimal ACT target during PCI has not previously been investigated in a prospective clinical trial, leaving uncertainty 
regarding the level of anticoagulation intensity during coronary revascularization procedures.  
We hypothesize t hat in the modern cardiac catheterization laboratory, where PCI procedural 
duration is relatively short and rates of intracoronary stenting and dual antiplatelet therapy use is high, lower ACT targets, as compared with higher ACT targets, will be associated with lower rates of bleeding while having similar rates of ischemic events. The specific aims of this  study  
are as follows:  
B.1.1 Aim 1  (P
 rimary):  The primary aim of this study of patients undergoing PCI is to compare 
the risk of bleeding in patients randomized to a low ACT target to those randomized to either a 
medium or high ACT target.  We hypothesi ze that the risk of bleeding will be lower in those with 
a low ACT target compared to those with a medium ACT target as well as those with a high ACT target .  See Figure [ADDRESS_1181816] target ranges.  
B.1.2 Aim 2  (P
 rimary):  We aim to estimate the incidence of both our primary study outcome 
(bleeding) and our primary safety endpoint (NACE) separately for those with a low, medium, 
and high ACT target.  
B.1.3 Aim 3  (Primary):  We aim to establish whether there is evidence of non- inferiority  of a low 
ACT target compared to a high ACT target with respect to the proportion of patients undergoing 
PCI with respect to NACE.  We hypothesize that the rate of NACE is the same as or lower than 
that for patients with a high ACT target.  
B.1.4 Aim 4 ( Secondary) : We aim to study the impact of sex, access -site (i.e., radial vs femoral), 
and concomitant use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors on the association of ACT target with 
bleeding.  It has been shown that female sex is associated with higher ACT targets during PCI  
(17), and work from our group has shown an important observed interaction with myocardial 
infarction risk in women, but not men, with ACT targets >350 seconds(18).  This observation of 
a potential differential sex -specific interaction has not previously been reported and requires 
validation in a prospective study.  In addition, it has previously been shown that women appear 
to be at higher risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_850079]. The use of transradial PCI has steadily increased in the [LOCATION_002], though 
adoption of this technique remains lower than that observed in Canada and Europe.  However, recent internal PCI data from the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster 
has shown increasing utilization of the radial artery for PCI, now over 50%.  At Mayo Clinic 
[LOCATION_012], the percentage of radial access is over 70% and is considered the default access site 
for catheterization.  It remains unknown whether ACT targets can be similarly interpreted for 
radial PCI, as these original targets were derived from studies in primarily transfemoral access cohorts with larger vascular access sheaths.  Finally, the additional use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in UFH- treated patients has been associated with higher rates of major and minor bleeding (9), 
thus lower ACT target values (i.e., 200- 250 sec) are recommended in patients concomitantly 
treated with these agents.  In the Mayo Clinic experience, there was no apparent interaction by 
[CONTACT_850096]/IIIa inhibitor status when testing the association of ACT values to outcomes, however, 
baseline characteristics of groups receiving or not receiving these agents differed and residual confounding may have been present (18).  The OPTIMAL- ACT trial will incorporate a pre -
specified analysis with specific ACT targets in patients receiving GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors to better understand ACT targets and outcomes.  
B.1.5 Aim 5 (Exploratory):  We
  will e xplore the association of ACT targets with individual 
components of NACE and stent thrombosis for purposes of hypothesis generation.  
 
C. Innovation/Experience:   Ther e are two  innovative and unique aspects of this proposal.  1. 
This study will define the optimal ACT target during PCI.  2. Mayo Clinic (S. Michael 
Gharacholou, senior author) has published the largest non-randomized (observational) study on 
the relation of ACT and outcomes in the peer -reviewed literature(18) .  Our observations that 
ACT values were associated with unadjusted events, but were not independently associated 
with outcome after multivariable adjustment, offers credible background evidence for performing 
a prospective trial (18)  2.  This study will incorporate an evidence- based algorit hm for UFH 
supplementation and ACT sampling frequency to provide critical standardization to the process of intra- procedural anticoagulation.  In addition, the study will be novel in formally defining the 
use of the ACT target as the value prior to first coronary device activation, which is 
recommended as it is a single, unique value, and unbiased as compared to peak ACT or closing 
ACT values which are greatly influenced by [CONTACT_850097].  ACT prior to device activation 
has been used as the primary predictor variable in retrospective analyses from previous 
antiplatelet trials (19- 21), however, the extant literature is not consistent with use of pre -device 
ACT values.  
 
D. Approach :  P
 atients >[ADDRESS_1181817] are as follows:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
• Age>18 
• Ability of subject to give appropriate consent  
• Referred for coronary angiography with possible coronary revascularization or 
adjunctive invasive diagnostic testing (IVUS/OCT, FFR , or iFR ) 
 
Specific exclusions would include patients receiving low -molecular weight heparin at treatment 
doses with last dose within 6 hours of coronary angiography (patients on low -molecular weight 
heparin (LMWH) for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis would be eligible), upstream 
treatment with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors within the previous [ADDRESS_1181818] trial and recommendations 
would be for  dosing bivalirudin per the manufacturer’s instructions with ACT monitoring as used 
in the REPLACE- 2 trial (2 2), which included ACT value 5 minutes after initial bolus and if <225 
sec, an additional bolus of 0.3 mg/kg if needed. The following exclusion cri teria for OPTIMAL -
ACT are as follows:  
Exclusion Criteria:  
 
• Receipt of LMWH at treatment dose (not DVT prophylaxis dose) within 6 hours of 
coronary angiography  
• Prior GP IIb/IIIa use within the previous 72 hours  
• Use of warfarin (vitamin K antagonist) or direct oral anticoagulant  
• Patients on LMWH bridging strategy  
• PCI within prior 30 days  
• Planned use of bivalirudin as the procedural anticoagulant  
• Rotational atherectomy  
• Excimer laser coronary angioplasty  
• Chronic total occlusions  
• Patients with active bleeding disorders or bleeding diathesis  
• Patients with ST -segment elevation myocardial infarction  
• Patient with clinical evidence of cardiogenic shock (defined as SBP<90 mmHg for ≥30 
min OR support to maintain SBP ≥ 90 mmHg AND evidence of end -organ 
hypoperfusion (urine output <30 mL/h or cool extremities) 
• Chroni c kidney disease stage 4/5 (GFR 30 mL/min)  
 Patients would be randomized to one of three ACT target groups (Figure 1). Pat ients will 
undergo randomization (1:1:1) to either low ACT target, medium ACT target, or high ACT target using a software automatic program (insert information on SDMS).  ACT target ranges would be 
modified based on intended or provisional use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.  Target ranges for the 
OPTIMAL -ACT trial were based on both review of practice guideline recommendations, 
including the uncertainty expressed in the guidelines regarding ACT values and outcomes (4), 
and consensus agreement by [CONTACT_850098]. . PCI would be performed per routine clinical practice and selection of 
adjunctive oral antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_850080] c linical practice guidelines (4).  Patients woul d be observed post PCI for  
bleeding (primary endpoint), defined as BARC 1, 2, 3 or 5 and EASY I -V (Appendix) and for 
NACE ( i.e., ischemic events  or bleeding as the primary safety endpoint).  F ollow- up would 
extend for 30- days post PCI for occurrence of the primary endpoint and primary safety endpoint.

monitoring (Figure 2)(4).  The algorithm provides rigorous standardization to the process of ACT 
sampling and UFH supplementation to reduce the risk for bias in the study.  Although there will be multiple ACT values for each PCI procedure, the use of the ACT value prior to device activation will be the “target” for the purposes of the trial. In the event that an ACT prior to 
device activation was not obtained, the ACT value closest to the time of initial device activation will be used and the procedure time between the ACT sample and device activation will be 
recorded.

The Hemochron Signature [CONTACT_681187] (Hemochron® Jr.) whole blood microcoagulation system 
(International Technidyne Corporation, Edison, NJ) for ACT is the POC test performed in the 
cardiac catheterization laboratory at Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012].  The ACT demonstrates linear 
correlation to the anticoagulation effects of heparin to 2.5 units/,L of blood. The device is 
intended for  clinical use during in vitro diagnostic testing of whole blood for POC monitoring of 
anticoagulation intensity in UFH -treated patients undergoing medical procedures. The test result 
is automatically converted to a reference Celite® ACT value and both displayed and 
electronically recorded on the device. No other ACT assay system  will be used for the 
OPTIMAL -ACT trial. Although some patients receive non- UFH anticoagulants, ACT is most 
commonly used to monitor patients receiving UFH and undergoing cardiac catheterization.  The 
Mayo Clinic Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology oversees POC testing in the cardiac catheterization laboratories at Mayo Clinic  [LOCATION_012].  For the OPTIMAL- ACT trial, 
collaborators from the Mayo Clinic Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology will be co -
investigators to provide technical exper tise regarding POC testing using ACT.  Quality controls 
are outlined in an institutional Standard Operating Procedure document.   
 
E. P reliminary Work:  Data for the relationship between ACT and outcomes are sparse in 
contemporary PCI practice and guideline recommended targets for ACT during PCI were based 
on small studies in angioplasty alone settings (23 ) or proof -of-concept studies that did not report 
clinical outcomes (24).  Table [ADDRESS_1181825] primarily been derived 
from “lower- risk” populations in trials and are entirely post- hoc analyses, the exception being the 
registry based design of the Mayo Clinic experience by [CONTACT_850099] (S.M. Gharacholou, 
senior author), representing the largest study on this topic to date (18).  However, the study is 
primarily limited in terms of drawing firm conclusions by [CONTACT_850100].

F. Statistical Considerations :   
F1. Randomization and blinding: Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of the three ACT 
target groups (low, medium, or high) using a dynamic minimization algorithm so as to optimize 
the likelihood that balance between the low, medium, and high ACT target groups will be 
achieved with respect to sex (male or female) and glomerular filtration rate (30 to 59 
ml/min/1.73m2 or ≥60 ml/min/1.73m2). The algorithm will be will be implemented in RAVE 
RTSM, a secure web -based interface, and accessed by [CONTACT_850102].  Randomization will be conducted after the diagnostic portion of the procedure on only patients who will require ACT monitoring.  Since eligible patients will require ACT monitoring during PCI, we will not conduct the study in a strictly blinded fashion. However, 
study participants will not be informed of their randomization assignment.  
 
F2. Data collection and handling: Electronic case report forms along with a corresponding 
secure REDCap database will be created for data collection (29).  Data to be collected will 
include baseline demographics, comorbidities, procedural variables, in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400113], NACE 
component, and adverse events . 
 F3: Definition of study outcomes:  Study endpoints are summarized in Appendix II. 
F3.1 Primary study  endpoint: Our primary study endpoint is bleeding and is defined as either 
a Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) hemorrhage grade of 1, 2, 3, or 5 or an 
EASY hematoma scale grade of I -V from the time of PCI to the time the patient is discharged 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
F3.2 Primary safety endpoint: Our primary safety endpoint is a composite of net adverse clinical events (NACE)  and stent thrombosis, as defined by [CONTACT_850103] , from the time of PCI to the time the patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .   
F3.2.1 NACE is the composite of all- cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, target 
lesion revascularization , and major bleeding within 30 days after PCI .   
F3.2.2 MI will be defined as any two of the following 3 criteria: 1) chest pain for at least 20 
minutes; 2) elevation of cardiac biomarkers, preferably troponin, above the laboratory upper limit 
of normal; and 3) new pathological Q wave on electrocardiogram.   
F3.3.[ADDRESS_1181829] at Mayo Clinic with documentation on appropriate neuroimaging (CT or MRI).  
F3.3.4 Major bleeding will be  defined as BARC grade 3 or 5 or EASY grade ≥III. 
F3.3.[ADDRESS_1181830] noted by [CONTACT_850104].   
F3.4 The study definition of non- inferiority will be defined based on the 95% confidence interv al 
for the difference in proportions of patients with NACE in the low and high ACT target groups, Δ 
= p
L-pH, with a lower limit of Δ L and an upper limit of ΔU  .  Low ACT target will be considered to 
be non- inferior to high ACT target if one of the following holds, depending on the estimate pH : 
• ΔU  < 0. 12 if pH ≥0.12 
• ΔU  < pH if 0.04 <pH<0.12 
• ΔU  < 0.0 4 if pH ≤0.04 
Note that italicized version are the theoretical proportions and the estimates are not italicized.  
F.4. Sample size determination: Recognizing the limitations of previously performed studies 
regarding ACT and risk of bleeding, including variability in definitions of bleeding, we estimate that the highest ACT target group will experience the in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850082] a rate of 
25%, while the lowest ACT target will experience the in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850082] a rate of 
5%.   A sample size of of 504 patients  was determined to ensure more than 80% power at the 
two-sided overall 5% significance level with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing ( p value 
≤0.025 considered as statistically significant) to detect an absolute difference in in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850083] ( Aim 1 ) between the low ACT target and the medium ACT target (ie. 5% vs. 15%) in 
addition to a 20% absolute difference between the low ACT target and the high ACT target (ie. 
5% vs. 25%).  The power was estimated on the the basis of 5000 simulations.  Patients meeting 
eligibility criteria for the study and who consent for participation but that do not undergo randomization due to either not receiving intracoronary diagnostic imaging (IVUS/OCT) or 
physiologic testing (iFR/FFR) or PCI will be entered into the ACT registry and observed for 
clinical events, including 30- day outcomes.  The reason these patients are not categorized as 
screen failures is because the final criterion for eligibility is receipt of PCI, a criterion that is not 
known until the coronary angiogram is performed which is after patients have signed informed consent.  Because patients receive moderate sedation during their procedure as part  of 
standard of care, ethical and scientific prudence dictates that informed consent be obtained prior to procedural start.  True screen failures, therefore, are those subjects not meeting study 
inclusion or exclusion criteria.  .   Based on current lab practice patterns at our institution, i t is 
anticipated that approximately 20% of patients who enroll in the study will not require ACT 
monitoring after the diagnostic portion of the procedure, therefore we intend to consent up to 
780 patients .   In 2016, there were 240 PCI procedures and 220 adjunctive coronary 
imaging/physiology procedures (Fractional Flow Reserve = 158, Intravascular Ultrasound = 59, 
Optical Coherence Tomography = 12)  establishing the feasibility of performing the  study and 
meeting patient accrual targets over an 18 - 24 month period.    
 
W
e also considered the implications of this samples size with the other primary aims.  For 
purposes of estimating the incidence of our study endpoint and safety endpoint  (Aim 2), a 
sample size of 504 with equal allocation to each of the three study arms would produce a two -
sided 95% confidence interval with a width of 0.15 or less using the Wilson score method.  T his 
sample size would also ensure more than 80% power to show evidence of non- inferiority for our 
primary safety endpoint ( NACE, Aim 3) in patients with a low ACT target compared to those with 
a high ACT target according to the above criteria  (section F3.4) when the low and high ACT 
targets are the same with respect to NACE assuming the probability of NACE with a high ACT target is 12% or more.  A review of the published literature had a median estimated rate of 12% 
for NACE (range 4% to 20% (T able 2) .

F5. Statistical analysis plans:  
F5.1 Patient population for analysis: The primary analysis will include all randomized patients.  Since patients will be randomized after the diagnostic portion of the procedure and the primary 
study outcome will be collected during their initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850084], we anticipate 
negligible loss to follow- up and negligible imbalance between study arms.  Analys is of the study 
aims  will be conducted using an intent -to-treat approach, which means it will be an analysis 
including all randomized patients according to the group they were randomized regardless of 
whether or not the  assigned ACT target  was achieved.  
F5.2 Primary analysis plan: Aim 1: T he risk of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850085] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850086] -wise chi -square tests (or Fisher’s exact test).  Relative risks 
and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  For these two tests of the primary study 
outcome, a two- sided p -value ≤ 0.025 will be considered statistically significant using the 
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing.  This means that the overall two -sided level of 
significance for the trial will be 0.05.   Aim 2: We will estimate the proportion of patients with each 
outcome (bleeding, NACE) along with 95% confidence intervals for the proportions using the Wilson score method separately for the three groups.   Aim 3: We will create a 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in proportions of patients with NACE in the low and high ACT target 
groups  using the Newcombe score method.  This will be used to assess whether there is 
evidence of non- inferiority of low ACT target compared to high ACT target according  to the 
definition in section F3.4.  
 F5.3 Secondary analysis plan: We will evaluate if associations between ACT target group (low, 
medium, high) and in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850087], access site, and concomitant 
use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa  inhibitors (Aim 2) using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  For 
these pre- planned tests, a two- sided p- value≤0.[ADDRESS_1181832] (or Fisher’s exact test) for categorical variables.  For those baseline characteristics with imbalance between groups, we will summarize the number and percentage as well as 
relative risk and 95% confidence intervals as was done with the pre -planned analyses of sex, 
access site, and concomitant use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors with stratification by [CONTACT_850105].  In addition, we will use a multivariable logistic regression model with in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850088] r outcome measure and fixed effect s for group (reference group = low 
ACT target), sex, access site, concomitant use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and any other baseline characteristics with evidence of potential imbalance between groups (p -
value≤0.20) allowing no more than one variable for every 10 patients who experience in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850083].  
 
F5.4 Exploratory analysis plan: We will explore the association of ACT target with individual  
components of bleeding and NACE using a Cochran- Armitage trend test and report the number 
and percent of patients with each component separately for each group.  Adjustment for multiple 
testing will be conducted using the Holm step -down method.  
 
F5.5 Interim analysis plan:  A blinded review of the study’s overall incidence of the primary study 
outcome and the primary safety endpoint will be planned after 50% of patients have completed 
the study.  If this review suggests that assumed incidence used to plan the study is much higher 
than the actual event rate then we may reestimate the sample size to ensure the study is 
adequately powered.  Since the analysis will be conducted blind to group assignment this will 
not introduce statistical bias and adjustment to the study’s significance level is not required. ..

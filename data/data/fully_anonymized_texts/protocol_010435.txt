1Use of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) Platform for COVID-19 Patients
SIGNIFICANCE
COVID-19 pandemic and significant background information 
The severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to impact the world with 
its exponential growth and fatalities related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). (1)  We have seen a 
global spread of the virus with the current number of reported cases exceeding 2,000,000. (2) While 
there have been other viral outbreaks in the past years (MERS, SARS, H1N1), SARS-CoV-2 has profoundly 
penetrated and impacted the world. (3)  Our healthcare systems have been stretched to their limits, 
especially in designated "hotspots," such as all boroughs of [LOCATION_001] City.  It is clear that given the 
current outbreak of COVID-19 and previous viral contagions, a comprehensive system is necessary for 
patient care during a pandemic. The need for risk stratification of infected patients with longitudinal 
monitoring is pi[INVESTIGATOR_338767].  We believe that 
emerging technologies incorporating remote patient monitoring (RPM) will play a key role in current and 
future systems-level solutions that can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_338768].   
 
The clinical presentation of COVID-[ADDRESS_418842] COVID-19 patients present 
with mild to moderate symptoms, approximately 14%-20% of patients develop severe symptoms that 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 5% of these patients require critical care services. (4-8)  One of the most 
troubling features of COVID-19 is the unexpected and rapid deterioration of some infected patients. An 
estimated 10% of COVID-19 patients can develop life-threatening conditions such as acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS), the treatment of which requires aggressive intervention. (9) As observed in 
other diseases, a delay in identifying clinical deterioration can result in belated therapeutic 
interventions, thereby [CONTACT_338789]. (2,10,11).The clinical variability of symptoms 
and progression of disease makes triaging and disposition of COVID-19 patients extremely challenging.   
Similar to SARS, MERS, and H1N1, respi[INVESTIGATOR_338769] a central role in COVID-19 morbidity and 
mortality.(12,13)  The pathological data of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with patchy inflammatory cellular 
infiltration of the lung tissue. (14) Even though there are several reasons for death in COVID-19 patients, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_338770], and shortness of breath are two early warning 
signs associated with adverse events. (15)  It is important to note that while respi[INVESTIGATOR_338771], there are also systemic 
responses and deterioration of other organs. (15,16).  Therefore, a comprehensive remote patient 
monitoring (RPM) system must incorporate a number of physiologic parameters in order to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_338772].   
As this is a novel pandemic, there are limited resources available for accurate identification of patients 
at high risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_338773]. Studies have demonstrated that delays in 
the identification of clinical deterioration resulting in late therapeutic interventions are associated with 
increased mortality and morbidity. (17) Strategies for identifying patients at highest risk and mobilizing 
early interventions have the potential to improve outcomes.  Patients presenting to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338774] (ECMO).  Moreover, early 
identification and subsequent intervention could mitigate disease progression, deterioration, and the 
need for more advanced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

2Lack of these predictive measures forces our healthcare system to adopt a "one-size-fits-all" model, 
which is inefficient, prohibitively expensive, and clinically ineffective in too many patients. As in the case 
of COVID-19, lack of a valid risk stratification tool and the possibility of the rapid deterioration of 
symptoms warrant continuous monitoring of non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338775]. 
(18) The use of RPM could be instrumental in understanding and developi[INVESTIGATOR_338776]. Moreover, during the medical surge, 
resource utilization is one of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_338777]. Appropriate resource utilization is essential to provide quality care to every patient and 
to mitigate the adverse outcomes associated with pandemics. The 4 "S' s," staff, stuff, space, and 
systems are the critical factors in pandemic preparedness and resource utilization.  
COVID-[ADDRESS_418843] higher mortality rates among the 
African-American and Hispanic populations. (19) The Bronx represents one of the most diverse 
populations in the country and has been profoundly affected by [CONTACT_4113]-19.   An ability to monitor 
patients in an out-patient setting with wearable technology has the potential to address some of the 
historical obstacles to timely healthcare access for our patient population.  The use of continuous 
monitoring would allow us to understand the progression of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_418844] become everyday devices capable of collecting physiological data such as heart 
rate, blood pressure, body temperature,  and blood oxygen saturation. (20) The utilization and success 
of wearable technologies have been demonstrated in various medical conditions, such as cancer, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748], heart disorders management, and diabetic care management. (21-23)In a recently 
published study, researchers demonstrated the utilization of wearables to track the resting heart rate 
and sleep pattern to predict the incidence of influenza-like illness. (24)  The improvements in wearable 
technologies provide opportunities for clinicians to deliver patient-centered care and engage patients in 
shared decision-making. In addition, detailed, longitudinal physiologic data could provide more insight 
into the development of advanced analytical tools for a better understanding of disease development 
and progression, early detection, and intervention. Data-driven clinical decisions, coupled with advanced 
analytical methods such as artificial intelligence (AI), have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare 
is delivered and improve the outcomes. The steady stream of information provided by [CONTACT_338790]-time disease progression and providing individualized care. 
Newly emerging and re-emergence of known and unknown pathogens have created unpredictable 
threats to global public health. In the recent period, infectious diseases such as mumps, measles, Ebola, 
and SARS have created unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems. Effective measures to limit 
the contagion include disease surveillance, hygiene measures, self-isolation, social distancing, travel 
restrictions, quarantine, and case isolation. Of all the above-described actions, case isolation (self-
isolation) and contact [CONTACT_338791].  One of the potential ways to safely implement self-isolation without impeding 
care is to develop protocols to monitor isolated patients remotely.

3Hypothesis
The central hypothesis motivating this study is that remote patient monitoring (RPM) of infectious 
disease patients can efficiently facilitate self-isolation. Additionally, RPM can assist in more rapid 
identification of patients at risk, facilitate detection of patient deterioration, and enable early 
interventions, all of which play a vital role in resource utilization and outcomes.   
Specific Aims
Aim-I To develop and test a clinical care pathway that can be utilized in similar epi[INVESTIGATOR_338778]. To study this aim, we will be using the COVID-19 medical surge as a condition to evaluate the 
framework of delivering care through remote patient monitoring. The success of this care delivery 
model will be evaluated on ease of model implementation, patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and 
the utilization of shared decision making.  
Aim-II To evaluate remote patient monitoring for appropriate resource utilization in epi[INVESTIGATOR_338779]. To evaluate this aim, we plan to compare the emergency department (ED) visits 
and inpatient admission of patients with and without wearable remote patient monitoring devices. 
Additionally, we will compare the number of patients that required critical interventions (mechanical 
ventilation and ECMO) during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
Aim III To evaluate the utilization of wearable technology for upfront predictions of patients that 
would require inpatient admissions. To evaluate this aim, patients who are diagnosed with COVID-[ADDRESS_418845] of care at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  ED visits, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124021], and patient satisfaction will be the outcome measures compared between the two groups.  
Aim IV To evaluate the association between early identification of critical, abnormal vital signs and the 
prevention of serious adverse events.  To evaluate this aim, patients in the monitored group and non-
monitored group will be compared for ED visits, inpatient admissions, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and 
serious adverse events. 
Objectives 
The primary purpose of the study is to compare the number of inpatient admissions between the 
monitored and non-monitored patients.
The secondary endpoints are to compare the number of ED visits, length of stay, patient satisfaction, the 
incidence of mechanical ventilation, ECMO, and serious adverse events (events requiring extended 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]).

Recruitment Strategy 
Every day around [ADDRESS_418846] will be generated on every alternate day; for example, the list will be 
generated on (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). We are only planning to enroll 5-[ADDRESS_418847] a balance in the number of patients in the 
intervention and the control group. Also, it helps us to streamline the study logistics.   After screening 
for inclusion and exclusion criteria, the research team will identify potential patients eligible for the 
study. 
 
The research team will call the patients in the evening and explain the purpose of the study and will 
obtain oral consent. Before calling the patient, the research team will review the EPIC notes to make 
sure their COVID results are shared and discussed with the patients.  Oral consents will serve as a 
method of patients giving consent for engaging in the study discussion. The paper consents will be 
delivered to the patients with the study materials  ( tablet, sensors SPO2, and blood pressure cuff).  
After reading the consents, patients have the opportunity to decline participation in the study and 
return the study materials.  Once patients sign the consent, patients will have two options to return the 
signed copy. Either they can take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_338780], or at the end of the study, they can return the signed consents along with the tablet.  We will 
keep a registry of the consenting process, which includes date and time, and the name [CONTACT_338798].  For patients who email the signature, the investigator portion will 
be signed and dated on the day of receiving the email. For patients who are returning the signed 
consent with the tablet package, the investigator portion will be signed and dated on the day of 
receiving the tablet.  
Delivery and Return of the Study Materials 
The following day morning, the research staff will drop off the monitoring packages at the patient's 
preferable drop-off locations. The research team will call the patients to confirm the receiving of the 
study materials. Once the packet is delivered, the study team will share the details of the patients with 
ImagineMic, the external company which will be monitoring the patients. Once the patient completes 
IRB NUMBER: 2020-[ZIP_CODE]
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/08/2020
5the 14 days of participation, the patient is required to return the study materials to the study team.  The 
research team will make the necessary arrangements for the return of the study materials. 
External Monitoring 
ImagineMic will be monitoring the patients for CDC recommended 14 days. (25) ImagineMIC has 
extensive monitoring experience and is providing services in different capacities and capabilities. (25) 
ImagineMic uses a secure, HIPPA compliant platform for monitoring the patients. Additionally, round 
the clock, licensed healthcare professionals continuously monitor these data from a monitoring 
intervention center. Detailed monitoring plans are explained in the submitted brochure ( Appendix-1).
Monitoring will be prematurely terminated if the patient requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; in all other 
cases, monitoring will be continued for fourteen days. During the monitoring period, patients will have 
the opportunity to call and speak to the medical professional at the Monitoring Intervention Center and 
also can call 911 in case of a severe emergency. Additionally, submitted is the guidelines put together by 
[CONTACT_338792]-19 patients from home to the emergency      
(Appendix-2)
The patients will be remotely monitored for their vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, SPO 2, 
skin temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], two lead ECG, and accelerometer.  
All the collected physiologic data will be transmitted to a central monitoring station where it will be 
evaluated continuously by [CONTACT_338793] (MD, RN, and NP) who will provide real-time 
support to the patients. Also, the research team will obtain all the data points for future analytic 
purposes. Additionally, the research team will conduct a [ADDRESS_418848] of care 
available for the patients discharged from the emergency room will be provided to the patients, 
including telephone consultations. The study team will not interfere or dictate the care provided to the 
control patients.  
Technology
This study will be integrating two technologies; an FDA approved proprietary body patch and a digital 
monitoring platform.  The FDA approved body patch that will be used in this study is lifesignal biosensor 
1AX*, which is capable of monitoring vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. (26) These patches are also capable of generating electrocardiogram (ECG) and function

6as an accelerometer. Additionally, an FDA approved pulse oximeter, and blood pressure monitor will be 
used to measure the peripheral oxygen saturation and blood pressure, respectively
The digital monitoring platform ImagineMic will be utilized for continuous digital monitoring of the 
physiologic measurements. (27) The vital signs generated through the biosensor patch will be 
continuously supervised at the Monitoring Intervention Center (MIC) by [CONTACT_338794]. These data points are monitored 24/7and alerts will be provided to patients in case an 
intervention is needed. Additionally, based on the condition of the patient, the monitoring staff will 
facilitate ambulance support if required. The schematic representation of the study proposal is depi[INVESTIGATOR_338781] 1. 
In addition to remote monitoring, the monitoring team will collect the data about their daily clinical 
symptoms, including cough, myalgia, difficulty in breathing, and any other clinically significant 
symptoms.  Additionally, at the end of the monitoring period (14days), a personal well-being 
questionnaire will be administered to those patients who experience no adverse events.  
Cost and Reimbursement 
There will be no cost for the patient to participate in this study. The department of the anesthesiology    
(grant fund) and ImagineMic (company monitoring the patients) will share the cost of the wearables. 
The cost of the monitoring will be billed to the insurance company by [CONTACT_338795]. Patients will not be 
reimbursed for participating in the study. 
Data Collection and Storage
All the study data will be collected on a paper case report form (CRF), which will be entered into the 
computer database. All the data points will be collected and managed using RedCap electronic data 
capture tools.  All the electronic files will be saved in a password-protected computer in the research 
office.  Additionally, de-identified continuous monitoring data will be shared with the Montefiore Center 
for Health and Data Innovation team for additional analysis. 
DSMB
The first DSMB meeting will be conducted after the completion of 50% of the enrollment. The safety of 
the RPM will be the only outcome discussed during the DSMB meetings. Additionally, all the adverse 
events associated with the RPM will be reported to the DSMB and the IRB. In the event of serious 
adverse events, the termination or the continuation of the study will be at the discretion of the IRB. No 
interim analysis will be conducted, and the efficacy of the study will not be discussed at the DSMB 
meetings.
Statistical Analysis
In this prospective observational study, we are evaluating the efficacy of continuous monitoring in 
preventing inpatient admissions. A sample size of 300 patients is targeted for enrollment; 150 in the 
monitoring and 150 in the non-monitoring group. The sample size calculation is based on the 
hypothesized reduction of 10% inpatient admission between the two groups; 15% admission in the non-
monitoring group and 5% in the monitoring group, 80% statistical power, and 20% type –II error.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/08/2020
7All continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: mean, standard 
deviation, median, maximum, and minimum. The frequency and percentages will be reported for all 
categorical variables. No interim analysis will be performed. Quantitative variables will be compared 
using parametric or non-parametric t-test. A Chi-square test will be used for the comparison of 
categorical outcomes. All significance tests will be two-tailed, and values of P <0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant.   
Risks and Benefits
Risks associated with this study are minimal.   Complications from pulse oximeters and the LifeSignal 
Biosensor 1AX* are exceedingly rare. Complications that may occur in this study include feeling a small 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_338782] a small irritation to the skin. Subjects will be asked to 
provide personal information (PHI). All attempts will be made to keep the PHI confidential within the 
limits of the law. All the study documents will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the research office. 
Electronic files will be password protected. Informed consent will clearly state that by [CONTACT_255327], the patient’s personal information will be shared with an external monitoring agency.
The potential benefits of remote monitoring are at the patient, provider, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172882]. One of the 
most important benefits for the patient is that during the self-isolating, and self-quarantine period, RPM 
can potentially provide peace of mind and daily assurance about their condition. In addition, enrolled 
patients will be able to instantly connect to their provider without any additional visit to the ED or clinic. 
These remote interactions could play a significant role in preventing the spread of the disease. At the 
provider level, because of the real-time availability of patient data, providers can deliver high-quality 
healthcare to a higher number of patients. Also, providers could use continuous physiological data 
points in risk stratifying and identifying patients with evidence of clinical deterioration and the need for 
care escalation.  At the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172882], RPM can potentially reduce the need for inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338783]. Additionally, RPM may allow earlier discharge of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], thereby 
[CONTACT_338796]. Finally, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338784].

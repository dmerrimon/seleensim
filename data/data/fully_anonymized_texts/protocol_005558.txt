2.2.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In mouse  NASH models, TERN-101 inhibited 7- DC4 and significantly reduced NAFLD 
activity score (NAS) and liver fib rosis area. NAS was markedly reduced by [CONTACT_443817]-
101 tested ( Figure 1, left panel) with an 80% reduc tion from baseline at 100 mg/kg (mpk). 
Steatosis was reduced to healthy control (lean mice) levels at 30 mpk ( Figure 2 , left), and 
hepatocellular ballooning was red uced to healthy control levels  at 100 mpk ( Figure 2 , middle).  
Hepatic inflamma tion was also reduced in TERN-101 treated mice (Figure 2 , right). The 
improvement in liver histology c orrelated with a reduction in liver triglycerides, serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_443808]-related enzymes ALT and AST. These results indicate p otent FXR agonist activity and 
support that TERN-101 has the potential for use in the treatmen t of NASH.

4.1. Overall Design 
This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, para llel-group study. 
Approximately 96 clinically or histologically diagnosed adult n on-cirrhotic presumed NASH 
patients who meet study eligibilit y criteria will  be enrolled a nd randomized at an overall ratio of 
1:1:1:1 into 4 groups receiving 5 mg (n = 24), 10 mg (n = 24), 15 mg (n = 24) TERN-101 tablet 
or matching placebo (n = 24) orally once daily.  
Of the [ADDRESS_564539] dose of study drug. Thi s includes 6 patients at each 
TERN-101 dose level, and 6 patients in the placebo group. Patie nts who are not participating in 
the PK/PD sub-study will have  trough PK/PD sampling only.  
The total study duration will be a pproximately [ADDRESS_564540] of TERN-101 on 
efficacy parameters  in a NASH population. 
4.3. Justification for Dose 
Based on PK results from TERN 101-US-A104 Phase 1 study in healt hy subjects, the tablet 
formulation of TERN-101 was dose linear in the range of 5 mg to  25 mg, with AUC 0-t of  
475 (±161) ng*hr/mL and 2890 (± 720) ng*hr/mL for 5 and 25 mg ta blets, respectively. 
 
 
Evidence of FXR target enga gement was seen for doses ranged from 5 mg to 
25 mg tablets of TERN-101 (see Section 2.2.3). The doses selected for this study of [ADDRESS_564541]  of food intake on TERN-101 PK based on results from 
Study TERN101-US-A104, thus TERN- 101 can be dosed without regar d to food intake.

6.4. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
Patients will be ra ndomized to TERN-101 or placebo using an Int eractive Web Response System 
(IWRS). Before the study is in itiated, the log-i n information a nd directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site.  
Approximately 96 patients will be randomized at an overall rati o of 1:1:1:1 into 4 groups 
receiving 5 mg (n = 24), 10 mg ( n = 24), 15 mg (n = 24) TERN-10 1 tablet, or matching placebo 
(n = 24). Randomization will en sure 6 patients at each TERN-101  dose level and 6 patients in the 
placebo group are assigned t o the PK/PD sub-study. 
Investigators, patients, all study personnel, and the Sponsor w ill remain blinded t o each patient’s 
assigned dose group throughout the course of the study. Study d rug will be dispensed at the 
study visits as summarized in Sche dule of Activities. Returned study drug should not be re-
dispensed to patients.  
6.4.1. Unblinding  
Treatment assignment may be unbli nded if knowing the patient’s treatment assignment would 
affect immediate medical management of the patient. The IWRS wi ll be programmed with blind-
breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the Investigato r has the sole responsibility for 
determining if unblinding of a patient’s intervention assignmen t is warranted. Pa tient safety must 
always be the first considera tion in making such a determinatio n. If the Investigator decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the Inve stigator should make every eff ort to contact [CONTACT_416468] a patient’s interven tion assignment unless this coul d delay emergenc y treatment of

Any unblinding of Sponsor personnel for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) or other reasons will be addressed in a separate plan.  
6.4.2. Patient Enrollment and Study Drug Assignment 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that patient eligibility is c onfirmed prior to 
randomization. Documentation of t he personally signed and dated informed consent of each 
patient, using the study-specific ICF, is required before initi ating the Screening Period.  
After written informed consent ha s been obtained, the patient’s  identification number will be 
obtained from the IWRS. Once e ligibility to partic ipate has bee n established, the randomized 
treatment assignment will be  obtained from the IWRS.

8.5. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient or clinic al study patient, temporally 
associated with the use of st udy drug, whether or not considere d related to the study drug.  
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that, at a ny dose, results in the 
following: death; is life threatening; requires in-patient hosp italization; results in persistent 
disability or incapacity; is a c ongenital anomaly or birth defe ct; or is a medicall y important event 
or reaction that ma y not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443811] m edical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes in the definition.  
Events meeting the definition of  an AE or SAE are defined in Appendix 6, including details on 
recording, reporting, and follow- up of AEs and SAEs, assessment  of intensity, and assessment of 
causality. AEs will be reported by t he patient (or , when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or 
the patient's legally authorize d representative) at every study  visit.

recording events that meet t he definition of a n AE or SAE and r emain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, consid ered related to the study drug o r study procedures, or that caused 
the patient to disconti nue the study drug (see Section 7 ). 
8.5.1. Time Period and Frequency for Co llecting AE and SAE Information  
After informed consent but pr ior to initiation of study drug, t he following types of events should 
be reported: all AEs and SAEs related to pr otocol-mandated proc edures.  
Medical occurrences (events cons idered not related to protocol- mandated procedures) that begin 
before the start of study drug but after obtaining informed con sent will be recorded on the 
Medical History/Current Medi cal Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE section. 
All AEs and SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, will be collected from the start of study 
drug through the Follow-Up Peri od, at every study visit, as spe cified in the Schedule of 
Activities ( Section 1.3 ). 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or design ee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 6 . The Investigator will 
submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of i t being available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek reports of AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if th e investigator learns of any  SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a patient has bee n discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the st udy drug or study participation, th e investigator must promptly notify 
the Sponsor. 
8.5.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
The method of recording, evalu ating, and assessing causality of  AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and t ransmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 6 . 
Care will be taken not to introdu ce bias when detecting AEs and /or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of t he patient is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences. 8.5.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE and/or SAE report, the investigator is req uired to proactively follow each 
patient at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followe d until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or  the patient is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3 ).

The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the patient or 
his/her legally authorized repre sentative and answer all questions regarding the study. 
Patients must be infor med that their partic ipation is voluntary . Patients or their l egally authorized 
representative will be required t o sign a statement of informed  consent that meets the 
requirements of [ADDRESS_564569] (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center. 
The medical record must include a statement that written inform ed consent was obtained before 
the patient was enrolled in the  study and the date  the written consent was obtained. The 
authorized person obtaining the inf ormed consent must also sign  the ICF. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of th e ICF(s) during the ir participation 
in the study. 
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the patient or the pat ient’s legally authorized 
representative. The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples 
for optional exploratory res earch for up to 15 years after the end of the study. The investigator or 
authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives  of the exploratory research. 
Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participa te and may withdraw t heir consent at 
any time and for any reason during t he storage period. A separa te signature [CONTACT_33509] a patient's agreement to allow any remaining specimens  to be used for exploratory 
research. Patients w ho decline to participate in this optional research will not provide this 
separate signature. Written informed consent may be  obtained via telephone with app ropriate documentation of how 
the informed consent form was transmitted to the patient, (such  as via email, fax, or mail) and

At Screening:  
x SARS-CoV-2 testing to assess for active infection (e.g. molecular test such as polymerase 
chain reaction [PCR] or viral a ntigen serology) and past infect ion (Immunoglobulin G 
[IgG] antibody required; Immunogl obulin M [IgM] antibody recommended in addition).  
x Prior to central laboratory testing availability, antibody testing may be omitted if not 
available locally. 
At Week 0, 6, and 12:  
x Testing for past infection via antibody testing (IgG required; IgM recommended in 
addition) if prior IgG was negative.  
x Prior to central laboratory testing availability , testing for a ctive infection (e.g. molecular 
test such as PCR or viral antig en serology) may replace antibod y testing if the latter is not 
available locally. 
x If Week [ADDRESS_564576] for SARS-C oV-2 active infection at

direction of the investigator. If technological changes result in changes to the assays implemented to assess for SARS-CoV-2, 
available central lab assays a nd testing mechanisms may change.  
The testing approach and sche dule may be modified based on the evolving landscape of the 
pandemic or in response to local public health requirements. In  that event, regulatory 
requirements, IRB requirements , and local institutional guideli nes will be followe d, as necessary.

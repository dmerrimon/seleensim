 (646) [ADDRESS_80553] in late and mid- life and contribute to 
increased disability, high health care costs, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicide. Older 
and middle- aged depressed- pain patients: a) are mainly treated in primary care 
practices; and b) are often prescribed medication, w hich increases the risk for addiction 
to opi[INVESTIGATOR_73773]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_73774] -  and desire by [CONTACT_73786] - for primary care behavioral interventions, be havioral interventions are scarce 
in primary care. To address this need, we wor ked with primary care practices of the 
Weill Cornell Medical Associates (WCMA), and developed Relief, a 9- session 
behavioral intervention, designed to be administered by [CONTACT_73787] d social workers 
(LCSWs) and/or nurse practitioners (NP) in primary care practi ces.  
 
Our conceptual model assumes that chronic pain and depression are characterized by 
[CONTACT_73788] -oriented/ reward- driven state 
leading to inadequate engagement of the reward network . Accordingly, Relief  aims to 
change the attent ional bias of depressed- pain patients favoring interoceptive 
experi ences (discomfort, negative feelings), and increase the salience of newly 
devel oped adaptive and rewarding behaviors. Relief also examines patients’ 
expectations of pain treatment (which may be adversely affected by [CONTACT_73789]), and 
uses techniques to reduc e negative emotions associated with pain treatment, modify 
unrealistic expectations and enhance the communication between the patient and 
primary care physician. To facilitate and enhance i ts delivery, Relief uses easy -to 
operate smartphone applications.  
 
This project aims to meet the needs of financially, ethnically and socially di verse older 
and middle- aged primary care patients with chronic pain and depression, who are 
mostly treated in primary care and are at risk of adverse outcomes. Pharmacological 
pain interventions (e.g., antidepressants, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) and physical therapy are in common use, but offer inadequate relief, and increase the risk of abuse. Behavioral interventions for depression and chronic pain are scarce in primary care.  
 Consistent with th e NIMH Objective [ADDRESS_80554] uptake and 
sustainabi lity by [CONTACT_73790] (e.g. Affordable Care Organizations or practices with 
large caseloads of adults with pain and depression who have limited access to 
psychiatrists or pain specialists ) that may employ or engage LCSWs and NPs whose 
services are reimbursable by [CONTACT_73791].

 The goals of the study are:  
 MONTHS 1 -3: 
 
1. Finalize the Relief Manual and establish feasibility of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73775]: We will continue to work with the WCMA to finalize Relief (9 s essions) and train practice 
LCSWs and NPs. We will determine the success rate of training and number of 
hours needed to achieve Relief certification.  
 
2. Develop Relief’s Operations Manual: W e will work with the WCMA’s clinicians 
and managers and create an O perations Manual to guide the integration of Relief 
into the practice, i.e., p rocedures for screening, referral and hand- off to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73776], communication with WCMA physici ans and staff.  
 MONTHS 4 -36: 
 
3. Assess Relief’s reach, feasibility a nd acceptability: We will assess across 
conditions:  
Relief Study Operations Manual  
May 2020

 a. Reach: Number of patients screened, and those who meet inclusion 
criteria;  
b. Feasibility: Number of patients who initiate Relief or UC/ RMH [referral 
(based on clinical indication) for mental health care]  and research 
procedures (tim ely referrals, assessments);  
c. Acceptability: P atient’s treatment satisfaction  at 6, 9, and 12 weeks.  
 
Benchmarks  of the study progress : Feasibility: At least 75 % of Relief 
participants will complete Relief. Acceptability: We will obtain treatment satisfaction score  at the end of Relief treatment.  
 
4. Preliminary Effectiveness: Over the course of 12 weeks, Relief participants, 
compared to participants in UC/ RMH  [referral (based on clinical indication) for 
mental health care] , will have greater (effect size) and cl inically significant 
reductions in depressi on, pain- related disability.  
 
5. Preliminary Evidence of  Target Engagement/Secondary: The differential effect of 
Relief vs. UC/ RMH in reducing depression and pain- related disability will be 
independently mediated by r eduction of interoceptive focus  and positi ve and 
negative emotions.

 PROTOCOL  
1. Study staff  review s the Electronic Health Records (EHR) on Electro nic Privacy 
Information Center (EPIC) and will identify patien ts with diagnoses of chronic 
pain,  a DSM 5 diagnoses of depression and anxiety , as well as patients who are 
on psychotropic and/or pain medications .  
2. Study staff wil l also attend meetings at eac h of the PCP practic es every few 
months to present/review the study and ask  the PCPs to write down the  names  
of any patients th ey think may be appropriate .  
3. Study s taff will then contact [CONTACT_73792] . If they meet 
preliminary eligibilit y criter ia (based on administering the phone screen script) 
and are interested,  they will be in vited to come to our offices in White Pla ins or 
NYC,  or to schedule a video or phone appointment , depending on the 
circumstances.  During the appointm ent, the co nsenting process will take place 
first, and then if the patient consents, the research assistant will conduct the 
scree ning assessment (either in person or remotely) .  
4. RA will then discuss the results of the assessment  with [CONTACT_73802].  
5. If the patient is eligible, the RA will email the data manager  with the patient 
information.  
6. The data manager  will randomize the patient to either Relief or UC/RMH . 
7. The data manager will notify [CONTACT_73802] and the supervising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (not 
administering the intervention)  about the randomization.  
8. The supervising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73777]/ RMH.  
9. The s upervising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73778] g Relief or 
UC/RMH  and will assign a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73779].  
10. Both groups will receive (from the RA or via mail):  
• Educational (TCAP) booklet  
• Withing s Watch with cha rger 
• iPhone 7 with charger (if patient does not have a smart phone or doesn ’t 
want to use their ow n) 
• W2H application downloaded to smartphone

INTERVENTION 
 
Relief: Relief utilizes a stru ctured, yet personalized, approach. The goals of Relief are 
to shift the attention of depressed- pain patients away from pain, discomfort and 
negative feelings, increase involvement in meaningful and pleasurable activities, use 
techniques to reduce negative emotions associated with pain, modify unrealistic 
expectations and enhance communication between the patient and primary care physician. The Relief therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73781]: attention- shift ( e.g 
“distract and refocus” technique, shapi[INVESTIGATOR_73782]), de- escalation 
(e.g.  avoidance of situations that trigger negative emotions, modification of situations, 
changing perspective), reward exposure (through explicit action plans), planning (e.g., step by [CONTACT_73795]/acti on, preparatory steps for a task), and motivational 
techniques (e.g. use of notebooks, calendars)  to achieve its goals (Manual in 
Appendix). Relief also includes techniques to address negative emotions and v iews 
related to the treatment process and to reduce tension between patients and family 
members. Mobile technology is used to augment the Relief intervention.  Finally, at the 
end of treatment Relief therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73783] a personalized summary of  
treatment that highlights the problems that were addressed, and the successful 
techniques that had been used to solve them.  
 
Comparison Condition:  UC/RMH Offered at WCMA: UC/RMH is a strong comparison 
condition because routine care for depression in WCMA  practices is superior to more 
than 80% of primar y care practices. T he practices do not have ongoing, standardized 
fidelity procedures to mental health treatments or guidelines. Our team will not interfere 
with these procedures but record treatment of study participants (percent referred, type 
of treatme nt received, frequency of sessions, attendance, referral to psychiatrist, and 
psychotropic prescriptions). In addition to the regular referral services, we will offer an educational booklet on chronic pain and depression.
 
 
 
  
FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS  
 
Follow up assessments are conducted by [CONTACT_73796] 6, 9, and 12 
weeks after the baseline, and include measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, 
and pain. Subjects will receive $25 (cash, check or gift card)  as co mpensation for 
completing each assessment.

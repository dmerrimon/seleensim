05/19/[ADDRESS_126408] of number of remote limb ischemic conditioning cycles of learning 
enhancement.  
 
Study Objectives  The objective of this research study is to determine if remote limb  ischemic conditioning 
(RLIC) can serve as an agent to enhance  motor and cognitive learning. The immediate goal 
is to test the effect of number of RLIC cycles on  motor learning in neurologi cally intact 
adults. An additional goal is to determine a physiological marker of the effectiveness of 
RLIC through collecting blood samples during various time points throughout the study. The 
long term goal is to determine if RLIC, when compared to sham treatment, augments the 
learning that occurs during a rehabilitation training exercise in people who have motor 
deficits following stroke.  
Background Rationale  It is now understood that the nervous system has remarkable adaptive capacity. 
Specifically, the central nervous system retains its ability to reorganize in structure and function in response to behavioral experience in neurologically intact people and in individuals with neurological injury. Cognitive and motor learning guide the adaptation of the 
central nervous system and are essential components of effective training paradigms.  
 There is a growing body of literature which suggests that inducing a transient state of 
systemic ischemia has the potential to induce spi[INVESTIGATOR_113302], strengthen spared pathways 
to motor neurons, and lead to improved motor recovery following neurological 
injury.
1,2  Specifically, daily system ic ischemic conditioning has been shown to improve both 
forelimb and respi[INVESTIGATOR_113303].1,3 
Moreover, systemic ischemic conditioning resulted in increased ankle strength (single 
session)2 and augmented walking speed and endurance (5 sessions)[ADDRESS_126409] injuries.   
 
In a related area of research, it has been shown that  ischemic conditioning administered 
peripherally  represents a strategy for harnessing the body’s endogenous protective 
capabilities against lethal levels of ischemi a. With this technique, applying brief ischemia 
and reperfusion to a remote organ or tissue results in significantly reduced damage from 
subsequent exposures to ischemia. For example, applying a tourniquet and creating 
hypoxia in a rat’s hind limb for 10 minutes reduced the extent of cardiac abnormalities 
following a sustained ischem ic insult.5 This same phenomenon has been shown in humans. 
Applying an inflated blood pressure cuff to the upper or lower limb has shown efficacy for 
protection in people undergoing cardiac surgeries,6,7 undergoing elective surgery to repair 
abdominal aortic aneurysm,8 experiencing MI,9  and with symptomatic intracranial arterial 
stenosis.7 
 
The mechanisms underlying the neuroplastic  and neuroprotective effects of ischemic 
conditioning are not fully understood. At this time, the literature indicates that there are both humoral and neural mechanisms responsible for the protection and the plasticity. It is clear that ischemic conditioning results in widespread physiological effects and that the observed effects work through multiple mechanistic pathways.  
 
The next translational step is to investigate whether combining ischemic conditioning with 
behavioral training has the ability to augment motor learning. Specifically, we will employ 
remote limb ischemic conditioning (via inflation/deflation of a blood pressure cuff) with the objective of activating the endogenous pathways shown to elicit neuroplasticity. If eventually 
effective, RLIC could have profound effect on the rehabilitation and recovery of motor 
[ADDRESS_126410] adults and if we can find a physiological blood marker related to 
effective administration of RLIC.  We hypothesize that 3 cycles of  RLIC will be sufficient to 
enhance motor leaning compared to sham conditioning, and that there will be a dose -
dependent (number of cycles) response in learning, thus making training more efficient, 
more effective, and longer -lasting.   Determining the number of cycles necessary to elicit the 
benefits of RLIC is important in developi[INVESTIGATOR_113304].

Number of Subjects & 
Power Analysis  Based off of pi[INVESTIGATOR_113305], we need the following total sample sizes 
moving forward (see Table 1 below) to achieve at least 80% power to detect the mean differences of change scores (posttest – pretest) b etween the two treatment groups (RLIC 
vs. sham) based on a two- sample t -test at a significance level of 0.05. The standard 
deviations for change scores are assumed to be 2.[ADDRESS_126411] 3- 4 seconds. Differences less than this (and 
smaller effect sizes) are unlikely to be clinically- relevant in future target populations.

Order of Experiment/  
Study Visits  This study involves 8 total visits . Participants will be in the study for up to 6 weeks.   Please 
refer to Figure 1 for details about study visits.  
 
D1: Subjects will be asked to avoid food, drink (except water), and vigorous exercise beginning midnight the day of their visit.  A trained clinical interviewer will provide informed 
consent and conduct a structured clinical interview. Eligible individuals  will be asked to 
complete descriptive measures . Next, subjects will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
recording while they sit quietly for 7 minutes.  Then, subjects will undergo a blood draw (4 teaspoons).  Next, researchers will gather baseline measurements on all primary and 
secondary outcome measures.  Subjects will then be randomized to their treatment group.  
After randomization, subject s will undergo their assigned dose of  RLIC or sham 
conditioning . After conditioning, subjects will have another 7 -minute resting ECG recording 
and undergo another  blood draw  (4 teaspoons) . This visit will take approximately:  2.5 
hours 
 D2: Subjects will be asked to avoid food, drink (except water), and vigorous exercise beginning midnight the day of their visit.  Subjects will undergo a blood draw (4 teaspoons). 
Then, subjects will undergo  their specified dose of RL IC or sham conditioning. This visit 
will take approximately:  1 hour  
 
D3-6: Subjects will undergo their specified dose of RLIC or sham conditioning.  Next, 
behavioral training will commence  (a balance task, arm task, and computer task) . The order 
of behavioral training task practice will be randomized. These visits will take 
approximately: 2 hours  
 D7: Subjects will be asked to avoid food, drink (except water), and vigorous exercise 
beginning midnight the day of their visit.  Subjects will undergo a blood draw (4 teaspoons). Then, subjects will undergo their specified dose of RL IC or sham conditioning. N ext, 
subjects will complete behavioral training tasks and post- testing. This visit will take 
approximately: 2.5 hours  
 
F/U: Post -test p erformance assessment  on the primary and secondary outcome measures 
will be performed . Participants will not receive RLIC or sham conditioning during the follow -
up visits.  Participants will fill out a survey indicating whether they think that they received 
RLIC  or sham treatment.  This visit will take approximately:  45 minutes  
RLIC Treatment 
Parameters  Remote limb  ischemic conditioning will be achieved via blood pressure cuff inflation to 2 0 
mmH g above systolic blood pressure  on the non -dominant, upper extremity regardless of 
the assigned number of cycles.  Sham conditioning will be achieved via blood pressure cuff 
inflation to 10 mmHg under diastolic blood pressure  on the non- dominant , upper extremity.  
 
5 
 Subjects will be blinded to their group assignment  (RLIC or sham conditioning) . 
Behavioral Training 
Parameters  Three  tasks will be used for behavioral training on D1-D7.  
 
1) Balance  training task (15 minutes; rest breaks as needed)  
2) Arm training task ( 10 minutes; rest breaks as needed)  
3) Computer training task (10 -20 minutes)  
 
The balance task requires subjects to stand on a movable platform (stability platform, model 
16030L, Lafayette Instrument) and to keep the platform in a balanced, horizontal position.[ADDRESS_126412]’s motor abilities.  
 The arm task is a cup stacking task.  Subjects are asked to stack ten cups in three different arrangements, using bilateral upper extremities.  This task should be completed as quickly as possible.  
 
The computer  training task is a  discrete sequence production task. The computer  task 
involves having subjects learn six, [ADDRESS_126413] with their right hand that corresponds to the position of the boxes on the screen.  This particular task was selected because it can 
improve with practice .11 
Descriptive measures  Demographic information, including age, dominant side, gender, ethnicity, ra ce, level of 
physical activity, height, body weight, employment status, education level , co-morbidities , 
and current medications  will be collected on all subjects  on D1 .  
Primary Outcome 
Measures  The primary outcome measures are:  
 
1) Performance on the standing balance motor task 
2) Performance on the arm task  
3) Performance on the computer task  
 
Performance on the standing balance task will be quantified by [CONTACT_113308] a 30- second trial that an individual is able to maintain the platform within ±3° of 
horizontal.  Performance on the arm task will be measured by [CONTACT_113309]-stacking structures. The measure of performance on  the computer  task will be the 
average time to complete each unique sequence in milliseconds.  
 
Please refer to Table 1  for a summary of the assessment schedule.  
Secondary Outcome 
Measure  The secondary outcome measure is:  
 
1) Blood draw : probe for  levels of serum markers of RLIC   
 The blood draw will be performed by [CONTACT_113310]. Blood will be processed the Washing ton University CORE Laboratory.  
Please refer to Table [ADDRESS_126414] factor of time 
(pretest vs. posttest) and a between subjects factor of conditioning ( RLIC vs. sham 
treatment).  
Safety Considerations & 
Monitoring  The study will be submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_113311].  The risks of participating in the rehabilitation 
[ADDRESS_126415] and monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation before, during, 
and after each session of RL IC. Sessions will be terminated if  heart rate <40 bpm or 
>160bpm, systolic BP <85mm Hg or >160mmHg,  or if O
2 saturation <75%.  Moreover, 
during the follow up session , all subjects will be asked to fill out a questionnaire related to 
the presence of adverse effects that resulted from participation in this study.

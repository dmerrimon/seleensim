system is indicated for spi[INVESTIGATOR_54185] (SCS) as a n aid in the management  of chronic, 
intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs -including unilateral or bilateral pain  associated with 
conditions , including  Degenerative Disk Disease (DDD)/herniated disk pain refractory to 
surgical and conservative interventions.  It is designed to deliver electrical stimulation to the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_397529] ( also called  leads) placed  in the dorsal epi[INVESTIGATOR_708637].  
The study will use commercially available IntellisTM neurostimulator  and compatible SCS 
system components  from Medtronic in accordance to the approved FDA indication s and 
labeling . Section D of this Investigational Plan provides detailed description o f IntellisTM 
neurostimulator.  
 
A.2.  Purpose of the Investigation  
The purpose of this  post-market  study is to evaluate the effects  of Differential Target Multiplex 
SCS (DTM ™SCS) programs  in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk with or 
without lower limb pain associated with the following  conditions : Degenerative Disk Disease 
(DDD) /herniated disk  refractory to conservative and not a candidate for surgical  interventions , 
in the abscense of previous back surgery . Differential Target Multiplexed SCS (DTM -SCS) 
programming approach relies on stimulation parameters that will be set to levels that span 
above the perception threshold, yet well below the levels that  could cause uncomfortable 
paresthesia .  This study is a post market, open -label, multi -center, prospective , randomized , 
controlled  clinical trial that evaluates the treatment  outcomes resulting from  DTM -SCS 
programming  approach  and Conventional SCS  programming approach . Both programming 
approaches will be discussed in section B.[ADDRESS_963241] Stimulation systems and their 
compatible device components.  Both DTM -SCS and Conventional SCS  programs  will utilize 
an FDA -approved and commercially available SCS system (IntellisTM neurostimulator and 
compatible SCS components ) as is, without any modification using approved parameters under 
approved labeling for indicated population. Outcomes will be assessed via standardized tests.  
 
A.3.  Study Size  
Up to  250 subjects may be enrolled  at up to 20 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002] in order to 
include an estimated 1 35 subjects  to the point of randomization and trial phase .  This would 
allow a minimum of 100 subjects (50% in each treatment arm) to complete the [ADDRESS_963242] received the permanent implant will be 
followed up for approximately 14 months. This consists  of Baseline assessments, up to 1 0 days 
of trial stimulat ion, and 12 months of treatment  following implantation and activation of the 
device .  
 
B.  Proto col 
B.1.  Rationale for Study  
It is estimated that about 20% percent of the population worldwide is affected by [CONTACT_708665]1. Chronic pain becomes a burden to the individual as this affects a person’s 
ability to carry out many daily life activities, such as exercising, walking, driving a car, 
attending social events, or performing household chores.  In the [LOCATION_002], chronic pain is 
considered one of the most pervasive and intractable conditions affecting at least one third of 
the population at an estimated cost of five hundred billion dollars per year, when combining 
health -related expenditure and the cost -impact on loss of productivity and income2.  
Conventional  medical management, including medication and physical therapy , is often not 
adequate for treating chronic pain. Medication therapy based on opi[INVESTIGATOR_708638]. Extensive use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_708639]3. When these treatments fail to pr ovide pain relief, imaging is performed 
to assess candidacy for back surgery4. However, surgery is only indicated for those patients 
with mechanical instability or pi[INVESTIGATOR_708640]5.  For the many patients for whom imaging does 
not clearly show a cause of chronic back pain, or for the patients that have confounding medical 
issues precluding an invasive surgical procedure, there are few alternative treatment options6. 
Furthermore, s urgical interventions have also fail ed to remediate severe cases of neuropat hies 
and intractable back pain  for many patients . Yoshihara et al. evaluated  the surgical trends for 
lumbar degenerative disc disease in the US from 2000 to [ZIP_CODE]. They reported a 2.4 -fold 
population -adjusted increase. Bae et al. repo rted an increase in the number of lumbar surgical 
fusion for spi[INVESTIGATOR_708641] 21.5% to 31.2%  between 2004 and [ZIP_CODE]. Reoperation rate for 
disc herniation and spi[INVESTIGATOR_708642] 10 to 23%9. Overall, 40% of patients 
develop ed post-laminectomy  syndrome or fail ed back surgery syndrome, requiring further 
treatment , with an estimated incidence of 80,[ADDRESS_963243] stimulation 
(SCS) is a proven therapy that ha s been in use for a bout 50 years for various types of chronic  
pain. SCS  is a reversible therapy that allows patients to evaluate the therapy for several days 
using an external neurostimulator  (ENS) prior to receiving an implantable neuro stimulator  
(INS) system11,12,13,14. Taylor et al, showed the cost effectiveness of SCS versus surgery and 
other interventions at $7,[ADDRESS_963244] Stimulation (SCS) utilizes pulsed electric field s that are applied to the dorsal 
section of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_397530], called leads, implanted in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].   
Conventional  SCS programming approach utilizes pulsed electric field s oscillating in the 40 -
250 Hz frequency range. The electric field creates a stimulation pattern  (paresthesia) that 
overlay s with the targeted pain location. The concept behind Conventional SCS  is that the 
stimulation pattern  masks pain signals travelling to the brain.  Conventional SCS programming 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963245]. Each program group contains multiple programs that 
deliver, for a given pulse rate, different stimulation parameters (e.g. pulse width, amplitude) to 
same o r different electrodes. This approach has been used to create better stimulation patterns 
for the given patient’s pain locations or more tolerable stimulation depending on patient’s 
different positions or postures.  
Historically, Conventional SCS  has not h ad high success for back pain patients  due to the 
challenge of having the stimulation pattern overlap the back -pain region without causing 
uncomfortable paresthesia. Although different approaches to SCS exist, Conventional SCS still 
remains the most used S CS programming approach in treating chronic back and leg pain.  
DTM -SCS programming approach relies on stimulation parameters that will be set to levels 
that span above the perception threshold, yet well below the levels that could cause 
uncomfortable pare sthesia , which may result in greater pain relief .  This can be done with  
programming parameters that are currently available on the device.  
In a given program group, DTM -SCS will provide programs with different pulse rates and 
pulse widths for the goal of better pain relief .  For example, starting parameters may be a 
combination of a program with [ADDRESS_963246] -market, open -label, prospective, randomized controlled s tudy 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluating the DTM -SCS programming approach versus the Conventional 
one. The study includes more than 100 subjects randomized in 12 sites in the U.S . At the 3 -
month primary endpoint, the responder rate (percentage of subjects with ≥50% p ain relief) for 
DTM -SCS programming was 80% vs 51% for the active control arm. Thus, the study met the 
primary objective for non -inferiority. A secondary objective of superiority of DTM -SCS was 
also met for the primary outcome. In addition, the mean percen t of back pain relief relative to 
baseline at the 3 -months follow up for DTM -SCS was 74% vs. 46% for conventional 
programming.   
Thus, the ongoing study has shown that DTM -SCS is more effective than conventional SCS at 
the 3 -month primary endpoint of the s tudy.  Results also show that DTM -SCS shows  a risk 
profile in line with that widely documented for conventional SCS.   
Therefore, DTM -SCS offers an alternative approach that  might  help thousands of chronic pain 
sufferers make substantial improvement in pain relief, reduction in disabilities, and reduce the 
likelihood of uncomfortable paresthesia.  
A multicenter  feasibility study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  has also been completed  in which DTM -SCS 
programming approach was evaluated during the required period for trialing SCS therapy. In 
this acute study 20 subjects completed a trial  with DTM -SCS and Conventional  SCS 
programming approaches .  In terms of back pain relief,  DTM -SCS programming approach  
provided a mean of 68% pain relief  and Conventional SCS programming approach provided a 
mean of 43% pain relief, which translates to DTM -SCS achieving 25% greater reduction than 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 46 Conventional SCS.  Notably with DTM -SCS,  80% of subjects experienc ed 50% or b etter back 
pain relief , and 85% of the subjects preferred therapy received through DTM -SCS 
programming approach.  The safety results were in line with expectations of previous SCS 
studies and were mostly resolved within a few days with minimal intervention s.  There was 
one serious adverse event, epi[INVESTIGATOR_115909], which although uncommon, is well established as 
a potential risk in SCS trial and was not related to either programming approach. There were 
no unanticipated adverse events.  
The study i s a post mar ket, open -label,  prospective, randomized, controlled multi -center study  
that will evaluate  DTM -SCS programming  and Conventional  SCS programming  for chronic 
back with or without leg pain sufferers  without previous back surgery .  There is an optional 
two-way crossover to the other treatment group available for all subjects who remain implanted 
at  the 6 month visit.  This scientifically sound study will  provide more information on the 
effectiveness of DTM -SCS programming approach.  
 
B.2.  Study Objectives  
The primary  objective  of this study is to evaluate  the effectiveness of DTM -SCS in reducing 
back pain as compared to  Conventional  SCS for the treatment of intractable chronic back pain 
in subjects without prior history of spi[INVESTIGATOR_708643]. 
The secondary objectives  of this study are to further  demonstrat e the effectiveness  of the DTM -
SCS when compared  to Conventional  SCS for the treatment of chronic pain  of the trunk and 
limbs .  This study will also include the characterization of the safety of DTM -SCS.

DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 46 B.4.  Treatment Groups  
Subjects meeting the study entrance  criteria will be  randomized to one of two study treatment 
groups in a 1:1 ratio:  
• Control Treatment Group:  Conventional  SCS programming approach   
o Stimulation parameters  in the [ADDRESS_963250] practice as described in the  IntellisTM labeling/manuals  
▪ If frequency parameter above [ADDRESS_963251] will be counted as failure towards Coventional SCS 
programming approach  but will continue to permanent implant.  
• Test Treatment Group: DTM -SCS programming  approach  
o As with Conventional SCS programming , stimulation parameters will be trialed 
according to standard practice as described in the  IntellisTM labeling/manuals . 
Subjects will be given multiple program groups to try. Each DTM -SCS program  
group will ha ve multiple parameters.  The s timulation parameters will be within 
the specifications described in the  IntellisTM labeling/manuals .  Each  DTM -SCS 
program group  has at least two programs with  different pulse rate  in the [ADDRESS_963252] been designed  to minimize 
potential sources of bias.  Each Investigator’s qualification  for meeting the requirements 
of this  investigational plan will be reviewed prior to their participation in this investigation.  
Randomization of subjects  to one of the two treatment groups  will occur  after the subject 
complet es Baseline assessments in order to  minimize selection bias.  
Each therapy, DTM -SCS programs  and Conventional  SCS programs , will be programmed 
by [CONTACT_708667], and in accordance with 
their Conventional  therapy al gorithms for optimal pain relief. This will minimize bias 
related to potential preference by a given clinical representative to a particular SCS therapy.   
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963253] SCS studies indicate that there is no reason to believe that subjects and 
Investigators/clinical staff will be influenced one way or another b y the knowledge that a 
particular SCS program  has been used.  Best efforts will be made to limit bias by [CONTACT_708668], clinical site personnel, and all clinical representatives on the relevant areas 
of the  study protocol to limit their influence.  
 
B.5.5 .  Sample Size  
Primary Endpoint  Assessment occurs at the follow up visit 3 months after Device 
Activation .  Based on the primary endpoint  requirement , the estimated sample size of this 
study is 100 total sub jects (a pproximately  50 subjects  in the DTM -SCS group  and 
approximately  50 subjects in Conventional  SCS group ) who have passed screening 
requirements , have been  randomiz ed, and have completed the primary endpoint 
assessment .  Randomization of approximately [ADDRESS_963254] group to the control group  at 3 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 46 months .  Established methods were foll owed in determining the non -inferiority criteria 
and the related sample size estimate  
• Test basis:  Farrington -Manning binomial test for non -inferiority  
• Estimated responder rat e of 70% in the test group and 5 0% in the control 
group  
• Significance level, alpha, of 0.05 one -sided  
• Statistical power = approximately 9 0% or greater  
• Non-inferiority margin of 1 0% 
• Randomization:  1:1  
Based on these assumptions, a minimum of 50 randomized and trialed subjects per 
treatment group (100 total) are required . 
 
B.5.5. 2 Overall Sample Size  and Enrollment  
Based on the primary endpoint  requirement, a minimum of 50 subjects per treatment 
group are required ( 100 total). To account for a combined estimated attrition of 25% 
for subjects that do not complete the Trial Phase , and subjects that exit study before 
the 3-month primary endpoint  visit, approximately  135 subjects would need to  be 
randomized  and trialed.     
To account for 46% attrition prior to randomization (including subject  ineligibility 
after signing the informed consent and subject  dropout ), it is estimated that a total of 
up to [ADDRESS_963255] 18 months. Subjects who are expected to complete the study will commit to it for 
approximately 14 months. This consists  of Baseline assessments, up to 1 0 days of trial 
stimulat ion, and 12 months of treatment following implant ation and activation of the 
device .  
 
B.5.7.  Interim Administrative Analys es  
 
For the purposes of business decisions and planning purposes  (e.g., to provide an update to  
third -party investor s), administrative analys es may be performed.  The results of th e 
analys es will not be widely distributed,  and access will be limited to those persons with a 
“need to know”.  Access will be restricted from those involved directly with the study 
conduct or management to prevent the introduction of bias.  Th e administrative analysis 
will not be used to modify the trial or stop early for potential benefit. As there is no chance 
of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the type I error rate is not affected. Limiting changes to the protocol and 
access to the interim administrative an alysis also prevents operational bias due to 
knowledge of interim results.  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963256] ( IRB) 
approvals, and when written informed consent from subjects ha s been obtained.  Prior to 
enrollment, Investigators and clinical site staff will approach s ubjects , who have been 
determined to be candidates for SCS therapy  and talk about potential participat ion in the study.  
Following informed consent, the eligibility of subjects to participate in the study will be 
assessed according to  inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in this Investigational P lan.  
Various assessments including pain intensity , evaluation of medical history  and records , and 
the Investigator’s clinical judgment  will be used in the selection process .  
 
B.6.1.  Summary of Study Protocol  
Potential s tudy subj ects will be identified from a  pool of candidates for SCS therapy  that 
are either  affiliated with or referred to  the clinical sites.  Notice of availability  of the study 
may be used for recruitment purposes, upon approval of the patient recruitment materials 
by [CONTACT_397563](s). An informed consent form (ICF) will be given to the potential subject 
for private evaluation. The Investigator or Study Clinical Staff will be available to respond 
to any questions the potential subject may have during evaluation of the ICF. Potential 
study  subject s willing to participate  in the study will visit the study site for providing 
written consent and for evaluation of eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
Subjects may also be consented via a combination of mail and telephone calls . The RC will 
document the telephone calls and follow -up by [CONTACT_708669]. The RC will then provide a photo copy to the subject. Once a consented 
subject is deemed qualified  to participate in the study , baseline assessments and 
randomization  will occur followed by [CONTACT_708670] .  Subjects who complete a successful SCS trial phase will be 
scheduled to recei ve a permanent implant of leads and the implanted neurostimulator ( INS) 
and will undergo 12 months of stimulation delivery with assessments at 1, 3,  6, 9, and 12  
months after the activation of the therapy . 
All subjects who remain implanted at or after the 6 month visit , but are not getting sufficient 
pain relief and would like to try the other  treatment arm’s parameters will have the option 
to cross over to the  other treatment group  (this is an optional two-way crossover).  X-ray 
may be required to determine lead locations.  Crossover must be completed within 30 days 
of the 6 month visit.  
Baseline assessments will include measures for pain  intensity , use of medication, exten t of 
disability , and quality of life. 
Following completion of the baseline assessment , study subje cts will be  randomized in a 
1:[ADDRESS_963257]’s  response to assigned treatment group . Temporary or permanent leads and an 
external neurostimulator (ENS) will be used during the Trial Phase . Subjects will evaluate 
the assigned treatment group  based on pain intensity under optimal parameters.  Those who 
have a "successful Trial Phase" (defined as a 40% or greater pain reduction from Baseline 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 46 in their back  pain) will proceed to permanent implantation of a SCS system  to evaluate the 
assigned treatment group . 
The implanted neurostimulator ( INS) will be activated within  14 days after surgical 
procedure and SCS therapy will be delivered for the next 12 months.  Activation of the 
device marks the initial time point for effectiveness evaluation of the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_708646] . Assessments of pain intensity , use of medication  and adverse events will be 
made at 1 month following Device Activation.  At 3 , 6, 9, and 12  months after Device 
Activation, subjects will be assessed for pain intensity, adverse  events , extent of disability , 
use of medication, and quality of life  (EuroQol EQ -5D-5L). Patient Global Impression of 
Change, and subject satisfaction will also be recorded at [ADDRESS_963258] the option to cros sover to the other arm after completing the 6 
months visit  (up to 30 days after completing the 6 month visit) .

DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 46 B.6.2.  Consent/Enrollment  
Medical records of all subjects deemed by [CONTACT_397564] -identified and sent to a sponsor designated physician for pre -screening. 
De-identified m edical records should  include detailed  medical and surgical history of the 
pain condition under study as well any information about comorbidities. Any imaging 
studies (such as MRI, CT, X -ray) should  be included for evaluation of the study candidate.   
Once the site has received confirmation tha t subject may be an appropriate candidate for 
this study, the site may proceed with the eligibility  process. This de -identified pre -
screening process assists in reducing unnecessary visits for subjects that would not be 
eligible  for this study.    
Written i nformed  consent  for participation in the study must be obtained from subjects 
before  initiation of any study -related activities .  Following  informed consent, subjects will 
be assigned a unique subject identification number and will be considered to be enrolled in 
the study .  Eligibility  for advanc ing to the next stage of the study will be evaluated by [CONTACT_708671] . Subjects will be assessed 
for pain intensity and disability.  
 
B.6.3.  Entry Criteria Evaluation  
The eligibility of s ubjects who have consented participation will be assessed based on  the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Study subjects must meet all of the study inclusion criteria 
and none of the study exclusion crit eria to be eligible.  Assessments for eligibility include 
average pain intensity  (which will  be used as Baseline pain intensity ), medication usage, 
medical records  and history , and the Investigator’s clinical judgment.  Subjects with  
confirmed eligibility  will proceed to Baseline assessment, while  subjects who do not will 
be discontinued from the study.   
 
B.6.4.  Baseline  
Before a subject is  randomized , a subject will be reque sted to fill out standard 
questionnaires t hat will  assess extent of disability , use of medications, and quality of life .  
The medical and surgical history of the subject will be collected. At this visit and  
subsequent visits, the subject will be assessed for adverse events, medication usage and be 
reminded to not increase pain medications from baseline through the [ADDRESS_963259] of care for SCS therapy and b e 
determined by [CONTACT_9257].  
 
B.6.5.  Randomization  
Subsequent to  completing Baseline assessments, qualifying subjects will be randomly 
assigned to either one of the two study treatment groups: DTM -SCS programming  or 
Conventional  SCS programming  (active comparator ).  Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_708672]. Randomization will 
be done at each study site by [CONTACT_638847] . 
 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963260]’s pain condition 
and pain pattern as described in the Physician Implant Manual.  Stimulation will be 
delivered from an external neurostimulator (ENS).   
Anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral X -ray imaging will be done following lead implantation 
at the beginning of the Trial Phase . The subject should flex forward prior to the final AP 
and lateral X -ray imaging.  Imaging may also be done  when  lead migration is suspected.  
Stimulation therapy will be as follows for each study arm:  
• For Conventional  SCS: s timulation parameters  in the [ADDRESS_963261] practice as described in the  IntellisTM 
labeling/manuals  
• For DTM -SCS: As with Conventional SCS  programming  stimulation parameters 
will be trialed according to sta ndard practice as described in the  IntellisTM 
labeling/manuals . Subjects will be given multiple program groups to try. E ach 
DTM -SCS program  group will have multiple parameters .  The s timulation 
parameters will be within the s pecifications described in the  IntellisTM 
labeling/manuals .  Each DTM -SCS program  group  has at least two programs with 
different pulse rate  in the [ADDRESS_963262]’s 
self-reported pain relief.  Adjustments to therapy wi ll be attempted until at least 5 0% self -
reported back pain reduction from baseline is achieved or until conclusion of the trial phase 
(no more than 10 days). Subject s will be assessed for adverse ev ents and medication usage .  
 
B.6.7.  End of Trial  Assessment  
At the end of the Trial Phase , subjects will be assessed for pain intensity under optimal 
therapy  parameters . Anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral X -ray imaging may  be done at the 
end of the Trial Phase.  The subject will be assessed for adverse events  and medication 
usage.  
Those who have a "successful Trial Phase" (defined as a 40% or greater pain reduction 
from B aseline in their back  pain) will proceed to permanent implantation of a SCS system  
to evaluate the assigned therapy, and permanent implantation  of the IntellisTM SCS system 
will be scheduled. A threshold of 40% for the Trial Phase was predetermined as the 
minimum pain reduction that warrants consideration of a permanent implant and an 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 46 opportunity to achieve a 50% pain reduction  as defined in the Individual Subject Success 
criterion (see Section B.7.3). )  
Data from subjects who did not a chieve 4 0% or greater pain reduction in  back  and do not 
receive permanent implantation will be carried forward toward the primary and secondary 
endpoint s. These subjects will exit the study  after being followed up for two weeks after 
explant of the leads t o assess adverse events.  
 
B.6.8.  Permanent Device Implant (0 -60 days from end of successful Trial Phase)  
As described in section B.6.7, subjects who underwent a successful trial of the assigned 
SCS therapy and who agreed to continue into the next stage of  the study will proceed to 
permanent implantation stage.   
Permanent percutaneous leads will be placed in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397531] a vertebral level based 
on the subject’s pain condition and pain pattern as described in the IntellisTM Physician 
Implant Manual. The INS will be i mplanted by a trained physician  according  to standard 
practice and following the Physician Implant Manual for the device.  Anterior -posterior 
(AP) and lateral X -ray imaging will be obtained .  Standard practice of a study site for 
prophylactic pre -surgery antibiotics and post -surgery pain medicati ons will be followed ). 
Subjects will be assessed for adverse events  and medication usage .  
 
B.6.9.  Device Activation ( 0-14 days following Permanent Implant)  
Clinical site personnel  will assess if healing of surgical wounds is sufficiently appropriate 
to start charging and programming of the INS. The INS will be initially programmed  to the 
group therapy or set of stimulation parameters that provided adequate pain relief  during the 
Trial Phase . Adjustments to therapy may be made based on patie nt response to a program 
group  or set of stimulation parameters . The subject will be provided with instructions on 
how to operate the charger and patient remote control at this visit .  Subjects will be assessed 
for adverse events  and medication usage .  
 
B.6.10.  Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study for the assessme nt of possible 
adverse events, changes  in pain medication,  and programming adjustments.  Each 
unscheduled visit will be documented and recorded on a n eCRF . 
 
B.6.11.  Telephone Calls  
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_426] t he study coordinator , via a telephone call, before  each study 
visit. Th e study coordinator will  check on the well -being of the subject, remind the subject 
of the  upcoming scheduled visit, remind the subject  not to change pain medication usage 
at least two weeks prior to the scheduled visit , remind the subject not to start any new 
strenuous activity prior to the visit, and remind the subject  to contact [CONTACT_737]/study 
staff should he/she have any concerns or questions. The telephone calls should be made 
two to three weeks  before  the scheduled visit.  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 46 B.6.12.  1 Month After  Device Activation (± 15 days)  
Subjects will visit the study site where they will be assessed for pain  intensity .  
Programming adjustments may be made, as needed. Anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral X -
ray imaging may be done if significant lead migration is suspected. Subjects will be 
assessed for adverse events  and medication usage .  
 
B.6.13.  3 Months After  Device Activation (± 21 days)

generated by [CONTACT_397565]. Programming adjustments may be made, as 
needed.   Anterior -posterior (AP) and lateral X -ray imaging may be done if significant lead 
migration is suspe cted. Subjects will also be assessed for possible adverse events  and 
medication usage.   
After the [ADDRESS_963263] is not receiving sufficient pain relief a nd desires to 
try the the other arm’s parameters.   The subject can crossover immediately after completing 
the [ADDRESS_963264] would be continued to be followed by [CONTACT_708673] a non -study, 
commercial patient.  
 
B.6.15.  9  Months After  Device Activation (± 31 days)  
Subjects will visit the study site where they will be assessed for pain, extent of disability , 
quality of life, Patient Global Impression of Change, and subject satisfaction .  Paresthesia 
generated by [CONTACT_397565]. Programming adjustments may be made, as 
needed.  Subjects will also be assessed for possible adverse events  and medication usage.  
 
B.6.1 6. 12 Months  After Device Activation (± 45 days)  
The follow -up visit [ADDRESS_963265]’s 
condition is stable, at which point the Study Completion Clinical Research Form (eCRF)  
should be completed.  
Beyond the [ADDRESS_963266] of care at each site, in order to 
facilitate pai n management, stimulation adjustments, possible revisions and/or 
replacements of neurostimulation  components . Any additional  non-study related  
monitoring of the subject will be the responsibility of the subject’s personal physician, as 
dictated by [CONTACT_708674].  
 
  
B.6.[ADDRESS_963267] additional 
AP and lateral X -rays taken to confirm the new lead position in order to  aid the Investigator 
in determining a course of action.  
Paresthesia  testing may also be performed to assess lead location and therapy coverage of 
pain areas. Programming adjustments may be made based on pa tient feedback following 
assessment . 
Additional information on Medication Usage:  
• The investigator will instruct all subjects  to take the Baseline doses of pain 
medication until the 3-Month  Visit.   Howev er, after Device Activation Visit, the 
Investigator  may reduce the dose of pain medication if the subject is benefitting 
greatly  from SCS and not benefitting from Baseline dose pain medication.  
o Subjects should not fluctuate medication usage nor dosages eve n if the dose 
is at or below Baseline doses. The research coordinator or investigator 
should  instruct all s ubjects to maintain stable dosing of medication for  at 
least two weeks prio r to scheduled follow -up visits.  
• Acetaminophen, NSAIDs or other pain medications (new prescriptions or greater 
than Baseline doses) may only be taken for an acute condition and for a limited 
duration. For each type of pain medication, dosing should not exceed the maximum 
daily dosage recommended by [CONTACT_708675] e should not continue 
beyond 5 days. Should acute pain medication usage coincide with a follow -up visit, 
the visit will be postponed until two weeks after acute pain medication usage has 
been stopped.  
• Following trial and permanent implants, the clinical si te’s standard practice for 
prophylactic pre -surgery antibiotics and post -surgery pain medications will be 
followed. Investigators will instruct subjects not to change usage of any other 
concomitant pain medications.  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963268]  follow the appropriate guidelines set forth b y the Medtronic for 
returning  the explanted device  and/or lead(s) as well as the accessories (charger, patient 
remote control) . 
 
B.6.[ADDRESS_963269] Withdrawal  
Although efforts will be made by [CONTACT_708676], s ubjects may withdraw  early from the study for a number of 
reasons, including but not limited to:  
• Failure of SCS Trial Phase  
• Subject request  
• Investigator request  
• Subject lost to follow -up 
• Subject ’s death 
• Adverse events (e.g., intolerable adverse event occurrence that forces subject to 
stop participation in the study)  
If a subject is considering withdrawing from the study due to unsatisfactory effectiveness 
of the assigned treatm ent, the Investigator wi ll mak e attempts to improve therapy during a 
study visit. When a subject is withdrawn  early from the study, a Study Termination eCRF 
will be completed describing the reason for discontinuation.  Study staff will contact 
[CONTACT_708677] a 
subject that is not responding to a contact [INVESTIGATOR_1306]. In situations where study withdrawal is due 
to an adverse event, subjects will be follow ed until resolution of the adverse event or 
determination that the adverse event is not likely to change . 
 
B.6.20.  Study Completion  
All subjects enrolled in the study are expected to complete all scheduled visits through the 
follow up visit [ADDRESS_963270] been issued  and reported to the IRB . 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 46 SGX , the Investigators, or th e IRB (s) may suspend or terminate the study early at any time.  
If the study is suspended or terminated prematurely, all subjects that are still enrolled will 
be terminated  from the study . A Study Completion eCRF will be completed  noting that the 
study has  been terminated .  If there is an ongoing adverse event related to the device or 
treatment , the subject will be followed until resolution of the adverse event or 
determination that the adverse event is not likely to change .  
Subsequent follow -up of the subjects after study completion will be  the responsibility of 
the subject’s personal physician.   
SGX  reserves the right to terminate the study but  intends only to exercise this right for 
reasons related to the protection of subjects or valid sc ientific or  business reasons .  SGX 
will notify Investigators and IRBs in writing in the event of study termination.   
SGX  reserves the right to stop the enrollment of subjects at a ny clinical site at any time 
after the clinical site initiation . Possible reasons for s uspending or terminating a clinical 
site may include, but are not limited to:  
• Non-compliance by [CONTACT_10670]  
• Failure to obtain proper written informed consent  
• Repeated failure to complete or submit eCRFs in a timely manner  
• Failure to report SAEs to the Sp onsor within 48 hours of knowledge  of the event  
and to reviewing IRB in accordance with its policies  
• Repeated failure to comply with clearance of queries generated during monitoring 
of the study  
• Inactivity  
 
B.7.  Study Endpoints  
 
B.7.1.  Definition of Analysis Populations  
• Modified Intent to Treat ( mITT): All successfully randomized subjects who 
complete the Trial Phase . 
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT):  All successfully randomized subjects who met all the 
enrollment criteria.  
• Per-Protocol (PP):  All s ubjects who received a permanent device implant and 
contributed their data to the 3-month  endpoint without any major protocol 
deviations  or adverse events (that would render their data unevaluable ).  
The primary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed  on 
the mITT population. Supportive analyses will be performed for the  Intent -to-Treat 
and Per-Protocol population .  
For analyses incorporating crossover data (i.e. data gathered in the post 6 -month 
periods), analyses will be based on the mITT population with treatment group 
defined by [CONTACT_708678].  Additional sensitivity analyses censoring data post -crosso ver will be 
performed to examine the impact of crossover.  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 46 B.7.2.  Effectiveness  Assessment  Definitions  
• Primary Effectiveness  Assessment:  For subjects who have a successful Trial Phase 
and receive a permanent implant, the Primary Efficacy Assessment occurs  at the 
follow up visit [ADDRESS_963271] a 
successful Trial Phase  (based on subject’s pain score)  or subjects who do not want 
a permanent device implant due to insufficient pain relief  (based on subject’s 
discontinuation reason) , the Primary Efficacy Assessment occurs at the end of the 
Trial Phase .  
 
B.7.3.  Primary Endpoint  
Pain rating on the [ADDRESS_963272] widely used outcome measure in assessing pain due to its 
documented reliability and validity, ease in administration, and minimal training 
requirements for the administrator.  
• Individual Responder :  A decrease in back pain VAS by [CONTACT_2669] 50% 
at [ADDRESS_963273]:  
o If a subject is switched to a programming parameter that is not 
considered to be DTM -SCS nor Conventional SCS 
programming for a period over two weeks  
o If a subject is switched to a programming parameter that is not 
considered to be DTM -SCS nor Conventional SCS 
programming for any length of time within the 2 weeks  prior to 
a follow -up visit.  
Overall Study Success :  The percentage of Individual Responders in the test 
group is shown to be statistically non -inferior  to the percentage in the control 
group.  
 
B.7.4.  Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated :  
• Comparison of the  percentage of Individual Responders  between the test and 
control groups in a statistical test of superiority  over time (i.e. based on repeated 
measures analysis). In addition, data will be summarized at the individual time 
points at [ADDRESS_963274] -crossover.  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 46 • Comparison of c hange from Baseline in back pain score (VAS)  between 
test and control in statistical test s of non -inferiority  and superiority .  This 
is calculated as: Change from B aseline in Back Pain VAS = Follow -up 
Visit Pain VAS – Baseline Pain VAS. A negative result reflects a decrease 
in the Pain VAS, while a positive result reflects an increase  in Pain VAS . 
All subjects must be using the assigned programming parameters.  If a 
subject is switched to a programming parameter that is not considered to 
be DTM -SCS nor Conventional SCS programming, that subject’s Baseline 
Back Pain VAS will used instead of Follow -up Visit VAS  after the 
programming change has occurred  for the following  follow -up visit if one 
of the two following conditions exist:  
o If a subject is switched to a programming parameter that is not 
considered to be DTM -SCS nor Conventional SCS 
programming for a period over two weeks  
o If a subject is switched to a programming p arameter that is not 
considered to be DTM -SCS nor Conventional SCS 
programming for any length of time within the [ADDRESS_963275] correlation. Treatment group status for the repeated 
measures models will be based on treatment status at the current time point (i.e. it will 
be based on treatment status incorporating potential crossover, not necessarily the 
original randomize d assignment).  
 
B.7.5.  Additional Data Collection   
These following data will be collected : 
• Frequency of treatment emergent adverse events  
• Comparison of o pi[INVESTIGATOR_708647] 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after 
device activation between the two arms  
• Comparison of mean c hange from Baseline in Leg Pain VAS, evaluated at 3 , 6, 9 
and 12  months after device activation for subjects with baseline leg pain VAS score 
≥ [ADDRESS_963276] and control  
• Comparison of Leg Pain Treatment Success, measured as at least a 50% reduction 
in Leg Pain VAS, evaluated at 3 , 6, 9, and 12  months after device activation for 
subjects with baseline leg pain VAS score ≥ [ADDRESS_963277] and control  
• Comparison of patient sat isfaction between two arms  
• Patient Global Impre ssion of Change, evaluated at 3 , 6, 9 and 12  months after 
device activation  
• Comparison of Patient Global I mpression of Change between two arms  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 46 • Comparison of ODI change from baseline at 3, 6, 9 and 12  months after device 
activation between the two arms  
• Comparison of  quality of life ( QoL) change (from EuroQol EQ -5D-5L) from 
baseline at 3 , 6, 9 and 12  months after device activation between the two arms  
• Quality  of paresthesia at [ADDRESS_963278] and control   
• Percentage of subjects that crossover  
• Comparison of mean change from last visit prior to crossover to [ADDRESS_963279] -crossover.  
• Activity level based on IntellisTM adaptive data log  (when available)  
• Analysis of additional evaluable data items will be based on treatment status at the 
current time point (i.e. it will be based on treatment status incorporating potential 
crossover, not necessarily the original randomize d assignment).  
 
B.8.  Evaluation Criteria  
 
B.8.1.  Effectiveness  
Results of the tests and standard questionnaires will be recorded in Case Report Forms at 
Baseline and during follow -up visits.  Changes from Baseline will be calculated and 
compared between the two groups.   
Effectiveness will be measured for each subject using the following tests:  
• Pain 
– Visual Analog  Scale  (VAS , 10 cm ) at Baseline, End of Trial Phase , Months 1, 
3, 6, 9 and 12   
• Disability  
– Oswestry Disability Index Questionnaire  
• Quality of Life  
– EuroQol EQ -5D-5L 
• Impression of Change in Quality of Life  
– Patient Global Impression of Change  
• Satisfaction with Therapy  
– Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire  
 
Study personnel will be appropriately trained for administration of each test.   
 
B.8.2.  Definition of Success  
 
The subject’s self -reported p ain intensity score based  on the 10 cm  Visual Analog  Scale  
(VAS)  is considered the outcome measure  for the efficacy component of the primary 
endpoint . VAS  is a widely used outcome measure in assessing pain . It is a reliable and valid 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963280] or study -level success criteria for secondary 
and tertiary endpoints.  
 
B.8.3.  Safety  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_708679] . 
 
B.8.3.1 Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject associated 
with the use of the therapy under the study  whether or not related to IntellisTM SCS 
system  or the study procedures. An AE is also any event related to any underlying 
medical condition, present at baseline, which increases in severity  or frequency  by a 
clinically meaningful amount during the study as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
For all adverse even ts, the Investigator will provide an assessment of the relationship 
to the study.  If the adverse event is study -related, the following parameters will be 
assessed: its seriousness , severity, treatment/intervention provided, and resolution.  
As the efficacy  measure s in this study are back  and leg  pain, back  and leg  pain do not 
need to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious 
adverse event. Investigators may, however , report any other pain-related adverse 
events during the s tudy.   
Pre-existing conditions will not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been 
a substantial increase in the severity or frequency of the problem , which has not been 
attributed to its natural history.  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is an adverse event that  
• Leads to death  
• Leads to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either result s in  
o a life -threatening illness or injury (life -threatening is defined as at risk 
of death at the time of the event), or  
o a perma nent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
o in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (in -
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a period of 
greater than 24 hours), or  
o medical or surgical  intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function,  
• Leads to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Those known adverse events related to the device, procedure or therapy are listed in 
the section  C. (Risk Analysis) of this Investigational Plan . 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 46 B.8.3.2 Reporting  
All AEs  and SAEs  will be assessed and captured from enrollment through the 
completion of the study on the Adverse Event Source Worksheet.   AEs and SAEs will 
be reported as required by [CONTACT_1201].  
All Adverse Events (see list in section C.1.) assessed/determined to be study -related  
study will document seriousness , severity, treatment/intervention provided, 
relationship to the device/procedure, and resolution.   
Adverse events that are determined to be not study related by [CONTACT_708680].  
As would be the common  practice when usi ng commercial medical devices, device -
related AEs may be reported by [CONTACT_779] (per their institutional policy) to the Customer 
Service or Technical Support of Medtronic  as specified in the  manufacturer's 
labeling/manuals.  
 
This is a post market, open -label study so Data Monitoring Committee will not be 
used.  
  
B.9.  Data Collection and Analysis  
 
B.9.1.  Data Collection  
Study d ata will be collected using a secure Electronic Data Capture system meeting the 
requirements of [ADDRESS_963281] names 
will not be published.  Data collection is summarized in Table 1.  
 
Remote data collection from the subjects is allowed. This should be evaluated on a case by 
[CONTACT_413], pending Investigator’s ap proval based on safety and clinical condition . Subjects 
who are not demonstrating study compliance, e.g. not returning phone calls, not charging 
device or turning the device off should not be mailed the questionnaires until they 
demonstrate compliance with  the study . The site should continue to contact [CONTACT_708681] . The communications will be 
documented in the source worksheets.  
Visit windows remain in place and should be maintained as much as possible . Subjects 
should be contact[CONTACT_708682], medications and concurrent procedures. All

yields the margin of 0.65.   
The following secondary endpoints do not have an associated hypothesis, and no 
significance level will be assigned to statistical tests that may be performed . 
Analysis of these endpoints will be based on a repeated measures a pproach that 
accounts for within subject correlation. Treatment group status for the repeated

DTM -SCS programming approach will be used with commercially available, FDA approved 
IntellisTM SCS sys tem within approved indications for use. Anticipated potential adverse events 
resulting from the study are expected to be in line with  adverse events already documented for 
SCS using a Standard  programming approach .  
There are known risks associated with t he use of any SCS system.  Known risks are associated 
with the implant procedure, the stimulation, the implanted device (not associated with 
stimulation) and external devices such as the charger and remote control. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_397532]. Subjects will be informed of t hese anticipated risks in the study 
consent process . 
 
Risks of Surgery  
Implanting a neurostimulation system has risks similar to spi[INVESTIGATOR_397533], including spi[INVESTIGATOR_397534] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_397535]), headaches, swelling, bruising, bleeding, 
infection, or paralysis.  
Subjects on anticoagulation therapy may be  at higher risk for problems after surgery such as 
hematomas that could result in paralysis.  
  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963294] stimulation system involves risks that are similar to other 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_397533]. In addition to tho se normally associated with surgery, implantation or use of 
a neurostimulation system includes, but is not limited to the following risks:  
• Allergic or immune system response to the implanted materials  
• Infection  
• Lead or neurostimulator erosion through the s kin or migration  
• Leakage of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  
• Loss of pain relief may return patients to their underlying pain condition  
• Persistent pain at the neurostimulator site  
• Placement of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397538] a surgical procedure that may expose patients to 
risks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865] (bleeding), hematoma, or paralysis  
• Radicular chest wall stimulation  
• Seroma (fluid collection in pocket where stimulator is placed) or hematoma at the 
neurostimulator site  
• Change in stimulation, possibly related to cellular changes ar ound the electrode(s), 
shifts in electrode position, loose electrical connections, lead fractures, which has 
been described by [CONTACT_397580] (jolting or shocking 
sensation)  
• Over time there could be changes in the level of sympt om control. In most cases, 
the physician can correct these changes without surgery.  
• Formation of excessive tissue around the lead in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_397539], requiring surgical intervention. 
Time to on set can range from weeks to many years after implant.  
• The safety of this therapy is unknown for pregnancy, unborn fetus, or delivery  
• Stimulation -dependent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, incontinence or 
constipation  
• Stimulation -dependent bladde r symptoms such as urinary retention, incontinence 
or frequency  
• Unexpected changes in stimulation - Electromagnetic interference, changes in 
posture, and other activities can cause a perceived increase in stimulation  
 
System Revision Risk  
The Intellis AdaptiveStim Neurostimulator may require replacement in 9 years or earlier, 
regardless of the number of times the neurostimulator is recharged.  It is possible that the system 
will need to be revised (explanted, replaced, or repositioned) earlier than 9 years.  Possible 
reasons for revision/explant may include infection, malfunction, and migration of the system 
components.  The risks associated with system revision are equivalent to the commercially 
available systems.    
Pregnancy Risks  
Pregnant wo men are not able to take part in this study.  Female subjects must agree to not 
become pregnant during the study by [CONTACT_2329] a medically acceptable method of birth control. If a 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963295] become pregnant.  Subjects  that become pregnant during the study 
will be instructed  to turn the neuro stimulator “OFF” a nd will be exited from the study.  
Radiographic Imaging  
As part of the study, subjects may  be required to have fluoroscopic or X -ray images taken of 
their thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_708648].  This may be 
beyond what i s standard of care.  The risk associated with these additional images has been 
considered and determined to be minimal since the total radiation dose will be approximately 
the same as one CT scan of the abdomen.     
Study Risk Control Measures  
The followi ng will be done to mitigate risks associated with the implanted system:  
• Investigators who are experienced with spi[INVESTIGATOR_708649]  
• Instructions will be given to the study participants to ensure they can properly  use the 
patient programmer and recharger system  
• Subjects can turn off stimulation at any time during the study with the patient 
programmer or recharger  
• Periodic monitoring of the study participants  
• Written materials  that contain precautions, warnings, and contraindications, as well as 
instructions on the use of the devices will be available and/or provided to the clinicians 
and subjects  
Since  the efficacy measure in this study is intensity of pain in the back and leg s, pain in these 
areas does not need to be reported as an adverse event unless it meets the definition of a serious 
adverse event. However, Investigators may, at their discretion, report any other pain-related 
adverse events during the study.   
C2.  Minimization of Risks  
Neurostimul ation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as SCS, are used as an aid in the management of chronic, 
intractable pain that cannot be effectively managed with medications and/or other conservative 
treatments alone. Patients considered for neurostimulation therapy have typi[INVESTIGATOR_708650].  
Medtronic has carefully designed and tested the Intellis AdaptiveStim Neurostimulation 
Systems to ensure the safety and performance for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain. 
Medtr onic has completed an extensive risk analysis to ensure the identification of potential 
hazards and subsequent mitigation of these hazards to eliminate them entirely or reduce them 
to an acceptable level.   
The risks associated with the surgical implantati on of the device, device use, and device failures 
are the same as those observed for commercially available SCS devices. With an existing pre -
market application approval for the commercially available Intellis AdaptiveStim 
Neurostimulation Systems, an esta blished safety profile of probable benefit outweighing risk 
already exists for SCS Therapy for chronic back and/or leg pain. In most cases implantation of 
SCS is a reversible procedure and the system can be turned off or removed. Moreover, 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963296] provide evidence of training 
in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in the conduct of clinical trials with human participants .

D.1.1.  Device System Overview  
The Intellis ™ system is a totally implantable spi[INVESTIGATOR_708651] k and /or limbs . 
The system has been approved by [CONTACT_397581].  
The Intellis system  system  consists of a rechargeable implantable neurostimulator  (INS) 
with [ADDRESS_963297] 
percutaneous leads  located in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814] .  The I NS can be  controlled by a Patient 
Programmer and/or a Clinician Programmer.   
Before permanent implantation, a trial phase of therapy lasting up to 10 days is required. 
Components of the system during trial include an E xternal Neuros timulator  (ENS)  
capable of delivering the same stimulation as the I NS, and Stimul ation L eads. Other 
components of the system include Clinician Programmer, Communicator , Patient 
Programmer , Extensions, Charger and charging system, and surgical accessories.  
 
D.1.2.  Device System Details  
   
Only FDA approved, commercially available components will be used for the study  and 
used in a maner that is consistent with approved labeling.  
 
D.1.2.1   Major Components  
Implantable Neurostimulator : Intellis neurostimulator  (Model [ZIP_CODE], Medtronic, 
Minneapolis MN)  will be used for the st udy. The INS is a multi -programmable, 
rechargeable d evice that delivers stimulation through one or two 8 -electrode 
percutaneous leads. The stimulation settings are sto red in programs. A program is a 
specific combination of pulse width, rate, and amplitude settings  acting on a specific 
electrode combination (up to 16 electrodes per program).   Each of the [ADDRESS_963298] through the electrodes in the leads that are connected to the output 
terminals  of the INS. The electrical pulses used for stimulation are generated using a 
single current source.  The INS is de signed to produce charge -balanced, biphasic 
rectangular pulse s.  
The battery is recharged using an external charger that uses transcutaneous RF energy 
transmission. The INS is capable of communicating with the Charger to control the 
recharging function.   
The INS communicate s with the Clinician Programmer  and Patient Programmer (also 
called Patient Remote Controller) . Clinician Programmer is used to program the INS 
and the ENS. The Patient Programmer is used by [CONTACT_397582], change therapy programs, and turn stimulation on and off.  
External Neurostimulator (ENS) for Trial Phase : The Medtronic Model [ZIP_CODE] 
Wireless External Neurostimulator (ENS) is part of a neurostimulation system used for 
trial stimulation outside of the operating room.  The ENS is powered by [CONTACT_708683] A batteries. The ENS is connected to leads  implanted in the subject . The 
subject uses th e ENS d uring the Trial Phase  to evaluate the e ffectiveness of SCS 
therapy prior to receiving a permanent implant. The ENS also communicates with the 
Clinician Programmer system and Patient Remote Controller , similar to the INS .  
Clinician Programmer  System :  The Medtronic Model A710 Intellis ™ clinician 
programmer application resides on a tablet and is intended to be used by [CONTACT_708684] (Model [ZIP_CODE]) and IntellisTM INS (Model [ZIP_CODE] and 
[ZIP_CODE])  for pain therapy. The Clinician Programmer requires the use of the 
Communicator (Model 8880T2 ) to communicate with the INS .  
Patient Programmer : The Patient Programmer (Model [ZIP_CODE]), also called Patient 
Remote Controll er, is a handheld unit able to communicate with the INS or ENS .  The 
Patient Programmer  is powered by [CONTACT_708685]  (during trial) or 
a rechargeable battery (after permanent implantation) . The Patient Programmer  is used 
by [CONTACT_1130] s to sele ct the SCS therapy  program to be applied, to turn on or off the INS 
or ENS,  and to change some of therapy parameters such as stimulation amplitude .   
Charging System :  The Charging system  (Model [ZIP_CODE])  is used by [CONTACT_397587].  It is a portable device powered by a 
rechargeable battery and can be held in one hand. The charging system used in this 
study is a commercial ly available charging system  manufactured by [CONTACT_13735] 
(Minneapolis, MN) and fully compatible with the study INS.  
Stimulation  Leads and Lead Extensions :  The study will use commercially available 
percutaneous eight -electrode leads manufactured by [CONTACT_13735] (Minneapolis, MN) and 
compatible with the INS and ENS to be used in this  study. The l eads are positioned 
percutaneously in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_708652]. The percutaneous l eads are 
intended to be single use.  Temporary  or permanent  percutaneous leads may be used 
during the Trial Phase of the study. The proximal end of these leads connect directly to 
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963299] to the INS.  Commercially available lead extensions 
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) compatible with the percutaneous leads and INS may 
be used in this study.   
 
D.1.2.2 .  Surgical Accessories  
 
The surgical accessories that will be used in the study will be commercially available 
devices.  
Torque Wrench:  A commercially available  Torque Wrench is used to tighten the 
screws that lock a  percutaneous lead into the INS  and/or a lead extension. It also tighten 
the screws that lock the lead extension into the INS when this is used.  
Lead anchors:  Lead anchors may be used to possibly prevent lead migration and/or 
lead strain.  These are used to anchor the percutaneous leads  to the supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_708653] .  Lead anchors used in this study are commercially available 
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and  designed to slide freely over the lead length to the 
required fixation position . Surgical s utures are then tied around the anchor clampi[INVESTIGATOR_708654].   
Insertion Needle:   Percutaneous leads are implanted in the dorsal epi[INVESTIGATOR_708655] .  An insertion n eedle contains a cannula and stylet that  facilitate 
access to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_708656] l ead placement.  Th e insertion needle is a 14G  epi[INVESTIGATOR_708657] a thin wall and a modified Touhy non -coring tip.  The cannula and stylet 
are designed to lock together and maintain the orientatio n of the tip of each component. 
The hub of the insertion ne edle has a standard luer fitting.  
Stylets:   Stylets  are used to push and “steer” a percutaneous l ead into the desired place  
within the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814] .  The distal end of the stylet could be straight or curved .  The 
implanter is able to use either one in order to comfortably maneuver a percutaneous 
lead through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_708658].  
Tunneling Tool:   A Tunneling Tool is used to create  a subcutaneous tunnel that directs 
the percutaneous leads or lead extensions from the midline incision to the leads  from 
the INS implant  site.  This is a single use tool .  
INS Template:   The INS  Template is an aid to be used for the implanter  intended for 
proper sizing of the INS pocket  within each subject . 
INS Port Plug:   An INS  Port Plug is used to seal the port of the I NS that is not in use 
when only one percutaneous lead  is implanted.  
Lead Blank:   A Lead Blank is an optional aid made out of flexible stainless steel  that 
has an outer diameter similar in size to the percutaneous lead. A lead blank can be  
optionally used to clear a p ath for the introduction of a percutaneous l ead into the  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].  
 
  
 
DTM -NOVA -2020PM1 Rev 3.[ADDRESS_963300] stimulation therapy for pain management has been used for  more than four 
decades. Its efficacy and safety has been widely documented.

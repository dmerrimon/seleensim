 [ADDRESS_417194] that the described real- world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely 
as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in  the healthcare data bases.  
 1.1 Title  
Liraglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes (LEADER  trial)  
 1.2 Intended aim(s)  
 The primary hypothesis was that liraglutide would be noninferior to placebo (plus standard of care) with regard to the 
primary outcome, with a margin of 1.30 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio.

1.4 Required power for primary endpoint  and noninferiority margin (if applicable)

5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing liraglutide  to the DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) antidiabetic 
class  as a proxy for placebo . Both 2nd generation sulfonylureas (SUs) and DPP4is are not known to have an impact on the outcome of 
interest . The comparison against DPP4i is the primary comparison. Initiators of 2nd generation SUs are used as a secondary 
comparator group. The patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180 days before 
initiation of liraglutide  or a comparator drug ( cohort entry  date) . Follow -up for the outcome (3P -MACE), begins the day after drug 
initiation. As in the trial, patients are allowed to take other antidiabetic medications during the study.  
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
  
5.2.1 Eligible c ohort entry dates  
Market availability of liraglutide  in the U .S. started on January  20, 2010.  
• For Marketscan: January  20, 2010- Dec 31, 2017 (end of data availability ).  
• For Medicare: Jan 1, 2012 -Dec 31, 2017 (start - end of data availability).  
• For Optum : January  20, 2010- March 31, 2019  (end of data availability).  
 
5.2.2 Specify inclusion /exclusion  criteria for cohort entry and define  the index date  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for al l inclusion/exclusion are provided 
in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowchart s below.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables :  
 
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of liraglutide . Initiation will be defined by [CONTACT_337726] a comparator in the prior 
6 months before treatment initiation (washout period).  
 Comparator agents : 
• Initiators of liraglutide  will be compared to initiators of - 
o DPP4i  (primary ) 
o 2nd generation sulfonylureas  
 Because liraglutide  and comparators are frequently used as second or third line treatments of T2DM, we expect it  to be unlikely that 
liraglutide  and comparators are initiated in patients with substantially different baseline risk for proposed outcomes.  
 
6.2 Preliminary c ovariate s: 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decisio n making  
 
 7 • Age 
• Sex 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default  baseline covariate assessment period , defined as  180 days 
prior to and including index date  
 
Covariates listed abov e represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. 
We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap b etween 
treatment g roups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility 
analysis and the initial power assessment  and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ). These covariates are based on those used by 
[CONTACT_337727]. (2019).  
 6.3 Outcome variables  and study follow -up:  
 6.3.[ADDRESS_417200]  (definitions provided in Appendix A ):  
 
• Primary outcome : 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), i.e., non -fatal myocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, 
or CV mortality  
• Secondary outcomes:  Individual MACE component s: 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337705] (for purposes of individual component, fatal MI is included) 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337706] (for purposes of individual component, fatal stroke is included)  
o All-cause mortality/CV mortality:  
§ All-cause inpatient mortality identified using discharge status codes will be used as a proxy for “CV mortality” 
in commercial databases  
§ Information on CV mortality through data linkage with the National Death Index (NDI) will only be come  
available  at a later date  for Medicare and will be used in secondary analyses . 
 
Control outcomes of interest  (control outcomes only serve to assess aspect s of study validity but are not further interpreted) :  
1. For comparison with 2nd Gen. SUs : Severe hypoglycemia (we expect to see protective effect ; American Diabetes Association, 
2018 ) 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decisio n making  
 
 9 o A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion  
o An added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion (e.g. if a 
liraglutide  user adds insulin, he or she does not get censored at the time of insulin augmentation)  
 
For the ITT analyses, the censoring base d on the augmentation/switching  and treatment discontinuation will be replaced with a 
maximum allowed follow -up time of 365 day s.

We excluded patients using contraceptives because this trial includes non-
pregnant women, patients without childbearing potential, and patients who 
have childbearing potential but are taking precautions such as oral 
contraceptives (among many other ways) to avoid pregnancy during the trial 
period. It is impossible to implement such inclusion in real-world data, as 
childbearing potential is not recorded in claims. In this trials setting, this 
limitation to implement as an inclusion criteria is due to the following: i) lack of 
recording of contraceptives and other precautions to avoid pregnancy and ii) 
patients with diabetes and baseline CV tend to be older and are not likely to be at 
childbearing age. Therefore, we assumed that patients taking oral contraceptives 
have childbearing potential, so if they were to stop contraceptive use during 
follow-up, they could then become pregnant. Also, just to note, this exclusion of 
contraceptives use excludes very few patients (typi[INVESTIGATOR_15120] 0.1% of 
patients).

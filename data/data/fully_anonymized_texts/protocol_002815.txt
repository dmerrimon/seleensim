7.1 Efficacy Evaluations  
To quantify the subjective benefit using the FACE -Q to determine the patient’s satisfaction and comparing 
it with true objective volume changes measured with the Vectra 3D camera.  
[ADDRESS_510052] descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics and study outcome 
measures at each visit, both overall, and within each arm.  
8.4.2  Efficacy Analysis  
The validated FACE -Q will be used to determine patient satisfaction for each arm.  The Mirror Software 3D 
software (Canfield Scientific Inc , Fairfield, New Jersey) will calculate the volumetric changes by [CONTACT_404549].  The baseline and post treatment measurements 
from the Vectra 3D images will determine volumetric changes of the injections over time.  All volumetric 
measurements will be recorded in milliliters, and the average volume change will be calculated.   A 
correlation between patient satisfaction and volumetric changes will be calculated.

9 Safety and Adverse Events 
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_404550]:  
 Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use if a drug in humans 
whether or not considered drug related.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404538].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events.  
9.[ADDRESS_510054], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event will 
be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or

11.06.2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly  related to the study intervention or study participation will be 
recorded and reported immediately.  
9.3 Relationship of AE to Study  
The relationship of each adverse event to the study procedur es should be characterized. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_241881]: 
• likely related – a well- known eff ect of the device or  clearly not related to the subject or 
environmental factors  
• probably related –  is know n or suspected effect of device or  cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_404551]   
• possibly related – is a possible effect of the device or can be explained by [CONTACT_241892]  
• unlikely related –  is not a suspected effect of the device or can readily be explained by [CONTACT_241894]   
• unrelated – is not a known effect of the device and can readily be readily and easily explained 
by [CONTACT_404552]  
9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events, Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems  
Investigators and the protocol sponsor  (which may or may not be a Penn Investigator)  must conform to the 
adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible,  
 
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the 
initial report includes:  
 
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention  
 
 Additionally,  all other events (unanticipated problems, adverse reactions, unanticipated adverse device 
effects and subject complaints will be recorded and reported with respect to institutional and federal policies.   
 
9.4.1  Follow -up report 
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that changes the 
investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed until either resolved or stable.  
9.4.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Investigators from all participating sites should report all unexpected and related adverse events, regardless of whether they are serious or not, and all unanticipated problems to the sponsor.  
 
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious adverse 
event, will be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event.  To report such 
events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form wi ll be completed by [CONTACT_404553] 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_241896]:

Within the following [ADDRESS_510055] the understanding of the 
event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the study sponsor.  
9.4.3  Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB  
For single and multi- site studies each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_404539].   
9.4.4  Sponsor reporting: Notifying Participating Investigators   
For clinical trials, in addition to reporting certain unanticipated problems and adverse events noted above to the FDA, it is the responsibility of the study sponsor to report those same adverse events or findings to 
participating investigators.  
9.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above. The lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_404540].   
9.[ADDRESS_510056] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that

patient identifiers will be collected and stored in the REDCap database.  Patient name [CONTACT_404555].   
 Source data will mainly be from the patient’s EMR.  When the study  requires data not normally collected in 
the patient’s EMR, the case report forms will also be the source document.  Data from source documents 
(Appendix 15.4, case report forms (case report forms definition-  Appendix 15.5), will be entered into an 
electronic data capturing system.  All source documents should be secure in private spaces with restricted access.    
During procurement of data charts will be reviewed in private spaces to ensure the confidentiality of 
acquired data.   Data will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_510058] (IRB) acknowledgement of the termination of the research project and secondly by [CONTACT_241897] (45 CFR  46.115) and FDA 
regulations (21 CFR 56.115) state that IRB records relating to research shall be retained for at least [ADDRESS_510059] manager.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_404541] f rom the patient’s EMR .  The study 
team member will enter the data into the RED Cap and the project manager will monitor the entry to verify 
the compliance with respect to the protocol, data collection and source documents.     
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the sponsor, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulator y documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.   
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent 
form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.  The formal 
consent of a subject, using th e EC/IRB -approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject 
undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_29762], and the investigator -designated research professional obtaining the consent .

to injection to confirm negative pregnancy status.  The effects of this drug/device, there could be serious 
harm to unborn children or children who are breast -feeding. These effects could also harm the mother.   
11.2 Benefits  
Subjects participating in this trial will not  directly benefit participating in this study.  I f assigned to the 
treatment  group,  the patient will receive the treatment described in the initial consultation. I f assigned to the 
control group,  they may not receive the desired benefits of the requested consultation . 
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Subjects participating in this trial will unlikely experience an increase in risk  as both groups  receive 
injections .  This study is designed to minimally change patient’s care.  Subjects participating in this trial  are 
chosen due to the clinic consultation  scheduled.  No change in patient care will happen if the subject is 
consented.  All subjects  will be asked to return for three follow -up visits for observation and surveys .  
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Eligible subjects will be identified from the practice of the PI .  Potential subjects will be screened by a 
member of the study team for eligibility, using the electronic medical record (EMR), according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above.  In clinic, the participating investigator will introduce the s tudy 
to eligible patients during the consultation visit.  A member of the study team, identified to consent, will give 
a written informed consent and answer any questions the patients may have. Eligible patients may be 
contact[CONTACT_404544] a phone call by a member of the study team to introduce the study followed by 
[CONTACT_404554] .  A member of the study team will answer any 
questions the patients may have before and after the informed consent is signed.  It will be emphasized to the potential subject that three visits  are required which are not considered standard of care.  The informed 
consent process will be documented in the subject’s medical record or comparable source document.

15.2 Expedited FDA Reporting Requirements   
The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA.  These 
written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND/ IDE safety reports.  
 
The following describes the IDE safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_342649]:  
 
• Within 10 working days  
Any study event that is all : 
– associated with the use of the study drug, and  
– unexpected,  
regardless of the seriousness of the event.  
 
• Within 5 working days  
– Protocol deviation to protect the life of the subject in emergency  
– Withdrawal of IRB  approval  
– Lack of informed consent  
 Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND/IDE safety reports all previous reports concerning similar 
adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous reports.  
 Reporting Process  
Applicable events can be reported to the FDA using Form FDA3500A
 or in narrative format. The report 
must be sent to the correct division . Specific information that must be included in the reports can be found 
in 21 CFR 312.32 or in 21 CFR 812.150 .

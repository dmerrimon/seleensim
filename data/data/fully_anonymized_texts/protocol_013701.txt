2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_485157]  (EHE) is a rare sarcoma that shows vascular (endothelial) 
differentiation. It usually presents with widespread metastases. Although metastatic disease can 
be stable for years, it inevitably progresses rapi[INVESTIGATOR_485158], is highly lethal and has 
no effective treatment. EHE can occur at any age, but peaks in adulthood (Weiss & Enzinger, 
1982) . Five -year disease -specific mortality is 40% and 65% for EHE that arises in the lung and 
liver, respectively (Weiss & Goldblum, 2008) . Although localized EHE can often be treated with 
surgery and radiation, systemic therapy options are limited for patients with metastatic disease in 
which the median survival is less than [ADDRESS_623331] systemic therapy and data is 
limited to single -institution case reports or retrospective case series. Cioffi et al. (Cioffi et al., 
2011) reported a retrospective study of 42 patients with metastatic EHE. Thirty -four patients 
received systemic chemotherapy including conventional doxorubicin -containing regimens 
(n=16), other chemotherapy regimens (n=6), and anti -angiogenesis agents or tyrosin e kinase 
inhibitors (TKI, n=12). There were no ob jective responses although [ADDRESS_623332] 6 months. Of those with stable disease, 4 patients received doxorubicin -
containing chemotherapy, 4 received other chemotherapy and 6 received angiogenesis targeting 
agents or TKIs. Median PFS was 4.8 months and median OS was 41 months.

 Mehrabi et al. published a comprehensive review of patients with malignant hepatic EHE 
comprised of 434 patients (Mehrabi et al., 2006) . The most common treatment was liver 
transplantation (44.8%), followed by [CONTACT_4171] (24.8%) and chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
(21%). One -year and five -year patient survival rates were 73.3% and 30%, respectively , for 
patients who received treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Chemotherapeutic regimens 
were diverse and included thalidomide, doxorubicin, [ADDRESS_623333] prospectively investigated drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_485159]. For example, a phase II study evaluated bevacizumab in seven patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic EHE (Agulnik et al., 2013) . Two patients had a partial response 
and four patients demonstrated stable disease with one patient experiencing progressive disease 
at first evaluation. The mean number of cycles received was 17.3 (52 weeks). Median PFS was 
39.1 weeks and median OS was 1 42.6 weeks. Given the small number of patients in this study, 
further conclusions cannot be made.  
 
A phase II study by [CONTACT_485180] (800 mg 
daily) in 15 patients with progressive EHE with a primary endpoint of 9 -month PFS (Chevreau et 
al., 2013) . Twelve patients had metastatic disease at the time of enrollment. The 2 -month, 4 -
month, 6 -month and 9 -month progression free rates were 84.6%, 46.4%, 38.4% and 30.7%, 
respectively. Median follow -up was [ADDRESS_623334] 
used chemotherapy, immunotherapy, multi -kinase inhibitors or anti -vascular endothelial growth 
factor inhibitors with marginal benefi t; therefore, standard drug therapy for patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic unresectable EHE has not been established.  
 
Recently, a disease -defining TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion has been identified  in EHE . This is a 
balanced, reciprocal translocation that results in the fusion of TAZ (also known as WWTR1 ), to 
CAMTA1 , dysregulating the Hippo pathway (Tanas et al., 2016; Tanas et al., 2011) . Importantly, 
this fusion is found in more than 90% of EHE tumors, and EHE tumors have no other consistent 
genetic alterations, suggesting that the fusion is an early and important genetic event and that 
EHE cells are highly dependent on TAZ -CAMTA1 (Tanas et al., 2011) . TAZ -CAMTA1 drives 
oncogenic transformation through a TAZ -like transcriptional program and the Hippo pathway is 
unable to regulate TAZ -CAMTA1 (Tanas et al., 2016) . Thus, this fusion unleashes an otherwise 
tightly controlled transcriptional program resulting in EHE oncogenesis. Rubin et al. have 
studied signal transduction downstream of TAZ -CAMTA1, identifying connective tissue growth 
factor (CTGF) and MAP kinase si gnaling as key pathways and potential therapeutic targets 
(unpublished data). Most of the clinical studies discussed above predate the discovery of this 
gene fusion. The limited success of systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_485160].

 2.2 CTEP  IND Agent  
 
2.2.1 Trametinib Dimethyl Sulfoxide ([COMPANY_004]1120212B, MEKINIST)  
 
The RAF -MEK -ERK pathway plays a critical role in multiple cellular functions.  
Activation of the pathway can result from activation/mutations of the upstream receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and RAS, or upregulation/mutations in RAF and MEK.  Upon 
activati on, RAF acts as the MAPK kinase and activates MAPKK (MEK1/2), which in 
turn catalyze s activation of the effectors ERK1/ERK2.  Once activated, ERK1/2 
translocate into the nucleus and phosphorylate a number of effector proteins and 
transcriptional factors th at regulate cell proliferation, motility, differentiation, and 
survival.  
 
Trametinib is one of several MEK inhibitors in clinical development.  On May 29, 2013, 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved trametinib for the treatment of 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K 
mutations as detected by [CONTACT_13247] -approved test (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
2013).  On January 10, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated 
approval to trametinib and dabrafenib for use in combination to treat patients with 
unresec table o r metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation as 
detected by [CONTACT_13247] -approved test (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2014).  
 
Experience to date indicates that MEK is a valid target.  In a phase 3 trial comparing 
trametinib with dacarbazine or paclitaxel in patients with BRAF V600E or V600K 
mutant metastatic melanoma, trametinib demonstrated a significantly better response rate, 
progression -free survival, and overall survival (Flaherty et al. , 2012).  However, single 
agent activities are limited.  Extensive research is underway to identify the patient 
selection markers and develop rational combination strategies.  Preclinical stud ies have 
provided strong rationale and proof of principle for combination of MEK inhibitors with 
RTK inhibitors (EGFR or IGF -1R) (Gopal et al.,  2010; Ebi et al.,  2011), PI3K/AKT 
inhibitors (Engelman et al.,  2008; Hoeflich et al.,  2009), and mTOR inhibitors.  On the 
other hand, the optimal dose/schedule and patient selection criteria for combination 
regimens have not been defined.  Phase [ADDRESS_623335] been 
reported, including AZD6244 + MK2206 (Tolcher et al., 2011) and GDC -0973 + GDC -
094 (MEK + PI3K inhibitor) (Bendell et al.,  2011).  
 
The most up -to-date preclinical and clinical study information for trametinib can be 
found in the [COMPANY_004]1120212 (trametinib) Investigator's Brochure ( August 10, 2018 ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mechanisms of Action and Preclinical Data with Trametinib  
 
Trametinib is a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvate compound (ratio 1:1) with potent, 
allosteric and ATP non -competitive inhibition of MEK1/2 (IC [ADDRESS_623336] MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) (Gilmartin et al.,  2011).  Trametinib inhibited 
MEK1/2 kinase activity and prevented RAF -dependent MEK phosphorylation (S217 for 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, 2020  
 
 
10 
 MEK1), producing prolonged pERK1/[ADDRESS_623337] unphosphorylated MEK1/2 (u -MEK1/2) when compared with preactivated 
diphosphorylated MEK (pp -MEK), suggesting that u -MEK affords a higher affinity 
binding site for tram etinib than does pp -MEK.  
 
The specificity of trametinib was confirmed against a panel of 183 kinases, including 
MEK5 (the closet kinase homolog to MEK1/2), CRAF, BRAF, ERK1, and ERK2 
(Yamaguchi et al.,  2011).  Trametinib demonstrated equal potency against activated 
MEK1 - and MEK2 -mediated phosphorylation of ERK (sequence identity of 85% across 
the whole protein and 100% in the active site for humans).  Trametinib demonstrated 
preferential inhibition of RAF -mediated MEK1 activation (IC 50 = 0.60 nM) over pMEK1 
kinase activity (IC 50 = 13 nM) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2012a).  
 
BRAF -mutant Colo205, A375P F11s, and HT -[ADDRESS_623338] significant mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) (80% to 87%) at 3.0 
mg/kg trametinib, with multiple complete and partial tumor regressions.  In the Colo205 
model, tumor regression was observed even at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (Yamaguchi et al.,  
2011).  Two KRAS -mutant xenograft models, HCT -116 and A549, also showed 
significant TGI (83% and 75%) but without significant tumor regressions (Gilmartin et 
al., 2011).  As predi cted by [CONTACT_377488], tumor xenograft lines with wild -type 
(wt) RAF/RAS (PC3, BxPC3, and BT474) were much less sensitive, showing only 
modest TGI (44 -46%) with no tumor regressions.  
 
Pharmacodynamic studies were performed in mice treated with trametinib for 14 days 
(Gilmartin et al.,  2011).  In the A375P F11s xenograft model, the first dose of trametinib 
(3 mg/kg) significantly reduced pERK for more than 8 hours on Day 1.  pERK inhibition 
was more sustained (over 24 hours) after the Day 7 dose, probably due to an increase in 
the stead y-state levels of trametinib after repeated doses.  The average C max in blood was 
1,410 nM on Day 7, with an estimated half -life (t 1/2) of 33 hours.  In ad dition, 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) also confirmed inhibition of cell proliferation (reduced 
Ki67) and G1 cell cycle arrest (elevated p27Kip1/CDKN1B) following 4 days of 
treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Activity of Trametinib  
 
FTIH Phase 1 Trial of Trametinib Monotherapy (MEK111054)  
There are 3 parts in this study.  Part 1:  The dose -escalation portion involves 
administration of trametinib (repeat doses of 0.125 mg to 4.0 mg) to patients with solid 
tumors or lymphoma in one of three schedules - (1) QD for 21 days followed by 7 days 
without drug, (2) loading dose on Day 1 or Day 1 -2, followed by [CONTACT_377489], or (3) QD dosing without a drug holiday.  Part 2:  cohort expansion at the 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for pancreatic cancer, melanoma, non -small cell lung 
cance r (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), or any BRAF mutation -positive cancer.  Part 
3:  expansion to characterize the biologically active range of trametinib via analysis of 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers (biopsies or FDG -PET).

The MTD of trametinib was established as 3 mg QD, but the recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) was chosen at 2 mg QD based on tolerability of repeated cycles (Infante et al.,  
2010).  
 
Trametinib  treatment  in children  
A 3 part phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter study of trametinib in pediatric subjects with 
recurrent or refractory tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is underway. Unpublished results from 
the part A, dose escalation portion of the study which included 38 subjects is com plete. 
The recommended phase 2 dose in children 6 years of age or older is 0.025 mg/kg per 
day with the total dose not to exceed 2 mg per day. A dose of 0.04 mg/kg per day  
(corresponding to a dose of [ADDRESS_623339] weighing 50 kg)  was associated  
with skin related dose -limiting toxicities. Pharmacokinetic steady state drug 
concentration target was met in children 6 years of age or older using a dose of 0.025 
mg/kg per day. (confidential information from [COMPANY_001])  
 
PK and metabolism of trametinib:  
PK measurements were conducted under fasting conditions.  After a single dose (Day 1), 
AUC 0-24 and C max values were dose -proportional up to 6 mg, lower than dose 
proportional following 8 mg, and greater than dose proportional following the 10 mg 
dose.  Median T max was 1.5 hours.  
 
After repeat doses (Day 15), trametinib accumulated with a mean accumulation ratio of 
6.[ADDRESS_623340] variability in exposure ranged from 27 -
50% for C max and 20 -41% for AUC 0-24 across all dosing regimens.  The effective t 1/2 was 
approximately 4.5 days, and steady state was reached by [CONTACT_190758] 15.  
Trametinib had a small peak:trough ratio of ~2 (Infante et al.,  2010).  At 2 mg QD on 
Day 15, mean AUC 0-24 was 376 ng•h/mL and C max 23 ng/mL, and the mean trough 
concentrations ranged from 10.0 to18.9 ng/mL.  The long half -life and small p eak:trough 
ratio of trametinib allowed constant target inhibition within a narrow range of exposure.  
 
Drug -drug interactions:  
Trametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation (non -cytochrome P450 
[CYP450] -mediated) with secondary oxidation or in combination with glucuronidation 
biotransformation pathways (Investigator’s Brochure, 2012a).  The deacetylation is likely 
medi ated by [CONTACT_190759], such as carboxylesterases, or amidases.  Based on in 
vitro  studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, 
and CYP3A4.  Trametinib has an overall low potential for drug -drug interactions.  
 
Pharmacodynamic effect and biomarkers:  
The relationship between dose and tumor biomarkers such as pERK, Ki67, and p27, were 
evaluated in patients with BRAF or NRAS mutation -positive metastatic melanoma 
(Investigator's Brochure, 2012a).  In general, increasing exposures and/or doses provided 
greater pharmacodynamic effects.  The median change observed at a dose of 2 mg QD 
was 62% inhibition of pERK, 83% inhibition of Ki67, and a 175% increase in p27.

Antitumor Activity in the FTIH phase 1 trial:  
In the FTIH phase 1 trial, 14 patients with BRAF -mutant melanoma received trametinib 
at 2 mg QD.  The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 43% (6/14), including 2 
complete responses (CRs) (Investigator's Brochure, 2012a).  In 9 patients with BRAF wt 
melanoma, 2 patients achieved a partial response (PR), and 3 patients with stable disease 
(SD) (Infante et al.,  2010).  In 26 evaluable pancreatic cancer patients, there were 2 PRs 
(1 PR was KRAS mutation -positive) and 11 SD (2 achieved ≥20% tumor reduction ) 
(Messersmith et al.,  2011).  Among the 27 CRC patients (without selection of RAS or 
RAF mutations), 8 SD were observed.  
 
Antitumor Activity in Melanoma  
 
Phase 3 trial of trametinib vs. chemotherapy in advanced V600 mutant melanoma:  
In a phase 3 trial, patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV cutaneous melanoma with a 
BRAF V600E or V600K mutation were randomized (2:1) to trametinib (2 mg, PO, QD) 
or chemotherapy (dacarbazine or paclitaxel) (Flaherty et al. , 2012; MEKINIST, 2013).  
There were 322 patients in the intention -to-treat (ITT) population, of whom 273 (85%) 
were in the primary efficacy population (patients with BRAFV600E-positive cancer who 
did not have brain metastases at baseline).  Of the patients, 214 were randomized to

Experience with Trametinib in Metastatic Melanoma Following BRAF Inhibitor Therapy  
 
The clinical activity of single -agent trametinib was evaluated in a single -arm, 
multicenter, international trial in 40 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation -

 positive, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma who had received prior treatment with a 
BRAF inhibitor.  All patients received trametinib at a dose of 2 mg PO QD until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity.  None of the patients achieved a confirmed PR or 
CR. 
 
Antitumor Activity of Trametinib in Cancer Other Than Melanoma  
 
In a phase 1/2 monotherapy study, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) patients were given trametinib at dose levels from 1 -2 mg QD.  Drug -
related AEs in 45 patients were similar to that observed in patients with solid tumors, and  
2 mg PO QD was selected for further investigation in this patient population.  Twelve 
patients (23%) withdrew due to an AE, including cardiac failure (2) and infection (2).  
Efficacy was reported in 39 patients (Borthakur et al.,  2010).  The best response  in 13 
patients with KRAS or NRAS mutations included 3 CRs (23%), 7 SD (54%), and 1 PD 
(progressive disease) (5%).  In 26 patients with wild -type RAS or an unknown mutation, 
there were 2 PRs (8%).  
 
In a multicenter phase 2 study, NSCLC patients with KRAS mutant tumors were 
randomized 2:1 to receive trametinib (2 mg QD) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV every 3 
weeks) (Blumenschein et al. , 2013).  A total of 134 pts were randomized to trametinib 
(89) or docetaxel (45); [ADDRESS_623341] ratio for PFS 
was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.75 -1.75; P=0.5197) with a median PFS of 11.7 versus 11.4 weeks 
for trametinib versus docetaxel.  The overall response rate (ORR) was 12% for trametinib 
and 12% for  docetaxel.  
 
In a double -blind, phase 2 study evaluating the combination of gemcitabine with 
trametinib, untreated pancreatic cancer patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine 
(1000 mg/m2 weekly 7 for 8 weeks, then weekly 3 every 4 weeks) plus either 
trametinib 2mg or placebo QD (Infante et al. , 2013).  Median OS was 8.4 months with 
trametinib compared to 6.7 months with placebo.  Median PFS was 16 weeks versus 15 
weeks, and ORRs and median duration of responses were 22% and 23.9 weeks and 18% 
and 16.1 weeks on t rametinib and placebo; the median OS and ORR in the subgroup of 
patients with KRAS mutations (143/160) was similar to OS and ORR  for all randomized 
patients.   
 
Trametinib has not been formally evaluated in patients with EHE or soft tissue sarcoma. 
We do not expect drug pharmacokinetics or adverse events rates to differ significantly 
from the experience of trametinib in treatment of metastatic melanoma or non -smal l cell 
lung cancer.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Trametinib Safety Profile  
 
A Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR)  list using NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) terms is included in 
Section 7.1 of the protocol.  
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, [ADDRESS_623342] 
toxicities for MEK inhibitors.  In addition, visual impairment and left ventricular  ejection 
fraction (LVEF) reduction, although observed at lower frequencies, are also considered 
class -effect toxicities as they have been observed with trametinib as well as other MEK 
inhibitors.  
 
AEs of special interest:  
Rash, diarrhea, visual disorders, hepatic disorders, cardiac -related AEs, and pneumonitis 
are considered AEs of special interest because they are either known class effects ( i.e., 
have been observed with other MEK inhibitors) or are potentially life -threatening 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  The following sections provide integrated summaries 
for these AEs across different clinical trials, with emphasis on trials using trametinib as 
monotherapy, especially at the RP2D of 2 mg.  
 
Refer to dose modification guidelines for the toxicities for which they are addressed in 
Section 6.  
 
Rash :  Rash was a common AE observed across different dose levels and in different 
combinations (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  At the 2 mg dose, rash was seen in 27% to 
78% of patients in different trials.  Of the ~370 subjects with rash AEs at the 2 mg 
monotherapy dose (including crossover subjects) in five studies, the majority of rash AEs 
were grades 1 or 2 (24% to 73%); 0% to 9% of patients experienced grade 3 rash AEs, 
and four patients had a grade 4 rash AE.  
 
In a randomized phase 3 trial of trametinib vs. chemotherapy, the overall incidence of 
skin toxicity (including rash, dermatitis, acneiform rash, palmar -plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and erythema) was 87% in patients treated with trametinib 
and 13% in chemotherapy -treated patients.  Severe skin toxicity occurred in 12% of 
patients on the trametinib arm, most commonly for secondary infections of the skin  The 
median time to onset of skin toxicity was 15 days (range:  1 to 221 days), and median 
time to  resolution was 48 days (range:  1 to 282 days).  Dose reduction was required in 
12% for skin toxicities, and permanent discontinuation of trametinib was required in 1% 
of patients.  
 
Diarrhea :  At the 2 mg monotherapy dose, 33% to 58% of patients in five trials had 
diarrhea (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  Of ~320 subjects (including crossover subjects) 
with diarrhea at this dose, the majority of diarrhea AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity 
(33% to 56% of all study patients); 17 patients had grade 3 diarrhea, and none had grade 
4 diarrhea.  
 
Visual disorders :  At the 2 mg monotherapy dose, 4% to 21% of the patients in five trials 
experienced visual disorders (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  Of the 85 total subjects 
(including crossover subjects) experiencing visual disorders at this dose level, the

15 
 majority of visual disorders were grades 1 or 2 (4% to 20% of all study patients); six 
patients experienced grade 3 visual disorders, and one patient experienced a grade 4 
visual disorder.  
− Retinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_216679] (RPED) :  Also known as chorioretinopathy, 
RPED is a visual impairment due to fluid accumulation under the retina and causes 
blurry vision.  There were five cases of RPED, previously termed central serous 
retinopathy, reported from the integrated trametinib safety  population consisting of 
subjects treated with trametinib 2 mg once daily from five studies (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2013).  As of [ADDRESS_623343] subjects treated with trametinib either as 
monotherapy or in combination with other anti -cancer agents (including cases from a 
MEK/BRAF combination study).  
 
− Retinal vein occlusion (RVO):   As of 23 June 2013, a total of four cases of RVO were 
reported across the entire trametinib program (including one case from a MEK/BRAF 
combination study) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  All cases of RVO occurred in 
one eye only.  Study drug was stoppe d at time of diagnosis in all cases.  There was a 
decrease of visual acuity in two subjects with central RVO (CRVO) while the other 
two subjects had no meaningful decrease of visual acuity.  In the two subjects with 
CRVO, local  treatment with intravitreal injections of anti -VEGF antibodies was 
initiated within [ADDRESS_623344], at the time of the data 
cutoff.  Three of th ese four cases were considered related to study treatment by [CONTACT_4520].  
 
Hepatic disorders :  Abnormalities of liver enzymes and bilirubin have been observed with 
administration of trametinib (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  However, assessment of 
these cases was often confounded by [CONTACT_3252] -morbid conditions (such as biliary obstruction), 
concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and liver metastases.  At the 2 mg 
monotherapy dose, 8% to 34% of patients in fiv e trials had LFT abnormalities.  Of the 96 
total patients (including crossovers) with LFT changes, the majority were grade 1 or 2 in 
severity (4% to 20% of all study patients); 26 had grade 3 events, and 6 patients had 
grade 4 events.  
 
Cardiac -related AEs :  At the 2 mg monotherapy dose, 3% to 21% of the subjects in six 
studies had cardiac -related AEs (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  Of the 65 total subjects 
(including crossover subjects) experiencing cardiac -related AEs at the 2.0 mg 
monotherapy dose in f ive of the studies, the majority of cardiac -related AEs were grades 
1 or 2 in severity (0% to 16% of all study subjects); [ADDRESS_623345] receiving trametinib 2 mg QD had grade 5 (fatal) acute cardiac fai lure, with 
evidence of massive tumor invasion of the heart; this AE was considered not drug -related 
by [CONTACT_093].

 In the phase 3 trial of trametinib vs. chemotherapy in patients with melanoma 
(MEK114267), cardiomyopathy (defined as cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or 
decreased LVEF) occurred in 7% (14/211) of patients treated with trametinib, and in no 
patients in the chemotherapy arm.  Cardiomyopathy was identified within the first month of 
treatment in five of these 14 patients; median onset of cardiomyopathy was 63 days (range: 
16 to 156 days).  Cardiomyopathy resolved in 10 of these 14 (71%) patients.   Cardiac 
monitoring should be included in trametinib protocols, to include LVEF assessment by 
[CONTACT_377491], one month after initiation of trametinib and 
then at 2 - to 3-month intervals while on treatment.  Refer to dose modificati on guidelines 
for cardiac AEs in the event of LVEF decline or symptomatic cardiac AEs.  
 
Pneumonitis :  At the 2 mg monotherapy dose, 0% to 4% of the subjects in five studies 
had pneumonitis (Investigator’s Brochure, 2013).  Of the nine total subjects (including 
crossovers) experiencing pneumonitis AEs at this dose, three subjects had grade 1 or 2 
pneumon itis and six subjects had grade 3 pneumonitis.  
 
Embryofetal toxicity :  Based on its mechanism of action, trametinib can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman.  Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient 
in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.[ADDRESS_623346] to a fetus.  
 
Incidence of common AEs reported from a phase III trial of trametinib vs. chemotherapy 
in patients with advanced melanoma:  
 
Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or 
current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure ([LOCATION_001] Heart 
Association) were excluded from this trial.  Selected adverse reactions (AR) occurring in 
patients receiving trametinib as compared to patients in the chemotherapy arm are listed

2.[ADDRESS_623347] is activated downstream of the TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion seen in over 90% 
of EHE tumors and pre -clinical studies demonstrated that MEK activation correlates with the 
ability of TAZ -CAMTA1 -expressing cells to grow  as colonies in soft agar or  in suspension. 
Exposure of these cells to either the selective MEK inhibitor PD325901 or trametinib inhibited 
colony formation in agar and in suspension establishing a role of MAP kinase pathway in growth 
and survival of cells dependent on TAZ -CAMTA1 medi ated oncogenesis and MEK as a 
potential tumor -dependent target for therapy. The IC50 for trametinib inhibition of tumor growth 
in vitro was less than 10 nM , which is a therapeutically achievable dose.  
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
2.4.1 Fluorescence In -situ Hybridization  (FISH)  for TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion  
We believe EHE most likely to respond to MEK inhibition are tumors that harbor the 
TAZ-CAMTA1  translocation because MEK activation requires TAZ -CAMTA1 expression 
(see section 2.4.2). In pathology review of tumors that morphologically resembled EHE, 
over 90% of the tumors contained TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion  detected by [CONTACT_4656] ( Tanas et 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]

 al. 2011 ). Therefore, we believe most, if not all, patients enrolled in this trial will have 
tumor that contains TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion. A fusion FISH test has been developed at 
Cleveland Clinic and will be used to evaluate the presence of  the TAZ-CAMTA1  gene 
fusion in tumor from  patients enrolled in the trial. Archival formalin -fixed , paraffin -
embedded  tumor samples will be collected and processed by [CONTACT_485181]. Representative H&E stained sections will be reviewed by [CONTACT_485182] a central review of the diagnosis . Fusion FISH for TAZ-CAMTA1  will be 
performed on unstained sections from diagnostic tissue using the CLIA -certified FISH 
laboratory at Cleveland Clinic after enrollment (See section 9.1). Tumors with at least 
10% fused gene signals will be considered positive for TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion  and 
will be scored as TAZ-CAMTA1  fusion detected. Tumors with less than 10% fused gene 
signals will be scores as TAZ-CAMTA1  fusion not detected. Tumor in which the fusion 
FISH test is not informative for technical reasons  including lack of sufficient tumor tissue 
in the sample/slide  will be scored as test failed .  
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_623348] resulting in a decr ease in the 
level of phosphorylation of ERK. In pre -clinical studies, NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing 
TAZ -CAMTA1 were grown in suspension and the MAPK and PI3K pathways were 
examined. NIH/3T3 cells containing empty vector, which do not proliferate in 
suspe nsion, were used as a control. Phospho -ERK, which is emblematic of MAPK 
pathway activation, was sustained in TAZ -CAMTA 1-expressing cells (7 day -13 day 
lanes) while cells expressing vector alone lost ERK phosphorylation over time (Fig. 1A). 
This suggests that TAZ -CAMTA1 maintained MAPK activation in these cells. In 
contrast, phospho -AKT, a surrogate of PI3K pathway activati on was activated both in 
cells with empty vector and cells expressing TAZ -CAMTA1, suggesting that it was 
MAPK pathway activation and not PI3K activation that was driving proliferation of 
NIH/3T3 -expressing cells in suspension (Fig. 1A). Phospho -ERK has been detected in 
protein lysates of snap -frozen EHE tumor samples (Fig 1B) and in EHE tumor cells by 
[CONTACT_210889] a phospho -specific anti -ERK antibody (Fig 1 C -D). Based 
on these observations, we hypothesize that tumor response to clinically administered 
doses of trametinib will be accompanied by [CONTACT_485183]. Fr esh tumor tissue will be obtained by [CONTACT_485184] [ADDRESS_623349] activation. The analysis will be performed by a research laboratory at 
Cleveland Clinic.

2.4.3 Biomarkers of EHE activity in p atients treated with trametinib  
Plasma CTGF levels may be a useful biomarker of EHE survival as CTGF is a secreted 
protein whose gene is an immediate downstream target of TAZ -CAMTA1 (Tanas et al., 
2016) . CTGF is secreted and binds to αIIbβ3 integrin on the cell surface, leading in an 
autocrine fashion to downstream activation of RAS and MAP kinase pathways. This 
signal transduction pathway drives TAZ -CAMTA1 -mediated NIH/3T3 cell 
transformation. Inhibitio n of any portion of this pathway inhibits transformation. This 
pathway is summarized in Figure 2. Preliminary studies have shown that CTGF is 
produced at high levels and secreted into culture media by [CONTACT_485185] -
CAMTA1.  
 
 
 
CTGF is secreted by [CONTACT_485186] -link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If trametinib results in EHE cell death and 
objective tumor response, we hypothesize that CTGF plasma levels will decline. 
Alternatively, if trametinib blocks growth of EHE by [CONTACT_485187]. 1. MAPK/ERK is activated in EHE. A. NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with either TAZ -CAMTA1 (TC) or empty vector 
(EV) were cultured on HEMA -coated plates, which prevent attachment and so force the cells to grow in suspension. Cell 
lysates were prepared at various time points, fractionated on  PAGE and western blotted with antibodies to total ERK, pERK 
(T202/204), total AKT, pAKT (S473), total S6, and phospho -S6 (S235/236), and actin. Note that at later time points pERK is 
elevated in TC cells while it i s lost in EV cells, suggesting that pERK/MAPK activation is driving proliferation in suspension. B. 
Protein lysates from three different frozen EHE tumor samples from three separate patients were fractionated on PAGE and

 3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
NIH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations be 
included in all NIH -supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving NIH -
defined clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to 
the satisfaction of the funding  Institute & Center  (IC) Director that inclusion is inappropriate 
with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research.  Exclusion under other 
circumstances must be designated by [CONTACT_25513], NIH, upon the recommendation of an  IC 
Director based on a compelling rationale and justification.  Cost is not an acceptable reason for 
exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources.  Women of 
childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.  
Pleas e see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.pdf . 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_485162] . There is no 
known predilection of the disease for a particular race or ethnic background. The study is open to 
eligible males and females of all races and ethnicity and enrollment will not discriminate on the 
basis of race or ethnicity. Because of the ra rity of locally advanced or metastatic EHE and the 
need to complete accrual to the trial in a timely manner, patients will be enrolled as they consent 
and are determined to be  eligible to participate. The study will not target enrollment to meet a 
predefined goal for accrual for any particular gender, race or ethnicity.

4.3 Patient Registration  
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis .  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interchange  
and with  the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data managem ent system, 
Medidata Rave.  
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registrati on and 
treatment information.   Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account ( i.e., CTEP username [CONTACT_2383]).  
• To enroll patients:  Be on an ETCTN Corresponding  or Participating Organization 
roster with the role of Registrar.  
• Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their site.  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS , site staff should verify the following:  
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes.    
• If applicable, all patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form.

consented and begin eligibility screening for enrollment in the study. The RPM may be 
notified by [CONTACT_648]: 734 -930-7600, fax: 734 -930-7557, or email: 
[EMAIL_9337] . The SARC RPM will inform the site if an enrollment slot is 
available based on the total number of patients with TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion positive 
EHE enrolled in the trial. Patients must not be consented until the site has been informed 
that an enrollment slot is available. An enrollment slot will only be opened (made 
available) if a patient enrolled in the trial and started on  trametinib does not have TAZ-
CAMTA1 gene fusion positive EHE  confirmed after testing by [CONTACT_485188]/reference laboratory . After obtaining patient consent, the site should provide  the 
SARC RPM the  date informed consent was obtained, patie nt initials, patient age, and 
whether the patient has agreed to participate in the optional tumor biopsies for research. 
This information will be used by [CONTACT_485189].  
 
4.3.4 OPEN /IWRS Questions?  
 
Further instructional information on OPEN is provided on the OPEN tab of the CTSU 
website at https://www.ctsu.org  or at https://open.ctsu.org .  For any additional questions 
contact [CONTACT_25518] 1 -[PHONE_103] or [EMAIL_013] .  
 
4.4 General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 7 days.  Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does not 
receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study may be 
canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an  outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  No

 emerging data. Patients will be instructed to take the medication at approximately the 
same time each day with a full glass of water. If a dose is missed, the patient will be 
instructed to take it as soon as they remember. If the next scheduled dose is wit hin 12 
hours, they will skip the missed dose. The patient will be requested to maintain a 
medication diary of each dose of medication. The medication diary should be returned to 
and/or reviewed by [CONTACT_485190].

5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Routine supportive care for management of nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, rash and hypertension are 
allowed. Additional supportive care recommendations are provided below in section 6.  
Trametinib is highly bound to plasma proteins (97.3%) and has the potential to interfere with 
other highly protein -bound drugs. Use caution in patients taking concomitant drugs that are 
highly protein -bound and have narrow therapeutic ranges. Trametinib i s an in vitro inhibitor of 
CYP 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and is anticipated to have ove rall low potential for drug interactions. It is 
also a weak CYP 2B6 and 3A4 inducer and expected to have little clinical effect on sensitive 
substrates.  
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 52 cycles  
or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  per RECIST , 
• Clinical progression,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

 • Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
• Pregnancy  
o All women of child bearing potential should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_85214] (e.g., missed 
or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
o The investigator must immediately notify CTEP in the event of a confirmed 
pregnancy in a patient participating in the study.  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
Patients with clinical progression or disease progression per RECIST who are benefitting 
from trametinib in reduction of tumor -related symptoms may continue on treatment 
with trametinib after discussion with the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_485163]. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_623371].  If the patient 
discontinues therapy prior to 24 months, follow -up will continue for 6 months after 
discontinuation or 24 months after initiation of trametinib, whichever is longer. Patients removed 
from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
the adverse event.

6.1.2 Trametinib Dose Modification for Rash  
 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, 2020  
 
 
32 
 Rash is a frequent AE observed in patients receiving trametinib (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2012a).  Recommendations for supportive care and guidelines for dose modifications for 
rash are based on experience with other MEK inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors (Bal agula 
et al. , 2010; Lacouture et al. , 2011).  
 
The institutional standards for the management of skin -related AEs can differ from these 
guidelines.  In this case, best clinical judgment should be applied and a consultation with 
the study chair or the CTEP Medical Monitor may be required.  
 
Guidelines for Supportive Care of Rash  
Type of Care  Action  
Prevention/Prophylaxisa 
 • Avoid unnecessary exposure to sunlight.  
• Apply broad -spectrum sunscreen (containing titanium dioxide or zinc 
oxide) with a skin protection factor (SPF) ≥[ADDRESS_623375] twice daily.  
• Use thick, alcohol -free emollient cream ( e.g., glycerine and cetomacrogol 
cream) on dry areas of the body at least twice daily.  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_190722], 
starting on Day [ADDRESS_623376], and 
upper back.   
• Use mild -strength topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560] (hydrocortisone 1% cream) or topi[INVESTIGATOR_15877] ( e.g., clindamycin) or oral antibiotics ( e.g., doxycycline 100 mg 
BID, minocycline 100 mg BID).  
Symptomatic Careb 
 • Pruritic lesions:  Cool compresses and oral antihistamine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Fissuring lesions:  Monsel’s solution, silver nitrate, or zinc oxide cream.  
• Desquamation:  Thick emollients and mild soap.  
• Paronychia:  Antiseptic bath, local potent corticosteroids in addition to 
antibiotics; if no improvement, consult dermatologist or surgeon.  
• Infected lesions:  Appropriate bacterial/fungal culture -driven systemic or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163].  
a Rash prophylaxis is recommended for the first 6 weeks of study treatment.  
b Patients who develop rash/skin toxicities should be seen by a qualified physician and should receive evaluation 
for symptomatic/supportive care management.

to retinal findings (e.g., retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] (RPED) or retinovascular 
abnormalities (i.e., branch or central retinal vein occlusions [RVO] ).  
 
The ophthalmology exam will include best corrected visual acuity, visual field 
examination, tonometry, slit lamp biomicroscopic examination, and indirect fundoscopy.  
Optical coherence tomography is recommended at scheduled visits and if retinal 
abnormalit ies are suspected.  Other types of ancillary testing including visual field 
examination, fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography may also be indicated as

• A specialist or hepatology  consultation is recommended . 
In patients stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_485168] 2 -6: 
• Repeat LFT and perform liver event follow up assessments within  24 -72 
hrs  
• Monitor subjects weekly until LFTs return to normal/baseline or 
stabilize.  
 
ASSESSMENT and WORKUP:  
• Viral hepatitis serology.4 
• If possible, obtain blood sample for PK analysis.5 
• Serum CPK and LDH.  
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin ≥2x ULN.  
• CBC with differential to assess eosinophilia.  
• Record clinical symptoms of liver injury, or hypersensitivity on AE 
CRF.  
• Record concomitant medications (including acetaminophen, herbal 
remedies, other over the counter medications) . 
• Record alcohol use.  
Additional work up for patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_485168] 1 -2 (with abnormal TB 
and INR, indicating potentially more significant liver toxicities) : 
• Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, Type 1 anti -liver 
kidney microsomal antibodies, and quantitative total immunoglobulin G 
(IgG or gamma globulins).  
• Serum acetaminophen adduct HPLC assay (in subjects with likely 
acetaminophen use in the preceding).  
• If there is underlying chronic hepatitis B (e.g. positive hepatitis B surface 
antigen):  quantitative hepatitis B DNA and hepatitis delta antibody.6 
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, MRI, CT) and /or liver biopsy.  
Footnotes:  
1.  Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation testing 
is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, which indicates direct bilirubin 
elevations and suggesting liver injury.  
2.  All events of ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3x ULN and INR >1.5 (if 
INR measured) may indicate severe liver injury (possible “Hy’s Law”).  INR measurement is not required, and the 
threshold value stated will not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants.  
3.  New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or 
eosinophilia)

5.  PK sample is desired if feasible.  Record the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the 
last dose of study treatment prior to blood sample draw on the CRF. If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, 
provide the subject’s best  approximation. If the date/time of the last dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample 
cannot be collected in the time period indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample.   
6.  If hepatitis delta antibody assay cannot be performed, it can be replaced with a PCR of hepatitis D RNA virus 
(where needed) (Le Gal et al. , 2005).  
 
6.1.6 Trametinib Dose Modification for Pneumonitis

6.1.9 Trametinib Dose Modification for Hypertension  
 
Increases in blood pressure (BP) have been observed in patients receiving trametinib.  
Recommendations for BP monitoring and management are provided below.  
 
Monitoring:  All BP assessments should be performed under the following optimal 
conditions:  
 
The subject has been seated with back support, ensuring that legs are uncrossed and flat 
on the floor.  
The subject is relaxed comfortably for at least [ADDRESS_623387]’s arm is supported so that the middle of the cuff is at heart level.  
The subject remains quiet during the measurement.  
In subjects with an initial BP reading within the hypertensive range, a second reading 
should be taken at least 1 minute later, with the two readings averaged to obtain a final 
BP measurement.  The averaged value should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Persistent hypertension is defined as an increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 
mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mmHg in three consecutive visits with 
blood pressure assessments from two readings as described above.  Visits to monitor  
increased blood pressure can be scheduled independently from the per -protocol visits 
outlined in the study calendar.  Ideally, subsequent blood pressure assessments should be 
performed within 1 week.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2  and 
7.3) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ) in addition  to routine  reporting.

The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited repor ting to NCI via CTEP -AERS (except as noted 
below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification.  Frequency is provided based on 1111  patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
Trametinib ([COMPANY_004]1120212B).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to 
the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to 
determine if expedited reporting is required.

 FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via electronic 
submission within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported  expeditiously  via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported to [EMAIL_9337] .  
 
Indicate form for reporting in Rave, timeframes, and if loading of t he pathology report is 
required – to be determined by [CONTACT_214788].  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified .

 8.1.1 Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide ([COMPANY_004]1120212B) (NSC 763093)  
 
Chemical Name  (IUPAC): equimolecular combination of N-(3-{3-cyclopropyl -5-[(2-
fluoro -4-iodophenyl)amino] -6,8-dimethyl -2,4,7 -trioxo -3,4,6,7 -tetrahydropyrido[4,3 -
d]pyrimidin -1(2H) -yl}phenyl)acetamide with (methylsulfinyl)methane  
 
Other Names:   trametinib, [COMPANY_004]1120212, MEKINIST™, JTP -[ZIP_CODE], JTP -[ZIP_CODE], JTP -
[ZIP_CODE]  
 
CAS Registry Number:   1187431 -43-1 
 
Classification:   MEK inhibitor  
 
Molecular Formula:   C26H23FIN 5O4 • C 2H6OS 
 
M.W.:   693.54 (dimethyl sulfoxide solvate), 615.41 (anhydrous parent)  
 
Approximate Solubility:   Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is almost insoluble in water 
(<0.0001 mg/mL at 25° C)  
 
Mode of Action:   Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is a reversible, highly selective, 
allosteric inhibitor of mitogen -activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) 
and MEK2.  Tumor cells commonly have hyperactivated extracellular signal -related 
kinase (ERK) pathwa ys in which MEK is a critical component.  Trametinib dimethyl 
sulfoxide inhibits activation of MEK by [CONTACT_190777].  
 
Description:   Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is a white to almost white powder.  
 
How Supplied:   [COMPANY_001] supplies and CTEP, NCI, DCTD distributes 0.5 mg and 2 mg 
(as free base) tablets.  Each investigationally -labeled bottle contains 32 tablets.  
The tablet core contains mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, hypromellose, 
croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate (non -animal), colloidal silicon dioxide, and 
sodium lauryl sulfate.  
 
• 0.5 mg tablets are yellow, modified oval, biconvex and film -coated. Aqueous film 
coating consists of hypromellose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, iron oxide 
yellow.  
• 2 mg tablets are pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], round, biconvex and film -coated. Aqueous film coating 
consists of hypromellose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, iron 
oxide red.  
Storage:   Store tablets at 2°C - 8°C in the original bottle  and dispense unopened bottles . 
Do not  open bottles,  repackage tablets or remove desiccant. Bottles should be protected 
from light and moisture.  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return trametinib to 2oC -8oC

51 
 and quarantine the supplies. Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including 
documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
[EMAIL_087]  for determination of suitability.  
 
Stability:   Stability studies are ongoing. Tablets are only stable for 32 days once bottle 
has been opened. If multiple bottles are dispensed to a patient in the same visit, please 
advise the patient to open only one bottle at a time.  
 
Route of Administration:   Oral. Take by [CONTACT_190802], either [ADDRESS_623398] that trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is not a substrate of CYP 
enzymes or of  human  BCRP, MRP2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1 or 
MATE1 transporters. Trametinib elimination by [CONTACT_485192] M5 is 
dependent on carboxylesterases (CES1b, CES1c and CES2). Trametinib is a substrate for 
P-gp and BSEP, but this is not expected to be cli nically relevant due to trametinib’s high 
permeability. .  
 
Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is an in vitro  inhibitor of CYP 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and is 
anticipated to have overall low potential for drug interactions as a perpetrator. It is also a 
weak CYP 2B6 and 3A4 inducer and expected to have little clinical effect on sensitive 
substrates. Trametinib is not an in hibitor of CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B62D6 and 3A4 and not an 
inhibitor of MRP2 or BSEP, but an in vitro inhibitor of P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 and MATE1. No clinically relevant inhibition by 
[CONTACT_485193] a l ow risk of intestinal drug -drug 
interaction is possible with BCRP.  
Trametinib is highly bound to plasma proteins (97.3%) and has the potential to interfere 
with other highly protein -bound drugs. Use caution in patients taking concomitant drugs 
that are highly protein -bound and have narrow therapeutic ranges.  
 
Patient Care Implications  
 
Advise women study participants of reproductive potential to use effective contraception 
while receiving study treatment and for [ADDRESS_623399] dose of trametinib. Refer 
to the protocol document for specific guidance.

9.3 Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative Studies  
 
9.3.1 Plasma Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) Level  
Plasma CTGF levels may be a useful biomarker of EHE survival as CTGF is a secreted 
protein whose gene is an immediate downstream target of TAZ -CAMTA1 (Tanas et al., 
2016) . CTGF is secreted and binds to αIIbβ3 integrin on the cell surface, leading in an 
autocrine fashion to downstream activation of RAS and MAP kinase pathways. This 
signal transduction pathway drives TAZ -CAMTA1 -mediated NIH/3T3 cell 
transformation. Inhibitio n of any portion of this pathway inhibits transformation. 
Preliminary studies have shown that CTGF is produced at high levels and secreted into 
culture media by [CONTACT_485185] -CAMTA1. CTGF is expressed in human EHE as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_14181] -CTGF west ern blot of patient tumor lysates. CTGF is secreted by 
[CONTACT_485195].  Fibrogen 
(San Francisco) has supplied a CTGF -specific monoclonal antibody to CTGF that 
performs well in ELISA.  If trametinib results in EHE cell death and objective tumor 
response, we hypothesize that CTGF plasma levels will decline. Alternatively, if 
trametinib blocks growth of EHE by [CONTACT_485196], we 
expect CTGF plasma levels will remain unc hanged.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collection of Specimen(s)  
Samples (3 -5 mL blood) will be obtained prior to treatment, after 4 weeks and 6 months 
(in patients with stable or better disease) of treatment, at the time of objective tumor 
response and upon determination of EHE radiologic or clinical progression.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Specimens(s)

 within 60 minutes of collection. After collection of blood into collection tubes, the tubes 
should be gently inverted 4 -6 times to ensure proper mixing of blood with EDTA. The 
tubes should be centrifuged at 1,000 – 2,000 x gravity at 4 degrees centigrade f or 15 -20 
minutes to separate plasma. After centrifugation, 1 -2 mL of plasma should be removed 
using a clean pi[INVESTIGATOR_485174] 1.5 mL Eppendorf (or similar) collection vials, 
labeled with the date of collection, patient ID and study ID or similar sp ecimen tracking 
information and immediately frozen at -80oC. Specimens should be stored frozen at -

In pre -clinical studies, NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing the TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion 
were grown in suspension and the MAPK pathway was examined. NIH/3T3 cells 
containing empty vector were used as control. Phospho -ERK, which is emblematic of 
MAPK pathway activation was sustained in TAZ -CAMTA1 expressing cells while cells 
expres sing vector alone lost ERK phosphorylation over time. This suggests that TAZ -
CAMTA1 maintained MAPK a ctivation. Furthermore, phospho -ERK has been detected 
in protein lysates of snap -frozen EHE tumo r samples and localized phospho -ERK in EHE 
tumor cells by [CONTACT_485197] a phospho -specific anti -ERK antibody which 
demonstrated strong activation specifically in tumor cells. We hypothesize that tumor 
responses to clinically administered doses of trametinib will be accompanied by

 semi -quantitative imm unohistochemistry using phospho -ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) -specific 
antibody (Cell Signaling #4370) and quantitative immunochemistry by [CONTACT_485200]. If ERK is 
no longer suppressed in tumor progression, MEK 1/2 will be sequenced to identify 
genetic mechanisms of resistance. Frozen tumor tissue will be reserved for primarily for 
protein studies of intracellular protein kinase signaling studies, if needed. For example, i f 
IHC suggests that ERK is inhibited, then the snap frozen tissue will be used to m ake 
protein lysates for phospho -proteomic arrays (R&D systems)  which will provide a panel 
of anti -phospho -protein antibodies targeting proteins involved in a variety of intracellular 
signaling pathways to identify activation of alternative signaling pathways that 
mechanistically could drive progression.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collection of Specimens  
Optional t umor biopsy will be performed prior to starting trametinib and after 
approximately 4 weeks of trametinib treatment (+/ - 7 days) , and upon progression in 
patients who previously had objective tumor response . It is encouraged that biopsies be 
performed to collect tumor tissue for correlative research studies to evaluate the effect of 
trametinib on MEK signaling. Patients will be provided the option of participating in 
biopsy of tumor prior to treatment an on tr eatment with trametinib. If treatment i s 
interrupted in a patient, the biopsy should be delayed until drug is restarted and taken 
daily for at least [ADDRESS_623404] (optimal cutting temperature) compound and fro zen at -80 
degrees Celsius . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Specimens  
Paraffin -embedded samples should be labeled with date of biopsy, subject ID and Study 
ID and kept at ambient temperature. Tissue frozen in liquid nitrogen should be kept 
frozen in an Eppendorf (or similar) clean collection vial labeled with the date of biopsy, 
subject ID and study ID and stored at -80 degrees Celsius until shipped t o Cleveland 
Clinic on dry ice.

NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, [ADDRESS_623410] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated  for response every 8 weeks (± 7 
days) for the first 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks (± 7 days).   In addition to a baseline scan, 
confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 to 8 weeks following initial documentation of 
objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST  1.1) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_623411] their 
response classified accor ding to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target dise ase.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_623412] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 c m) 
by [CONTACT_13190] x -ray or as ≥10 mm  (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by [CONTACT_461].  
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will be considered 
measurable  only if demonstration of progression of the lesion has occurred following 
radiation . 
 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, [ADDRESS_623413] be ≥15 mm  (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm  [0.5 cm] ) or MRI .  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm  [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm  [≥1 
to <1 .5 cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
[CONTACT_462]), are considered  as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection  as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeat ed 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion d oes not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesion s will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumo r regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, 2020  
 
 
63 
 beginning of treatment and never more than 30 days  before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being  
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions .  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm  (≥1 cm)  diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI .  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm  (0.5 cm)  or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used  at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of  scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT.  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identic al diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note,  however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, [ADDRESS_623414] in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy .  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following c omplete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers .  Tumor markers are not available for EHE and  cannot be used to assess 
response.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm (<1 cm) . 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstr ate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  (0.5 cm) .  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm  
[<1 cm]  short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, 2020  
 
 
65 
  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investiga tor). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since  the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

enrollment and response to treatment with trametinib will be electronically sent  via 
TRIAD  to IROC Rhode Island (QARC) . Digital images will be transferred to [CONTACT_485210] at Columbia University for review and independent assessment of 
tumor response. The decision to continue a patient on treatment with trametinib will be 
based on the treating investigator or site  assessment of tumor response.

12.5 Genomic Data Sharing Plan  
 
Not applicable.  
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint is the objective response rate using RECIST 1.1. Tumor response assessed 
by [CONTACT_485203]. Tumor 
response will be centrally reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lawrence Schwartz but the local site assessment will 
be used to determine patient treatment and tumor response outcome.  
 
A Simon minimax sampling two -stage design will be used to estimate the objective response rate 
with a goal of at least 20% of patients to be considered as having preliminary evidence of 
activity and less than 5% indicating that trametinib is ineffective as  a potential EHE treatment. 
Thirteen patients with EHE will be enrolled in stage I, and if there is at least one objective 
response as defined by [CONTACT_393]  1.1, additional patients with EHE will be enrolled  until [ADDRESS_623426] activity in EHE. With a type 1 error of 5%, this design will have a power 
of approxima tely 80% and will have a 51% probability of terminating after the first step if the 
response rate is 5%. The ORR, 6 -month PFS and 2 -year OS rates will be calculated along with 
their 95% confidence intervals. PFS and OS will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier  method.

 In stage I enrollment, the presence of TAZ-CAMTA1  translocation was not detected in 3 tumor 
samples and in one case there was insufficient tumor tissue available for the analysis. The rate of 
TAZ-CAMTA1  translocation negative EHE is higher than the expected rate of less than 10%, and 
because we anticipate activation of the MAP kinase pathway to occur in tumor with expression 
of TAZ -CAMTA1 but not in tumor without the translocation, the protocol is amende d to enroll 
at least [ADDRESS_623427] dose of study medication to 
occurrence of radiologic tumor progression per RECIST1.1, clinical progression based on 
treating physician’s assessment or death from any cause. Overall survival will be calculated from 
the time of first dose of study drug to occurrence of death from any cause. Patient s who are 
registered and are determined to be eligible for study treatment but do not start study drug will be 
replaced. All patients who receive study drug for any period of time will be evaluable for 
toxicity. The rates of adverse events occurring in at least 5% of subjects and rates of grade 3 -5 
adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_485204] (CTCAE). For dose adjustment schedule see Section 6.1. PROMIS 
questionnaires will be scored according to recommended standardized system and t -scores 
generated. A mixed model will be used to analyze change in t -scores over time. Whether or not 
having evidence of disease progression will be used as a time -depen dent variable in the mixed 
model with adjustment of other potential confounding variables.  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
This study will be conducted in a two -stage process. In stage I, [ADDRESS_623428] been 
enrolled and started treatment, enrollment of additional patients will be held until FISH testing is 
performed on available tissue from the enrolled patients. One enrollment slot will be opened for 
each case of FISH result of TAZ-CAMTA1  translocation “not detected”, “test failed”, or “test not 
performed” (no tumor tissue in sample) until a total of [ADDRESS_623429] enrolled and started 
treatment with FISH result of TAZ-CAMTA1  translocation “detected”. Enrollment in the second 
stage will be held until at least [ADDRESS_623430] enrollment based on sex, race or ethnicity in order to complete accrual within 2 -3 
years.

13.3 Stratification Factors  
None.  
 
13.4 Analysis of Exploratory  Endpoints  
 
Exploratory correlative studies will evaluate  rates of EHE growth  prior to starting trametinib to 
growth rates on treatment , the change in c -reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
(ESR), plasma connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and tumor volume as potential 
biomarkers of EHE activity, and the effect of trametinib on MAP kinase activation.  
 
Digital files of cross -sectional radiology images (CT and MRI) will be provided to Lawrence 
Schwartz (Columbia University, NY) to evaluate the change in rate of EHE growth pre -
trametinib therapy  and on trametinib . Evidence of tumor progression per RECIST will be 
required for enrollment of patients (except in setting of severe tumor -related pain); therefore, 
longitudinal pre -treatment radiology images will be available in the majority of cases for 
comparison. A 50%  or more reduction in the change in tumor size/unit of time following start of 
treatment with trametinib will be considered clinically significant. McNemar test will be used to 
compare the number of patients with EHE progression prior to starting trametinib to the number 
NCI Protocol #:  [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date:  June 23, [ADDRESS_623431] will be 
summarized with a scatterplot. The Pearson correlation coefficient (or Spearman, if more 
appropriate) will be assessed to determine the strength of the agreement. Agreemen t of the tumor 
classifications (response versus no response) will be summarized as the raw agreement and with 
a Kappa Statistic. The association of the change in tumor volume with survival will be evaluated 
in two ways. The first will be to use the change in tumor volume as a time dependent variable in 
a Cox model. The second will be a landmark analysis (done a t either the first radiographic 
assessment or at the second radiographic assessment) to compare the survival of patients 
classified as a responder (based on tumor volume) to those who have not responded by [CONTACT_485205]. Patients who died prior  to the landmark time point will be omitted from 
analysis.  
 
Evaluation of MAP kinase activation is an  exploratory analysis on relatively few samples. In 
another multicenter SARC phase II clinical trial (SARC028) that required paired pre -treatment 
and on -treatment tumor biopsy, matched samples were obtained in 75% of the cases and tumor 
biopsy was performe d in about 50% of patients at the time of progression. We estimate a similar 
success rate in obtaining matched tumor tissue. Descriptive statistics will be generated, and 
estimates for the proportion of samples with  demonstrated inhibition of MAPK signaling post -
treatment compared to pre -treatment will be generated along with 95% confidence intervals. 
Likewise, the proportion of patients with demonstrated MAPK signaling inhibition at time of 
disease progression will be determined with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.  These 
are exploratory analyses and all available data will be used.  
 
Evaluation of presence of TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion will be performed by [CONTACT_4656]. Tumor in 
which at least 10% of nuclei are scored as having a fused signal will be counted as EHE with 
presence of TAZ-CAMTA1  translocation. The number and percent of TAZ-CAMTA1  gene fusion 
positive EHE will be reported.  
 
13.5 For phase 2 protocols only: Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_623432] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be

 assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria and took at least [ADDRESS_623433] a treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an 
incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the 
analysis of the response rate.

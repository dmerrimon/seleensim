CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  13 4. STUDY D ESIGN 
This is a phase 2, randomized, active -controlled, double -blinded, multi -site study to assess the 
safety and immunogenicity of BioThrax and AV7909 using a PEP dosing regimen in adults 
≥66 years of age in stable health.  The safety and immunogenicity profile of BioThrax and 
AV7909 in adults ≥66 years of age will also be compared to the safety and immunogenicity 
profile of subjects 18 through 50 years of age in stable health.  The main study goal is to 
determine optimal dosing for AV7909.   
Approximately 300 male and nonpregnant female adults (200 aged ≥66 years and 100 aged 18 
through 50 years, inclusive) will be enrolled in the study.    
After screening,  subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
will be randomized to receive either BioThrax or AV7909.  Randomizatio n will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_11651] (18 -50, 66 -74, and ≥75  years) .  Subjects ≥66 years of age will be randomized 1:1:1:1 
within stratum across 4  treatment arms  (approximately 50 subjects per group) , and subjects 18  
through 50 years of age will be randomized 1:1 within stratum across 2 treatment  arms 
(approximately 50 subjects per group) as specified in Table  1.  Once randomized, subjects will 
receive 3 IP administrations , each separated by [CONTACT_3450] 14 days, on Day 1, Day  15, and 
Day 29, based on their assigned treatment arm.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  14 4.1. Sample Size Justification  
The sample size for this study is approximately 300 subjects: 200 subjects ≥66 years of age 
(older cohort) and 100  subjects 18 through 50 years of age (younger cohort).  Approximately 
[ADDRESS_1270244].   
Probabilities of detecting a safety event were calculated using the binomial distribution 
(Table 2) .

A lower bound of 40% is considered to be a meaningful threshold of success for the 
seroprotection rate for BioThrax1.  Assuming a one-sided alpha level of 0.025, an exact 
binomial test was used to calculate the power to detect the lower bound of an exact 95% 
confidence interval (C I) about an observed seroprotection rate being ≥40%, using sample size 
and 
hypothetical true seroprotection rate scenarios shown in Table 3.

SAP: BP -C-[ADDRESS_1270248] Data Listing 
Considerations  
The following analyses and reporting conventions will be used:  
 Categorical variables will be summarized using counts (n) and percentages (%) and will 
be presented in the form “n (%).”  Percentages will be rounded to one decimal place.  If 
n=0, then no percent will be shown.  To ensure completeness, all summaries for 
categorical and discrete variables will include all categories, even if none of the subjects 
had a response in a particular category.  
 Numeric variables will be summarized using n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum (min), maximum (max).  The min /max will be reported at the same level of 
significance as original data.  The mean and median will be reported at one more 
significant digit than the precision of the data, and SD will be reported at two more 
significant digits than the precision of the d ata. 
 The median will be reported as the average of the two middle numbers if the dataset 
contains an even number of observations.  
 Test statistics including t, z and F test statistics will be reported to two decimal places.  
 P-values will be reported to thre e decimal places if greater than or equal to 0.001.  If less 
than 0.001, the value will be reported as “<0.001.”  
 All tables, listings, and figures will be presented in landscape orientation.  
 Courier New 8-point  font will be used for all tables and listing s. 
 Dates will be displayed as ddmmmyyyy (e.g., 24Jan2017).  
If departures from these general conventions are present in the specific evaluations section of this 
SAP, then those conventions will take precedence o ver these general conventions.  
Tables, listi ngs, and figure s will include all study groups.  
Study groups will be presented in unblinded reports as shown below:  
 Study Group 1: Age ≥66 Arm 1  
 Study Group 2: Age ≥66 Arm 2  
 Study Group 3: Age ≥66 Arm 3  
 Study Group 4: Age ≥66 Arm 4  
 Study Group 5: Age 18 -50 Arm 1  
 Study Group 6: Age 18 -50 Arm 3  
Arms 1 through 4 will be defined in the footnotes of the displays.

    7.1.1. Imputation of Missing Data  
There will be no methods of imputation used for missing data for the summaries or analyses of 
the primary and secondary endp oints.   No imputation will be implemented for safety  or 
immunogenicity  endpoint analys es.  
7.2. Calculations Using Dates  
Study days for dates on or after Visit 1 (Day 1) will be calculated as:  
𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑦  𝐷𝑎𝑦 =𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 −𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡  1 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 +1 
For dates prior to Visit 1 (Day 1), study days will be calculated as:  
𝑆𝑡𝑢𝑑𝑦  𝐷𝑎𝑦 =𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 −𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡  1 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒  
Total duration  is calculated as:  
𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝐸𝑛𝑑  𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 −𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡  𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑒 +1 
Age (years) for randomized subjects at the time  of Visit 1 (Day 1) will be calculated as an integer

7.3. Baseline 
For data collected at both Screening and Visit 1 (Day 1) pre -IP administration, the baseline  data 
will be defined as the latest non -missing value collected.  Otherwise, if data are collected at only 
one of Screening or  Visit 1 (Day 1), the collected value will be considered  the baseline  value for 
analyses . 
7.3.1. Visit Windows Relative to the First Dose of Study Medication  
The visit schedule and allowable visit windows are provided in Table  4.  Relative target days and 
visit windows are generally based on the timing of Visit 1 (Day 1).  Visits occurring within 
[ADDRESS_1270249] IP administration are show n with both relative target days and visit 
windows based on Visit 1 (Day 1) and relative target days and visit windows depending on the 
actual IP administration day (in parentheses).  Similarly, the Visit 13 relative target day and visit 
windows are based o n both Visit 1 (Day 1) and on the actual date of the 3rd IP administration.  
For these visits, if an applicable IP administration does not occur, the relative target day and visit 
window will be based on the date of the 1st IP administration at Visit 1 (Da y 1).

7.4. Analysis Populations  
7.4.1. Screen Failures  
A screen failure  is defined as any subject who  gives written informed consent but is not 
randomized  at Visit 1 (Day 1) .  In addition, all subjects who are screened and found eligible but 
are not randomized will be considered screen failures.  Besides reporting the reasons for not 
meeting inclusion/exc lusion criteria, screen failures will not be included in any other analyses.  
7.4.2. Randomized Population  
The randomized population will include all subjects who are randomized into the study, 
regardless of actually receiving an  IP dose. Each subject will be anal yzed as part of the study arm 
assigned/age group combination. If any subjects of age 18 -50 years are randomized in error to 
either arm 2 or arm 4  (due to randomization into the stratum for age ≥66 years) , those subjects 
will be included with the study group of subjects  age ≥ [ADDRESS_1270251] dose.  If any 
subjects of age 18 -50 yea rs are randomized in error to either arm 2 or arm 4  (due to 
randomization into the stratum for age ≥66 years) , those subjects will be included with the study 
group of subjects age ≥66 years that corresponds to the randomized arm. The safety population 
will be used for all safety analyses.  
7.4.4. Immunogenicity Full Analysis  Population  
The immunogenicity full analysis population (IFAP) will include all subjects who are 
randomized, receive d at least one IP dose, and have at least one determinate assay result at any 
post-vaccination  visit.  Each subject will be analyzed as part of the treatment and dosing 
schedule actually received, regardless of the treatment arm assignment.  If any subjects of age 
18-50 years are randomized in error to either arm 2 or arm 4  (due to randomization into the 
stratum for age ≥66 years) , those subjects will be included with the study group of subjects age 
≥66 years that corresponds to the randomized arm. The IFAP will be used only for analysis of 
seroprotection based on TNA NF 50 antibody l evels at Day 64 as a secondary analys is.

    12. IMMUNOGENICITY  
12.1. General Considerations  
All primary , secondary  and exploratory  immunogenicity analyses  will be performed on the IPPP  
and MIPPP separately , and the IFAP will be used only for the primary immunogenicity endpoint 
summaries  as a secondary analysis . 
Since all hypothesis tests are performed as part of the secondary analyses , all statistical 
inferences of immunogenicity endpoints are considered exploratory in nature, including 
unadjusted 95% CIs and unadjusted p-values as appropriate.  
No formal statistical analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints will be adjusted by s ite or 
any other covariates .  Exploratory analyses may use site as a covariate in models, in addition to 
other covariates that are deemed appropriate.  
12.2. Statement of the Null and Alternate Hypotheses  
There are no comparisons or hypotheses involved in the pri mary immunogenicity objective.  
As supportive analyses of the primary immunogenicity objective, the specified success criterion 
for TNA NF 50 antibody levels is that the 95% lower bound CI about the seroprotection rate 
(SPR) is greater than 40%.  The followi ng null hypothesis will be tested within each study group , 
combined age group,  combined treatment arm , and overall : 
1. Ho: SPR based on TNA NF 50 antibody levels at Day 64 is less than or equal to 40%  
Ha: SPR based on TNA NF 50 antibody levels at Day 64 is greater than 40%  
For secondary objectives comparing antibody levels in a pairwise fashion between  study  groups, 
the following null hypotheses will be tested for each pairwise  comparison at each timepoint 
where immunogenicity d ata are collected : 
1. Ho: SPR based on TNA NF 50 antibody levels in both groups are equal  
Ha: SPR based on TNA NF 50 antibody levels differ between groups  
2. Ho: seroconversion rate (SCR) based on TNA NF 50 antibody levels in both groups are 
equal  
Ha: SCR based on TNA NF 50 antibody levels differ between groups  
3. Ho: SCR based on TNA ED 50 antibody levels in both groups are equal  
Ha: SCR based on TNA ED 50 antibody levels differ between groups  
4. Ho: SCR based on ELISA anti -PA IgG antibody levels in both groups are equa l  
Ha: SCR based on ELISA anti -PA IgG antibody levels differ between groups  
5. Ho: TNA NF 50 antibody levels in both groups are equal  
Ha: TNA NF 50 antibody levels differ between groups  
6. Ho: TNA ED 50 antibody levels in both groups are equal  
Ha: TNA ED 50 antibo dy levels differ between groups

12.3. Subgroup Analyses  
No subgroup  analysis is planned . 
12.4. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
For all hyp othesis tests, significance will be declared at the two -sided α=0.05 level.  Due to the 
exploratory nature of secondary analyses, no adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  
12.5. Analysis of the Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint  
The primary immunogenicity endpoint for this study is seroprotection at Day 64 based on TNA 
NF 50 antibody levels.  Seroprotection is defined as TNA NF 50 antibody ≥0.56.  
The primary analysis for this endpoint is descriptive.  The following summary statistics will be 
displayed:  
 count of subjects with non -missing data at the visit  
 count of subjects meeting criteria for seroprotection  
 proportion of subjects meeting criteria for seroprotection  
 95% exact (Clopper -Pearson) CI corre sponding to the seroprotection rate  
In addition, SPRs and corresponding 95% CIs will be displayed graphically by [CONTACT_904895] 64.  
The supportive analysis of the primary immunogenicity objective will be analyzed using a 
one-sided one-proportion z-test. 
P-values for the supportive analysis will be displayed.  
If more than 10% of subjects in the IPPP population are seroprotected at Visit 1 (Day 1) based on 
TNA NF 50 antibody levels, sensitivity analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_904896] 1 (Day 1).  
12.6. Analysis of the Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints  
All secondary immunogenicity endpoints are listed below and will be analyzed according to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  (antibody level endpoints)  or Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (seroprotection and 
seroconversion endpoints) .

12.6.1. Presentation of the Secondary Immunogenicity Results  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Antibody Levels  
Each secondary immunogenicity endpoint measuring TNA N F50, TNA ED 50 and ELISA anti -PA 
IgG antibody levels will be summarized similarly.   
Antibody levels with a value  that is less than LLOQ will be imputed for antibody level analyses 
as ½ LLOQ . 
The following summary statistics will be displayed by [CONTACT_725155]:  
• count of subjects with non -missing data at the visit  
• geometric mean (GM) antibody levels and corresponding geometric standard deviation  
(SD)   
• back -transformed 95% CI based on the t distribution about the GM antibody level  
• minimum and maximum values  
• median , and 1st and 3rd quartile values  
Study group summaries of GM antibody levels for TNA NF 50, TNA ED 50 and ELISA anti -PA 
IgG antibody levels by [CONTACT_904897] 10 scale with corresponding 95% CIs.  The 
reverse cumulativ e distributions of GM antibody levels for TNA NF 50, TNA ED 50 and ELISA 
anti-PA IgG antibodies at Visit 10 (Day 64) will also be plotted.  
Hypotheses concerning the immunogenicity antibody levels will be tested using pairwise t-tests 
on log 10 transformed ant ibody levels, and p-values, geometric mean ratios , and back -transformed 
95% CIs of the difference in log 10 antibody levels will be displayed.

     proportion of subjects meeting criteria for seroprotection or seroconversion  
 95% exact (Clopper -Pearson) CI corresponding to the seroprotection or seroconversion 
rate 
Hypothes es concerning the primary immunogenicity endpoint ( seroprotection rate at day 64) will 
be tested with a one -sample binomial test.  
Hypothes es concerning the comparison of SPR and SCR between different groups will be tested 
with a Fisher’s exact test  using the IPPP and MIPPP .  Risk differences of comparisons will be 
displayed with  corresponding 95% exact unconditional  CIs (based on the Santner and Snell 
method)  and p-values  (based on two -sided Fisher’s exact test) . 
A data listing of antibody levels will be prepared, which will include seroprotection (for TNA 
NF 50 antibody levels only) and seroconversion status (for TNA NF 50, TNA ED 50 and ELISA 
anti-PA IgG antibody levels separately) at each applicable visit.  
12.7. Analysis of the Exploratory Immunogenicity Endpoints  
12.7.1. Antibody level correlations  
Correlations between 1) TNA NF 50 and ELISA anti -PA IgG antibody levels and 2)  TNA ED 50 
and ELISA anti -PA IgG antibody levels will be calculated at Visit 10 (Day 64) .  Pairwise scatter 
plots  on the log 10 scale with regression lines will be created.  The Pearson correlation coefficie nt 
will be presented with corresponding p-value.  This analysis will be performed on the IPPP  and 
MIPPP . 
12.7.2. Additional pairwise comparisons  
The following pairwise  comparisons  of TNA NF 50 antibody levels  and seroprotection rates  will 
be performed at the given visit using the hypothesis testing methodology stated  in Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] : 
1. Group  1 vs. combined Group s 2 and 3 at Day 29  
2. Group  1 vs. Group 3 at Day 64  
3. Group  1 vs. Group 4 at Day 64  
4. Group 5 vs. Group 6 at Day 29 
5. Group  5 vs. Group 6  at Day 64

All AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT), according to 
MedDRA .  For solicited reactogenicity symptoms of injection site tenderness,  the low level term 
will be used instead of preferred term to distinguish these symptoms from injection site pain, as 
HHS/ASPR/ BARDA   BioThrax and AV7909  
SAP: BP -C-[ADDRESS_1270260] severity.  
13.2.1. Summaries of Adverse Event Incidence Rates for All Subjects 
Separate summaries of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity  symptoms and unsolicited AEs 
will be prepared for  the following:  
 combined dose 1, dose 2 and dose 3 (start dates occurring in the periods of Day 1 through 
8, Day 15 through Day 22, and Day 29 through 36)  
 dose 1 only (start dates occurring in the period of  Day 1 through 8)  
 dose 2 only (start dates occurring in the p eriod of Day 15 through 22)  
 dose 3 only (start dates occurring in t he period of Day 29 through 36)  
AEs beginning after  the 1st IP administration on Day [ADDRESS_1270261] had more than one AE in a SOC (or AE 
type, if applicable), the subject is counted only once in that SOC (or AE type)  according to the 
highest seve rity rating (in order, mild  [grade 1] , moderate  [grade 2] , or severe  [grades 3, 4 and 
5]).  If the severity of the AE is not reported, then the severity of the AE will be counted as 
unknown.   The summary tables will include incidence estimates for overall SOC (or AE type) as 
well as for PTs within each SOC (or AE type).  Incidence will be presented  alphabetically  by 
[CONTACT_2946] (or AE type) and then by [CONTACT_904901] (or AE type) by [CONTACT_904902].  
The investigator is to re cord their opi[INVESTIGATOR_904879] ( “not related ”, 
“unlikely related ”, “possibly related ”, “probably related ” and “related ”).  If a subject experiences 
the same AE multiple times, the event with the strongest relationship to IP will be counted.  For 
summaries of IP -related AEs, the categories of “possibly related ”, “probably related ” and 
“related ” will be considered IP -related.  I f the relationship is missing, it will be counted as 
“related ” in summaries.  
Day of onset relative to the most recent IP administration will be dichotomized for summaries as 
≤[ADDRESS_1270262] IP administration and ≥[ADDRESS_1270263] experiences the 
HHS/ASPR/ BARDA   BioThrax and AV7909  
SAP: BP -C-[ADDRESS_1270264] start date to IP 
administration will be counted.  
Solicited local reactogenicity symp toms and solicited systemic reactogenicity symptoms will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_904903] 95% exact ( Clopper -Pearson) CIs for dose 1, dose [ADDRESS_1270265] 
relationship to IP in the same method as described above.  
Unsolicited adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_904903] 95% exact (Clopper -
Pearson) CIs for dose 1, dose [ADDRESS_1270266]  in chronological order including ID, age, race, sex, 
and all related event status information (start and stop dates, whether the event was resolved , 
study day of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to IP, action taken with IP, and outcome). 
Separate flags will be displayed for solicited local reactoge nicity symptoms, solicited systemic 
reactogenicity symptoms, SAEs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279], MAAEs, unsolicited AEs, deaths, AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation, and AEs leading to subject study withdrawal.  Additionally, a coding 
list of PTs and the verbatim text asso ciated with them will be produced.  
SAEs, MAAEs and PI[INVESTIGATOR_904880] .

    15. MAINTAINING THE BLIND 
For all analyses requiring unblinded data from study start through the Day 394 analysis for the 
final CSR, a blinded programming team consisting of programmers and statisticians will perform 
all programming tasks (including SDTM datasets, ADaM  datasets, ta bles, listings , and figures) 
and all associated validation tasks using dummy study groups, which will be randomly assigned.  
After validation of datasets and displays using dummy study groups, an unblinded team of a 
statistician and a programmer will gener ate, interpret and report each analysis using appropriate 
study groups and will not modify any programs used to perform analyses.   
Any necessary modification of programs due to incorrect coding will be communicated from the 
unblinded team to the blinded t eam so that the blinded team can modify the coding while being 
blinded to study groups, after which the unblinded team will then rerun analyses using unblinded 
data.  This process is continued until the unblinded team ensures all data issues have been 
resolved.  
15.1. Immunogenicity Data  
Immunogenicity data of TNA NF 50, TNA ED [ADDRESS_1270276] ID assignments will be used for all unblinded analyses and 
will only be viewable by [CONTACT_904907].

    16. INTERIM ANALYSES  
An interim analysis w ill be performed based on cumulative immunogenicity and safety data 
through Visit 10 (Day 64) for all subjects.   At the interim analysis, the study database (all data 
through Visit 10 [Day 64]) will be monitored and cleaned per the Data Management Plan.  
The blinding at the subject level will be maintained for those outside of the unblinded team until 
database lock of all data through Day [ADDRESS_1270277] 
level  will be maintained for the interim analysis as specifi ed in Section 15. 
All primary and secondary endpoint analyses will be performed for the interim analysis as 
specified in Section s 12.6 and 12.7 (for immunogenicity analyses) and Sections 13.4.4  and 
13.4.5  (for safety analyses) .  Additional analyses included in the interim analysi s, such as subject 
disposition and demographics, will be performed based on Sections  10 and 11.  Exploratory 
immunogenicity analyses will also be included in the interim analysis.  
In order to prevent unblinding of any individual subjects, tabular summaries of data will exclude 
extreme v alues (minimum and maximum).  Listings will not be included in the interim analysis 
package.  Immunogenicity tables and figures will report study group and pooled group statistics 
and counts. AE  tables will not report study group specific counts, but will i nstead report the 
overall totals and totals by [CONTACT_551].  As such AE tables will remain blinded, even at the group 
level. All remaining tables included in the interim analysis that may have small counts will not 
report study group specific counts for appli cable variables.    
The unblinded statistician will be responsible for reporting interim results to  Biomedical 
Advanced Research and Development Authority  (BARDA ). 
Since all active subjects will have completed Visit 10 (Day 64) and this timepoint is of prim ary 
interest , there will be no penalty for an early look at the data.  In addition, no decisions regarding 
the status of the study will be made as a result of the interim analysis.  
The interim analysis tables and figures will be a subset of the final table s and figures included in 
the CSR. At the time of the final analysis  for the CSR , all tables  and figures generated as part of  
the interim analysis will be regenerated to include da ta through the end of the study.

    17. SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE MEETINGS  
The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will perform a planned review of interim safety data 
after 40 subjects ≥[ADDRESS_1270278] completed Visit 7 (Day 36).  Enrollment and dosing will 
continue during this planned SMC review.  In addition, ad hoc reviews wil l occur in the event 
that pausing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_904883] a review is deem ed necessary by [CONTACT_904908].  
Following the planned interim analysis (described in Section 16), a final set of SMC data 
displays will be  provided to the SMC members.   These displays will be of the same format as 
provided for the planned SMC data review but will be run on the clean and frozen data from the 
interim analysis . 
The bl ind will be maintained for all blinded individuals according to Section 15.  The unblinded 
statistician will be responsible for presenting data to the SMC.  Safety analyses for SMC review 
will be completed using the safety population.   
Refer to the SMC Charter for more details of the SMC procedures and reporting.

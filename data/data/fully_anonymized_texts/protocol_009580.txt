I
n lieu of an Administrative Protocol Clarification Letter to respond to requests from the various 
participating sites’ additional questions, it was elected to proceed with this administrative 
amendment to provide improved readability and clarity to ensure proper conduct of the study. 
Material  change made  (page #s are for 
Protocol V1.1)  Rationale  
P7, P40 (Section 8.1.3), P53 (Section 
10.2.1): Multimodal analgesia – reduced 
the number of doses of ketorolac and 
acetaminophen allowed by [CONTACT_536058] [ADDRESS_697759] of the study.  
Administrative changes made  Rationale /Clarification  
P3: added additional names and contact 
[CONTACT_536059][INVESTIGATOR_141466]  n/a 
P8 (Synopsis) , P42 (Section 8.1.4): 
clarification on outpatient multimodal 
analgesia dosing and timing of the 12h 
period before discharge triggering the 
potential need for a [ADDRESS_697760] requires opi[INVESTIGATOR_536018] T84h 
regardless of the time of discharge this  triggers the need for a 
prescription for oxycodone .  Refills are per investigator discretion.  
P11 (Synopsis), P49: clarification of 
Exclusion criteri on 4d to allow antibiotics 
for treatment if necessary after surgery 
to treat an AE; 4e refers to steroid 
inhaler for allergy treatment  If the investigator feels that antibiotics are appropriate treatment 
for an AE this should be done  and should not automat ically trigger 
an ET .  Antibiotic prophylaxis is allowed is routinely performed per 
site standard of care.  
Language was added to include the use of steroid inhaler for 
treatment of asthma as well.  
P11 (Exclusion 6.a), P49 (Exclusion 6.a ), 
P61 (Section 11.5.2): clarification on 
positive drug screen  There is the potential for confusion with Exclusion 6.a and language 
on P61: “If any of these tests are positive (note exception for THC 
below  [referring to Exclusion criterion 6.a] ), the subject  will not be 
allowed further participation.”    
Added explanatory note to this exclusion criterion.  It may be 
permissible for the subject to participate if the results can be 
explained by a current prescription or acceptable over -the-counter 
medication as determined by [CONTACT_109481], and/or 
prior to surgery.  
P13 (Synopsis), P58 (Section 11.4.1): 
clarification on guidelines for 
“ambulation”  In the immediate postoperative period, partial weightbearing on 
transfers to/from bed/wheelchair may b e all that is appropriate for 
“ambulation”.  Once closer to discharge from the inpatient facility 
and during the outpatient period, subjects should be instructed to 
walk about 10 yards to assess pain with “ambulation”.  
P14(Synopsis), P20 (Schedule of Even ts): 
clarification on timing of specific protocol 
assessments  The physical examination, neurosensory examination and surgical 
site assessment need not be collected at 24h  after study treatment 
injection .   
Clinical laboratory tests should be collected at s creening and 96h.

DENTIAL       Page 5 of 98 Urinalysis is performed only at screening and 96h.   
No need for repeat screening labs on day 0 (surgery day) unless it 
was not performed during screening.   
Daily temps can be recorded along with vital signs per site SOPs at 
1, 2, 4, 6 , 12, 24, and every 8 h thereafter until discharge from the 
inpatient facility (if awake at the time of assessment between hours 
of midnight and 6 a.m.)  
P14 (Synopsis): clarification on time 
windows  Lab collection window for 24h and 96h are ±30 min.  Neur osensory 
examination at 96h is ±4 h, but prior to discharge from the inpatient 
facility.  
P14 (Synopsis): clarification on 
coagulation tests  These tests are not required.  
P20 (Schedule of Events), P62 (Section 
11.5.6): clarification on subject weights  Weight assessments are not needed on day 15 and 29, or day 36 if 
this visit is necessary.  
P38 ( Section 8.1 ); regarding timing of 
enrollment of PK subjects  Removed language regarding a “smooth startup”  
P39 (Section 8.1.2), 44 (Section 8.1.8): 
clarification on vital signs  Site is to collect temperature, BP, HR and RR.  
P42 (Section 8.1.4): clarification on 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_536019] .  It may 
be used as an outpatient on the surgical site but subjects should be 
instructed to report this as a concomitant treatment that may be in 
response to an AE.  
P52 ( Section 10.1.2 ): clarification on IP 
preparation  Any language on preparation has been removed and the 
investigator is referred to the Pharmacy Manual to avoid potential 
conflicting language.  
P57 (Section 11.4.1): clarification on 
medical history documentation  Only medical history deemed pertinent to the study by [CONTACT_536060].  
P57 (Section 11.1.5): clarification on 
contraceptives to prevent pregnancy  Under double -barrier methods, the protocol specifies that this is a 
“male condom in addition to a diaphragm of a contraceptive 
sponge.”  
Spermicidal contraceptives are acceptable as part of a double -
barrier contraceptive program (i.e., spermicidal jellies, foams or 
gels)  in any combination per discretion of the investigator.  
When considering male inclusion, they should be qualified by 
[CONTACT_536061] #3.  
P59 (Section 11.1.4): clarification on 
rescue usage documentation after 
discharge  Rescue consumption should be recorded through the day 15 visit 
when diaries are collected.  
P59 (Section 11.1.3): clarification on who 
may perform the IGE  The IGE assessment may be performed by [CONTACT_536062] 1572.  
P61 (Section 11.5.5): clarification on 
timing of ECGs  ECGs are required only at screening and 24h.  
P62 (Section 11.5.7): clarification on 
frequency of follow up for AEs  Regarding the sentence “…they will be evaluated and graded for 
severity regularly until resolution.” The word “regularly” in this 
context should be clarified to mean as deemed per standard of care 
by [CONTACT_093].  Contact [CONTACT_536063] -up if this occurs.  
P63 (Section 11.5.9): clarification on 
serious AEs and AEs deemed possibly 
related  P63, “Serious AEs and AEs that have been designated as possible 
related to study treatment will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.”

draw instructions  The language on handling of PK samples has been removed and the 
investigator is instructed to refer to the Clinical Laboratory  Manual.  
P81 (Section 1 5.1.3): clarification on 
documentation of ICF process  Protocol language: “the time that informed consent is obtained 
must be documented;”  however the ICF time will not be required 
per the IRB -approved ICF template.

Study Objectives:  Primary Objective : 
 To evaluate the efficacy of a single intraoperative administration of CA -
008 vs placebo in subjects undergoing an elective BUNX .  
Secondary Objectives  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intraoperative 
administration of CA -008 vs. placebo in subjects undergoing an elective 
BUNX .  
 To evaluate the PK profile of a single intraoperative administration of 
CA-008 vs. placebo in subjects undergoing an elective BUNX .  
 To explore the efficacy of various doses of CA -008 administered 
intraoperatively in subjects undergoing an elective BUNX .  
Exploratory Objectives  
Pharmacoeconomic benefits from administration of CA -008 vs. placebo in 
subjects undergoing an elective BUNX . 
Study Treatment 
Dosing Schedule:  Study treatment  is to be administered intraoperatively as a s ingle administration 
via “surgical site” infiltration  / instillation  prior to wound closure.   
“Surgical Site”:  “Surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately 2 -3 cm in all 
directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal) from the incision site and surrounding 
tissues which may be affected by [CONTACT_536064] 
(IP). 
Anesthesia:  The surgery will be performed under light to  moderate  sedation  (what constitutes 
this level of sedation  and the additional anesthetic medications used per 
discretion of the anesthesiologist)  and a Mayo block to produce surgical  
anesthesia  and postoperative analgesia.  After administering light to mo derate 
sedation , but prior to surgery, perform a Mayo block by [CONTACT_454] 0.5% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (up to 30 mL total volume, 150 mg) proximal to the 
planned surgical  incision .  The Mayo block should be performed 15 -30 minutes 
prior to study treatment dosing.  
Injection of Study 
Treatment:  Prior to wound closure, study treatment will be injected/instilled into the soft 
tissues and osteotomy surgical sites with a t otal volume of 14 mL of study 
treatment  as follows:  
 CA-008: 3 doses: 0.7, 2.1 and 4.2 mg in 14 mL volume (concentrations: 
0.05, 0.15, 0.3 mg/mL)  
 Placebo: CA -008 vehicle using the same 14 mL volume

DENTIAL       Page 9 of 98 Study treatment will be injected/instilled into the surgical site as follows:  
 Instill  2 mL  at cut bone site s prior to fixation  
 Prior to  capsule  closure , infiltrate the deep soft tissue and area proximal 
to the capsule with a total of 9 mL (approximately 2.25  mL into each 
quadrant circumferentially)  
 Close the capsule, but using a small gauge catheter infiltrate 2  mL into the 
closed capsule  space  
 Prior to closure of the subcutaneous tissues and skin, instil l 1 mL to coat 
all exposed surfaces  
Note that T0 is the time that the study treatment injection/instillation is 
completed.  
Postoperative 
Multimodal Analgesia 
Regimen during the 
Inpatient Period:  In addition to the Mayo block noted above, a multimodal analgesia regimen will 
include the following during the immediate postoperative period:  
 Ketorolac 30 mg IV (a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) to 
be administered intraoperatively before end of surgery (EOS ).  Per 
investigator discretion, adjust the  ketorolac  dose as necessary for subject 
age and medical condition.  
 Acetaminophen [ADDRESS_697765] been administered, no additional NSAIDs or 
acetaminophen are to be administered during the inpatient phase of the stu dy 
through T96h.  
Postsurgical Care:  Subjects  will be monitored for 96 hours  after completion of study treatment  
(through T96h) at the trial site as an inpatient. Safety and efficacy evaluations 
will be performed,  and blood drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments in a 
portion of enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be required to meet standard pre -
specified criteria for discharge from the unit.   
Subjects will continue to be monitored as an outpatient after discharge through 
D29/W4 for various safety and efficacy assessments, and if necessary for safety 
follow up, D36/W5  or longer if needed to establish a new baseline for an AE . 
Rescue Medication 
during the Inpatient 
Period:  Additionally, the following rescu e medication are available to subjects and may 
be administered for any moderate to severe breakthrough pain at any time during 
the inpatient period:  
 PO oxycodone [ADDRESS_697766] 12 hours after surgery for 
moderate or severe pain (≥ 4 ) as reported by [CONTACT_536065] 0 to 10 
numerical rating s cale of current pain intensity (NRS)

Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate pain  scores (≥ 4), 
however rescue may be requested at any time and medication will be provided 
when requested per protocol timing.  
Multimodal Analgesia 
and Rescue 
Medication during 
Outpatient Period : 
 Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instructed 
to take a combination of  OTC analgesics (NSAID and acetaminophen) at an 
appropriate dose per medical judgment to manage any residual or breakthrough 
postsurgical pain through D29/W4.   Administration of rescue medication should 
be based on T0.  
Outpati ent period: D4 through D29/W4, if needed  for pain management, the 
following oral over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics  will be recommended for 
subjects to self -administer (note that these medications will not be provided by 
[CONTACT_456]):   
 NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen 200  – 400 mg prn up to qid [Advil® or Motrin®] 
or naproxen 220 mg prn up to tid [Aleve®]) or other options per 
investigator discretion and  
 Acetaminophen 1 -2 500 mg tablets prn up to tid or 650 mg prn up to qid 
(3g daily maximum limit)  
If a subject  is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_536022] 12h prior to discharge from the 
inpatient unit  (i.e., from T84h on regardless of whether discharge is dela yed), 
then prescribe no more than 6 tablets (1 PO tid prn)  of oxycodone [ADDRESS_697767]

situation occurs, the Investigator should use clinical discretion on adequacy of 
analgesic tr eatment, but to capture this event as an adverse event (AE) and 
document any required treatments.  
Inclusion Criteria:  In order to participate, subjects must meet all inclusion criteria:  
1. In the medical judgment of the investigator, be a reasonably healthy  
adult aged 18 - 75 years old, inclusive, and American Society of

bunionectomy surgery, or is scheduled to receive an inv estigational product 
other than CA -008 while participating in the study.  
Visit Schedule:  
 1. Screening D -45 to D -1: Subjects undergo screening during this period. All 
screening assessments (including informed consent form [ ICF]) must be 
completed at least 1 day prior to surgery.  I f screening occurs prior to D -30, 
it may be necessary to  reverify eligibility and ICF agreement , but only if the 
facility SOP requires  such reverification be performed . 
2. Site Unit Admission D0 : Day of surgery, subjects will be randomized and 
baseline evaluations will be performed prior to surgery.    
3. Surgery D0 : BUNX  procedure is performed under light to moderate 
sedation  (what constitutes this level of sedation and the additional anesthetic 
medications used per discretion of the  anesthesiologist) and Mayo block; 
study treatment is injected/instilled prior to wound closure with T0 defined 
as the time of study treatment completion of administration.   If a subject is to 
participate in the PK study , assessments are to be done per pro tocol -specified 
time points through T24h.  
4. Post-surgery T0 to T96h : Subject remains at the Site Unit for study 
assessments and PK blood draws.  Discharge after T96h assessments with 
follow up instructions, particularly on diary completion.  
5. Follow Up D8±1 (W1) : clinic visit for study assessments  
6. Follow Up D15± 2 (W2):  clinic visit for study assessments  
7. Follow Up D29±2 (W4):  clinic visit for study assessments and study 
completion visit, unless follow up for wound healing is needed  
8. If needed f ollow Up D36±2:  Clinic visit as needed for any ongoing safety 
issue continuing after the D29 visit  
9. Early Termination (ET):  For subjects who terminate early, an ET visit will 
be required. Safety and subject -reported outcome assessments will be 
performed.

Safety Endpoints:   The following safety endpoints will be evaluated:  
 Incidence of TEAEs or treatment -emergent SAEs from D0/T0 through D29: 
Note that all AEs will be recorded from the time the informed consent form 
(ICF) is signed through D29 (or D36 as applicable).  TEAEs are defined as 
AEs occurring post T0 (end of study treatment infiltration).  
 Surgical site assessment / wound evaluations to assess for  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_536029], e.g., erythema,  pain, pruritus, bruising, swelling, bruising or other 
skin changes, should be evaluated and graded for severity and followed 
regularly until resolution or a stable baseline is achieved.  
 Physical examination (PE) of the lower extremities and vital signs, i ncluding 
neurosensory testing of both lower extremities    
o Note that any observed or reported sensory deficit or clinically 
significant persistent sensory change remote from the immediate 
surgical site, such as allodynia or hyperalgesia, must be designated 
as a neurologic AE.  Subjects should be followed until resolution or 
a stable baseline is achieved.  
o Numbness proximal to  the incision need not be considered a 
neurologic AE since this could occur because of tissue trauma and 
inflammation from the surgery.  
 ECG changes from screening to T24h post -treatment  
 Clinically significant  clinical labs  changes from screening   
Pharmacokinetics : Approximately 1/3rd of enrolled subjects at each site will participate in the PK 
study (48 in total; 12 in each treatment group).  The PK population will include 
all subjects who have sufficient concentration -time profiles for estimation of PK 
parameters.    
Based upon the PK results from the Phase 1 bunionectomy ascending dose safety 
study, the time points for whole blood collection will be at baseline (within the 
30 min before the start of study treatment dosing), and T5min, T10 min, T15min,

for a total of 17 samples).  Actual sampling times will be used to calculate 
plasma bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] -derived PK  parameters.   
The following parameters will be estimated using noncompartmental analysis for 
CA-008, capsaicin and CA -101:  
 Cmax: The m aximum measured plasma concentration, obtained directly from 
the data without interpolation  
 Clast: Last observed (quantifiable) concentration  
 Tmax: Time of C max 
 t½: The apparent first -order terminal elimination half -life, calculated as 
0.693/λ z  
 Tlag: Time delay between drug administration and first measurable (above 
lower limit of quantitation) concentration  
 Tlast: Time of occurrence of C last  
 λz: Terminal first -order elimination rate constant  
 AUC 0–t: Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_697780] measurable concentration (where time is postdose), calculated by [CONTACT_300235]   
 AUC 0–∞: Area under the plasma concentration -time curve, from time of 
dosing to infinity.  
 AUC last:  Area under the plasma concentration -time curve, from time of 
dosing to the time of the last measurable concentration  
Sample Size 
Justification:  In the previously completed Phase 1 ascending dose safety study in 
bunionectomy  (CA-008 vs. placebo),  the mean  difference between CA -008 (all 
dose groups combined) and placebo for the  AUC [ADDRESS_697781] 
deviation (SD) estimates for the six treatment arms in this study ranged from 70 
to 190 with a median SD of 108.  For the primary endpoint ( AUC 0 to 96h), the true 
treatment difference between the 4.2 mg CA -008 group and the placebo group is 
assumed to be equal to -100 and the assumed true SD is equal to 130.  For these 
assumptions, and based on the use of a two -sided, two -sample comparison of 
means  at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, a sample size of 36 subjects per 
arm will provide 90% power.  Thus, the planned total sample size is 144 
subjects.  
Study Populations:  The following three analysis populations are planned for this study:  
 The Safety Population will include all subjects who received any part of a 
dose of study treatment.   
 The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study 
treatment and complete all PK assessments through the T 6h timepoint.  
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697782] s who fail to complete these PK assessments will be replaced.   
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all subjects as randomized 
to study treatment.  The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) Population will 
include all subjects who receive a full do se of study treatment and complete 
the first 3 pain assessments (through T2h).   
 Inpatient study completers (Inpatient Completers) will include all subjects 
who receive a full dose of study treatment and complete the inpatient 
assessment period (through T9 6h).   
 Study completers (Study Completers) will  include all subjects who receive a 
full dose of study treatment and complete the entire study period through 
D29±2/W4.  
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation during the inpatient phase 
of the s tudy, will be asked to continue with assessments through T96h if they 
have not elected to withdraw from all aspects of study participation.  Subjects 
who elect to discontinue participation prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to 
have terminated as of the da te of their election, however they will be asked to 
return to the site one time, if willing and at their convenience, to ensure wound 
healing.  
All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the 
Safety Population.  PK and efficacy analyses will be performed using the PK and 
mITT Population s, respectively.  Additional efficacy analyses will be performed 
on the ITT, Inp atient Completer and Study Completer Populations.  All 
summaries will be grouped by [CONTACT_84810].  Each active dose 
cohort will be presented separately, along with a combined active dose group.

TRODUCTION 
7.1. Background  
Concentric Analgesics, Inc. (Concentric) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_84712]-[ADDRESS_697796]-surgical pain following a single local administration.  CA-008 is a prodrug of trans-
capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), the substance in chili peppers that produces 
the sensa
tion of spi[INVESTIGATOR_84713].  Capsaicin is a transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V 
(vanil
loid), member 1 (TRPV1) agonist.  TRPV1 is a ligand-gated, nonselective, cation channel 
preferentially expressed most densely in C-fiber nociceptors and to a lesser extent on Aδ–fiber 
nocice
ptors ( Babbar 2009, Caterina 2001 ). TRPV1 responds to noxious stimuli including 
capsaicin, heat, and extracellular acidification, and integrates simultaneous exposures to these 
stimuli ( Suresh 2010, Surh 1995, Tominaga 1998 ).   
Capsaicin exposure to TRPV-1-expressing nociceptor peripheral terminals results in initial 
ex
citation of the nociceptor followed by a functional desensitization which continues for some 
time after removal of capsaicin from the site.  Based upon this mechanism of action, it is thought 
that the loca
l infiltration of a TRPV1 agonist into a surgical site prior to wound closure will 
result in a meaningful reduction of post-surgical pain that lasts days to weeks.  This improved 
long-term pain relief, particularly in combination with infiltration of local anesthetics, may help 
reduc
e the need for supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_347395]. The capsaicin pro-drug CA-008 has 
been developed for local infiltration to improve upon the physicochemical properties of capsaicin 
while providing equivalent local analgesia.  
Capsaicin formulations in relatively low concentrations (0.025 to 0.25%) are marketed as over-
the-counter (OTC) products (e.g., Zostrix®) under a tentative final monograph for external 
analgesics (proposed in the Federal Register 8 Feb 1983; vol 48, No. 27; proposed for 21 CFR 
348.12).  The
se formulations include topi[INVESTIGATOR_159610], nasal sprays (Sinol-M®) and dermal 
patches to relieve pain.  For example, the Qutenza® (capsaicin) 8% dermal patch (Acorda 
Therapeutics) was approved in 2009 in the US for the management of neuropathic pain 
associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).  Note that each Qutenza patch contains 179 mg of 
capsaicin (640 mcg/cm2) (Qutenza P I).   
While no capsaicin products have been approved for injection or instillation into a wound site in 
the US, several companies have or had clinical development programs for such products.  
Centrexion Therapeutics has an active development program (CTNX-4975) for intraarticular 
injection of capsaicin for chronic osteoarthritis and Morton’s neuroma (see 
http://centrexion.com/our-pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]/).  Anesiva, Inc. previously had an early stage program for 
intra
articular injection for osteoarthritis as well as a late-stage program (Adlea™) evaluating 
capsaicin instillation during surgery for the management of post-surgical pain.  Capsaicin, 
however, is virtually insoluble in aqueous media or local anesthetic solutions.  Anesiva’s

pH.  In Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C, it completely breaks apart to capsaicin and CA-101 as the 
sole degradants. 
The cyclic urea (CA-101) formed has not been previously evaluated for biological activity and it 
was shown to be inac
tive.  While not a known compound in the clinical literature, its safety was 
evaluated in all nonclinical studies with CA-008.  The toxicokinetic profiles for CA-008, CA-
101, and capsaicin were determined in GLP safety studies and in a Phase 1 ascending dose safety 
study
 in patients undergoing bunionectomy. 

Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697799] common route of human capsaicin exposure is ingestion in spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716], like chili 
peppers.  Capsaicin is absorbed by a nonactive process from the stomach and whole intestine 
(Le
elahuta 1983 ; Kawada 1984 ), where the total absorption capacity varies between 50 and 90% 
in different animal studies.  Maximum blood concentration is  seen about an 1 h after ingestion 
(S
uresh 2010 ). To a certain extent, capsaicin is absorbed in its intact form, and the amount in the 
portal blood is measurable by [CONTACT_536067] ( Kawada 1984 ).  A minor part of capsaicin 
metabolism occurs in the small intestine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] ( Kaw ada 1984 ).  A study by [CONTACT_536068] 
a
nd colleagues investigated the human PK profile of 5 g of orally ingested C. frutescens, 
approx
imately 26.6 mg of capsaicin or the equivalent of eating 15 habanero peppers ( Chaiyasit 
2009
). Capsaicin could be detected in plasma after 10 min, and the C max was 2.47 ng/ml, T max  
was 47.[ADDRESS_697800] is metabolized in 
the liver.  
In vitro  human investigation with hepatic microsomes to investigate involvement of 
phase
 2 metabolisms, showed that capsaicin was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_78081], producing three major 
metaboli
tes, 16-hydroxycapsaicin, 17-hydroxycapsaicin, and 16,17-hydroxycapsaicin, whereas 
vanillin was a minor metabolite ( Chanda 2008 ).  This suggests that cytochrome P450 enzymes 
minimally participate in  capsaicin biotransformation in  skin  compared with their key role in 
hepa
tic metabolism. 
Animal studies have shown that capsaicin metabolites are eliminated mainly by [CONTACT_8212], with 
a small unt
ransformed proportion excreted in the feces and urine ( Le elahuta 1983 , Kawada 1984 , 
Surh 1
995).  It is excreted in both free form and capsaicin glucuronide form.  In vivo animal 
studie
s have shown that after 48 h, only a small amount (<10%) of an administered dose was 
found 
in feces ( Leelahuta 1983 , Kawada 1984 ). 
7.1.3. Capsaicin PK 
Other than by [CONTACT_78262], most human exposure to capsaicin is from topi[INVESTIGATOR_536034]-defense or noxious effects 
with pe
pper spray.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_536035] ( Hay man 
2008).  Additionally, capsaicin is often used in basic science studies, such as in experimental 
pain studies (
animal and human), where the main administration method is intradermal or 
intraplantar injections.   
Systemic PK data for topi[INVESTIGATOR_536036].  In [ADDRESS_697801] C max observed in any patient was 17.8 ng/mL (Babbar 2009).  Sparse sampling resulted 
in most patients not having quantifiable levels.  Plasma concentrations were fitted adequately 
using a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination. Capsaicin levels

DENTIAL       Page 31 of 98 declined very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], with a mean population elimination half -life of 1.64 hours. Mean area 
under the curve and C max values after a 60 -minute application were 7.42 ng*h/mL and 1.86 
ng/mL, respectively.  Ninety -minute applications of Qutenz a  resulted in AUC and C max values 
approximated 1.78-  and 2.15 -fold higher  than those observed after a 60 -minute a pplication.   Due 
to capsaicin’s TRPV1 mechanism of action  of inducing a prolonged functional depolarization , 
the duration of pain relief extend s well beyond the relatively limited time of its exposure  to the 
targe
t peripheral site.  
7.1.4. Background Information on the Use of Capsaicin in Analgesia  
While capsaicin is well understood to have long lasting analgesic benefits, it has shown a limited 
effect in the initial hours following administration in both nonclinical ( Dudley -Cash 2012 ) and 
clinical studies ( Pollak  2009, Savage 2009).  In Phase 3 clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_373424], 
c
apsaicin instillation demonstrated statistically significant reductions in cumulative pain and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_373383] 48 hours, but failed to show a difference with shorter periods of observation (e.g. 
pain AUC 4-
32 hours) ( Hartrick 2011, Pollak  2009 ).  Based upon a post hoc review of these data 
that periods longer
 than 48 hours are necessary to demonstrate capsaicin’s benefit as the 
treatment difference increases during this period. 
Activation of TRPV1 receptor with an agonist such as capsaicin immediately results in transient 
hyperalgesia, erythema, and localized burning sensation followed by a functional desensitization 
that re
sults in reduction in noxious pain stimuli without affecting evoked pain sensations or 
muscle control.  This desensitization can lead  a sustained analgesia for a week or longer.  Given 
CA-008’s rapid conversion to capsaicin, a similar profile (PK and pharmacodynamic or PD) 
would be e
xpected following the administration of CA-[ADDRESS_697802] practice multimodal 
analgesia (systemic medications +/- local anesthetic administered by [CONTACT_536069]) appropriate for the surgery in question to manage pain for the first [ADDRESS_697803]-Operative Pain Management: the unmet need  
A clinical practice guideline on the management of post-surgical pain from the American Pain 
Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American 
Society of Anesthesiologists’ Committee on Regional Anesthesia, Executive Committee, and 
Administrative Council was published recently in the Journal of Pain ( Chaiyasit 2009, Chanda 
2008, Chou 2016 ).  This publication presents evidenced-based recommendations for 
preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions and pain management strategies.  
As summarized in this guideline, more than 80% of patients who undergo surgical procedures 
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697804]-surgical pain and approximately 75% of those with post-surgical pain 
report the severity as moderate, severe, or extreme (Apfelbaum  2003; Gan 2014 ).  Evide nce 
sugge
sts that fewer than half of patients who undergo surgery report adequate post-surgical pain 
reli
ef (Apfelbaum  2003).  Inadequately controlled pain negatively affects quality of life, 
functi
on, and functional recovery, the risk of post-surgical complications, and the risk of 
persistent postsurgical pain ( Kawada 1984, Kehlet 2006 ) .  The publication recommends 
strategies for the management of post-surgical pain ranging from preoperative education and 
perioperative pain management planning, multimodal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], physical modalities, cognitive-
behavioral modalities, systemic pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], local and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_536037], use of peripheral regional anesthesia, and neuraxial therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], all depending on the 
nature of the patient and surgical procedure.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_19249], management of pain in patients after surgery remains insufficient 
(Pogatzki -Zahn 2012), and there is no ideal way to provide continuous, effective pain relief 
bey
ond the immediate hours after surgery.  Systemic pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_536038]
y of post-surgical pain relief, with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] a key component of the arsenal, especially for 
moderate- to-severe pain.  Systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_536039], but increase cost and morbidity due to 
known safety issues such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], gastrointestinal dysfunction, and abuse, and 
produce a heavy societal burden.  Non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_373385], nonselective 
NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors are useful for the treatment of light- to- moderate pain 
and are part of a balanced multimodal pain treatment ( Pogatzki -Zahn 2012 ).  These products also 
have known safety risks.  The use of peripheral regional anesthetic techniques has been shown to 
be effective as a component of multimodal analgesia for management of post-surgical pain 
associated with several surgical procedures, including thoracotomy, lower extremity joint 
surger
y, shoulder surgery, cesarean section, hemorrhoid surgery, and circumcision.  This 
approach has limitations including the increased cost and intensively of care and the potential for 
increased incidence of patient falls. 
Site-specific infiltration techniques utilizing a novel mechanism of action are attractive as a 
component of
 multimodal analgesia due to the potential for prevention of post-surgical pain, with 
lower potential safety risks due to the local nature of administration.  Treating pain at its source 
with local anesthetic, e.g., liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel®), while highly effective, is limited 
due to i

7.1.7. Previous Human experience 
There is substantial clinical support for the potential safety of capsaicin, the active molecule 
released by [CONTACT_28474]-008 in vivo.  In addition to be ingested in hot spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716] (chili peppers), 
capsaicin is an approved product for dermal applications for OTC and prescription use (Qutenza; 
8% patch for management of neuropathic pain associated with post herpetic neuralgia), is 
frequently used intradermally in experimental pain model s, and has been studied clinically for 
wound instil
lation for postsurgical analgesia (Anesiva; Adlea; capsaicin for instillation).  
A first- in-human study (Study CA- PS -2017-101) evaluated the safety and tolerability of CA-[ADDRESS_697805] metatarsal osteotomy for correction of 
hallux valgus deformity, more commonly known as a bunionectomy.  This study also evaluated 
PK 
and preliminary efficacy assessment of CA-008 to inform future studies in our clinical 
development plan.  This study was originally designed to look at 4 different doses of CA-008 
(0.5 mg, 1 m
g, 2 mg, and 3 mg), however based upon the benign adverse event (AE) profile, a 5th 
cohort (
4.2 mg) was added.  Based upon the results from this study we selected [ADDRESS_697806] listing

K profile was not available at the time of preparation of this protocol, however the 
preliminary time-concentration values were instructive as to C max and T max.  The following 
pre
liminary assessments could be made: 
 For CA-008, the highest C max value was 1.04 ng/mL and the median T max was [ADDRESS_697809] dose (4.2 
mg
) and after 45 min at lower doses.  Given the paucity of measurable concentrations at

7.2. Study Rationale 
CA-008 is being investigated as a potential therapy for treatment of pain following surgery.  CA-
008 is administered (injected and instilled) directly into the postoperative wound during the 
surgery.  This study is a follow-on placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study which includes 
assessments of 
wound healing and a PK study in enrolled subjects.

VESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design 
study evaluating a single dose of one of three CA-008 dose groups vs. placebo injected during an 
elective BUNX with a multimodal analgesia regimen including an NSAID and regional Mayo 
block with 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  The study will be conducted in two parts: 
 Inpatient period which continues to 96h after completion of study treatment injection 
(T
0) or T96h. 
 Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through various 
follow visi
ts to D29 ±2 (W4) after surgery, or if necessary for ongoing safety assessments, 
to D36±2  (W5). 
Subjec
ts will be undergoing unilateral transpositional first metatarsal osteotomy for the 
correction of hallux valgus deformity (bunionectomy or BUNX).  The surgery is to be performed 
under 
light to moderate sedation anesthesia (what constitutes this level of sedation and the additional 
anes
thetic medications used per discretion of the anesthesiologist) .  In accordance with standard of 
ca
re, light to moderate sedation will be supplemented with a Mayo block to produce surgical 
anesthesia and postoperative analgesia.  After administering light to moderate sedation, but prior 
to surgery, perform a Mayo block by [CONTACT_454] 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (up to 30 mL 
total volume, 150 mg) at least 3 cm proximal to the “surgical site”.  The Mayo block should be 
performed at 15-30 minutes prior to study treatment dosing.  “Surgical site” is defined as the area 
ex
tending approximately 2-3 cm in all directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal) from the 
incision site and surrounding tissues which may be affected by [CONTACT_536070]. 
After the surgery, subjects will be monitored for [ADDRESS_697810] week of enrollment, subjects may be 
enrolle
d for the pharmacokinetic (PK ) portion of the study and have samples drawn prior to CA-
008 inje
ction and at various time points over 24h after surgery until the target of 48 PK subjects 
(12 pe
r treatment group) are enrolled and complete PK assessments.  Subjects will be required to 
meet ce
rtain pre-specified criteria prior to discharge. 
9.1.1. Screening Phase (Day -45 [D -45] to D-1  or D0):   
Subjects requiring bunionectomy between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive, will be 
screened for participation at the study site in the [LOCATION_002] within 45 days of surgery/study

9.1.4. Postoperative Care Through 96 Hours (T96h) 
After
 surgery, subjects will be monitored for 96 hours (through T96h) at the trial site as an 
inpatient.  Safety and efficacy evaluations will be performed and blood drawn for PK 
assessments (for the
 PK study).  Subjects will be required to meet standard pre-specified criteria 
for discha

The schedule of assessments are as follows:  
 Perform NRS assessments of current pain intensity:  
o During the inpatient stay, at T0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and every 4 hours (if 
awake at time of assessment and if no rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_536031] 4 
hours) until discharge from the inpatient unit . 
o Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight and [ADDRESS_697814] be obtained 4 hours  (±15 min)  after every rescue 
dose even if this time point occurs between midnight and [ADDRESS_697815] is 
asleep  at these times . 
o During the inpatient stay, starting on postoperative day 1 (after T24): each morning on 
arising at  approximately 08 00h (±2h) and each evening prior to bedtime at 
approximately 2000h (±2h) document the NRS score with ambulation ( partial or full; 
must document time of assessment).  Actual assessment times must be documented.  
o There will be a ±[ADDRESS_697816] 4 hours after the end of surgery, after which will be a ±15 minute window allowed.  
 Record vital signs: 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and every 8 hours thereafter (if awake at time of 
assessment be
tween the hours of 00:00 and 06:00) until discharge from the inpatient unit 
(may
 not miss two consecutive assessments).  There will be a ±[ADDRESS_697817] 4 hours after the end of surgery, after which will be a 
±15 minute window allowed.  Daily temps can be recorded along with vital signs per site 
SOPs at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, a
nd every 8 h thereafter until discharge from the inpatient facility 
(if awake at the time of assessment between hours of midnight and 6 a.m.).  
 Perform interim PE: surgical site assessment and neurosensory exam of the foot proximal to 
the surg
ical site with contralateral comparison prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.

 Subjec
ts with inadequately controlled pain may request and receive rescue medication at any 
time; however, subjects will be encouraged to receive rescue only for an NRS ≥ 4. 
Additiona

AEs that occur from the time a subject's informed consent but prior to study treatment 
will be captured in the medical history.  All AEs and SAEs will be documented and followed 
from t

AEs (TEAEs).    
After
 completing the assessments through T96h hours after study treatment administration and 
prior to di
scharge from the inpatient unit, review with the subject the use of a diary for at-home 
use to rec
ord pain assessments and medication use (including pain medication) at home.  
Additiona
lly, obtain the subject’s global assessment of satisfaction with study treatment (patient 
global evaluation or PGE) and the investigator’s global evaluation (IGE) prior to discharge.  
Finally, instruct subjects to return to the study center on D8±1 for a follow-up assessment.  
Once
 discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instructed to take a 
combination of OTC analgesics (NSAID and acetaminophen) at an appropriate dose per medical 
judgment to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain through D29/W4. 
Outpatient period: D4 through D29/W4:

9.2. Discussion of Study Design 
This trial is designed to determine the efficacy of study treatment (CA-008 vs. placebo) 
infiltrated/instilled during surgery in treating postoperative pain after a bunionectomy in the 
setting of multimodal analgesia in addition to a Mayo block with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_536047] 24h and 
to confirm the safety profile observed in the phase [ADDRESS_697822] on duration of acute 
pain (multiple-day efficacy) ( Singla  2013; W ang  2010 ). 
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase 
the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics and baseline 
characteristics) or other variables are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance 
the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. 
A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical 
endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment as well as to minimize subject and 
investigator bias.  Double-blinded treatments will be used to reduce potential bias of subjects and

inventory.  The unused quantities will be returned to the Sponsor’s drug supply vendor at the end 
of the trial. All unused supplies will be checked against the drug accountability records during 
the study and/or at the end of the study. The Investigator or designee must maintain an inventory 
record of all dispensed rescue medications to subjects. Additional details are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual. 
Only eligible subjects participating in the study will receive the study treatment. Only authorized 
research site staff may supply, prepare or administer the study treatments. Once dispensed, study 
treatment may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_23837].

.2. Other Interventions 
11.2.1. Inpatient Multimodal Analgesia  
Whil
e in-clinic, subjects will be treated with a multimodal analgesic regimen to supplement the 
May
o block in the immediate postoperative period.  The regimen will include IV ketorolac and 
IV/PO acetaminophen.  Administer the following:  
 Ketorolac 30 mg IV (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to be administered 
int
raoperatively before the end of surgery.  Per investigator discretion, adjust the dose as 
necessary for subject age and medical condition. 
 Acetaminophen [ADDRESS_697834] been administered, no additional NSAIDs or acetaminophen are to be 
administered during the inpatient phase of the study through T96h.  
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697835] breakthrough or poorly controlled pain at any time from 
EOS
 to T96h (the inpatient period ), oxycodone rescue medication may be administered for any 
modera
te to severe pain (NRS ≥ 4) (see Section 9.1.3 ). 
S
ubjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate pain scores (≥ 4), however rescue may 
be requested at any time and medication will be provided when requested per protocol timing.  
11.2.3. Outpatient Analgesic Medications 
Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instructed to take a 
combination of OTC analgesics (NSAID and acetaminophen) at an appropriate dose per medical 
judgment to m
anage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain through D29/W4. 
Outpatient period: T96h through D29/W4:   
 If needed for pain management, over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics administered PO, 
e
.g.,  
o NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen 200 mg to 400 mg prn qid [Advil® or Motr in®] or 
na
proxen 220 mg prn tid [Aleve®])  
o Acetaminophen 1-2, 500 mg tablets (up to 1 g) tid or 650 mg qid (3g daily limit) 
I
f a subject is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_536048] T84 hour timepoint, then 
presc
ribe no more than 6 tablet supply of oxycodone 5 mg (for use up to tid prn) to cover the 
initi
al outpatient period with actual number of tablets prescribed and refills per investigator 
discre
tion and based upon the subject’s needs. 
Pe
rsistent pain or pain exacerbations during this period may suggest the need for an unscheduled 
in-person visit to assess the surgical site.  If such a situation occurs, the Investigator should use 
clinical discretion on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but capture this event as an AE and 
document any required treatments. 
11.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatments, to increase 
the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics, baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  Subjects who have provided written informed 
conse
nt will be assigned a unique number in the screening process. This number will be used to 
identify the subject throughout the study.  Once any subject number or randomization number is 
assi
gned, it cannot be reassigned to any other subject. The randomization plan is described in 
Section 12.2. 
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.2 , 06-June- 2018      Concentric Analgesics, Inc. 
CONFI
DENTIAL       Page 57 of 98 There
 will be up to 4 treatment groups of subjects (3 active dose groups and placebo).  Each site 
will be
 provided with sufficient study treatment supplies for all treatment groups.   
Subjects may be rescreened if the screening window is exceeded due to scheduling issues.  For 
other out of screen window situations, Sponsor approval is needed prior to the rescreen visit. 
11.4. Selection of Doses 
The safety of CA-008 was established in relevant animal models and a prior phase 1 study after 
bunionec
tomy.  These results support the potential safety of CA-008 with no apparent abnormal 
findings.  Based on these nonclinical studies, a single instillation administration of CA-008 into 
the surgical site, at an initial dose of 0.7 mg/person and a maximum dose of 4.2 mg/person, has a 
minim
al risk of causing adverse events.  This dose range is within the range used in the phase [ADDRESS_697836] and/or monitoring of this study will not be aware of the 
treatment group assignments.  In the PK study all participating subjects whether randomized to 
active or placebo will have blood drawn at the specified time points and sent to the bioanalytical 
laboratory for subsequent processing.  As no one at the site is unblinded as to which treatment 
group any subject is assigned, blinding is preserved within the PK study. 
Under normal circumstances, the blind will not be broken until all participants have completed 
treatment. In case of emergency, and only if the information is required by [CONTACT_12534]’s safety in managing a medical condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the 
site by [CONTACT_2329] a code break module.  The code break module will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] ’s 
designee.  If possible, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_373431].  Whenever a treatment sequence is prematurely unblinded, the 
rea
son, date and time of the unblinding, and the individual who broke the blind must be 
documented.  Individual code breaks will result in withdrawal of the participant from the study. 
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697837] will be reviewed for eligibility and documented for the 30 days prior to Screening and 
throughout the study. Allowed rescue medication is described in Se ction 11.2.1 . 
The
 Investigator is permitted to use clinical discretion for required concomitant medications to 
trea
t an AE.  
11.7. Treatment Compliance  
Because all study treatment is being administered by [CONTACT_3462], no compliance procedures 
are
 necessary.  Diversion will be monitored and recorded through rescue medication 
ac
countability.  Any suspected or confirmed diversion will be documented and reported.

Assessments ( Table 1 ); the following sections outline the details and procedures associated with 
the assessments.  
12.1. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
12.1.1. Informed Consent 
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by [CONTACT_149192]. The subject must voluntarily provide written 
informed consent on an ethics-approved informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any 
study-related procedures. The subject’s source records must document that the consent process 
has be
en completed and that written informed consent has been obtained from the subject prior 
to the initiation of any study-specific procedures. Documentation that the subject was given 
adequate time to ask the Investigator (or designee) questions about their participation in the study 
and that a signed and dated copy of the ICF was provided to the subject should also be included 
in the medical records or clinical chart. 
12.1.2. Demographics 
The following demographics will be recorded: age (birthdate), sex, race, and ethnicity.  
12.1.3. Medical and Surgical History 
The complete medical and surgical history will include histories of acute, chronic, or infectious 
disease; surgical or oncologic histories; and any reported conditions affecting major body 
systems. Subject’s medical history will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1629] I nvestigator for clinical significance. 
12.1.4. Medication History  
All medications (prescription and non-prescription, herbal medications/natural health products, 
or investigational drugs) taken by [CONTACT_12539] [ADDRESS_697838] a same sex partner.  Examples of 
medica
lly acceptable forms of contraception include true abstinence, hormonal contraceptives 
(combined oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch or vaginal ring, intrauterine device or system, progestin implant or

male subjects of non-childbearing potential are not required to use contraception or undergo 
pregnancy tests; however, they must be surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy and/or bilateral 
oophorectomy or salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy, as determined by [CONTACT_149194]) or 
congenitally sterile, or must be post-menopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as being 
amenorrheic for at least one year without another cause. 
Male subjects, unless in a relationship with a same sex partner or a female partner who is of non-
childbearing potential (see above), must either be sterile (surgically or biologically) or commit to 
using double
-barrier methods (using investigator discretion, recommend the appropriate 
combina

12.4.2. P
atient Global Evaluation (PGE) 
At T96h (prior to discharge), and on the D8, D15 and D29/ET visits, each subject will be asked 
to report their
 satisfaction with the study treatment for pain using a 4-point categorical scale.  
Each subject will be asked the following question:  
“How would you rate the study treatment that you have received for pain? Poor (0), Fair (1), 
Good (2), or
 Excellent (3)” (see Appendix 1C). 
12.4.3. Investigator Global Evaluation (IGE) 
At T96h (prior to discharge), and on the D8, D15 and D29/ET visits, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_536049]’s study treatment for pain using a 4-point

labs) to a
ssist in the determination of clinical significance. 
The clinical laboratory tests will be completed at Screening and at T96h before discharge from 
the inpati
ent unit (see).  In addition to the clinical laboratory tests, a serum pregnancy test will be 
perf
ormed at the Screening Visit and a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to surgery 
for women of childbearing potential.  ALT or AST > 3x upper limit normal range (ULN) / Tot. 
Bil
i > [ADDRESS_697841]/ Alk Phos. >2X ULN will be considered an adverse event, as well as any other 
cha
nges deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737].  
12.5.2. Urine Drug Screen and Alcohol Test 
Urine drug screen and alcohol (breath or saliva) tests will be completed at screening and pre-
procedure.  All subjects will be tested for drugs- of-a buse (e. g, amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benz
odiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), methadone, 
methampheta
mine, tricyclic anti-depressants, oxycodone and others ). 
The drug
 and alcohol screens may be performed in-house at the Clinical Unit, and the alcohol 
sali
va test may be sent out to a local lab (e.g., LabCorp).  If any of these tests are positive, the 
subje
ct will not be allowed further participation in the trial unless one of the previously noted 
ex
ceptions is present.  A positive test may be repeated at the discretion of the PI.   
12.5.3. X
-Ray 
An X-ray of the surgical site will be performed during screening and at D29/ET. 
12.5.4. Vital S
igns 
Vital signs will consist of blood pressure ( BP, mmHg), pulse rate (HR, beats per minute), and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR, breaths/min) collected while sitting, following a rest period of at least 5 
minutes. Vital signs and temperatures will be assessed at various study time points (see Se ction 
9.1.4  through Section 9.1.8 ).   
Vital sign abnormalities are graded in Appendix 1I.  If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_536051], it will be considered an adverse event.  
12.5.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
12-Lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been resting in a recumbent/supi[INVESTIGATOR_536052] 5 minutes.  The ECG variables will include ventricular heart rate and the PR, 
QRS, QT
 and QTcF intervals.  The ECGs will be signed and dated by a medically-qualified 
individual to confirm review of the ECG and verify whether any abnormalities are clinically 
significant.  In general, abnormal, clinically significant ECGs are expected to be associated with 
an item recorded in medical history or with an AE.  ECGs will be assessed at Screening and at 
T24h (± 2 hour).  Clinically significant changes in ECG (i.e., QTc F should be <450 msec / < 470

12.5.6. Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (PE) including all major body systems (HEENT, neurologic, 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, dermatologic and musculoskeletal systems) will be 
performed at Screening, and interim PEs prior to Surgery, and additional interim PEs focused on 
the surg
ical site and neurosensory testing of both lower extremities at T96h prior to discharge 
from the inpatient unit, D8, D15 and D29/ET.   
Body weight (kg), in indoor clothing, but without shoes, will be measured at Screening, at T96h 
prior to discharge from the inpatient unit and ET.  Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured, 
and B
MI will be calculated at Screening only.  BMI shall be calculated as kg/m2.  Use the NIH 
websit
e BMI calculator http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi-m.htm . 
12.5.7. S
urgical Site Assessment  
The surgical site should be assessed to determine if any related AEs have occurred.  Assessments 
will be
 conducted at T96h prior to discharge from the inpatient unit, and on the D8, D15 and 
D29/ET
 visits.    
At T96h prior
 to discharge, the investigator will evaluate their satisfaction with the healing of the 
wound during
 this Surgical Site assessment using an 11-point scale (0-10) where a score of 0 is 
“Completely unsatisfied,” and a score of 10 is “Completely satisfied.” Appendix 1E 
Assessm
ents will also be performed at each of the Follow-up visits on Days 8, [ADDRESS_697842] will be scheduled for a follow-up visit on Day 36. Appendix 1F 
If
 there are atypi[INVESTIGATOR_536053], for example, erythema, pain, pruritus, bruising, swelling, 
bruising or othe
r skin changes, they will be evaluated and graded for severity. 
12.5.8. Neurosensory Exam 
A neurosensory exam of the lower extremity (foot/great toe surgical site with contralateral 
comparison ) will
 be conducted at screening, at T96h prior to discharge from the inpatient unit, 
on the D8, D15 and D29/ET (and D36 if necessary) visits.  The exam will involve the dorsal 
aspe
ct of the foot proximal to the great toe.  
This evaluation wil
l include the following (details described in Appendix 1 G): 
 Visual exam of the foot 
 De ep Tendon Reflexes (normal, reduced or absent) 
 Vibratory sensation (normal, reduced or absent)

A pe
rsistent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_536054], such as allodynia or hyperalgesia proximal to the 
surgical site will be reported as an AE.  Numbness at or near the incision need not be considered 
an AE since this could occur due to tissue trauma and inflammation from surgery. 
12.5.9. Assessment of Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time the subject has signed the ICF until 
D29 or, if necessary, D36 after the completion of surgery.  All SAEs and non-serious AEs will 
be documented and followed from the time of administration of study treatment until D29 or, if 
nec
essary, D36 after the completion of surgery.  AEs that occur between Screening and the study 
procedure should be considered medical history and added to the subject’s medical record. AEs 
that have been designated as possibly or probably related to study treatment will be followed 
until re
solution or stabilization. Further details on AEs, including definitions, elicitation, and 
reporting are provided in Section  13. 
12.6. Efficacy, Safety and PK Endpoints 
12.6.1. Efficacy Endpoints

treatment dosing at T0), and at T5min, T10 min, T15min, T30min, T45min, and T1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 
3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24h, for a total of 17 samples  or approximately 102 mL ).  Actual sampling 
times will be used to calculate plasma bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] -derived PK parameters.   
A selected number of subjects will participate in the PK study.

VERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Clinical Safety 
Data Management Guidance for Industry, E2A, will be used to identify AEs in this study. 
An AE is an
y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
an
y unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormality, temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. 
A “suspected adverse reaction” means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug 
caused the event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   
13.1.1. Re
lationship to Study Treatment 
A qua
lified investigator must make the determination of relationship to the investigational 
produc
t for each AE.  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_104841].   
 
Causality 
Category  Description  
Unlikely  related  A clinical event, including laboratory tes t abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment  administration which  makes a causal 
relationship improbable or if other drugs, chemicals or underlying 
disease provide more plausible  explanations.  
While t emporal sequence may be an important factor in determining 
causality: i.e., whether the observed reaction or event began after the 
study treatment , it may well be that the surgery, anesthesia, a concurrent 
medical condition or concomitant medications administered during or 
after surgery were more likely than not to be responsible for the AE.  
The investigator should use clinical judgment to evaluate the evidence 
and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that study 
treatment actually caused the AE  or whether based upon the evidenc e it 
is more likely that something else is responsible .  If the former, choose 
“possibly related” and if the latter, “unlikely related.”

CONFI
DENTIAL       Page 69 of 98 For the purpose of this protocol, the term “unlikely related” will be 
considered an AE not related to study treatment . 
Possibly  related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration , which also may be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153] .  In such 
cases , if the investigator using clinical judgment is unable to rule out a 
reasonable possibility that study treatment was partly responsible , then 
choose “possibly related .”  
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has possible relationship 
to study treatment  will be define d as a “Suspected Adverse Drug 
Reaction”.   
Probably  related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration , in which the investigator 
has determined that the event is unlikely to be attributed to other 
factors .   
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has probable relationship 
to study treatment  will be defined as an “Adverse Drug Reaction”.  
 
13.1.2. Adverse Event Reporting 
All AEs must be entered on the AE CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include new 
AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease-related 
signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings that the 
Investigator feels are clinically significant. 
Disease
-related signs and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as AEs 
unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency. 
Information collected concerning AEs will include the following: 
 Name [CONTACT_12581]  
 Onset date  
 Resolution date  
 Severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe or potentially life-threatening)  
 Relationship to study treatment  
 Action and outcome  
 Seriousness of event  
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697845] has signed the ICF until 29 
(+/- 3 days),  or, if ne cessary, Day [ADDRESS_697846]’s medical record, unless the AE is due to a study-related procedure (such as 
phlebotomy
), in which case it will be recorded as a non-treatment emergent AE.  AEs that have 
bee
n designated as possibly related to study treatment will be followed until resolution or 
stabiliz
ation. 
13.1.3. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE or reaction is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes: 
 Death  
 Is life-threatening (at the time of the event)  
 Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring)  
 An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
All AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a pre-existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536055] [ADDRESS_697847] be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF: study specified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], short-term administrative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84748], tests or treatments of conditions that would not otherwise 
constitute an SAE, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].

o Whether the study treatment was discontinued  
o Investigator’s assessment of causality  
The
 CRO Medical Monitor or another representative of the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_536071]. All SAEs will be 
entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE report and the 
AE CRF.  The Investigator is responsible for the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to 
the Sponsor (
or designee), reporting pertinent follow-up information on the SAE, and notifying 
the appropriate IRB of the occurrence of and details surrounding the event. In the event there is a

TA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee may conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 14.2.  
Acti
ons to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigator and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, completeness, and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor or designee will 
review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on-site monitoring visits and 
after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator, as 
appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non-compliance will be investigated and remedial action instituted 
when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site 
termination and regulatory authority notification. 
14.1. Data Collection  
Source documents include, but are not limited to, original documents, data and records such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, 
participant diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and 
pharmacy records, etc. This study will use electronic data capture (EDC). At a minimum, all data 
required by [CONTACT_149198]. 
All CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_12555]’s monitor or 
designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative will review all 
source records on-site and compare them to the data collected on the CRF.  All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_12556]. 
All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_12557]. The 
electronic data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
14.2. Study Auditing and Monitoring 
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing CRFs for accuracy and 
completeness) will be performed by [CONTACT_1034]’s designated monitor(s). The extent, nature, and 
frequency of on-site visits will be based on such considerations as the study objectives and/or

STICAL METHODS  
15.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
This section describes the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety.  The 
final ana
lysis will be documented in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be 
finali
zed before database lock.  The SAP will include details on how variables will be derived, 
how missing data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on 
statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy analyses.  The final clinical study report 
will discuss deviations from the SAP, if any. 
15.2. Sample Size Justification 
In the previously completed Phase 1 ascending dose safety study in bunionectomy (CA-008 vs. 
placebo), the mean difference between CA-008 (all dose groups combined) and placebo for the 
AUC [ADDRESS_697851] deviation (SD) estimates for the six treatment arms in this 
study
 ranged from 70 to 190 with a median SD of 108.  For the primary endpoint ( AUC 0 to 96h ), 
the true treatment difference between the 4.2 mg CA -008 group and the placebo group is 
assumed to be equal to -100 and the assumed true SD is equal to 130.  For these assumptions, 
and based on the use of a two -sided, two -sample comparison of means at the alpha =0.05 level of 
significance, a sample size of 36 subjects per arm will provide 90% power.  Thus, the planned 
total sample size is 144 subjects.  
15.3. Analysis Populations 
The following three analysis populations are planned for this study:  
 The Safety Population will include all subjects who received at least part of a dose of study 
tre
atment.   
 The PK Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of study treatment and 
c
omplete at least all PK assessments through the T6h timepoint.  Subjects who fail to 
compl
ete these PK assessments will be replaced.   
 The modified ITT (mI TT) Population will include all subjects who receive a full dose of 
study

Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation during the inpatient phase of the study, will 
be asked to continue with assessments through T96h if they have not elected to withdraw from 
all aspects of study participation.  Subjects who elect to discontinue participation after discharge 
from the inpatient unit but prior to D8 (W1) will be considered to have terminated as of the date 
of their election, however they will be asked to return to the site to reassess the surgical site for 
wound healing.

All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) 
using the descriptive statistics n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, and maximum).  
Categorical assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using

will be presented as their corresponding continuous measures for post-baseline visits.  All study 
data will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], subject and time point.  
No preliminary rounding will be performed; rounding will only occur after the analysis.  Means 
and medians will be presented with one more decimal place than the precision of the data.  
Standard deviations will be presented with two more decimal places than the precision of the

be reported as 0% or 100%, respectively.  Minimums and maximums will be presented with the 
same precision as the original data. 
All analyses will be performed using the SAS System® version 9.3 or higher. The domain 
(Study data tabulation Model [SDTM]) and analysis (Analysis Data Model [ADaM]) data sets 
will be taken as input to the SAS programs that generate the report-ready tables, figures and 
listings. The submission ready SDTM and ADaM data sets will be provided to the sponsor along

provided in a separate document. 
The following conventions will be used throughout the study analysis: 
 Time T0 is the  time of completion of study treatment administration.  
 Day of surgery is defined as D0 
 Assessment visit times are defined by [CONTACT_5586] T0/D0. 
 Baseline value is defined as the last valid measurement prior to beginning study treatment 
a
dministration. 
 Change from baseline is defined as post-baseline value minus baseline value. 
 Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and as 
hours f

 If duplicate values are obtained at a given visit (e.g., repeated vital sign measurements), the 
last va

Values that compromise interpretation will not be used in summaries (e.g., values that were 
obtained post-dose will not be summarized as pre-dose values). 
15.6. Analysis of Efficacy Measures 
All efficacy endpoints (e.g., NRS scores), will be summarized over time by [CONTACT_149202]. 
AUC calculations will be done using the standard trapezoidal rule  
AUC  =     ∑ (𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+1
2)𝑥
𝑖=0 ∗ (𝑇𝑖+1− 𝑇 𝑖) 
Where:  NRS i = NRS at time i, and (T i+1 – T i) is the Time difference in minutes between time i 
a
nd time i+1.  A similar calculation and handling of missing data will be performed for the NRS 
scores with ambulation. 
In this study, subjects are permitted to take rescue medication for analgesia.  It is expected 
subjects randomized to placebo arm will take rescue medication more often.  During both 
inpatient and outpatient por
tions of the study, the subjects will be instructed to record NRS 
immediately prior (within approximately 15 min) to taking rescue medication. 
Missing NRS will be handled as discussed in the Study’s SAP and as briefly outlined in Section 
15.6.4.   
15.6.1. P
rimary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint ( AUC 0 to 96h) w ill be conducted using an  
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with t reatment group (four levels) as the main effect.   The 
primar
y analysis will compare the 4.[ADDRESS_697854] at the alpha=0.05 level of significance.

ey Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
If the primary efficacy analysis is statistically significant (p<0.05), then comparisons between the 
4.2 mg CA-008 group and the placebo group will be made for the following endpoints: 
 Percentage of subjects who do not require opi[INVESTIGATOR_536028] (OF) from T0 to T96): 
OF 0 to 96h  
 Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (in daily oral morphine equivalents) = OC from T0 to T96h: OC 0 to 
96h 
 Using NRS at rest: AUC [ADDRESS_697855] at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance.  However, once a nonsignificant result occurs, then all subsequent analyses in the 
hierarchy will be exploratory rather than confirmatory. 
The percentage of subjects who do not require opi[INVESTIGATOR_536056] a logistic 
regression model with treatment group (four levels) as a factor.  The other two key secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed using the same type of ANCOVA model as described for the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
15.6.3. Other Efficacy Analyses 
For the primary endpoint and the three key secondary endpoints, comparisons between the 0.7 
mg C
A-008 group and the placebo group, and between the 2.1 mg CA-008 group and the 
placebo group will be tested using the same model as used for the primary (key secondary) 
analysis of the corresponding endpoint. 
All other AUC and quantitative endpoints will be analyzed using the same type of ANOVA 
model as described for the primary analysis.  All proportion endpoints will be analyzed using the 
same type of logistic regression model as described for the first key secondary efficacy analysis. 
All other efficacy analyses will be conducted using two-sided tests at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance, with no adjustment for multiplicity. 
15.6.4. Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
All efforts will be made to minimize missing data.  These efforts will include the following: 
 Subjects are required to consent continuous data collection even after subjects 
disconti
nue the study treatment; 
 Continue data collection after subjects taking rescue medication; 
 Establish robust effic acy data collection procedures. 
Wit
h the procedures above, it is expected that the missing would be minimal.   
Clinical Trial Protocol               CA-PS-201 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_697856] (LOCF) 
will be
 used. The pre-rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled assessments for 4 hours 
following the r
escue use. Intermittent missing pain scores (due to subject sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not 
be imputed, and AUC will be calculated based on non-missing values. For subjects who drop out 
of the study prior to Day 15, scheduled assessments will first be imputed using the worst prior 
pain score carried forward (WOCF). As sensitivity analyses, the AUC will also be calculated 
where
 assessments after drop out will be imputed using LOCF, using the last scheduled non 
missing pain score prior to drop out. 
For se
condary continuous efficacy endpoints, similar methods as the primary analysis will be 
used.  For categorical endpoints, when assessments are imputed for data after a subject 
discontinues from the study, a WOCF method will be used. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue medication may also be performed.  Additional sensitivity analysis with different missing 
value imput
ation methods for subjects who drop out of the study may also be performed.  All 
imput
ation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP. 
15.7. Analysis of Safety  
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section 15.3).  
Sa
fety will be assessed through treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs); hematologic, biochemical, 
and urinalysis laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements; ECGs; physical exam, surgical 
site and neurosensory assessments.  
No formal statistical comparisons will be performed for safety endpoints. 
15.7.1. Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) reporting system. Treatment-emergent AEs are 
defined as any of the following: 
 Non-serious AEs with onset on the date of treatment with the study treatment through Day [ADDRESS_697857];  
 Serious AEs with onset on the date of treatment with the study treatment through [ADDRESS_697858];  
 AEs that start before the start of treatment but increase in severity or relationship at the time 
of or following the start of treatment through Day [ADDRESS_697859].

IRB NUMBER: 2018-158
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/18/[ADDRESS_1019465]-of-care one or two-level 
posterolateral lumbar fusion surgery with instrumentation using ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix 
on-label for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. 
Background and Significance
Nearly half of the estimated 500,000 bone grafting procedures performed annually in the United 
States involve spi[INVESTIGATOR_158451].1 Traditionally, autologous bone grafts are used to repair damaged 
bone caused by [CONTACT_278066], infection, malignancy, degenerative disease and congenital deformity. 
However, harvesting of bone autograft is an invasive procedure that can lead to significant donor 
site morbidity.2 
Bone graft substitute (BGS) materials offer an alternative to autograft bone capable of supporting 
new bone growth, while avoiding or minimizing the frequent co-morbidities associated with 
autograft harvest from the iliac crest.3-[ADDRESS_1019466]-generation alternative to autograft bone. While traditional processed 
allograft bone can be difficult to shape, shows variable resorption characteristics, and variable 
biological activity, ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix has addressed these issues in their product. 
While containing all the properties required for bone formation, it additionally has a consistency 
that allows it to hold shape in a putty-like consistency.6 ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix can be 
molded into a specific form that allows proper placement, positioning and formation during 
posterolateral lumbar fusion.6  
Description of ViviGen ®6
ViviGen® is manufactured by [CONTACT_453301], Inc. (West Chester, Pennsylvania). ViviGen® 
Cellular Bone Matrix is comprised of cryopreserved viable cortical cancellous bone matrix and 
demineralized bone. ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix is a Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular 
and Tissue-based Product (HCT/P) as defined by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 21 
CFR 1271.3. ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix is processed from donated human tissue, resulting 
from the generous gift of an individual or his/her family. 
ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix contains all of the properties required for bone formation being 
that it is osteoconductive, osteoinductive and osteogenic. Safety of ViviGen® Cellular Bone 
Matrix is defined by [CONTACT_745317]. Packaging and handling is beneficial in that all four sizes of ViviGen® 
Cellular Bone Matrix will thaw in less than 5 minutes, which is vital for cell viability, in that the 
ported pouch allows for the quick and efficient removal of the cryopreservation media and 
rinsing solutions. ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix maximizes cell viability by [CONTACT_745318]. 
Objective
The objective of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to 
compare radiographic fusion rates and patient reported outcomes, including pain and function 
preoperatively and postoperatively, using Depuy ViviGen® Cellular Bone Matrix mixed with 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-158

Version 1.8 October 14, 2018cortical/cancellous allograft in conjunction with an approved Depuy Synthes pedicle screw 
system compared to autograft mixed with cortical/cancellous allograft in conjunction with the 
same DePuy Synthes pedicle screw system used for a one or two- level posterolateral lumbar 
fusion.
Methodology
Study Design
This is a prospective randomized, non-blinded, controlled study.  Patients with a 
diagnosis of degenerative disc disease and/or up to grade I spondylolisthesis and planning to 
undergo a 1- or 2-level instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion surgery between L1-S1 will be 
screened.  If eligible and the subject meets all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria, the subject will be approached about study participation by [CONTACT_11065].  If the subject 
agrees to participate, the consent process will be initiated by [CONTACT_9137]. Once the 
patient has been consented; data including medical history, neurological exam, patient 
questionnaires (VAS, ODI, SF-36) will be collected.  Randomization will occur once a surgery 
date has been scheduled so the appropriate instrumentation can be boarded accordingly.  A 
randomization envelope will reveal randomization treatment group.  The envelopes will be 
generated in a 1:1 fashion and be randomly allocated to an assigned study identification number.
Subjects will be randomized to either:  1) treatment arm where the investigator will use an FDA 
approved/cleared DePuy Synthes spi[INVESTIGATOR_745300]® Cellular Bone 
Matrix mixed with cortical/cancellous allograft or the 2) control arm where the investigator use 
the same DePuy Synthes spi[INVESTIGATOR_745301]/cancellous allograft.   Both treatment groups represent standard of care lumbar 
fusion surgeries using two types of bone graft options to create the arthrodesis as comparators. 
Once the lumbar fusion surgery has taken place as planned; data will be collected 
regarding the surgery performed, including operative time, amount of bone graft used, spi[INVESTIGATOR_745302], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and adverse events/complications.
Study subjects will be followed up at 6-weeks, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months 
postoperatively at the private practice or clinic. During these routine (standard of care) 
postoperative visits, subjects will complete questionnaires (VAS, ODI, SF-36, patient 
satisfaction) and have neurological exam (lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_745303], see appendix 1) completed by [CONTACT_1275].  Adverse events related to device and/or procedure will be evaluated as each 
postoperative visit.  AP and lateral x-rays will be performed at all visits with flexion and 
extension x-rays added at baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months.  A CT scan of the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_745304] 12-month postoperative time frame at the Beaumont-
RO Imaging Center.   Radiographic analysis will be performed and evaluated for fusion status as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_745319], presence of radiolucency, and development of pseudoarthrosis at 
each follow-up visit. 
This study design reflects the current standard of care for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], 
degenerative disc disease and lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis.  Lumbar fusion surgery 
using pedicle screw fixation with autograft and allograft bone grafting options is treatment of 
choice after conservative (non-surgical) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_745305].
Statistical Analysis
IRB NUMBER: 2018-158
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 10/18/[ADDRESS_1019467] of 40 patients; [ADDRESS_1019468] and fusion rate of 86%, there is a 0.80 probability of 0.80 of finding a 
difference for 60 patients.  A 10% dropout rate was considered.  Forty patients may result in low 
statistical power; however, this may be increased by 10 in each arm once enrollment has 
obtained and if needed, and upon agreement with study sponsor.  Enrollment of 40 reflects the 
current allotted grant/budget per the study sponsor for this project. 
There are other studies that analyzed demineralized bone matrix in two-year fusion 
outcomes for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_745306] a similar size population (range between 13 and 28 
patients) to the proposed enrollment for this study, as demonstrated in Vaccaro et al (2007) and 
Kang et al (2012).  Power calculation for the primary outcome of bone fusion was obtained using 
PASS 15.  An 86% fusion rate (Kang et al) was assumed with a 10% dropout rate for both arms.  
Secondary endpoints (VAS, ODI, SF-36, neurological status, and fusion) will be 
quantified to detect changes longitudinally from baseline through 12-months post-surgery.

Data and Safety Monitoring
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749] (including sub-investigators, clinical research manager) will be 
responsible for data and safety monitoring.  All adverse events will be reviewed to 
determine relatedness to the product and reported to sponsor as necessary (if related to product 
and unanticipated according to risk profile).  The data will be reviewed for maintenance of 
confidentiality and integrity as well as the data collection process.  The data and safety review 
will take place every six months from the date of the first patient enrolled into the study or after 
every ten patients enrolled whichever comes first.
Adverse Events
Relevant adverse events (those related to the study device, the surgical procedure, or the lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be recorded in this study. All adverse events will be reviewed for relatedness and 
expectedness by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a case by [CONTACT_745320].  
Protocol Deviations
The investigators are responsible for documenting all protocol deviations, including an 
explanation for why the deviation occurred.  All protocol deviations will be recorded and 
submitted to the IRB per policy.

No occurrence of adverse events related to device by [CONTACT_24473] 12.
Subject Screening and Enrollment
Patients who have already planned a decompressive lumbar laminectomy and fusion surgery will 
be approached about potential study participation.  If the patient wishes to proceed with study 
participation, the study coordinator will go through the informed consent process.  After the 
consent process has been completed, the subject will be further screened for eligibility and given 
the subject questionnaires to complete.  
Screen Failures
If the subject does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one of the exclusion criteria after 
signing consent, then the subject will be considered a screen failure and therefore, not enrolled 
into the study.  The subject will also be considered a screen failure and not enrolled in the study 
if there is a change in surgical treatment based on the surgeon’s observations and best practice 
intraoperatively.  
Withdrawals
A subject who withdraws consent prior to study completion will be removed from the study and 
no longer followed.  The surgery, instrumentation, and bone grafts are FDA approved and 
cleared and considered standard of care.  The subjects may follow-up as needed and per standard 
of care at their own discretion if they decide to no longer participate in the study. 
The reasons for voluntary withdrawal or discontinuation of study subjects will be documented. If 
during the course of the clinical study, a study subject is non-responsive to attempts to schedule 
follow-up visits, communication methods such as phone calls, emails, mail, or other means as 
appropriate in an attempt schedule an appointment or determine if the subject has moved, died, 
or otherwise become lost to follow-up. 
Summary and Rationale of Proposed Study 
The purpose of this study is to collect on-label safety and efficacy data where ViviGen® Cellular 
Bone Matrix is applied to posterolateral lumbar fusion with DePuy Synthes pedicle screw 
system.  It is expected that this study will contribute to the compi[INVESTIGATOR_745309]: 2018-158

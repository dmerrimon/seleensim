3.0 Study Design Summary  
This study  is  designed to satisfy both  the FDA SMBG:2018   and the  ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013, Section 8   
requirements.  Besides different analysis criteria, the main difference between these regulations is 
that FDA SMBG:201 8 requires that both naïve users (people without diabetes) and pe ople with 
diabetes to be  included in the study population.   The ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_143232] states that the study 
population shall only include  people with diabetes.  
The study will be conducted at minimum of one clinical site an d enroll a total of approximately 
370 lay users. Ten to fifteen percent (10 - 15%) of the enrolled subjects will be pe ople without 
diabetes and twenty percent (20%) of subjects enrolled with diabetes will have Type [ADDRESS_143233] 70% of subjects will  be younger than age 65.     
For this study, there must be at least [ADDRESS_143234] results . ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_143235] results , study staff performed 
fingerstick blood and venous blood tests .   
In addition,  per FDA SMBG:[ADDRESS_143236] 
palm  blood samples will be < 80 mg/dL and 10 will be > 250 mg/dL (by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_126974]) .  
Subject enrollment will continue until the required evaluable samples are collected.   
The subjects will be [ADDRESS_143237]  [ZIP_CODE]   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 9 of 38  Procedu res: All subjects will complete the informed consent process before performing any study 
procedures.  
• For All Subjects  
Subjects will be assigned to   use  the T-PLUS meter and randomized to use one of three Contour 
Plus test strip lots throughout the visit.   
The untrained subjects, who have never used  the Ascensia Contour TV3 (Thunder V3 ), and 
Thunder PLUS  meter systems  previously , will be sequestered in such a way that they cannot 
observe o r be influenced by [CONTACT_127002].  They will learn to 
use the T-PLUS  meter by [CONTACT_127003] (UG) and Quick Reference Guide (QRG).  Each 
subject will perform one fingerstick self -test using a Microlet NEXT or si milar lancing device and 
the T-PLUS  meter.  Immediately following the subject self -test, a Tenderlett ™ or similar device 
will be used by [CONTACT_127004]’s finger ( preferably the same hand) to collect a 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_126975].   
Immediately following the Tenderlett lancing, subjects will lance their palm using the Microlet 
NEXT lancing device (with AST clear endcap) and will perform  a self -test using the meter.   
Immediately following the AST test, the staff p erson will perform a fingerstick test on the subject  
with the Microlet device and the T -PLUS meter .  
All subject capi[INVESTIGATOR_126976]-test results and study staff fingerstick results will be compared 
to YSI results from blood obtained from the Tenderlett fingerstick.  
Hematocrit will be measured for all subjects.    
All Subjects will then complete a questionnaire (Questionnaire 1) to provide feedback on the meter 
system and instructions for use (UG and QRG).   
• Additional Procedures for  Subjects w ith Diabetes  
Subjects with diabetes will be given a venipuncture. The venous blood will be tested by [CONTACT_127005]  T-PLUS  system, , and the YSI lab analyzer.  The venipuncture may be performed 
any time after the subject is enrolled (i.e. upon complet ion of  informed consent and passed 
inclusion/exclusion criteria).  
After all self -testing is completed, staff will demonstrate to the subjects with diabetes several 
features of the meter system that would not necessarily be experienced during the brie f accuracy 
testing. These subjects will be given a second questionnaire (Questionnaire 2) to provide feedback 
about the new features of the system.

Manager or designee will review the YSI pre -study glucose control data before the study begins.  
Study control tests: Any YSI used on a given day to test subject blood samples will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_127011] 4 glucose control s at the beginning of the day .  The controls will be tested: 1 sip = 
1 result from white probe and 1 result from black probe. The YSI will be calib rated before each 
serum control sample is tested.    
The sequence of control testing will be:  
1. Calibrate the YSI  
2. Test Control 2 (1 sip)  
3. Calibrate  
4. Test C ontrol 3 (1 sip)  
5. Calibrate  
6. Test Control 4 (1 sip)  
7. Calibrate  
8. Test Control 5 (1 sip)  
Site staff will keep a  maintenance log for each YSI, including daily operational checks, 
maintenance and membrane changes.   A full set of serum controls should also be tested after YSI 
parts are changed (such as buffers, probes, or membranes).    
5.11.[ADDRESS_143287] plasma samples (capi[INVESTIGATOR_126983]) will be tested using [ADDRESS_143288] (=2 results, 1 
from white and 1 from black probe) with calibration of the YSI before the first sip.  A serum 
control (1 sip) will be tested after each subject plasma s ample to verify the YSI Analyzer has 
remained in control during the plasma sample test.  The control with target value close to the 
concentration of the subject plasma sample will be tested.  The average of the black and white 
probe results will be verifie d to be within the ranges shown in Table 5.2.  
If the control result is out of range, the YSI will be recalibrated and the control sample will be 
retested.  If the control result is now within the appropriate range (Table 5.2), the control sample 
is conf irmed as appropriate for use.  The YSI analyzer will then be re -calibrated, the plasma will 
be re -tested, and the control will be tested per the protocol’s plasma testing procedure already 
described.  
If the control result is not within the appropriate range  after the plasma sample has been tested 
twice, the results for this subject sample will be non -evaluable.  
The sequence of testing for each subject sample will be:  
1. Calibrate the YSI  
2. Test plasma sample (1 sip)  
3. Test control (1 sip)  
4. Verify control result (mean of black and white probe results)  is within limits in Table 
5.1.  If it is, stop and record result.  
5. If not, repeat Steps 1, [ADDRESS_143289]  [ZIP_CODE]   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 21 of 38  Glucose values of the YSI replicates (both controls and plasma) should be within 4 mg/dL or 4% 
of each other (i.e. 4 mg/dL  for values < 100 mg/dL and 4% for values ≥ 100 mg/dL).   If they are 
not, an additional assay should be run.  
5.11.4  Recording YSI Results  
The YSI source documents will be labeled as follows throughout the study to facilitate matching 
glucose results .  
Sample ide ntification will include:  
1) Ascensia serum traceability control level or  
2) Subject ID plus either ‘capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]’ or ‘venous’ blood  
The YSI source documents (tapes) will be affixed to plain white paper and photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_126984] , and will be  stored in individual subject’s study file   for source data 
verification .  
NOTE:  If glucose results are not to be used due to operator errors, insufficient sample, etc., this 
should be clearly marked on the YSI source document.  
The YSI o perator will record all non -numeric codes - QNS (Quantity not sufficient), NO (Not 
Obtainable), and error codes as appropriate for the YSI tests.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_143290] Questionnaires  
Site staff will administer two questionnaires to subjects .  Questionnaire 1 will be given to all 
subjects and Questionnaire 2 will be given only to subjects with diabetes.  
5.12.1  Questionnaire 1: Evaluation of Instructions for Use.  (All subjects)  
Staff will administer a questionnaire to all subjects who perform fingerstick self -testing after the 
meter testing is completed.   
The questionnaire will include statements for which a numerical score or rating will be provided 
by [CONTACT_1766] (1=strongly disa gree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree).  These 
numerically scored statements will be tabulated into frequency distributions.   The following 
statements will be subject to the pass/fail criteria listed in the study objectives section:  
• I find  it easy to do a fingerstick blood test with this meter.  
• The meter display is easy to see and read.  
• It was easy to understand my test results.  
• The instructions (User Guide and Quick Reference Guide) were easy to understand.  
• The instructions clearly explain  how to run a test.  
• The instructions clearly explain what to do if an error message is displayed by [CONTACT_127012].    Note: an error message will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_127013]/her testing.

The procedures to be performed under this protocol are considered to be low risk.  
7.1 Description and Classification  
7.1.1.  An AE during a clinical evaluation is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended  
disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, 
users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.”  It is not 
dependent on whether the event is considered to be relate d to the investigational product or the 
study.  An AE includes events not seen at the beginning of the study, or worsened if present at the 
beginning.   Adverse events can be classified as presented in Table 7.1. 
7.1.2.  The next classification to consider i s whether or not the AE is Anticipated or Unanticipated.  
In order for an AE to be considered ‘anticipated’ it must be listed in the protocol and ICF prior to 
any occurrence.  
7.1.3.  For studies on products that have not yet been cleared for market, it is i mportant that all 
AEs be documented and included in the study file.  
7.1.4.  An unanticipated adv erse device effect (UADE) is:  Any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if  that 
effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in 
the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a  device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare 
of subjects [21CFR812.3(s)].  
7.1.5.  All AEs observed by [CONTACT_127018] (including all symptoms) and included in the study file.  
7.[ADDRESS_143295] has a hypoglycemic event, as determined by [CONTACT_079] 
(PI) during a study visit, the subject will be treated by [CONTACT_127019] . Appendices D and 
E note each site’s treatment plan .  
Classification of the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_126985].  If the hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is considered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_126986], it will be 
considered to be an anticipated AE and w ill be recorded on the AE Form.  
Subjects who are hypo - or hyperglycemic may continue with fingerstick testing if they so choose, 
and if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_126987].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_126988] a hypoglycemic

8.1 Criteria to Withdraw / Discontinue a Subject from Study  
Subjects who experience an AE will be withdra wn from the study. Subjects may be withdrawn 
from the study at their own request for any reason, or at the discretion of the PI (or designee) for 
one of the following reasons:  
1) Illness of a subject  
2) Subject non -compliance with protocol requirements  
3) Other, at the discretion of the investigator  
In such cases, the subject will be withdrawn from further study participation.   Any evaluable d ata 
collected from withdrawn subjects will be analyzed and results will be retained for safety 
assessments.   If ava ilable, data will be retained in analyses related to the  objective s of the study 
unless there is a valid reason to believe that the data may be biased, incorrect, or confounded.

devices.”  
The  T -Plus meters, which is the focus of this study, is an  investigational devices. For studies 
involving an investigational device, the sponsor is responsible for determining whether submission 
of an IDE application to FDA is require d before a study may proceed. The IDE regulations (21 
CFR 812) describe three types of device studies: significant risk (SR), nonsignificant risk (NSR), 
and exempt studies.  
Ascensia has determined that the T -Plus study is a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) study  
which   must follow the abbreviated IDE requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including informed 
consent and IRB review, and do not require submission of an IDE application to FDA. As a result 
of this conclusion, Ascensia has not had correspondence with th e FDA regarding determination of 
study classification and risk level.  
Determination of the NSR classification is based on the following:  
• T-Plus meters are not intended to be implantable devices.   
• T-Plus meters are not purported or represented to be for us e in supporting or sustaining 
human life  
• T-Plus meters are not intended to provide substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, 
mitigating, or treating diabetes, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health.  
• T-Plus meters do  not present a potential  for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject.

Prior to study initiation, a n IRB must review this protocol, the ICF, and any other supporting study 
documents which impact subject safety.   The investigational site may not begin the study until the 
IRB has given its written and dated approval via a letter that identifies the version/date of the 
protocol and ICF.  A copy of the IRB approval letter and approved ICF must be provided to the 
Investig ator and to Ascensia prior to the Study Initiation Visit.  
9.[ADDRESS_143304] provide informed consent before she/he can participate in the study.  The 
informed consent process fully apprises the subjects of the risks and benefi ts to them and to society 
for participating in the study.   The ICF will clearly state that designated study personnel will be 
able to view the subject’s medical records.   The ICF will also state that Ascensia representatives 
may observe some subjects as pa rt of study staff training, study monitoring or for troubleshooting 
problems with the investigational devices.  
Clinical Trial Proto col GCA -PRO -[ADDRESS_143305] understands and agrees to participate in the study, she/he will sign the ICF.   All 
subjects will be given a signed copy of the IC F.  If a subject has a question about his/her rights, 
he/she may contact a member of the IRB at any time during or after study participation.  
9.4 Study Documentation Procedures  
The investigator will keep study records for a minimum of three years.   Alternatively, other 
arrangements may be made with Ascensia for study document storage.  
9.5 Study Monitoring   
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_127023].   A monitoring plan will be completed 
by [CONTACT_127024]/designee prior to the study.   The Study Manager or designee will conduct a 
study initiation visit, combined with  1st monitoring visit, at least 3 interim monitoring visits and a 
close -out visit.   Note: the latter two visits may occur within a continuous timeframe.  Study 
monitoring will be performed on site as well as by [CONTACT_127025] . 
Per site/sponsor agreement, selected source documents will be scanned and sent to the sponsor for 
remote monitoring by [CONTACT_456]. Some of the c ritical data points  that will be monitored 100% 
which include , but not limited to :  
• Meter results  
• YSI control and subject plasma results  
• Centrifugation times  
Ascensia representatives may observe some subject visits as part of study monitoring.   This will 
be done under supervision of the investigator.   Ascensia representatives will maintain subject 
confidentiality and will not interfere with rights of human subjects, safety or bias study conduct.  
9.6 Investigator’s Report of Study Closure  
Ascensia r epresentatives will send a letter to the site informing them that the study is closed.  The 
study will be considered closed when the data has been locked for data analysis.  
The Investigator or designee will submit a report summarizing subject disposition and other study 
details, as appropriate, to the Ascensia Study Manager and the reviewing IRB.  This report will be 
completed within 3 months of the study closure date.   
In addition, the Ascensia Study Manager, or designee, will report the completion of th e study to 
the IRB within 6 months of study closure.  
 
9.7 Registration of Trial  
The clinical trial will be registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov as required.  
 
9.8 Clinical Study Reports (CSR)  
Two CSRs will be written by [CONTACT_127026] T -PLUS : one report will evaluate data according to 
ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2013 criteria and one report according to FDA SMBG:[ADDRESS_143306] results. These original Forms will be retained by [CONTACT_39722]. 
In addition to data collection, the EDC system will be used for data cleaning as well as monitoring 
operations.   Site and sponsor users will be trained on the system prior to the study start, and their 
access to EDC system will be contingent upon suc cessful completion of training requirements. 
Study personnel will complete and sign all appropriate source document forms in compliance with 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Source documents (Forms) should be completed legibly, in black 
or blue ink.   If it is necessary to make corrections, a single line should be drawn through the original 
entry, the new entry written in, and the correction initialed and dated by [CONTACT_127027].  
The original forms will be retained by [CONTACT_13177]  a minimum of three years.  
YSI source documents (tapes) will be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_126989].  
Site staff or designees who photocopy the YSI tapes will certify (with signature, date, and YSI ID) 
that the copy is a true and accura te representation of the original.  
11.0 Data Analysis  
The statistical analysis plan for this study is described in document GCA -SAP-2019 -001-01. 
In general, meter results satisfying the pertinent objective criteria will be considered “successes” 
in the Bernoulli sense.  
All fingerstick and AST meter test results will be compared to the capi[INVESTIGATOR_126990].  
All venous blood meter test results will be compared to the venous blood YSI laboratory results.  
 
 
11.1 Primary Objective , 2.1.1, and Se condary Objectives 2.2.1, 2.2.2  (ISO [ZIP_CODE])  
 
The percentages of results from PWD subjects satisfying the ISO [ZIP_CODE] accuracy definition:  
95% of glucose results shall fall within ±15mg/dL of laboratory method  (LabBG)  
at glucose concentration <100 mg/dL and w ithin ±15% at glucose concentrations 
≥100 mg/dL  
will be computed.  
If n = 315 PWD subjects (90% of 350), the critical value is 0.95*315 = 299.25 ≈ 300.  Thus, the 
critical value is associated with testing the hypothesis:  
Clinical Trial Proto col GCA -PRO -[ADDRESS_143307]  [ZIP_CODE]   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 30 of 38  H0: Pr{ISO Accurate result} < 0.[ADDRESS_143308] the alternate:  
H1: Pr{ISO Accurate result} ≥ 0.9678  
(Pardo, 2014) [ADDRESS_143309] H0 at Pr{ISO Accurate result} = 0.9678 is approximately 0.9490.  
 
Other Secondary Accuracy Objectives  
Internal Accuracy Objectives: 2. 2.8, 2.2.9 
 
2.2.8 Criterion 1  
Define criteri on 1:  
T-Plus Meter result with ±12.5mg/dL if LabBG  < 100mg/dL, or  
T-Plus Meter result within ±12.5% of corresponding Lab result  (LabBG) , if LabBG  ≥ 100mg/dL  
 
Test the hypothesis:  
 
H0: p=Pr{meter result satisfies criteri on 1} < 0.9 5 
H1: p=Pr{meter result satisfies criteri on 1} ≥ 0.95 
The critical value , Xc (minimum number of X “successes”) is determined to be the smallest 
number such that Pr{X ≥Xc|p=0.95} ≤ 0.95.  For n = 315, Xc = 294 (power ≈ 0.9263).  
 
2.2.9 Criterion 2  
Define criteri on 2: 
T-Plus Meter result with ±15mg/dL if YSI < 100mg/dL, or  
T-Plus Meter result within ±15% of corresponding YSI result, if YSI ≥ 100mg/dL  
 
Test the hypothesis:  
 
H0: p=Pr{meter result satisfies criteri on 2} < 0.95  
H1: p=Pr{meter result satisfies criteri on 2} ≥ 0.95

 Page 31 of 38  The critical value , Xc (minimum number of X “successes”) is determined to be the smallest 
number such that Pr{X ≥Xc|p=0.95} ≤ 0.95.  If n = 315, Xc = 294 (power ≈ 0.9263).  If n = 350, 
Xc = 327 (power ≈ 0.9246)  
 
11.2 Secondary Objective s 2.2.4, 2.2.5 (FDA SMBG:2018)  
a. At least 95% of n results will fall within ±15% of the corresponding YSI result  
b. At least 99% of n results will fall within ±20% of the corresponding YSI result  
 
These criteria, with n = 350, are equivalent to testing the hypotheses:  
 
H0: Pr{T -Plus meter result within ±15% of LabBG } < 0.9664  
H1: Pr{T -Plus meter result within ±15% of LabBG } ≥ 0.9664  
with Pr{reject H0|p=0.9664} ≈ 0.9488  
 
and: 
 
H0: Pr{T -Plus meter result within ±20% of LabBG } < 0.9960  
H1: Pr{T -Plus meter result within ± 20% of LabBG } ≥ 0.9960  
with Pr{reject H0|p=0.9960} ≈ 0.9466  
 
11.3 Non-Accuracy Objective: Subject Questionnaire [ADDRESS_143311] the hypotheses  for each questionnaire statement:  
 
H0 : Pr{subject response is at least 3, or “ Neutral” to ‘Strongly Agree”} < 0.90  
H1: Pr{subject response is at least 3, or “ Neutral” to ‘Strongly Agree”} ≥ 0.90 
 
The minimum number of “successes”, Xc, to reject H0 is determined such that  
Pr{Reject H0|p=0.90} ≤ 0.95.  
Thus, with n = 315, Xc = 276, with power ≈ 0.9299.

 Page 34 of 38  Appendix B -  Instructions for Collection/Processing of Blood for YSI  
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126992]  
1. The study staff will perform a deep finger puncture using a Tenderlett, or similar, lancing 
device, on the subject’ s finger.  
2. The study staff will express the blood and collect approximately 200 - 300 µL in a blood 
collection tube (e.g. BD Microtainer with lithium heparin).  A hand warmer may be used to 
improve blood flow and facilitate sample collection.   Detailed ins tructions are as follows:  
• Typi[INVESTIGATOR_126993].   It is recommended to practice the 
finger massaging technique prior to puncture.  
• Give subject a hand -warmer to hold for several minutes prior to puncture.  Note that the 
hand-warmer should be moved to the subject’s wrist when ready for puncture and kept 
there during the whole collection procedure.  
• Angle finger with tip slightly downward and squeeze fingertip gently prior to puncture.  
• Consider placement of finger puncture dev ice:  Choose a puncture site that will allow you 
to use your dominant hand to collect the blood.  The device should be aligned so that the 
opening (where the blade comes out) is perpendicular to the grooves of the fingerprint and 
so that the opening is pla ced to the side of the finger (not too close to the nail).  
• While continuing to hold the fingertip, squeeze firmly, hold device firmly against side of 
finger and trigger the blade.  Then turn the finger so that the nail is facing up.  
• Remove pressure from fi ngertip (to allow capi[INVESTIGATOR_126994]) and collect the first 
drop.  
• Begin massaging motion – continuous message of sides of the finger – this is critical.  
• Continue massaging finger from base to tip as you continue to collect the blood drops into 
the tube.  If blood flow reduces it may help to press on the nail a bit in between massaging 
the finger.  Having the subject stand up and drop their hand may also help.  
 
Processing of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126995]  
1. Once collected, process  the microtainer tube for laboratory glucose analysis as follows:   
• Label all tubes with the subject number and a C or a V (Capi[INVESTIGATOR_126996]) as appropriate 
using a Sharpie marker.   
• Gently invert the microtainer tube several times to mix the anticoagul ant.  
• Centrifuge the whole blood immediately to separate the plasma from the red blood cells.  
Centrifugation must occur within [ADDRESS_143316].  Timing of all meter 
testing/centrifugation will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.   
• It is recommended that after centrifugation, the plasma is transferred from the microtainer 
tube to a micro/dispo tube or similar container.  Ensure the container is labeled and the cap 
is secured.  
• The capped plasma sample may be kept at room temperature for up to [ADDRESS_143317]  [ZIP_CODE]   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 35 of 38  2. If testing on the YSI Analyzer is not completed within 4 hours of sample collection, the plasma 
should be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, after which it should be frozen until the sample is 
tested.  
3. Shipment of samples to Ascensia for glucose determinations may be recommended if YSI 
Analyzers do not meet the accuracy guidelines for the Ascensia traceability control sera. 
Arrangements will be made to ship the samples with dry ice via prepaid express mail should it 
become nec essary.  
4. Glucose values of the YSI replicates (controls and plasma) should be within 4 mg/dL or 4% of 
each other; if not, an additional assay should be run.  
5. Insufficient (or suspected to be insufficient) samples, missing samples, and other sample issues 
should be recorded in the CRF and on the YSI printout as appropriate.   If a sample is 
hemolyzed, record in the CRF.

 Page 36 of 38  Appendix C - Instructions for Hematocrit Sample Preparation & Testing  
 
Staff  performing the hematocrit will be trained in this procedure during the initiation visit by [CONTACT_127028].    
1. Two hematocrit tubes will be obtained from each subject’s blood.   One tube will be measured 
and the result recorded on the form.   The second tube will be measured only if the first tube 
was not adequate for measurement.  Note:  
• Sample that is collected from venous blood will be collected in un-treated micro -
hematocrit tubes .   
• Samples collected from capi[INVESTIGATOR_126997] -
hematocrit tubes.    
2. Place a microhematocrit tube against the surface of the blood drop.   Do not place the opening 
of the tube flush against the skin or it will be occluded.  
3. Fill the microhematocrit tube about halfway.  Do not o ver-fill.  Then immediately place one of 
the microhematocrit tube openings in the clay sealant.  Press into the clay [ADDRESS_143319] the sealed microhematocrit tube into the micro -centrifuge.   Note: it is very im portant to 
place the microhematocrit tube in centrifuge rotor with clay side pointed outward.   Spin for 
approx. 2 mins.   Use dialed setting on StatSpin centrifuge.  
5. Measure hematocrit using StatSpin Crit -reader or other hematocrit reader approved by [CONTACT_103].  
6. Instructions for  the StatSpin Crit -reader : 
• After collection and centrifugation of hematocrit, place tube rotor in StatSpin Crit -reader, 
with clay side to the right.   
• Slide the marker on the crit -reader to the exact line where the clay and red bloo d cells meet 
(this is the “0” line).  Press set button until “0” shows in the display.   
• Then move marker all the way over to the other end of the tube to the exact line where the 
plasma ends – press the set button until “100” shows in the display.   
• Now y ou are ready to read the hematocrit result.  Slide the marker to the exact line where 
the red blood cells meet the plasma.  
• The result in the display is the hematocrit percentage for that sample.

 Page 38 of 38  Attachment 1:   Proper Handling of Ascensia YSI Serum Controls  
 
Ascensia R&D completed characterization of six -level serum controls purchased from Bio -
Techne® (formerly Bionostics).  During the characterization, staff observed that sample 
stratification during thawing can occur if the control vials are not ha ndled judiciously.  The 
recommended procedure is as follows.  
 
1. Thaw the frozen control amber glass vials at [ADDRESS_143321] 1 0 times.  
3. Prepare an aliquot of each level in capped microcentrifuge tubes.  Cap tightly.  We prefer 
Fisherbrand™ Microcentrifuge 0.5mL tubes (PN 02 -681-333) with O -ring seal caps (PN 02 -
681-358).  
4. Store any remaining control in the amber glass vials at [ADDRESS_143322] all thawed control —aliquot tubes and amber 
glass vials —after two weeks.  
8. Since slow thawing for 2 -3 days is recommended, it is advisable to keep an extra thawed set 
available for testing.

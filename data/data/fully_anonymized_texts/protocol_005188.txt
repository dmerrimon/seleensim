1) Brief Overview  
 
For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489259], a key component of high -quality care includes goals -of-care 
discussions (GOCD) conducted early during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489260]’ goals of care should inform 
current care plans. These goals -of-care discussions are associated with improved patient and family outcomes 
and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_265095], GOCD during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489261]. The failure to conduct these conversations and to ensure that care received is aligned with 
patients’ wishes for care is particularly a concern for older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those 
with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).  
 
This study, funded by [CONTACT_45455], evaluates the Jumpstart  intervention, the key to which is the “Jumpstart Guide.”  
There are two versions of the Jumpstart Guide being tested, one that is “clinician -facing” and includes 
information identifying the dates of prior advance care planning documents (e.g.,  living wills , healthcare 
directives, durable power of attorney for healthcare) and Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatments 
(POLST forms) in the electronic health record (EHR) to the clinician. It also includes “just -in-time” suggestions 
for having a GOCD. The other guide is “patient -specific” and “bi -directional”.  It is patient -specific because it 
provides goals of care information from patient’s self -reported surveys and is then shared with his/her 
clinician.  It is bi -directional because there is one Jumpsta rt that goes to the clinician and another version that 
goes to the patient or , if the patient doesn’t have decisional capacity, a  family member. These one -page 
Jumpstart Guides include not only indications of prior advance care planning documents (both gui des) and 
preferences (patient -specific guide only) but also tips to improve this communication that are tailored either 
for clinicians or patients and family members.  
 
The study comprises two linked, complementary randomized trials.  Trial 1, a large prag matic trial, compares 
usual care with the clinician -facing Jumpstart for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489262] (target n=2000; 
ADRD subset, target n=400). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial is a three -arm trial that compares the 
clinician -facing Jumpstart, the bi -directional, patient -specific Jumpstart and usual care (n=600). Subjects are 
enrolled from the UW Medicine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center - Montlake, UW 
Medical Center – Northwest).  For Trial 1, eligible patients are ≥ 55 years, admitted for a minimum of 12 and a 
maximum of 96 hours  prior to study enrollment  to inpatient services, without a documented GOCD during 
admission, and meet criteria for serious illness; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] >[ADDRESS_628898] be sufficiently fluent in English to complete 
questionnaires and not be under COVID precautions to allow in -person recruitment.  For Trial 2, eligible family 
may i nclude any of the following:  legal guardians, durable power of attorney for healthcare, spouses, adult 
children, parents, siblings, domestic partners, other relatives, and friends. In addition, we will conduct 
qualitative interviews with key stakeholders including patients/families (n=40, subgroup of patients enrolled 
for Trial 2) and clinicians (n=50 across Trial 1 and Trial 2).  
 
2) Specific Aims:  
 
Specific Aim 1 (Trial 1) : Evaluate the effectiveness of a novel clinician -facing Jumpstart, compared with usual  
care, for improving the quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals -of-care 
discussion during the 30 days after enrollment . Secondary outcomes focus on intensity of care: ICU use, ICU 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176620] , costs of care during t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 7 - and 30 -day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  
 
Specific Aim 2 (Trial 2) : Evaluate the efficacy of the bi -directional, patient -specific Jumpstart compared to the 
clinician -facing Jumpstart and usual care for improving quality of care; the prim ary outcome is EHR 
documentation of a goals -of-care discussion 30 days after enrollment .  Secondary outcomes include: intensity 
of care outcomes from Aim 1 and patient - and family -reported outcomes assessed by [CONTACT_489287] 3 -5 days and 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  4 
4-6 weeks after random ization, including occurrence and quality of goals -of-care discussions in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
goal -concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs.  
 
Specific Aim 3 :  Conduct a mixed -methods evaluation of the implementation of  both interventions, guided by 
[CONTACT_39505] -AIM framework for implementation science, incorporating quantitative evaluation of intervention reach 
and adoption, as well as qualitative analyses of interviews with participants, to explore barriers and facilitators 
to future implementation and dissemination.   
 
3) Research Plan  
 
a) Background and Significance  
 
People near the end of life often receive care they would not choose .48,49 The National Academy of  
Medicine has documented these discrepancies in care and identified advance care planning and goals -of-care 
discussions as primary mechanisms for addressing them.48 This type of communication is a focus for 
improvement for two key reasons: 1) when goals -of-care discussions occur, they are associated with improve d 
quality of care and patient - and family -centered outcomes including increased quality of life, reduced 
symptoms of psychological distress, and fewer intensive treatments at the end of life;1,7,50,51 and 2) clinicians 
frequently do not have goals -of-care discussions with their patients until very late in the illness.1,3-6 
 
The value of advance care planning discussions with healthy individuals is a topic of debate ; however  
improving goals -of-care discussions for those with serious illness facing difficult treatment decisions is  widely 
agreed upon as  an urgent need that can improve patient outcomes.1-6 There is an emerging consensus on this 
important distinction between ACP for healthy individuals and goals -of-care discussions for those with chronic 
life-limiting illness and on the critical importance of timely goals -of-care discussions.1,7,8 Furthermore, even if 
advance care planning does occur in the outpatient setting, effective  goals -of-care discussions (a component of 
advance care planning for more proximal decision -making) are still needed for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489263].52,5 5,56 In 
short, for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489259], a key component of high quality care includes goals -of-care 
discussions conducted early during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489264]’ goals inform current care.4,53,57 These early hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489265].58 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_489266] a large number of patients, early hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489267] -of-care discussions 
often do not occur.4,59 A recent research agenda for s erious illness communication, supported by [CONTACT_489288], highlights the importance of promoting high -
quality goals -of-care discussions, as well as the potential opportunity to use the EHR to both i dentify those 
patients who would benefit from goals -of-care discussions and to guide clinicians in high -quality discussions.8 
We propose two complementary trials to examine the effectiveness of such interventions, and we use an 
innovative hybrid effectiven ess-implementation approach that evaluates the interventions and their 
implementation.23 
 
b) Innovation  
 
Use o f the EHR to identify seriously ill, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489268] a goals -of-care discussion : Recent research 
agendas highlight the lack of research utilizing the EHR to implement interventions that  improve serious illness 
communication.8,[ADDRESS_628899] developed an innovative NLP/ML protocol to identify inpatient and outpatient documentation of goals -
of-care discussions in any type of EHR note, including admission notes, progress notes, and discharge 
sum maries ( see preliminary data ). In this way, we not only target a population likely to benefit from the 
intervention but also do so with methods that are generalizable and scalable.105 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  [ADDRESS_628900] art in an innovative study design : The 
intervention is based on our recently completed trial in the outpatient setting of the patient -specific 
intervention (Jumpstart), which is an individualized communication -priming intervention, targeting both 
patients and clinicians and providing each with information obtained from patient surveys in order to guide a 
goals -of-care discussion.2 This intervention is innovative because it is one of the few that involves clinicians as 
well as patients and family members (bi -directional). However, a question raised by [CONTACT_489289]2 
was whether the individualized survey -based component was necessary, especially given the resources needed 
to implement it. Therefore, we have developed this innovative study design  that combines a large pragmatic 
trial of a clinician -facing Jumpstart compared to usual care (using a waiver of informed consent to facilitate 
enrollment and the pragmatic approach) and a smaller comparative effectiveness trial of a bi -directional, 
patien t-specific Jumpstart that will include individual patient or surrogate consent for participation as well as 
completion of surveys to generate the patient -specific Jumpstart.  
 
Develop an innovative effectiveness -implementation approach that advances implementation and 
dissemination : Few evidence -based communication interventions are widely adopted. Barriers to 
implementation include factors at the level of individual patients, clinicians, operating clinical units, and 
healthcare systems.106,107 The RE -AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) 
framework systematically addresses these factors and, in turn, translates interventions like Jumpstart into the 
“real world”.24-28 This study will include a novel hybrid effectiveness -imple mentation approach that can 
accelerate implementation and dissemination of the interventions after the study by [CONTACT_489290] –
during the study –strategies and outcomes that will facilitate uptake of the interventions in the future.23,28,108 -110 
This innovative design offers the opportunity to advance implementation science in palliative care and 
increases the utility of this study.  
 
4) Research Design and Methods  
 
a) Overview  
 
We will conduct two linked, complementary randomized trials of a clinician -facing or a bi -directional,  
patient -specific intervention to promote and guide goals -of-care discussions for older, seriously ill, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489269]. Trial 1 assesses 
effecti veness of the clinician -facing Jumpstart compared with usual care in a large pragmatic trial not requiring 
patient or family consent (Aim 1, Trial 1). Trial 2 examines the efficacy of the patient -specific Jumpstart Guide  
as compared with the clinician -facing Jumpstart and usual care (Aim 2, Trial 2). In addition, we will examine the 
implementation of the interventions using the RE -AIM framework24-27 (Aim 3). Figure 1 provides an overview of 
the design.  
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  6 
 
 
b) Setting  
 
We will conduct this study with a diverse population drawn from 3 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489270], including  
a university hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (UW Medical Center, UWMC), a county, safety -net hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Harborview Medical Center, 
HMC), and a community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Northwest Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469716], NWHMC). UWMC provides 
specialist care for the Pacific Northwest region and has  529 acute care beds and 75 ICU beds. HMC is operated 
by [CONTACT_489291] 413 acute care beds and 94 ICU beds. HMC is the only Level 1 Trauma 
Center serving five states, and its mission population includes inner city poor, recent immigr ants, and persons 
with HIV/AIDS. NWHMC is a community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] [ADDRESS_628901] been able to access and use.16-21  
 
c) Patient population  
 
Eligible patients over 55 will be identified by [CONTACT_48334] -10 codes  for one or more of the nine  chronic conditions used 
by [CONTACT_489292]:134 dementia, malignant cancer/leukemia, chronic pulmonary disease, coronary artery 
disease, heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes with end -organ da mage, and 
peripheral vascular disease. These nine  conditions account for 90% of deaths among Medicare beneficiaries in 
the US.135,[ADDRESS_628902] s ufficient English language proficiency to 
complete surveys.  
 
d) Description of participants  
 
 
 

Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  [ADDRESS_628903] the following information about study participants.  
 
Patients: Age, race, ethnicity, sex, comorbidities and acute severity of illness including th e National Early 
Warning Score (NEWS). For Trial 2, we will additionally collect education, marital status, health status (SF -1) 
and income.  
 
Families: Age, race, ethnicity, sex, education, marital status, health status (SF -1), relationship to patient, li ving 
situation related to patient.  
 
Clinicians: Age, race, ethnicity, sex, education.  
 
e) Sampling patients with ADRD  
 
Given the dramatically increasing prevalence of ADRD in the US and the rising intensity of care among these 
patients,11,[ADDRESS_628904] of interventions to improve quality of 
palliative care in this group. We designed both trials to be powered to examine heterogeneity of treatment 
effects (HTE) in this important group. For Trial [ADDRESS_628905]  to maximize this subgroup sample 
size. We hypothesize that the interventions will be equally effective in this popul ation, but that the proportion 
of patients with decisional capacity will be lower (enrolling more family members). However, we believe it is 
important to explicitly examine this hypothesis given the unique features of intensity of care at the end of life 
for this important and increasing population.  
 
f) Randomization  
 
Patients are randomized  in a 1:1 ratio in Trial 1 and 1:1:[ADDRESS_628906]. Participating family members or legal surrogate decision makers are 
assigned to the same arm as the corresponding patient.   
 
g) Intervention  
 
Clinician -facing Jumpstart :  First, we use automated methods to examine inpatient and outpatient EHR notes 
prior to the current admission, identifying current code status as well as all prior POLST forms and advance 
directives; this informat ion is included on Jumpstart Guides to inform discussions. Second, we deliver the 
Jumpstart Guide to the primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219350] (all attending and resident physicians and advanced practice 
providers) via secure email and  either  a page  (Trial 1) or Epic Secu reChat message (Trial 2)  alerting the 
physicians to the presence of the Jumpstart Guide in their email, with the addition of in -person delivery of a 
paper version in Trial 2 only.     
 
Bi-directional Jumpstart  (Trial 2 only) :  First, information about the patient is abstracted  from the EHR in the 
same way as for the Clinician -facing Jumpstart. Second, patients or their legal surrogate decision -maker 
complete baseline survey items assessing three domains: a) preferences for di scussions about goals of care; b) 
barriers and facilitators for having such discussions; and c) current goals of care. Third, using the EHR and 
baseline survey, we use the automated algorithm from our prior trial9 adapted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489271] -centered design methods10 to create a survey -informed Jumpstart Guide to prompt and guide goals -of-
care discussions between the patient and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489272], if the patient isn’t able, the family member and th e 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219350] (see supplement for sample Jumpstart Guide). Finally, in the fourth step, we deliver the 
Jumpstart Guides to the primary team via secure email similar to Trial 1, as well as in -person delivery to 
members of the team.  We also provide a surv ey-informed Jumpstart Guide to the patient or family, adapted 
with phrasing and terminology  specifically for the patient and family.  All Jumpstart Guides are delivered on 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  8 
the day of randomization with the goal of prompting a goals -of-care discussion early  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as 
supported by [CONTACT_66427].11 The bi -directional Jumpstart includes both EHR - and patient -
tailored suggestions for conducting goals -of-care discussions based on survey responses.  The suggestions are 
guided by [CONTACT_489293], a nationally -acclaimed program for teachin g serious illness 
communication, and adapted to the inpatient setting,12,1 3 as well as by a human -centered design exercise with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489273].10 
 
 
5) Outcomes  
 
a) Outcomes from the EHR and Death Certificates (Trials 1 and 2):  
 
The primary outcome for both trials is EHR documentation of goals -of-care discussions within 30 days after 
randomization. Our rationale for this as the primary outcome is that this is the primary target for all 
interventions and important to diverse stakeholde rs including patients and their families.1,14 -17 We will use 
NLP/ML methods to identify goals -of-care discussions.[ADDRESS_628907] EHR abstraction methods19-21 for a randomly selected subset of patients in each 
trial to evaluate potential misclassification wi th  NLP/ML methods.  
  
Additional outcomes for both trials, obtained from the EHR, include utilization metrics associated with 
intensity of care (i.e., any ICU admissions, any ED visits, any palliative care consultations, and ICU - and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
free days); t hese outcomes will be assessed at 30 and 90 days after randomization. ICU - and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -free days 
are defined as the number of days alive and outside of the ICU (or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) within the specified time period 
after randomization (i.e. 30 days or 90 days).22,23 We will also examine the following outcomes: 1) time to first 
goals -of-care discussion during the 30 days af ter randomization; 2) occurrence of any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489274] 7 and 30 days after discharge from the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and 3) mortality status at 90 days and 1 
year after randomization. Costs of care during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179] 30 - and 90 -days following randomization 
will be obtained from institutional billing systems.  Washington State death certificate data will be used to 
examine mortality after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (Table 1).  
 
b) Outcomes derived from patient - and family -reports (Trial 2 only) : 
 
Additional outcomes for Trial 2 will be obtained from patient or family surveys. Surveys will be completed 
targeting three time points: 1) baseline; 2) 3 -5 days after randomization; and 3) 4 -8 weeks after randomization. 
Surveys may be completed in perso n, online, by [CONTACT_2319], or by [CONTACT_648], based on respondents’ preferences.    
 
Occurrence and quality of discussions : We use previously validated items to assess the occurrence and quality 
of goals -of-care communication during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489275].9,24 -30 Communication 
occurrence is assessed with a single item.9,25 Quality of goals -of-care communication is assessed with the end -
of-life communication scale (QOC_eol) of the Quality of Communication ( QOC) survey, developed from 
qualitative interviews and focus groups with a diverse group of patients, families, and clinicians.24,26,28  
 
Goal -concordant care : Concordance between the care patients want and the care they are receiving will be 
measured with two questions from SUPPORT.[ADDRESS_628908] question defines patients’ priorities for extending life 
or ensuring comfort. The second question assesses patients’ perceptions of their current treatment using the 
same two options.[ADDRESS_628909] to identify patients’ top priority.32-34 If 
patients are unable to respond, goals of care are elicited from family as they would be in clinical practice.35   
 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  9 
Symptoms of anxiety and depression : Patient and family symptoms of anxiety and depression are ass essed 
with the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS).36,37 Patients and families will complete these surveys 
for themselves only; we do not ask for surrogate report of patients’ psychological symptoms.  The goal is not to 
diagnose the clinical syndromes of anxiety or depression, but rather to  identify the burden of symptoms.  
 
Utilization :  In addition to measuring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489276], we will use patient or family 
reports of patient emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and outpatient visits following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489277].  By [CONTACT_489294], we expect to capture utilization that occurs outside of UW  Medicine.  
 
c) Implementation outcomes (Trials 1 and 2)  
 
Assessment of the implementation of the interventions in Aim [ADDRESS_628910] ementation research38-41 and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).[ADDRESS_628911] quantitative and qualitative data on reach, effectiveness, adoption, 
implementation, and maintenance (RE -AIM) of the intervention. Quantitative data are collected as  routine 
tracking as part of the implementation of both trials, with data on participation, intervention use, fidelity to 
the intervention, and changes over time (Table 2). Qualitative data are collected through short, semi -
structured interviews (10 -30 min utes) guided by [CONTACT_489295].  The interviews are conducted in -person or 
by [CONTACT_489296] (n=20) and family members (n=20) from Trial 2, and clinicians (n= 50) from either Trial 1 
or 2 after study involvement.  All participants are selected using purposive sampling to ensure a diverse group 
based on level of participation, race, ethnicity, age, gender and, for clinicians, specialty, and year of training. A 
trained qualitative interviewer will interview participants using an interview guide, and int erviews will be 
audio -recorded and transcribed.16,43 -59.

6) Analyses  
 
We will follow the  intention -to-treat principle for all analyses.  
 
a) Primary Outcome (presence of goals of care discussion within 30 days after randomization)  
 
The effect of intervention on the primary outcome will be quantified  by [CONTACT_489297] a linear regression model with robust standard errors. The predictor of interest is 
randomization arm (Clinician -facing Jumpstart or usual care for Trial 1; or Clinician -facing Jumpstart, Bi -
directional Jumpstart, or usual care for Trial 2). The model will adjust for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489282], since 
randomization is stratified on these factors. This model assumes the effect of intervention is the same for 
patients with and without ADRD. We will also i nclude an interaction between randomization arm and ADRD, 
which allows the effect of intervention to vary by [CONTACT_489298].  We will evaluate the timing of goals -of-care discussions with a  Cox proportional 
hazards model.  
 
b) Additional Outcomes  
 
For the analysis of the other outcomes, we will use a strategy similar to that for the primary outcome. For 
continuous outcomes (e.g., ICU -free days, HADS score), the effect of intervention will be qu antified by a 
difference in means. For survey outcomes which are collected at more than one time point after 
randomization, we will use a mixed model to account for the correlation between repeated measures. Our 
initial model will allow the average respons e to be different at each time point, but assume the intervention 
has the same effect at each time. We will also allow the effect of intervention to be different across time by 
[CONTACT_489299]. The advantage of using the data at the multiple time 
points and a mixed model approach is that we can gain precision; it also allows for missing responses, 
assuming responses are missing at random. Missing data are more of an issue for the survey outcomes than 
the primary outcom e; we will quantify the amount and type of missing data, evaluate associations of 
missingness with participant characteristics, and apply appropriate methods to account for missing data.61 
 
c) Evaluate implementation and identify barriers and facilitators to future implementation.  
 
We will perform thematic content analysis of transcribed interviews to ex plore feedback on the intervention, 
ways to improve intervention implementation, and aspects of care not adequately addressed by [CONTACT_283800] .62-64 Interview guides and analyses will be guided by [CONTACT_39505] -AIM and CFIR framework s as 
described above.38-42 Qualitative data will be imported to analytic software (Dedoose), where investigators will 
perform the following analytic steps using an iterative approach to thematic a nalysis65: 1) initially code 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  11 
material, devising a coding framework a nd using that framework to reduce the text into smaller segments; 2) 
identify themes from the coded text; 3) construct thematic networks that include basic themes, organizing 
themes and global themes; 4) describe and summarize thematic networks; and 5) int erpret patterns that have 
emerged in and across thematic networks.  
 
7) Sample size  
 
a) Sample size considerations for the primary outcome   
 
The focus for sample size considerations is the primary outcome: proportion of patients with documented 
goals -of-care d iscussions within 30 days after randomization.  
 
Trial 1:  With a total sample size of 2000 (1000 per group), two -sided significance level (α) of 0.05, and a 
variance estimate based on the proportion in the control group only, we have 80% power to detect a 
difference in proportions between those randomized to Clinician -facing Jumpstart and usual care of at least 
0.06. We assumed a proportion in the control group of 0.[ADDRESS_628923] in Trial 1 is 400 (20 0 per group), we would have 80% power with α=0.[ADDRESS_628924].  
 
Trial 2:  With a total sample size of 600 (200 per Clinician -facing Jumpstart, 200 per Bi -directional Jumpstart, 
and 200 per usual care),  we have 80% power to detect a difference in proportions of 16% for each of the 3 
pairwise comparisons assuming an overall α=0.05 and a Bonferroni adjustment for the 3 comparisons (α=0.017 
for each comparison) and variance based on a proportion of 0.54.    
 
b) Sample size for qualitative analyses  
 
For Aim 3 qualitative analyses, it is important to achieve theoretical saturation (no new themes emerging).64,66 
Based on our prior studies, we anticipate achieving saturation by 80 interviews for understanding 
patients/families and clinician perspectives.16,46,54 -59 We will monitor for saturation and will recruit addition al 
participants if needed.  
  
8) Data management and quality control to achieve scientific rigor  
 
This project requires the creation, maintenance, and analysis of a database that includes a variety of measures 
from multiple sources.  This study, like all studi es, depends on the quality of the data and therefore systematic 
data collection, quality control, and data -management procedures will be implemented: 1) protocols for data 
collection; 2) rigorous training, certification, and periodic re -training of study s taff, with ongoing monitoring of 
adherence to protocols; 3) regular review of questionnaire response rates, respondent burden,[ADDRESS_628925] problems; 4) verification of all data through custom -designed data entry systems; 
and 5) weekly  team meetings to provide feedba ck to study staff to ensure problems are resolved quickly. To 
ensure reliability and validity of data, we will use our current methods for training and quality control.68-72 Staff 
conducting EHR review will undergo the following training : instruction on the protocol, guided practice 
abstraction, and independent abstraction with reconciliation by a trainer.  
 
9) Protocol modifications  
 
1. Changes to inclusion/exclusion criteria for Trials 1 and 2 (except where noted)  
a. Lowering the inclusion criteria age from ≥65 to ≥55 years  
b. Removing “English speaking” as an inclusion criterion (Trial 1 only)  
c. Adding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a mi nimum of 12 hours as an inclusion criterion  
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  12 
d. Removing markers of frailty as an eligibility criterion  
e. Adding pregnancy, suicide attempt and same -day discharge as exclusion criteria  
f. Adding COVID -19 as a specific inclusion diagnosis  (Trial 1 only)  
2. Study design  
a. For Trial 2, in addition to comparing the bi -directional (survey -based) Jumpstart Guide to the 
clinician -facing (EHR -based) Jumpstart guide, we will also include a third arm in which patients 
receive usual care.  
b. We have increased the target sample size f rom n=400 to n=[ADDRESS_628926] “usual care” arm to the study.  
c. We have modified the questionnaires that patients receive at baseline such that only patients 
in the bi -directional Jumpstart arm are presented with items that are use d to create the bi -
directional (survey -based) Jumpstart Guide. These items are an integral part of the bi -
directional intervention and therefore not appropriate for the other arms to complete.  
3. Procedures  
a. Removing data collection for acute severity of illn ess ( e.g.,  SOFA score) for Trial [ADDRESS_628927] numbers for clinician interviews from 20 to 50 across both trials  
d. Addition of demographic items (required by [CONTACT_20950], NIH) to the clinician interview  
4. Materials  
a. Updated instructional video for clinicians in Trial 1  
b. Revision of the Jumpstart Guide into an HTML format as a delivery option. This version 
includes optional feedback buttons at the bot tom (options: will definitely use; will use if time 
allows; maybe, will consider; not appropriate; will not see this patient; already done; opt out; 
other/free text)  
c. Updated language and formatting for all versions of the Jumpstart Guide (patient, clinicia n 
EHR-based, and clinician survey -based)  using a human -centered design approach .10  
 
10) Potential limitations and alternative approaches  
 
a) Including ADRD and other diseases in same study  
 
Patients with ADRD receive different intensity of care at the end of life compared to other chronic 
diseases,73,[ADDRESS_628928] and other 
illnesses, but this would decrease the generalizability of the interventions.  
 
b) Generalizability  
 
This study occurs in a single healthcare system but  includes three diverse hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489283] y. 
 
c) Misclassification of goals -of-care discussions  
 
Goals -of-care discussions may be misclassified  for two reasons: 1) the sensitivity and specificity of the NLP/ML 
algorithm is not perfect; and 2) documentation of goals -of-care discussions in the EHR will never perfectly 
reflect actual discussions. This misclassification could affect outcome assessmen t and patient identification. 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  13 
For outcome assessment, we will assess the accuracy of the NLP/ML algorithm against manual EHR review in a 
randomly selected  sample  of patients to evaluate the extent of misclassification.  For our final algorithm, we 
will use  human abstractors to verify the first documentation of a goals -of-care discussion for each patient to 
maximize positive predictive value and specificity, as has been done by [CONTACT_2312].75,76  However, since our goal is 
to prompt a nd guide more discussions than would happen without the interventions, the limitations of the 
NLP/ML algorithm for patient identification do not invalidate the randomized trials. We could have included all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489284], but we believe that untargeted prompts might limit 
the impact of the intervention. In addition, we will use the interviews in Aim 3 to understand clinicians’ 
perspectives on the effect of misclassification.  
 
d) Contaminatio n 
 
It is possible that this i ntervention might change behavior for clinicians caring for patients randomized to the 
comparator arms. Our prior studies suggest that most clinicians require a patient -specific prompt to have 
timely goals -of-care discussions, which may mitigate this conce rn.9,[ADDRESS_628929] the null hypothesis and only be a major issue for a negative study.  
 
e) Scalability of surveys in Trial [ADDRESS_628930] to address scalability for implementation.  
 
f) Objective assessments of the quality of goals of care discussions  
 
Our NLP/ML approach identifies goals -of-care discussions without assessing their quality. Si nce our prior trials 
demonstrated increased patient assessed quality with the Jumpstart intervention, this is less of a concern .9,25 
Future NLP/ML advances may permit quality assessm ents. Trial 2 assesses quality of communication from 
patient and family perspectives.  
 
g) Costs assessments focus on UW Medicine  
 
Cost assessments for Aim [ADDRESS_628931] of the benefits we anticipate for this 
intervention will occur during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], although there may be ongoing reductions in costs after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489285] a result of the intervention. We will evaluate for such 
effects in Trial 2, and the limitation of not having access to these costs  from outside UW Medicine  in Trial 1 is 
diminished somewhat because this is a randomized trial.  
 
11) Anticipated findings  
 
These interventions use the EHR to identify patients who should have documentation of a goals -of-care 
discussion but do not, and then prompt and guide such discussions with either: a) a clinician -facing prompt and 
guide for clinicians only, along with info rmation about prior advance care planning completed prior to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or b) a bi -directional, patient -specific intervention that provides patient -specific support to 
clinicians, patients and family members. We anticipate that both interventions  will be effective compared to 
the usual care  arm, and that this study will provide important options for healthcare systems. Economic 
analyses will allow us to evaluate the effect on costs of care, after factoring in the costs of implementing these 
interv entions, to enhance dissemination. If either or both of these interventions are not effective, the results 
Study Protocol : PI[CONTACT_57857] -H  PI: J. Randall Curtis  Page  [ADDRESS_628932] and deliver future 
interventions.

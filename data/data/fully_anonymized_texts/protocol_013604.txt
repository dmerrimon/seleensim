Study Objectives 
1. Establish the safety of using tranexamic acid in the treatment of chronic subdural 
hematomas 
2. Determine if the use of oral tranexamic acid reduces the rate of ipsilateral 
recurrence following drainage of chronic subdural hematomas 
 
Background 
Chronic subdural hematomas are a common problem faced by [CONTACT_134240] 13.5/100,000 persons per year and up to 58/100,000 in the over 65 years old 
population (Kudo). Their treatment is often complicated by [CONTACT_134241] 33% (Muzii). Currently there is no good strategy to help avoid this problem, which adds 
significantly to patient morbidity. The pathogenesis of this problem is believed to be related to the 
propensity of the associated neo-membranes to bleed (Ito, Weir, Lim, Labadie). Ito et.al. showed 
with labeled red blood cells that bleeding continues to occur into the hematoma cavity (1976). It 
has also been shown that there are high levels of tissue plasminogen activator in the outer 
membrane of chronic subdural hematomas (Ito 78 and Labadie 74). Lim et.al. found that ratio of 
tissue plasminogen activator to plasminogen activator inhibitor contributed to the pathogenesis 
(Lim 95). It has also been shown that chronic subdural hematomas have high levels of fibrin 
degradation products which in addition to marking the breakdown of fibrin are themselves anti-
hemostatic by [CONTACT_134242] (Nieuwenhuizen 83), having an 
anti-thrombin affect (fletcher 62) and inhibiting platelet aggregation (kowalski 64) and fibrin 
polymerization (Alkjaersig 62). Essentially, a scenario of ongoing hemorrhage and repeated clot 
formation and hyperfibrinolysis leads to the expansion and recurrence of chronic subdural 
hematomas. 
Given the importance of plasmin and hyperfibrinolysis in the pathophysiology of chronic 
subdural hematomas, interrupting its action and the vicious cycle it propagates seems an ideal 
therapeutic target. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative. It binds to th e 
fibrin binding sites on plasmin or plasminogen and prevents its interaction and degradation of 
fibrin. This effect on the neo-membranes of chronic subdural hematomas should prevent 
rebleeding and the re-accumulation of the subdural hematoma. 
 
Supporting Data 
Kageyama et.al. showed the safety and potential efficacy of treating chronic subdural 
hematomas in their retrospective study of [ADDRESS_152112] not shown an 
increased risk (McCormack, Dunn, Katsaros, Barer, Benon). Furthermore, in a study of over 
[ADDRESS_152113] 
on plasminogen in the vein wall (Astedt).

Study Design 
 
This study is a single center single armed study of 50 patients to determine the safety of 
tranexamic acid in the chronic subdural hematoma population following surgical drainage of 
chronic subdural hematomas. This will be compared to historical controls. This study intends to 
be a prerequisite to a large nationally funded randomized control trial. 
 
Selection and Enrollment of subjects 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
-all patients undergoing intervention for cSDH including drainage 
-cSDH will be defined as hematoma on CT imaging that is predominantly isodense to 
hypodense to brain 
- 18-[ADDRESS_152114] drill craniostomy 
-medically unstable for surgery 
-patients requiring long-term anticoagulation- unable to stay off for less than 30 days 
-patients not expected to survive to the completion of follow- up 
-patients comatose prior to the initiation of treatment 
-history of thromboembolic problem including stroke, MI, DVT, PE 
-pregnant 
-minor 
-allergy/sensitivity to tranexamic acid 
-irreversible coagulopathy 
-known clotting disorder 
-bilateral hematomas with both requiring drainage 
-incarcerated 
-any patient not judged suitable for the study by [CONTACT_473] 
-women who are taking combination oral contraceptive 
 
Study Enrollment 
 
Patients meeting all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo standard treatment of 
their chronic subdural hematoma including operative treatment with the addition of preoperativ e 
and postoperative oral tranexamic acid treatment. Patients will receive a dose of 1300mg orally 
three to four hours prior to surgery. They will then take 1300mg orally three times daily for three 
days or until discharge, whichever occurs first. Tracking and follow-up will be explained to the 
patients and arranged by [CONTACT_9137].

All patients will have clinical follow-up on Day 30 +/- [ADDRESS_152116] DVT prophylaxis with spontaneous compression devices. Pharmacologic 
prophylaxis will be at the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
 
Experimental Interventions

central tendency (mean) will be used for continuous variables. Nonparametric tests will be 
used for statistical comparison, including the Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test for multiple groups 
and the Mann-Whitney U test for 2 groups . Data tabulation and analysis will be analyzed usin g

regression models where appropriate. A P value < 0.05 will be considered statistically 
significant. P values for difference among time point means (preoperative, postoperative days 
3, 7 and 30) to be determined by [CONTACT_134245].

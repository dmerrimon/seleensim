Speech, Spatial, and  
Qualities of Hearing Scale 
(SSQ)  A validated metric used as a self -assessment of hearing in  
everyday life across three hearing domains: speech hearing,  
spatial hearing, and qualities of sound  
3.0 Introduction and background  
The goal of this study is to evaluate recipi[INVESTIGATOR_422777] a new Artificial 
Intelligent (AI) technology . The AI system utilizes novel evaluation measures to provide a standardized approach 
to post -operative programming (also referred to as MAPpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). This technique can be utilized as a clinical tool for 
the audiologist to use in modifying programming parameters for  both existing and newly implanted cochlear 
implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  As mentioned the AI technology is a tool used by [CONTACT_422787] a more consistent manner.  
 
One of the novel evaluation methods is via psychophysical  tests based in auditory hierarchy skills. These include 
detection, discrimination, identification and comprehension of auditory stimulus. Tests will be presented via direct auditory input to the sound processor. This module allows for test measures to be presented in a calibrated 
manner outside of the soundfield through the commercially available wired and wireless programming pods. 
There are several configurations which can be utilized based on clinician and patient preference as well as the 
sound processor type. One of these configurations is  via the commercially available CP910 sound processor, 
Personal Audio Cable, and standard of care Cochlear Nucleus Programming Pod as shown in Figure [ADDRESS_534018] module may allow for improved clinician and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_422778]’s sound processor outside of a soundfield for both 
newly implanted and existing cochlear implant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .

recommendations by [CONTACT_422788] (Bermejo et al, 
2013, Varenberg et al 2011, Govaerts et al 2010). In current clinical practice patient programs (also referred to as 
MAPs) are often modified based on subjective patient feedback. Programming parameter modifications are made 
in Custom Sound, for Cochlear Nucleus  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The program adjustments can vary based on clinical center 
and audiologist, which may impact patient outcomes in some cases. The AI system provides several advices to 
potentially improve outcomes, based on data across major cochlear implant systems and individual psychoacoustic  data. These Intelligent Agent recommendations can substantially reduce programming time, as it 
may assist the audiologist in implementing test results to modify the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s program (also referred to as a MAP) , Figure 2

of the subject and provide the audiologist with programming parameter suggestions . Each clinical site will be 
provided a laptop to complete psychoacoustic testing, in addition to CS  for use in the study .  
 Description of Test Measures  
5.3.1  Consonant -Nucleus -Consonant (CNC)  Word Recognition Test  
The CNC Word Test (Peterson & Lehiste, 1962) is a validated test used clinically and in research to assess the 
speech perception performance of individuals  with hearing aids or cochlear implants on open- set word 
 
    
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page  [ADDRESS_534026] (Spahr  et al, 2012) is a validated test used clinically and in research to assess the 
open- set sentence recognition in speech- spectrum noise of adults with hearing aids or cochlear implants. It 
consists of [ADDRESS_534027] or ‘fill in’ unintelligible words. The sentences 
will be presented at a fixed level in speech weighted noise at a fixed signal -to-noise ratio.  Each list includes [ADDRESS_534028] is 85% +/ - 
1%.  Each word in the sentence counts towards the overall score.  Subjects will be tested using a configuration of speech at 0º and noise at 0º azimuth at +10dB SNR.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_534029]  battery   
This term is an overarching name [CONTACT_422797]: Speech audiometry, phoneme discrimination, loudness scaling, and audiometry. All tests are completed via Direct Connect and collect data regarding detection, discrimination and identification of sound through the cochlear implant. Results from these tests are incorporated into recommendations for the AI MAP . Specific tests within the psychoacoustic test  battery to be completed at 
each study visit are based on recommendations through the AI software  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Speech audiometry  
For this study, [ADDRESS_534030] module, 
across the four presentation levels.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phoneme discrimination  
The phoneme discrimination test is performed using up to 20 pre- defined speech sound contrasting pairs (a- r, u-ʃ, 
u-a, u-i, i-a, o-a, i-e, m-z, s-ʃ, e-a, u-o, ə-a, ə-o, ə-e, ə-i, z-s, v-z, ə-u, u-y, y-i). Phoneme pairs have been 
established as linguistically representative and are tested at 70 dB HL in an oddity paradigm (Govaerts et al., 2006). Subjects will be tested via Direct Connect and provide a behavioral response (e.g., hand raise or verbal 
response) if a discrimination  is recorded for the phoneme contrast. Two correct responses are required to be 
considered as correct identification as scored by [CONTACT_737]. Training for at least one phoneme pair will be completed for each study visit to ensure familiarity with the test.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Loudness scaling  
Loudness scaling testing is completed by [CONTACT_422789]-third octave narrow band noises centered at 250, 
1000, and 4000 Hz. A 1876 ms duration stimulus will be presented randomly twice at 5dB increments between 30 
and 80dB HL. L oudness  will be  scored on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (inaudible) to 6 (too loud)  by [CONTACT_422790] . (Varenburg et al. 2011, Govaerts et. al, 2006, Hereeen 
et al., 2012).

sponsor will monitor the sites to assure protocol compliance, and the data gathering mechanism (case report forms and data acquisition) will be the same across all study sites (Meinert, 1986).  
5.5.[ADDRESS_534039] follow -up due dates will be 
provided to participating centers to facilitate scheduling of follow -up visits.  
5.5.5  Additional Statistical Analyses 
Statistical Analysis for this study is addressed in detail in the document entitled “ Statistical Ana lysis Plan for the 
Clinical Investigation of New CI Delivery Models in a Nucleus CI Population study ”.  
5.5.6  Access to Study Documents and Data  Monitoring 
Investigator(s) will provide access to study documentation including source data for the purposes of monit oring, 
audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections.  
The Sponsor will designate appropriately trained monitors  to review the progress of this study and assure the 
quality and integrity of data accumulated. Clinical monitors, as  represent atives of the Sponsor, have the obligation 
to provide site qualification and initiation visits as well as regular site visits. The study monitors will be employees 
of the Sponsor, Cochlear Americas, or any contracted vendors qualified by [CONTACT_422791].  Study monitors, employed by [CONTACT_51894], for this study will be:  
 
      
       
      
       
 
      
       
      
       
 
      
     
                             
       
 
All data generated during this study and the source documents from which they originated are open to inspection 
by [CONTACT_13668], and other regulatory  agencies.  Upon completion of the study, the clinical 
monitor will conduct a final visit, or close- out of  the site. The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all 
subjects  are accounted for, that  the regulatory records and reports are complete, verify that study device and 
other  supplies have been accounted for and ensure that the Investigator is aware of his/her  responsibilities post -
study.  Data collection is performed using electronic data capture (EDC) on electronic Case Report Forms

 (eCRFs). Site personnel will be trained on the completion of the eCRFs prior to obtaining their own 
Login/Password. Access to clinical study information will be based on an individual’s role and responsibilities. In 
the event that the site requests assistance with data entry from the Sponsor, the Sponsor may assign a non- study 
related team member to assist the site with data entry.    
 Data Storage and Confidentiality  
5.6.1  Confidentiality  
A Case Report Form (CRF) will be completed for each study subject, summarizing all clinical and study data. The CRF contains confidential material. Subjects will only be referred to in the CRF by [CONTACT_51895]. Specific instructions to complete the CRF shall be provided to the clinical investigation team as appropriate.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_51887]. The original CRFs are to be retained by [CONTACT_13177] a period of time as determined by [CONTACT_13125].  
5.6.[ADDRESS_534040]’s name [CONTACT_422798]. All individuals who provide informed consent (sign the informed consent form) are 
considered consented into the study and will be assigned a unique identifier. A unique alphanumeric code will 
identify the subject throughout the course of the study. For example, US01- ART-0000, where: 
• US = [LOCATION_002]  
• 01 = a sequential numeral corresponding the order in which a subject is enrolled into the study for a given 
study site, in this case this would correspond to the first subject recruited into the study for a particular 
site, 
• ART = an abbreviation for the study, in this case “ART” for the Artificial Intelligent  system,  
• 0000 = a unique, numeric study site identification.  
5.6.3  Release of Medical Information  
Subjects will be required to release the exchange of medical information between the Investigator(s) and the 
Sponsor. This requirement will be clearly identified in the Informed Consent form.  
 Transition from Research Participation  
5.1.[ADDRESS_534041] -activation, including completion 
of evaluation materials (See Section 3.3). Subjects in Group 2 will be deemed completed after approximately  
eight weeks, including completion of evaluation materials (See Section 3.3). Subjects will continue to receive 
standard clinical follow -up care at their cochlear implant facility after the study.  
6.[ADDRESS_534042] Risks  
Subjects may experience sounds during mappi[INVESTIGATOR_422780]. Mitigation of  the risk  listed above is 
similar to that used during clinical cochlear implant mappi[INVESTIGATOR_422781]/or the stimulation to the sound processor is ceased in Custom Sound.  Risks to newly 
implanted subjects is consistent with commercially cochlear implantation. Risks of cochlear implantation will be 
detailed in the informed consent.  
 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential benefit s to subjects may include improved outcomes on speech perception outcomes  due to 
programming technology  and reduced clinical visits with the modified clinic model schedule while in this study. It 
cannot be promised that subjects will receive any medical benefits from being in this study.  
 Alternatives to Participation  
In lieu of study participation, patients may elect to continue standard clinical care for hearing aids if they do not 
pursue cochlear implantation, or pursue cochlear implantation without study participation. If patients receive a cochlear implant outside this study, programming will not be completed with the programming technologies or modified clinic model used in this study. Patients who have been implanted prior to invitation to participate in the study may be seen  for post -operative management  of per standard clinical care at their respective institution .  
7.[ADDRESS_534043] identification, Recruitment, and Consent/Assent  
 Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited into the study sequentially to ensure a subject pool representative of the general 
population of those with hearing loss, with no pre- selection based on age (other than being 12 years -of-age or 
older), ethnicity  or gender  as described in Section 2.0. The identification and recruitment of subjects will protect 
patient privacy and be free of undue influence.  
 Process of Consent  
Prior to recruitment of any subjects into the study, written approval of the investigat ional  plan including clinical 
protocol and informed consent form will be obtained from reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB).  An interview 
(as part of the informed consent process) will be conducted by [CONTACT_51896]/or audiologist to inform the 
subject  about rationale for and the details, aims, objectives of the study,  study expectations, evaluation schedule, 
and the risks and benefits of the trial treatment (and alternative treatments), and the extent of the patient’s involvement . Written informed consent shall be obtained from each subject after this explanation. After reviewing 
the Informed Consent Form, the subject  will be given the opportunity to review and ask questions about the 
Informed Consent Form and/or the study prior to signing the Informed Consent Form. The subject will be offered 
the opportunity to take the form home to discuss with family members should they choose to do so. If they sign the Informed Consent Form, the subject twill then be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent Form to take 
home.  The informed consent process is intended to be completed after standard of care surgery for Group 1 
subjec ts, but may be completed pre- operatively if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737].

 Costs to the Subject  
Costs to subjects in this study include billing newly implanted subjects and/or their insurance company for a Nucleus cochlear implant system and for surgery. The insurance company will be billed for any medical, surgical, or 
audiological  treatment which may be needed after receiving the cochlear implant. Cochlear Americas will not for 
any audiology or medical evaluation conducted before or after surgery. Subjects will not be reimbursed by [CONTACT_422793], programming of the device, or any therapy received.  These services are all standard components of learning to hear with a cochlear implant.  
Tests and procedures that are done only for the study will not be billed to the subject’s insurance company. It is recommended subject’s talk with their insurance company about its payment policy for standard medical care given 
during a research study. If the subject’s insurance company does not pay, they may be billed for those charges. 
Subjects are responsible for, and will have to pay for, transportation to and from the study visits.  
 Payment for Participation  
Subjects in Group 1 and Group 2 will be paid $12.50/hour for study visits completed.  If a subject  withdraw s from 
the study before completing all stud y visits, they  will be compensated $12.50/hour for the study visits which wer e 
completed. In order to receive payment for participation, subjects will need to complete a W -[ADDRESS_534045]  
Each site will obtain approval from its designated IRB prior to commencing any study -related activities. A copy of 
the IRB approval will be kept in the Investigator file(s). Any additional requirements imposed by [CONTACT_4158]/or 
regulatory authority shall be followed. The Investigator(s) will submit the appropriate documentation if any 
necessary extension or renewal of the IRB approval must be obtained.  
Study procedures will not be changed without mutual agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator(s). 
Changes will be implemented in a signed protocol amendment, and for significant changes, approval will be obtained from the IRB.

 • led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_10396], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_534047] (SADE)  
A serious adverse device effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
8.1.6  Unanticipated Adverse Device E ffects  
Unanticipated adverse device effects refer to any event that represents a “serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.” [FDA 21 CFR 812.3(s)]  
 Assessment and Reporting of Adverse Events  and device deficiencies  
To monitor subject safety throughout the study, adverse events and device deficiencies will be recorded. Information on all adverse events will be maintained by [CONTACT_92920]. The investigator will complete an Adverse 
Event and/or Device Deficiency form if any adverse event or device deficiency is reported or observed for a 
subject during this study, even if the event was acknowledged as a risk factor in the Informed Consent form.  
Investigators are to inform their respective Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Cochlear Americas immediately if an unanticipated adverse device effect is suspected (no more than [ADDRESS_534048]). If the case is determined to be an unanticipated adverse device effect, the investigator will fill out an “Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Form.” Cochlear Americas will report the results of an evaluation of the 
unanticipated adverse device effec t within [ADDRESS_534049] led to a serious 
adverse event to the sponsor without delay.

Appendix A : Procedural considerations 
• Pre-CI (Hearing aid condition) and post -CI (Cochlear Implant condition)  testing may be completed in the 
soundfield using an audiometer, such as a Grason Stadler GSI 61 (Grason Stadler, Inc., Milford, NH, 
U.S.A.) or equivalent, calibrated to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards with 
maximum output for frequencies of 0.5 to 4  kHz of no less than 120 dB HL.   
• Additional test set -up post -implantation for Group 1, or for Group [ADDRESS_534050] system.  
• Speech and hearing evaluations completed in t he soundfield will be completed at a minimum, a single-
walled sound booth capable of accommodating a calibrated, 90- degree, speaker orientation.  Stimuli will 
be administered using either insert earphones and/or sound field speakers. Applicable ANSI standards are: ANSI/ASA S3.6 -2004;  ANSI S3.1 -1999 (R 2003).  
• Speech and hearing evaluations completed with Direct Connect testing will be completed in a quiet 
room within the clinical site.  
• Sound field calibration will be completed as recommended by [CONTACT_411169] (2002). The sound level meter 
should be set to the “A scale” and “slow” settings.  The sound level meter will be placed in the center of 
sound booth, approximately 1m from the loud speaker face, at the height of which would represent the 
center of an average subjects  head. The calibration noise (test specific, however preferably speech 
spectrum noise) will be administered through the audiometer output to the loud speaker within the 
sound booth. The sound level meter detects the audiometer output through the loud speaker.  With the VU meter on the audiometer set to 0 while, the dial on the audiometer is adjusted until the sound level meter within the sound booth detects the desired output . 
• Pure tone threshold exploration will be completed using the adaptive Hughson & Westlake procedure 
(1944).

2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 BACKGROUND  & RATIONALE  
Veterans with PTSD have high rates of unhealthy behaviors and low rates of positive health and 
wellness behaviors. Veterans and service members with PTSD have high rates of smoking and substance 
use, worse health, more sick -call appointments, and low rates  of preventative health behaviors (i.e., 
exercise and medical screening) .[ADDRESS_971002] higher rates of inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] .2,3 Also, despi[INVESTIGATOR_713352] ,4 rates of engagement are low; for example, only 11.5% of Veterans  entering  treatment  
with  a provi der trained  in Cognitive  Processing  Therapy  or Prolonged  Exposure  initiated  one of these two 
treatments, and only 7.9% completed the treatment protocol .5 Three classes of interventions 
demonstrate positive support for increasing “patients’ willingness and ability to take independent 
actions to manage their health and care”: (1) skill development, problem solving, and peer support; (2) 
social environment changes to facilitate healthy beliefs,  social  norms,  and behaviors;  and (3) tailored  
coaching,  which  facilitates  goal  setting  at appropriate  levels .6 
Whole Health Coaching seeks to increase health and wellness behaviors through a personalized plan 
for recovery and values -based goal setting. Whole Health Coaching is a health coaching service 
designed by [CONTACT_713370]&CT. Whole Health Coaching differs in a pproach, focus, and principle from Telephone Screening for Interest and Appropriateness

evaluate  current  and desired  functioning  in eight  areas  of self-care  and develop a focus. In phase 3, 
coaches and Veterans develop a plan including setting goals, developi[INVESTIGATOR_560247], exploring 
barriers, and establishing accountability. In phase 4, coaches review progress and modify goals and 
action steps as needed.  Coaches  move  through  phases  at the Veteran's  pace  and can return  to a phase  
at any point  as needed.  
Although there is no research directly evaluating the outcomes of Whole Health Coaching, it is based on 
a style of health coaching called integrative health coaching, which has good research suppor t.7 
Integrative health coaching and Whole Health Coaching incorporate many skills similar to motivational 
interviewing7 (e.g., open -ended questions, reflectio ns, scaling questions, exploring attitudes and beliefs 
around behaviors), behavioral activation (e.g., assessment of life goals and values, activity scheduling) ,8 
and goal setting. However, it is unique in its whole -person orie ntation to health rather than a focus on a 
specific behavioral concern (e.g., depression, weight loss) .7 In principle, focusing on Veteran defined 
values and goals increases patient engagement and healthy behaviors (Figure 1). Recent reviews 
indicate that health coaching demonstrates efficacy for improving health behaviors, physical health, and 
social and mental health functioning.9,[ADDRESS_971004] of WHC on outcomes  
 
Note that Whole Health Coaching is not a stand -alone treatment for any mental health or medical 
conditions, rather it is designed to increase patient engagement in treatment and healthy behaviors 
that are tailored for patient’s health needs. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], if a Veteran with PTSD is having problems at work 
and has co -morbid health problems like obesity and diabetes, this Veteran would get a series of 
problem -specific recommendations for each of these concerns from providers including a primary care 
provider, mental health  providers, vocational rehabilitation specialist, endocrinologist, nutritionist, etc. 
While any of these providers might set specific goals and tailor treatment recommendations to the 
Veteran's presenting concerns, recommendations would likely be specific to the individual problem(s) 
being treated by [CONTACT_713371]. In contrast, if this Veteran were to engage in Whole Health Coaching, 
the emphasis would be on a whole health evaluation; broad, non -problem specific domains of health 
(e.g., activity level, slee p, spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824]); and generating feasible goals and action steps based on the 
Veteran's values and ability. The coach can then help the Veteran make healthcare decisions and 
identify self -management strategies considering provider recommendations. The whol e health 
emphasis is the primary difference, so Veterans are not working with a provider on a specific diagnosis, 
but rather overall health and wellness. There is a focus on domains and values that are uniquely 
important to the Veteran (Table 1). For Veter ans with PTSD, this ideally includes engagement in 
evidence -based PTSD treatment as part of the personalized health plan.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_971005] 
Veterans with appropriate services to follow through on 
action steps. For example, if a goal for a Veteran  with  PTSD  
is to reduce  hypervigilance  or irritability  and the Veteran 
develops action steps towards self -management, then the 
coach would provide support for the self -management 
plan. However, if a Veteran with a goal to reduce 
hypervigilance or irritability develops action steps focused 
on engaging in formal treatme nt, then the coach would 
provide navigation to appropriate services (e.g., PTSD Clinic 
or anger management)  and provide support for maximizing 
utilization of these services (e.g., developi[INVESTIGATOR_713353].   
Since Primary Care -Mental Health Integration (PC -MHI) addresses population -level barriers to 
behavioral healthcare, it is an ideal setting for engaging Veterans with PTSD through Whole Health 
Coaching. PTSD is prevalent within VHA with 20% of outpatients scre ening positive for PTSD12 and 
11.5% of primary care patients meeting full diagnostic criteria .13 PTSD diagnoses are commonly (44% of 
the time) made in non -mental health settings such as primary care.14 PTSD in primary care patients is 
associated with worse mental health functioning, co -morbid mental health concerns, hazardous alcohol 
use, and elevated risk of suicidality .12,15-18 VHA’s PC -MHI initiative was designed to address population -
level barriers to mental healthcare including both access and stigma.[ADDRESS_971006] 2 peer specialists .21 Within their role, they work with 
Veterans both individually and in groups to perform multiple functions inclu ding: sharing their recovery 
story, advocating for Veterans, acting as role models of recovery, providing crisis  support,  acting  as 
liaisons  with  clinical  staff,  providing  outreach  education,  supplementing  treatment,  providing  case 
management and navigation, and teaching copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] .[ADDRESS_971007] delivering 
Whole Health Coaching in primary care.23 Evidence suggests that patients receiving care from peers 
delivering services as part of a team, such as multidisciplinary PACTs, show improvements in treatment 
engagement, social functioning, and quality of life.23 Further, research on peer -delivered structured 
curricula (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], problem solving) demonstrated that peers were effective in this role.23 Evidence 
also suggests that mental health peers working with patients on mental h ealth concerns and/or health Table 1. Sample of Whole Health

sleep, symptoms, daily functioning, patient activation, and use of health services.23-26 
Veterans with PTSD report that peer services can significantly improve PTSD services through providing 
social support, normalizing symptoms, instilling hope for recovery, and linking Veterans with additional 
services .27 Some s pecific benefits that Veterans reported about working with a peer compared with a 
non-peer provider are: increased trust, increased likelihood of following through on recommended 
treatments, and increased hope for recovery along with decreased stigma.27 In addition, Veterans 
indicated that peer services to encourage implementation of provider recommendations and pursuit of 
life goals would be helpful .27 
2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
Potential Risks  
There is minimal risk to Veterans from their participation in any of the research activities. The 
procedures are non -invasive and will not cause physical harm to participants. There is minimal 
psychological risk (i.e., embarrassment, discomfort) to partici pants when asked to share sensitive 
information about themselves (e.g., regarding trauma and suicidality) with the research staff. 
Participants will be assessed for suicide risk according to an established protocol. No deception is 
involved in this study. To minimize risk of breaching confidentiality, all electronic and paper self - report 
data collected will be identified by a random identification number rather than individually identifiable 
information. Identifiable voice recordings will be stored separat ely and in accordance with the data 
security and privacy procedures below. Identifiable information for informed consent, payment, and 
enrollment status will be stored separately from study data and will also comply with the data security 
and privacy proce dures.  
All research staff will be up to date on all required VA and IRB trainings in the responsible conduct of 
research including privacy, confidentiality, HIPAA regulations, recruitment procedures, informed 
consent, and data management.  
Additionally, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_713354] -specific training in those topi[INVESTIGATOR_713355], interviewing skills, collection of self -report data, intervention delivery, and 
data entry/management, and analysis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_713356]. Only approved research staff will have access 
to the data. All data will be kept strictly confidential and secure per American Psychological Association 
(APA) ethical standards and IRB protocol.  
Veteran Safety  
Multiple procedures will be in place to minimize psychological risk including (1) participants will be 
reminded that they can choose not to answer any question that they are uncomfortable with, (2) 
participants will be reminded that they can choose to withdraw from the study at any time, (3) on -call 
clinicians (licensed independent providers) will be available to speak with Veterans who report distress 
during any study procedure, and (4) participants wi ll be reminded that they can choose to engage in 
additional mental health services, including specialty PTSD treatment, at any point in the study. All 
referral requests will be promptly facilitated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_169420] -call clinician and urgent requests will be  
provided with same day access through the facility procedures. This study team has conducted 
numerous studies using similar methods and there have been very few issues. We do not anticipate any 
serious or significant risk with these procedures.   
A number of procedures will be in place for participants who have more urgent needs including needs 
for immediate medical or mental health care. If participants should require medical attention, they will

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_971008] VA medical services, local c ommunity hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and/or [ADDRESS_971009] 
with connecting Veterans with required services. For Veterans who report urgent need of mental health 
services, they will be evaluated by [CONTACT_21639] -call clinician and connected with appropriate emergency 
mental health services as needed. For Veterans deemed at imminent risk of harm to self or others, they 
will be connected with the on -call clinician who will facilitate emergency services as necessary (e.g., 
police, Suicide Prevention Team, etc.). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -Is are licensed clinical psychologists with 
experience in crisis evaluation and management, and research staff will also have access to a list of on -
call clinicians to contact [CONTACT_713372]. Research staff will have detailed training in these protocols for managing urgent needs including 
imminent suicidal/homicidal risk. If Veterans e nrolled in the study demonstrate non -imminent suicide 
risk (e.g., ongoing ideation with no plan or intent), additional suicide risk assessments will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_713373].  
Potential Benefits.  
The potential ben efits of the proposed project outweigh the minimal risks. Risks are non -invasive and 
consist primarily of the possibility of mild psychological distress. There are several potential direct 
benefits for participants. The interviews, telephone screenings, an d assessment sessions may provide 
the opportunity for Veterans to thoughtfully reflect on their current situation which may increase insight 
and prompt change (e.g., behavior changes or seeking additional treatment). Veterans will also receive 
monetary com pensation for all assessments completed.  
Additionally, all participants will receive the peer -delivered Whole Health Coaching intervention, which 
may increase progress toward health and wellness goals and other improvements in other outcomes 
(e.g., PTSD sy mptom reduction, functional outcome improvement, patient activation). Indirect benefits 
include the opportunity to learn about and participate in clinical research that aims to improve Veteran 
healthcare. The data and feedback collected in this project wil l serve to improve services offered for all 
Veterans. Overall, the risk to benefit ratio seems favorable. The protocol outlines procedures for 
minimizing risk, and the benefits of evaluating peer -delivered Whole Health Coaching are high. We 
believe the pot ential benefit of this research outweighs the limited risk to research participants.

Health Coaching on Veterans’ progress toward health and wellness goals. In this design, outcomes are 
monitored over time prior to the onset of an intervention, to establish a baseline, and after the onset of 
an in tervention to evaluate changes in outcomes for each participant.32 In addition, the start of the 
intervention is staggered across participants to demonstrate experimental control (i.e., that the 
intervention and not some other  extraneous variable was responsible for any changes that were 
observed). Data from each  participant's  intervention  phase  are compared  to that person's  baseline  phase  
(within -series  comparisons)  and to the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_713357]' baseline phases who 
have not yet begun the intervention (between -series comparisons). We plan to recruit so that Veterans 
start baseline in groups of 2 -3 and move through the study concurrently. Participants who start baseline 
concurrently will be randomized to different baseline lengths to establish temporal precedence of 
change and control for history effects .32 The minimum baseline length of 4 weeks (eight possible 
assessment p oints) allows for sufficient assessments for the statistical model. Intervention will be 
introduced when each participant meets a baseline stability criterion defined as at least four data points 
total, the final two of which fall within the range  of the previous  data  points  (i.e.,  no increasing  slope  or 
trend  over  the final  three  baseline  data  points).  There  will be flexibility to extend baseline by [CONTACT_713374] -Delivered Whole Health Coaching to Improve Recovery in Veterans with PTSD  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_713351].gov  30 October 2020

4.2 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETE NTION  
Patients who screen positive on the PC -PTSD screen (which is delivered as part of standard practice), 
who have PTSD chart diagnoses, and/or are deemed clinically appropriate for referral will be referred by 
[CONTACT_331141], PC -MHI providers, or OEF/OIF/ON D case managers. To help identify potential referrals, 
research staff will create a list of these patients monthly and then ask their providers to refer these 
patients to the study. This list may be developed using the Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medi cal 
record, or via the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). VINCI is a VA HSR&D resource 
center that provides a secure, central analytic platform for performing research activities. It is a 
partnership between the VA Office of Information T echnology (OI&T) and the Veterans Health 
Administration Office of Research and Development (VHA ORD). VINCI includes servers for securely 
hosting databases from VA data sources. VINCI servers are physically located at the VA Austin 
Information Technology C enter (AITC), located in Austin, [LOCATION_007], which has multiple layers of security and 
disaster recovery to prevent data loss. Only designated members of the study team are granted access 
to study -specific data through a certified VHA network computer within th e VA or approved Virtual

VINCI with an IRB -approved request from individual VistA systems to the VA Corporate Data Warehouse 
where it is prepared and placed i nto a secure database for use by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
Once the names are identified from the VA electronic medical record and/or received from VINCI and 
the primary care provider has signed -off, research staff will send an IRB approved letter that is signed by  
[CONTACT_941] P.I. to all referred Veterans with the purpose of introducing the study. Study staff will then contact 
[CONTACT_713376]. Additionally, referral interacti ons with study staff may occur in person at the Syracuse VAMC or 
Behavioral Outpatient Center.  
 
We also plan to engage in multiple direct recruitment strategies. Research staff will set up an 
information table in the common areas at the VAMC. Research study staff will be present at the table 
and will distribute IRB approved brochures and/or flyers containing information about the study. IRB 
approved flyers may also be placed around the Syracuse VAMC and other community locations (e.g., the 
Vet Center), where appropriate. Approved electronic flyers will also be posted electronically at the VA 
medical center and other electronic venues (e.g., the Syracuse VA facebook page).  The IRB approved 
flyers and brochures include research staff contact [CONTACT_35865], allowing potential participants to 
directly contact [CONTACT_713377]. Interested and potentially eligible patients will be scheduled for a 
baseline research appointment within their PC clinic where study inclusion will be determined.  
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
5.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
5.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
Whole Health Coaching will be implemented as designed by [CONTACT_713370]&CT and delivered by a peer 
specialist who has completed the OPCC&CT Whole Health Coaching training. Whole  Health Coaching is 
explained in detail in the background. Veterans will meet weekly with a peer specialist for [ADDRESS_971013] the time 
frame and frequency as needed to help Veterans achieve progress on wellness goals. Although typi[INVESTIGATOR_713363], peers in primary care are not bound by [CONTACT_713378][INVESTIGATOR_713364] -MHI providers. Unlike the model for PC -MHI which focuses on facilitating 
increased access through population -based care (i.e., providing a small amount of services to many 
patients), the peer support model focuses on  improving the patient experience of care. This allows the 
peers to spend more time with Veterans.

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1 ASSESSMENTS & ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE  
Screening Measures.  The Blessed Orientation -Memory -Concentration test (BOMC) is a 6 -item interview 
of cognitive impairment that will be administered prior to any other measures. Scores range from 0 (all 
items correct) to 28 (all items incorrect). This measure has sound psych ometric properties.35 The P4 
Screener will be administered by [CONTACT_713379]. It assesses the 4 P’s: past 
history, plan, probability, and preventive factors and then classifies respondents as minimal, lower, or 
higher risk for su icide. The P4 will be re -administered at the follow -up assessments as needed to 
evaluate risk. The P4 has been validated in several large studies of medical patients enrolled in 
depression studies and has sound psychometric properties.[ADDRESS_971014] 2 months will be via chart review of VA records and self -report of non -VA 
services. A Demographics and Military Background questionnaire will be used to assess basi c 
demographic information (e.g. sex, age, education, employment, and income) as well as military 
background including deployment history (e.g., length, number, and locations), military rank/positions, 
branch, active/reserve status, and dates of service. Th is self -report measure is modeled after one used 
in CIH studies of Veterans with PTSD.  
 
Primary Outcome . The primary outcome directly evaluates the target of Whole Health Coaching: 
progress toward health and wellness goals. Progress toward health and welln ess goals will be measured 
by [CONTACT_713380] (GAS), one of the most established applied methods for evaluating 
individualized progress toward rehabilitation goals.37-40 GAS has strong psychometrics as an outcome 
measure in rehabilitation and menta l health.38,40 In rehabilitation, recent reviews show strong inter -rater 
reliability, convergent validity, and sensitivity as an outcome measure.38,40 In mental health, fewer 
studies were reported in the review, but available psychometric data are consiste nt with rehabilitation 
findings.40 Additionally, GAS demonstrated sensitivity to change in a recent peer -delivered coaching 
intervention.41 GAS is a measurement technique designed to be adapted to meet the needs of individual 
patients, settings, and studie s; we have adapted a version with specified behavioral anchors42 to 
evaluate the domains targeted by [CONTACT_713381]. We selected this version to  (1) reduce burden 
in establishing individualized rating criteria and (2) increase transparency, reproduc ibility, and validity. 
We also plan to follow other recommended guidelines to further enhance validity, reproducibility, 
transparency, and rigor.39  
 
Secondary Outcomes.  
The Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF)  consists of [ADDRESS_971015] for DSM -5 (PCL -5), a 20 -item scale, measures diagnostic criteria of PTSD on a 0 -4 
scale.50 The PCL -5 demonstrates good reliability and validity .50 
 
The 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)  is designed  to measure  patient  satisfaction  with  
services  and demonstrates  good  reliabilit y.51

7.2 PAYMENT  
Participants will be paid $20 each for completing the one -time baseline (including ineligible 
participants), pre, and follow -up assessments and $[ADDRESS_971016]  assessment. For the twice 
weekly assessments, participants will be reimbursed on a pa yment schedule similar to one used in a 
previous study including $5 for each completed assessment with bonuses for high compliance rates.34 
Participants will not be reimbursed for intervention sessions.  
 
8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES   
To analyze the primary outcome , GAS, we will use a variation of multi -level modeling (MLM) tailored to 
analyze single - case experimental design data.58 The appropriateness of the model will be evaluated and 
adapted as needed to fit the data including evaluating and implementing covariance structures to 
accommodate autocorrelation such as an auto - regressive error structure. We will evaluate alternative 
models to assess model assumptions and robustness of treatment effects. These analyses will be 
supplemented with visual inspection by [CONTACT_713382]’ outcomes in a multiple - baseline design 
format throughout the study.[ADDRESS_971017] size estimates for Veteran outcomes to establish

Selinexor (KPT -330) Developmental Phase:  
Phase 2 -3 
Title of Study : A Phase 2 -3 Multicenter, Randomized, Doubl e-blind Study of Selinexor 
(KPT -330) versus Placebo in Patients with Advanced Unresectable Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma 
(DDLS)  
Study Name: [CONTACT_420895] : Selinexor in Advanced Liposarcoma  
Protocol Number:  KCP -330-020 
Indication:  Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma (DDLS)  
Study Design  Overview :  
This is a Phase 2 -3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study.  
Approximately 334 total patients will be randomized  (57 patients in Phase 2 and approximately 
277 patients in Phase 3) . Enrollment in Phase 2 has been completed. There was  no break between 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 enrollment.  The study overview is presented in the figure below : 
 
 
Patients in the placebo arm who have PD will have the option to cross over t o open -label selinexor.  
Phase 2 : 
Fifty -seven patients were randomized to selinexor or p lacebo in a 1:1 allocation. Randomization 
was stratified based on the  following stratification factors for patients enrolled under protocol 
Versions ≤ 4:  number of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (1 versus ≥ 2) and prior eribulin use (prior 
eribuli n versus no prior eribulin ). The preplanned analysis of progression -free survival ( PFS; after 
40 PFS events were observed) was performed and served as a guideline to in form the final design 
of the Phase 3 portion of the study.  
Phase 3:   
The Phase 3 accrual period began immediately after enrollment of the Phase 2 portion was 
completed and will be approximately 30 months.  
Approximately 277 patients will be randomized to selinexor (~185 patients) or placebo 
(~92 patients) in a 2:1 allocation .  
Randomization  will be stratified based on (a) prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus  no prior 
eribulin) , (b) prior trabectedin (Yondelis®) use (prio r trabectedin versus no prior trabectedin), and 
(c) the number of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420825]  (2 versus ≥  3).  
All radiographic responses will be determined by [CONTACT_9251] (see the Imaging Manual  for

more details).  
Patients who have progressive disease ( PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST ) v. 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ), will discontinue blinded study treatment and their treatment 
assignment will be unblinded.  
• Patients in the placebo arm  who have PD  will have the option to cross over to open -label 
selinexor . 
• Patients in the selinexor arm who have PD will only be allowed to continue on selinexor 
(as open -label treatment) if the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes 
based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit from continued treatment 
with selinexor.  
Patients who discontinue blinded study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator for reasons 
other than PD are not allowed to receive open -label selinexor.  
An interim analysis was conducted  after [ADDRESS_530894] patient, on ce 209 PFS events are observed. Treatment 
assignment  for all patients will be unblinded at the time of the primary PFS analysis and all Phase 
3 patients will be evaluable for assessment of the primary endpoint.  
Patients who are on blinded study treatment at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the end of  
Phase 3 may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cross over to open -label selinexor (60 mg twice weekly).  
• Patients in the selinexor arm will continue selinexor but as open -label treatment.  
All patients who have PD while receiving open -label selinexor will discontinue selinexor and be 
followed for survival, unless the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes based on 
clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit from continued treatment with selinexor.  
Objectives:  
Phase 2  
Phase 2 Primary Objective  
• Assess and com pare progression -free survival (PFS)  of patients with advanced unresectable 
DDLS treated with selinexor (60 milligrams [mg]) or placebo twice weekly.  PFS is defined 
as the time from date of randomization until the first date of PD, per RECIST v. 1.1, or death 
due to any cause.  
Phase 2 Secondary Objectives  
• Compare time to progression (TTP) on study treatment, per RECIST  v. 1.1, with TTP on 
the patient’s last prior systemic therapy.  
• Determine the overall response rate (ORR: Complete Response [CR] + Partial Response 
[PR]), supported by [CONTACT_109955] (DOR). Responses will be defined by [CONTACT_393]  v. 
1.1.  
• Assess changes at 6 weeks in tumor glucose metabolism, density, and size using 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose -positron emission tomography (FDG -PET) and computed 
tomography (CT) (diagnostic).  
• Assess safety of each treatment arm.   
Phase 3  
Phase 3 Primary Objective  
Assess and compare PFS of patients with advanced unresectable DDLS treated with se linexor 
(60 mg) or placebo twice weekly. PFS is defined as  the time from date of randomization until

Selinexor (KPT -330) Developmental Phase:  
Phase [ADDRESS_530895] v. 1.1, or death due to any cause. Evaluation of the 
radiographic data for the PFS primary endpoint will be based on data from a scan review by [CONTACT_420851].  
Phase 3 Secondary Objectives  
• Assess Overall Survival (OS), measured  from date of randomization until death due to any 
cause.  
• Compare TTP on study treatment, per RECIST v. 1.1, with TTP on the patient’s last prior 
systemic therapy.  
• Assess Quality of Life (QoL) and patient -reported outcomes as measured by [CONTACT_420852] (EORTC) Quality -of-Life 
Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and the EuroQoL - Group Health Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L). 
• Determine the ORR, supported by [CONTACT_109957]. Responses will be defined by [CONTACT_393]  v. 1.1.  
• Assess PFS according to th e Investigator based on clinical and/or radiologic criteria.  
• Assess safety of each treatment arm.  
Study Population :  
This study will enroll patients  ≥ 12 years of age with DDLS per World Health Organization 
(WHO ) Response Criteria ( Miller 1981 ) for Phase [ADDRESS_530896] v. 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) for 
Phase [ADDRESS_530897] 2 but no more than 5 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420826].  
Study Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Blinded Study Treatment (Phases 2 and 3) : Selinexor at a fixed oral dose of 60 mg or matching 
placebo will be given twice weekly during We eks 1 -6 of each 6 -week (42 -day) cycle until PD per 
RECIST v. 1.1, intolerability, cons ent withdrawal, or unblinding.  
Open -label Selinexor :  
Patients on open -label selinexor will receive selinexor 60 mg twice -weekly during Weeks  1-6 of 
each six -week (42 -day) cycle until PD, intolerability, or consent withdrawal.  
Duration  of Treatment and Follow -up:  
Following a 21 -day screening period, patients may receive study treatment until they meet the 
criteria for discontinuation of study treatment or withdraw from the study.  
Patients will be followed for survival until the end of the study, withdrawal criteria are met, or 
death.  
Statistical Methods:   
Based on the planned  analysis of PFS by [CONTACT_420853] v . 1.1 C riteria in the Phase  2 portion 
of the study, the response criteria for the primary analysis (PFS) were changed from WHO to 
RECIST v . 1.1 in Version 4.0 of the protocol. Consequently, data from the Phase 2 portion of the 
study will be excluded from the final efficacy analysis in order to maintain statistical integrity and 
preserve overall T ype I error rate . (Phase 2 safety data will be i ntegrated with the Phase 3 safety 
data in the final safety analysis .) 
Phase 2:  
All Phase 2 analyses will be conducted among Phase 2 patients only.  
Phase 2 Primary Endpoint Analysis:  
The primary endpoint PFS for Phase [ADDRESS_530898]  2017 data cut with 49 eligible patients whose treatment  assignments were available. 
Patients were analyzed in the treatment arm to which they were ra ndomized. The preliminary  PFS

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-[ADDRESS_530968] tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) and other growth modulators 
inactivates their anti -cancer and regulatory functions.  The vast majority of TSPs are exported 
from the nucleus exclusively by [CONTACT_178177] 1 (XPO1, also called CRM1).  Selinexor (KPT -330) 
is an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) that specifically blocks 
XPO1, leading to the nuclear ac cumulation and re -activation of TSPs and other growth 
modulators.  The reactivation of multiple TSPs through inhibition of a non -redundant, single 
protein represents a novel approach to the treatment of neoplastic diseases including those 
with multiple genomic alterations and resistance mechanisms.  
Liposarcomas are among the most frequent type of soft tissue sarcoma, accounting for 
approximately 15 -20% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and are most often located in the lower 
extremities or retroperitoneum.  Liposarcomas are classified into three main biologic groups: 
well-differentiated  liposarcoma  (WDLS) and dedifferentiate d liposarcoma  (DDLS), 
myxoid/round -cell liposarcoma (MLS), and pleiomorphic liposarcoma.  These subtypes range 
from WDLS, which tends to be slow -growing, to DDLS and MLS, which are more 
aggressive and have greater metastatic potential.  While surgery is the primary therapy for 
localized liposarcomas, there remains a need for additional therapeutic options, to treat 
advanced, recurrent, or metas tatic liposarcomas.  
This Phase [ADDRESS_530969] of a Phase  2 
portion to compare progression -free survival ( PFS) obtained with selinexor versus  placebo, 
to adjust PFS assumptions and sample size for Phase 3, followed by a Phase  3 portion to 
assess whether the oral, single -agent selinexor can improve PFS ( versus  placebo) rates in 
patients with liposarcoma.  
  
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-[ADDRESS_530970] common 
subtypes is liposarcoma, which represents 24% of extremity sarcomas and 45% of 
retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas ( Crago 2011 ). Liposarcomas are malignant mesenchymal 
tumors and are classified into three main biologic g roups: (a) WDLS  and DDLS, (b)  MLS , 
and (c)  pleiomorphic liposarcoma ( Dickson 2013 ). 
WDLS c omprise 40% –45% of all liposarcomas and is classified as a low -grade neoplasm 
that is rarely metastatic and occurs most often in the retroperitoneum and limbs. WDLS 
malignancies have a tendency to recur locally ( Conyers 2011 ). WDLS/DDLS are considered 
to be a biphasic disease: DDLS represents progression from low -grade to high -grade 
nonlipogenic morphology within a WDLS. In contrast to WDLS, DDLS is more aggressive 
with a metastatic rate of 10% –20% and  overall mortality of 50% –75% ( Conyers 2011 ). 
Amplification of several oncogenes is associated with liposarcoma.  MDM2 is the most 
frequent amplification in WDLS/DDLS (close to 100%) while CDK4 is ampl ified in over 
90% of cases ( Dei Tos 2000 , Binh 2005 , Nakayama 1995 ). MDM2 is involved in  the 
destruction of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and CDK4 enha nces progression through the 
G1 cell cycle checkpoint by [CONTACT_420855]  (pRB). 
Thus, co -amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 proteins may result in prolif eration by [CONTACT_420856] p53 and 
the cell cycle (Conyers 2011 ). MLS is characterized by a translocation that results in th e 
FUS-CHOP gene fusion that is present in over 95% of cases ( Antonescu 2001 , Crozat 1993 ). 
Recept or tyrosine kinases , particularly signaling thr ough the PI3K/Akt pathway, appear to be 
involved in MLS oncogenesis ( Conyers 2011 ).  
Surgery is the primary treatment for localized liposarcoma, but approximately 40% of 
patients will eventually die f rom advanced disease ( Gobble 2011 ). Advanced unresectable 
liposarcoma is relatively resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, providing few options 
for these patients ( Dickson 2013 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_420830], most patients with 
liposarcoma currently receive anthracyclines and/or an alkylating agent. Olaratumab in 
combination with an anthracycline was granted acc elerated approval in soft tissue sarcomas 
including liposarcoma  based on an improvement in overall survival ( OS) compared to 
doxorubicin alone.  
Additional chemotherapeutic agents have recently shown PFS or OS benefits in randomized 
studies against the alky lating agent dacarbazine. In a recent Phase  3 study  (Study  SAR -3007 ) 
in patients with liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma  (LMS) , trabectedin (Yondelis®) had a 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of progressive disease ( PD), with a medi an PFS 
of 4.2 months versus 1.5  months with dacarbazine. There was no statistical ly significant 
diffe rence in OS  between the t wo arms. In a separate Phase 3  study, 452  patients with 
advanced soft tissue sarcoma were randomized to receive eribulin  or dacarbazine.  Treatment 
with eribulin (Halaven®) improved OS  by 7.2 months compared with dacarbazine in patient s 
with advanced LMS  or liposarcoma.  
Selinexor may represent a non -chemotherapy option for patients with liposarcoma . Because 
of the growth characteristics of liposarcoma, progression following selinexor or placebo  in

the study  design  (see Figure  1, Figure  2, and  Figure 3) allows crossover from placebo to

3.1. Inactivation of Tumor Suppressor Proteins (TSPs) by [CONTACT_420857], including p53, p73, 
FOXO1 and 3a, IκB , BRCA1 and 2, APC, PP2A, and pRB (Turner 2012 ). TSPs mediate 
tumor suppression pathways via various functions including recognition of cellular 
(deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ]) damage, arrest of the cell cycle until repairs can be made, 
and induction of apoptosis in cells that have substantial DNA damage repair ( Brown 2011 ).  
The tumor -suppressing and anti -cancer activity of these proteins requires their presence in 
the nucleus.  Conversely, export out of the nucleus can inactivate the abilities of TSPs to 
identify DNA damage and regulate cellular processes ( Xu 2010 ). Cancer cells exploit normal 
nuclear export to inactivate TS Ps and evade normal DNA -damage controls as well as anti -
neoplastic therapy.  The nuclear import (following synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes) and 
nuclear export of TSPs require specific shuttle proteins in order to traverse the nuclear 
envelope through the  nuclear pore complexes (NPC) ( Turner 2012 ). Although there are seven 
known nuclear export shuttle proteins (Exportins 1 – 7), exportin 1 (XPO1, also called 
CRM1) is the only known exporti n protein for the vast majority of TS Ps.  
3.2. Inhibition of XPO1 in Human Cancer  
Based on the postulated role of XPO1 in driving malignancy and chemotherapy resistance, 
XPO1 is promising as an oncologic therapeutic target ( Turner 2012 ). XPO1 blockade causes 
the tran sient nuclear retention of TSPs and other growth modulators, re -establishing their 
tumor -suppressing and growth regulating effects on cancer cells and potentially reversing 
mechanisms leading to chemotherapy resistance, with clear implications for future 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Lain 1999 , Kau 2003 , Turner 2008 ). In normal cells, XPO1 inhibition 
transiently arrests the cell cycle without cytotoxicity followed by [CONTACT_420858] ( Lain 1999 , van der Watt 2009 , Gray 2007 ). In addition, the messenger 
ribonuc leic acid ( mRNA ) cap-binding protein eIF4E requires XPO1 in order to exit the 
nucleus with its cargo mRNA proteins.  The mRNAs coding for various short h alf-life 
oncoproteins such as c -MYC, MDM -[ADDRESS_530971] liposarcoma and

4.1. Introduction  
Several attempts to use XPO1 inhibitors as anti -cancer agents, based o n the natural product 
leptomycin B, have failed due to secondary off -target effects of the drugs, which caused 
significant weight loss, diarrhea, and marked fatigue and asthenia in both animal studies and 
initial clinical  studies  (Mutka 2009 , Newlands 1996 , Roberts 1986 ). Modification of the 
structure of leptomycin B led to the development of  parenterally administered compounds 
with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and substantially improved therapeutic 
windows in preclinical studies ( Mutka 2009 ), but clinical studies  were never i nitiated.  
Selinexor is an oral, first in class, slowly reversible, potent SINE compound that specifically 
blocks XPO1.  Selinexor restores many of the TSPs to the nucleus where they can carry out 
their normal functions.  It is selectively cytotoxic for cells  with genomic damage, ie, for 
tumor cells, both in vitro  and in vivo . All cell types exposed to SINE compounds in vitro  
undergo G1 ± G2 cell cycle arrest, followed by a ‘genomic fidelity’ review.  Cells with 
damaged genomes are induced to undergo apoptosis.  Normal cells, with an intact genome, 
remain in transient, reversible cell cycle arrest until the export block is relieved.  Selinexor 
and other SINE compounds are not intrinsically cytotoxic; rather, they can restore the highly 
effective tumor -suppressing pathways that lead to selective elimination of genomically 
damaged ( ie, neoplastic) cells.  Tumors of hematopoietic lineage are particularly susceptible 
to induction of apoptosis by [CONTACT_67990]1 inhibition; normal hematopoietic cells and their functions 
are largely  spared.  Further details about the mechanism of action of selinexor are provided in 
the selinexor Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). 
4.2. Preclinical Data  
4.2.1.  Pharmacology  
Selinexor has shown potent pro -apoptotic activity with a median  inhibitory concentration, 
50% (ha lf maximal inhibitory concentration)  (IC50) of [ADDRESS_530972] anti -cancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as significant myelosuppression, alopecia, mucositis and other gastrointestinal  
(GI) dysfunction.  Selinexor and related SINE compounds have shown  substantial efficacy, 
with dosing regimens that match those currently under investigation in humans, in a variety 
of mouse models of hematological and solid tumors. These include DLBCL, ch ronic 
lymphocytic leukemia , Mantle Cell Lymphoma, acute myeloid leu kemia (AML), multiple 
myeloma, T -cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T -ALL), neuroblastoma, melanoma and 
prostate, breast, lung and ovarian cancers.  
Selinexor has shown potent in vitro  and in vivo anti -sarcoma activity.  Selinexor induced cell 
death through ap optosis in sarcoma cell lines, with nanomolar inhibitory concentrations in 
11 of 12 lines.  This cytotoxicity was associated with induction of p53 and p21 and reduction

xeno graft models of human liposarcoma ( Nair 2013 ). Selinexor also completely suppressed 
tumor growth in human alveolar soft part sarcoma xenografts and this efficacy was 
associated with increased nuclear  retention of p53 and p21 and reduced expression of 
survivin ( Crochiere  2014 ).  
Results of a more recent study that investigated selinexor in vitro  and in vivo  using [ADDRESS_530973] a wide variety of sarcoma models  (Nakayama 2016 ). Furthermore , in 
liposarcoma cell lines with MDM2 and CDK4 ampl ification, selinexor induce d G1 -arrest and 
apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation and irrespective of pRB expression. 
Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) 
level, indicating a post -transcriptional effect.  
4.2.2.  Pharmacokine tics and Toxicology  
The preclinical properties of selinexor were assessed in three species: mouse (CD1), rat 
(Sprague -Dawley), and monkey (cynomolgus).  While PK studies were limited to male 
animals for all three species, toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations were  conducted in both sexes for 
rats and monkeys as part of the selinexor toxicology studies, and no consistent sex -related 
differences were observed in either species.  No accumulation was observed in any of the 
multi -dose toxicology studies with an every -other-day dosing regimen for selinexor.  Overall, 
systemic exposure was generally dose -proportional in all TK studies that involved multiple 
dose levels.  Higher maximum plasma  concentration (C max) and earlier time to peak  plasma 
concentration (t max) values wer e observed in monkeys that were fasted versus  fed prior to 
dosing.  Systemic exposure (area under the curve from first to last plasma measurement, 
AUC last) to selinexor achieved with gelatin capsules was comparable to that achieved with 
oral suspension dosi ng, with lower C max and later t max values observed with capsules.  Results 
were not affected by [CONTACT_420859].  Oral bioavailability (F%) of selinexor 
was remarkably consistent among the three species with average values of 66.5%, 61.2%, 
and 67.5% in mice, rats, and monkeys, respectively.  
Nonclinical toxicology studies indicated that the major adverse drug reactions (dose limiting 
toxicities, DLTs) across all species are reduced appetite with anorexia -induced weight loss 
partially consistent with satiety induction.  High calorie foods and glucocorticoids can 
mitigate weight loss in animals taking SINE XPO1 inhibitors.  
See the selinexor  IB for more information.  
4.3. Clinical Experience  
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies are being conducted in advanced solid tumors and hematological 
malignancies (see the selinexor IB for a summary of clinical experience).  To date, more than 
[ADDRESS_530974] received se linexor . Selinexor was generally well tole rated with supportive 
care given to prevent anorexia and fatigue.  The aggressive use of appetite stimulants has 
reduced the severity of the anorexia and fatigue and improved the long -term tolerability of 
selinexor treatment.  A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor has been determined to 
be 65  mg/m2 twice weekly (Days 1 and 3) in Phase 1 solid tumor patients.  The recommended

Nonclinical d ata indicate that selinexor shows cytotoxic effects at nanomolar concentrations 
on a variety of sarcoma cell lines, whereas non -cancer cells show cytotoxic effects at much 
higher concentrations of selinexor. In murine xenograft models, three times a week o ral 
treatment with selinexor inhibits the tumor growth of a variety of sarcomas including 
liposarcoma.  
Selinexor treatment resulted in SD in 30 of 52 (58%) evaluable patients with liposarcoma in 
the sarcoma Phase 1 study KCP -330-003 (Section  4.3.1 ). The most commonly reported 
TRAEs were nausea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, and hyponatremia, which were 
primarily Grade 1 or 2 (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Nausea and anorexia were well controlled with 
antinausea medications and appetite stimulants. These data further support the development 
of selinexor  for the treatment of liposarcoma.  
5.1. Rationale for the Doses and the Dosing Regimen  
To date, more than [ADDRESS_530977] received selinexor orally in 
clinical studies  of selinexor  (Phase 1, 2, and 3) , and of these, 1 672 adult patients  in 
Karyopharm -sponsored studies were evaluat ed for safety as of 31 Ma rch 2018.  
Doses of 65 mg/m2 twice weekly have cleared DLT assessment and this is the MTD in the 
Phase 1 dose escalation study in advanced solid tumors, KCP -330-002. It should also be 
noted that while a dose of 70 mg/m2 cleared DLT in the AML arm of the Phase 1 study in 
patients with heavily pretreated hematological malignancies (KCP -330-001), escalating the 
dose beyond 70  mg/m2 twice weekly is prohibited in any study.  
In the present st udy, selinexor at a fixed oral dose of 60 mg (equivalent to ~35  mg/m2) or 
matching placebo  will be given twice weekly ( eg, Day 1 Monday and Day 3 Wednesday or 
Day 1 Tuesday and Day 3 Thursday or Day 1 Wednesday and Day 3 Friday) during 
Weeks  1-6 of each 6 -week (42 -day) cycle for a total of [ADDRESS_530978] v.  1.1 for the Primary Endpoint  
The Phase 2 primary PFS endpoint was evaluated using the WHO Response Criteria  (as 
specified in protocol V ersions ≤ 4 ). The WHO Response C riteria  were used based on input 
from the Sponsor’s Liposar coma Advisory Board. As RECIST C riteria have been 
traditionally used in sarcoma studies, including studies in liposarcoma, a prespecified 
analys is of PFS based on RECIST  v. 1.1  was also conducted  per protocol .  
The preplanned an alysis of PFS based on the WHO Response C riteria was conducted and the 
results of this blinded analysis (blinded to Sponsor and sites) were provided to the Data 
Safety Moni toring Board (DSMB).  
In addition, a  preliminary comparison of the PFS results by [CONTACT_420860] v.  1.1 
Criteria  ([ADDRESS_530979] v. 1.1) for all eligible patients 
whose treatment assignments were unblinded in the Phase [ADDRESS_530980] 2017,  are

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 47 presented in  Section  4.3.2 . This analysis revealed that the WHO Response C riteria, which 
use a bi -dimensional evaluation of each lesion, resulted in the premature determi nation of 
clinically asymptomatic progression “events,” typi[INVESTIGATOR_420831], while overall 
tumor burden was stable (as previously reported by [CONTACT_420861] [ Therasse 2000 ]). 
Based on these results , the D SMB recommended that the analysis of the primary endpoint 
should use RECIST v . 1.[ADDRESS_530981] v. 1.1 Criteria were similar  to 
those obtained in the Phase 1 study of selinexor in patients with sarcoma including 
liposarcoma  (Gounder 2016 ). Based on these results  and consist ent with other studies in soft 
tissue sarcoma,  RECIST v.  1.[ADDRESS_530982] v. 1.1 Criteria.  A formal analysis of all 56 eligible Phase 2 patients

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 51 7. STUDY DESIGN  
7.1. Study Design Overview  
This is a Phase 2 -3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled study of 
patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable liposarcoma.  Approximately 334 total 
patients will be randomized to study treatment (selinexor or placebo) as described below.  
Patients must provide written informed consent AND meet all the inclusion criteria and have 
none of the exclusion c riteria, before any screenin g tests not routinely performed  may be 
conducted.  The study flow chart is shown in Figure  1 and the disposition of patients  is shown  
in Figure  2 and Figure 3. 
Phase 2:  
• Fifty -seven patients w ere randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or pl acebo in a 1:1 
allocation.   
• Randomization w as stratified based on the following stratification factors for patients 
enrolle d under protocol V ersions ≤ 4: number  of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (1  versus  ≥ 2) 
and prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus  no prior eribulin ).  
The preplanned analysis of PFS was performed and served as a guideline to inform the final 
design of the Phase 3 portion of the study. See Section  4.3.2  for the preliminary  efficacy  
results for Phase 2.  
 
Phase 3:   
• Approximately 277 patients will be randomized to selinexor (60 mg) or placebo in a 
2:1 allocation ( ~185 selinexor,  ~ 92 placebo).   
• Randomization will be stratified based on (a) prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus 
no prior eribulin), (b) prior trabectedin (Yondelis®) use (prior trabectedin versus no 
prior trabectedin), and (c) the number of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420832] ( 2 versus ≥ 3).  
An in terim analysis was conducted at 108 PFS events  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). 
The Schedule of Assessments for Blinded Phase 2/Phase 3 Treatment and Open -label 
Selinexor are provided in  Table  1 and Table  2, respectively.  
Study treatment (selinexor or matching placebo) will be given twice weekly on Day 1 and 
Day 3 during Weeks 1 -6 of each six -week ( 42-day) cycle , without interrupti on between 
cycles.  
All radiographic responses will be determined by [CONTACT_9251] (see the Imaging Manual 
for more details).  
PD per RECIST v. 1.1. will be determined by [CONTACT_60653] r eader. Details for continuation of 
study treatment following PD and t he primary PFS analysis and follow -up after 
discontinuation of study treatment  are provided in Section  7.2.  
Treatment will continue until one or more of the following occurs:

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 53 7.2. Study Treatment  Following PD and the Primary PFS Analysis 
and Follow -up After Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Patients should  remain on blinded study treatment until the assessment of PD by [CONTACT_129211].  
Prior to unblinding, the patient and the Investigator will be asked which study treatment 
(active [selinexor] or placebo) they believe the patient received during blinded study 
treatment. See  Section  10.7.[ADDRESS_530991]  v. 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ) 
determined by [CONTACT_420862]. 
Note: WHO Response C riteria were used for Phase  [ADDRESS_530992] PD may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cross over to open -label selinexor (60 mg twice 
weekly).   
o After their first PD on open -label selinexor, patients will discontinue study  
treatment and be followed for survival, unless the Investigator, in consultation 
with the Sponsor, believes based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive 
benefit from continued treatment  with selinexor  (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
• Patients in the selinexor arm who have PD will discontinue blinded study treatment 
and be followed for survival , unless the Investigator, in consulta tion with the 
Sponsor, believes based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit 
from continued treatment  with selinexor (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
7.2.2.  Follow -up for Patients Without PD Who Discontinue Study Treatment  
Treatment assignment for patients who do NOT have PD determined by [CONTACT_420863] [ADDRESS_530993] PD determined by [CONTACT_420864]/or who discontinue 
blinded study treatment may proceed as follows:  
• Patients should remain on blinded study treatment until the assessment of PD from 
the central reader is obtained .  
• Patients who discontinue blinded study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator 
for reasons other than PD  will be followed for survival. These patients are  not 
allowed to receive open -label selinexor (see Section  11.3.1  for unblinding 
exceptions).  
7.2.3.  Study Treatment Following the Primary PFS Analysis  
Treatment assignments for all patients will be unblinded when the required number of PFS 
events for the primary PFS analysis  at the end of Phase [ADDRESS_530994] been obtained.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 54 Patients who are on blinded study treatment at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the 
end of Phase 3 may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cross over to open -label selinexor.  
• Patients in the  selinexor arm will continue selinexor but as open -label treatment.  
All patients who have PD while receiving open -label selinexor will discontinue selinexor and 
be followed fo r survival, unless the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes 
based on clinical judgement that the patient may derive benefit from continued treatment  
with selinexor (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
7.2.4.  Exception for Patients Who May Derive Benefit from Continued Treatment  
with Selinexor  
After their first PD (determined by [CONTACT_9251]) on  selinexor  (either blinded or 
open -label)  the following patients may elect to continue selinexor as open -label treatment if 
the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor, believes based on clinical judgement that 
the patient may derive be nefit from continued treatment  with selinexor : 
• Patients randomized to the selinexor arm  
• Patients randomized to the placebo arm who cross ed over to open -label selinexor  
• Patients randomized to the selinexor arm who continue d selinexor as open -label 
treatment at the time of t he primary PFS analysis  
Once these patients have a subsequent PD, they will discontinue open -label selinexor and be 
followed  for survival.  
7.3. Data Safety M onitoring Board  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to review the safety of 
selinexor and to rev iew any SAEs  that occur during the study.  The DSMB will develop and 
follow a data and safety monitorin g plan and charter.  
The DSMB will be composed of at least two oncologists (at least one of whom specializes in 
sarcoma) and a statistician.  The DSMB will be provided with all reports of AEs including 
SAEs regardless of Investigator  causality assessments.  
DSMB meetings will occur on a periodic basis in accordance with the DSMB charte r.  
An independent unblinded statistician conduct ed the preplanned Phase 2 analysis, based upon 
calculated PFS by [CONTACT_420865] 
(blinded to Sponsor and sites) to the DSMB  for review . In addition, a preliminary 
comparison of the PFS results  by [CONTACT_420860] v. 1.1 C riteria ([ADDRESS_530995] v. 1.1) for all eligible patients whose treatmen t 
assignments were unblinded in the Phase [ADDRESS_530996] v. 1.1 C riteria, rather than WHO Response C riteria.

The chairperson of the DSMB will be provided with SAE  reports, per the DSMB charter . 
The charter of the DSMB will s pecify that this committee is charged with providing periodic 
reports to Karyopharm that contain recommendations that include, but are not limited to, 
(a) continuation of the study ( or proposed changes to the study ), and (b)  termination of the

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 58 Key patient eligibility (inclusion /exclusion criteria) must be confirmed by [CONTACT_420868] s tudy prior to randomization.  
A Patient Enrollment Form will be sent from the site to the Karyopharm for evaluation. Upon 
confirmation of eligibility, Karyopharm will return the signed form to the site.  
7.6.1.  Study Patient Number  
Each patient in this study will be assigned a unique patient number and will keep this number  
for the duration of the study. Patient numbers will not be reassigned or reused for any reason.  
7.6.2.  Rescreening  
Rescreening is permitted in this stu dy. If a patient fails any of the inclusion or exclusion 
criteria, a patient may be rescreened after a suitable period of time (the exact length is 
dependent upon the reason for the screen failure) per the documented agreement of 
Karyopharm and the Investi gator. Any patient who is rescreened must be reconsented and 
will retain the same patient number. A patient may only fail screening once.  
7.6.3.  Screen Failures  
Patients who sign an informed consent but are not randomized for any reason will be 
considere d a screen failure. The reason fo r not being randomized will be entered on the 
eCRF. The demogra phic information (including screening number , informed consent date, 
and Inclusion/Exclusi on pages) must also be complete d for screen failure patients. No other 
data will be collected for patients who are screen 
failures, unless the patient experiences a 
SAE during the screening phase (see Section 13.2.2 for SAE reporting details). 
These data will also be retained in the Investigator’s study files and can be printed by [CONTACT_420869]. The primary anal ysis for this study will be an 
intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis, therefore, screen failure data will not be analyzed.  
7.6.4.  Replacement of Patients  
Patients who fail screening may be replaced.  
Patients who withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced.  
7.7. Randomization  to Blinded Study T reatment  
In Phase 2, patients were random ized to either selinexor (60 mg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization was stratified based on  the following stratification factors  for patients 
enrolle d under protocol V ersions ≤ 4: the number of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (1 versus ≥ 2) 
and prior eribul in use (prior eribulin versus no  prior eribulin) . 
In Phase 3, patients will be randomized to selinexor or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization 
will be stratified based on (a) prior eribulin use (prior eribulin versus no prior eribulin), (b) 
prior trabecte din (Yondelis®) use (prior trabectedin versus no prior trabectedin), and (c) the 
number of prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420825]  (2 versus ≥ 3).  
Specifically, randomization will be performed within each of the following 8 strata:  
1.≤ 2 prior systemic therap ies without prior eribulin use  or prior trabectedin use

8.≥ 3 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420840] a centralized system after confirmation of patient 
eligibility by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section 7.7). 
Study treatment will be administered in a double -blinded manner until the analysis of the 
primary PFS endpoin t at the end of Phase 3, with the following exceptions: 1) patients in the 
placebo arm who have PD while they are receiving blinded study treatment may cross over to 
open -label selinexor, or 2) patients in the selinexor arm who  have PD but may derive benefit 
from continued treatment with selinexor may elect to continue selinexor, but as open -label 
treatment  (see Section  7.2.4 ). 
7.8. Blinding Procedures  
All study staff will be blinded to the patient treatment assignments and study treatment will 
be administered in a blinded manner  during blinded study treatment . To maintain the study 
blind, it is imperative that patient treatment assignme nts are not shared with the patients, their 
families, or any member of the study team, either at the study site or at Karyopharm  until 
unblinding is permitted  (See Section  11.3).

[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
The physical examination will be performed according to the standards at each institution.  
Physical ex amination, including vital signs, will be performed on the scheduled day, even if 
study treatment is being interrupted . Physical examinations  should include general 
appearance, dermatological, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, 
abdominal, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, and neurological examinations.

•Body temperature (oC or oF)
•Systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and pulse rate should be measured after the
patient has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_159353] [ADDRESS_531051] be included in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions eCRF.  
Clinically relevant findings made after the start of study treatment , which meet the definition 
of an AE, must be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Height, Weig ht, and BSA  
Height (without shoes) in centimeters (cm) and weight (indoor clothing without shoes) in 
kilograms (kg) will be measured. BSA will be calculated by [CONTACT_159428] ( Dubois 1916 ) or 
Mosteller ( Mosteller 1987 ) method to verify that BSA >  1.2 m2 to ensure that an individual 
patient's selinexor dose would not exceed 70 mg/m2 twice weekly. If the patient’s weight 
fluctuates substantially, BSA should be re -calculated at each treatment visit. BSA should be 
re-calculated prior to any selinexor/placebo dose change.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  ECOG Performance Status 
ECOG performance status assessments (Oken 1982) will be performed during the study to 
assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patients ( Appendix 3). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Electrocardiography  
Standard [ADDRESS_531052] prior to the blood sample taken 
2 hours postdose  (approximately at the expected t max of plasma selinexor). ECGs may also be 
performed as clinically indicated during the study.  
Patients must rest for  at least 5  minutes prior to any ECG recording.  The Investigator  will 
interpret the ECG using one of the following categories: normal, abnormal but not clinically 
significant, or abnormal and clinically significant.  The time the ECG was performed and the 
following parameters will be recorded in the eCRF: heart rate, PR interval, QT interval, QRS 
interval, and QT corrected using either Bazett’s or Fredericia’s formula.

Concomitant medi cations will be do cument ed for each patient at each scheduled visit. A 
detailed histo ry of m edications w ill be do cumented for each patient at sc reening and C1  D1. 
Subsequently, at each study visit, patients will be asked whether they have taken any 
medication other than the study treatment  through the end of the study . All concomitant 
medications including dietary supplements, over -the-counter medications, and oral herbal 
preparations, as well as changes in medication, will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Necessary supportive care such as appetit e stimulants, anti -emetics and anti -diarrheal 
medication, etc., will be allowed (see Section  12.2.5 ).

dosing and appropr iate action taken for any clinically significant abnormal values.   
At any time during the study, abnormal laboratory values which are clinically relevant 
(eg, require dose modification and/or interruption of study treatment, lead to clinical 
symptoms or signs or require therapeutic intervention), whether specifically requested in the 
protocol or not, must be documented in the eCRF. If any abnormal laboratory val ue or test 
result constitutes an AE, then these must be recorded on the AE eCRF. Values will be 
documented on the laboratory report until stabilized, or the laboratory value returns to a

must be ≥ 25 mIU/mL.  
Pregnancy testing (serum hCG or high sensitivity urine) is als o required for females of 
childbearing potential prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycles ≥ 2 during both blinded and open -
label treatment and at the EoT Visit (serum hCG). A positive urine pregnancy test will be 
confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  
Pregnan cy te sting may be performed if  clinically indicated during the study . 
10.7. Other Assessments  
10.7.1.  Quality of Life and Health -Related Outcomes  
QoL questionnaires s hould be completed prior to study treatment  administration on the days 
when QoL questionnaire is completed.  
EORTC QLQ -C30: The QLQ -C30 is a validated, patient self -administered instrument for 
assessing the health -related QoL of cancer patients participating in international clinical 
studies . It is a questionnaire containing both multi -item and single scales, incl uding five 
functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive), three symptom scales 
(fatigue, nausea & vomiting and pain) and a global health status/QoL scale and six single 
items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea a nd financial difficulties).  
EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L: The EQ -5D-5L is a validated, patient self -administered instrument 
used for multiple health conditions and treatments, to provide a simple descriptive profile and 
a single index value of health status.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 82 10.7.2.  Treatment  Assignment Query  
Prior to unblinding, the patient and the Investigator will be asked which study treatment 
(active [selinexor] or placebo) they believe the patient received during blinded study 
treatment.  
Specifically:  
• After PD but prior to unblinding, the patient and the Investigator will be asked which 
study treatment (active [selinexor] or placebo) they believe the patient received 
during blinded study treatment and their responses will be recorded.  
• If blinded study treatment  is discontinued without PD, query should be performed at 
the time that blinded study treatment is discontinued and prior to unblinding.  See 
Section 11.3. 
• If unblinding is required for clinical management of a clinically important  SAE 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment and knowledge of the received study 
treatment is required for clinical management and treatment of the SAE, query should 
be performed prior to unblinding.  
10.7.3.  Nutritional Consultation  
It is strongly recommended that the Investigator, or his/her designee, provide patients with a 
nutritional consultation to discuss any food recommendations and strategies for managing 
potential nausea and appetite changes experienced with selinexor. This consultation does not 
need to be performed by a nutritionist.  
During bli nded study treatment, t he nutritional con sultation should occur on C1 D [ADDRESS_531057] dose of blinded study treatment (or within the Screening Perio d). 
During treatment with open -label selinexor,  the nutritional con sultation should occur on 
C1 D1 before the firs t dose of open -label selinexor for patients in the placebo arm who cross 
over to open -label selinexor. The nutritional consu ltation is not required at C1 D 1 of 
open -label selinexor treatment for patients in the selinexor arm who continue on selinex or 
but as open -label treatment.  
The nutritional consultation may be also performed at any time during the study, as 
necessary.  
10.7.4.  Collection of Information on Antineoplastic Therapy  
Information on any antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_420843] (Section 9.1.6 ), the EoT Visit (Section 9.2.4 ), Safety 
Follow -up Calls (Section  9.1.7  and Section 9.2.5 ), and d uring Survival Follow -up 
(Section  9.1.8  and Secti on 9.2.6 ). 
For patients who progress on post -study treatment antineoplasti c therapy, the Investigator 
should enter the date of progression  from the medical record  in the eCRF if that information 
is available to the Investigator.

patient, the Investigator at the study site, and key Sponsor team members  as specified to 
monitor the conduct of the study  will be unblinded to the treatment assignment . 
Treatment assignment s for patients who discontinue blinded study treatment without 
determination of PD by [CONTACT_9251]  (including patients who discontinue blinded study 
treatment for reason s other than PD ) will not be unblinded until the primary PFS analysis at 
the end o f Phase 3 and these patients a re not allowed to receive open -label selinexor.   
• Exception:  Treatment assignment may be unblinded in the event of a clinically 
important  SAE only if unblinding is required for clinical management of a clinically 
important  SAE leading to discontinuation of study treatment and knowledge of the 
received study treatment is required for clinical management and treatment of the 
SAE.  If the patient is on the placebo arm and PD has not been documented, the 
patient will not be elig ible t o receive open -label selinexor.  
11.3.2.  Unblinding of Treatment Assignment for All Patients at the Primary PFS 
Analysis  at the End of Phase [ADDRESS_531061] PD at the time of 
unblinding will 1) continue selinexor but as open -label treatment if they were in the selinexor 
arm, or 2) h ave the option to cross over to open -label selinexor if they were in the placebo 
arm. 
11.4. Definition of End of Study  
End of Study (EoS) will b e upon completion of the follow -up period for the last patient 
treated in the study. Completion of follow -up for the last patient will occur when the last

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-020 21 May 2020
   
Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 90 12. TREATMENT  
Selinexor (KPT -330) immediate rele ase tablets for oral administration and matching placebo 
will be supplied in blister packs.  Selinexor tablets will be provided in a coated tablet strength 
of [ADDRESS_531063] 120 mL (4 ounces) of water. Selinexor 
can be taken with or without food . For additional details on drug formulation, preparation, 
and administration, please refer to the Pharmacy Manual and the selinexor IB . 
In order to avoid contact [CONTACT_37381], tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be 
crushed.  
Blinded Study Treatment  (Phases 2 and 3) :  
Selinexor and matching placebo will be administered as fixed  blinded oral doses of three 
20 mg tablets given twice weekly ( eg, Day 1 Monday and Day 3 Wednesday or Day 1 
Tuesday and Day 3 Thursday or Day 1 Wednesday and Day 3 Friday ) on Weeks 1 -6 of each 
6-week (42 -day) cycle  until PD, intolerability, consent withdrawal, or unblinding. Patients 
with a BSA  < 1.2 m2 as calculated per Dubois 1916  or Mosteller 1987  will be excluded from 
the study.  Selinexor will be administered as a flat -fixed dose, and not by [CONTACT_420878] . 
Open -Label Selinexor :  
Patients on open -label selinexor will receive selinexor 60 mg twice -weekly during Weeks  1-6 
of each 6 -week (42 -day) cycle .  
The following 4 groups of patients may  receive open -label selinexor:  
(a) Patients in the placebo arm who have PD per RECIST v. 1.[ADDRESS_531064] to cross over to open -label  selinexor  
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 91 (b) Patients in the selinexor arm who have PD per RECIST v. 1.1 during blinded study 
treatment who may derive benefit from continued treatment  with selinexor  (see 
Section  7.2.4 ). 
(c) Patients in the placebo arm who are receiving blinded study treatment at the time of 
the primary PFS analysis at the end of Phase [ADDRESS_531065] to continue to cross over to 
open -label selinexor  
(d) Patients in the selinexor arm who are  receiving blinded study treatment at the time of 
the primary PFS analysis at the end of Phase [ADDRESS_531066] 
occur wi thin 14 days of the patient’s EoBT Visit. For patients in the selinexor arm during 
blinded study treatment who continue selinexor but as open -label treatment there will be no 
break in the patient’s twice -weekly dosing schedule.  These patients must complete  the EoBT 
Visit before their next scheduled selinexor dose to maintain continuity of selinexor dosing 
from b linded to open -label treatment.  
12.1.4.  Dosing Instructions for the Study Participants  
Study treatment  will be provided for twice weekly dosing during Weeks  1-6 for all cycles. 
Patients will be provided adequate doses to take home to complete dosing until the next 
scheduled clinic visit.  Patients will be asked to bring remaining study medicine, if any, when 
returning to the clinic for any scheduled or unsched uled visit.   
The Investigator  should promote compliance by [CONTACT_146525]’s 
safety and the validity of the study. The patient should be i nstructed to contact [CONTACT_420879]/she is unable for any reason to take the study treatment . 
Supportive treatment for the management of known toxicities will be provided as needed.  
All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose c hanges during the study 
must be recorded on the eCRF. Compliance to study treatment  will be recorded by [CONTACT_420880].  Medication 
compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_46874] a delegate and recorded in source 
documents.  The date will be recorded as per the study treatment  schedule.  The Investigator or 
designee will account for the number of tablets dispensed against those returned by [CONTACT_4677].  Any deviations and missed d oses will be recorded in the eCRF and drug 
accountability logs for verification of explanations for deviations.  The Investigator  or 
designee will try to ensure complete compliance with the dosing schedule by [CONTACT_420881] d re-education when necessary.  
12.2. Dose Reduction and Supportive Care Guidelines  
12.2.1.  Dose Modifications and Dose Delay  
For patients who do not tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments are 
permitted in order to allow the patient to continu e the study treatment. The criteria for dose 
modifications for toxicities considered related to the study treatment , as well as 
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-[ADDRESS_531067] be recorded on the eCRF.  
A dose reduction should be considered  if the patient missed 2 consecutive doses or 
3 nonconsecutive doses in a cycle due to  an AE(s). The missed doses may be the result of a 
combination of AEs during the cycle ( eg, Day 1 doses of Weeks 1 and 2 missed due to 
nausea, Day  1 dose of Week 3 missed due to fatigue).  Following a dose reduction, d ose 
re-escalation is allowed  only after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
Patients who require extended dose interruptions without disease progression ( eg, 
unacceptable toxicities)  will remain on study and continue with tumor scans per schedule of 
assessments as specifie d in Table  [ADDRESS_531068] be followed as described in Section  13.1.2 . Based on observations from the Phase  1 
studies in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumors, selinexor shows a 
reasonably wide therapeutic range with activities from ~10 mg/m2 to ≥ 60 mg/m2. Based on 
observations in over 1000 patients treated with selinexor alone or in combination with other 
agents, fatigue, anorexi a and weight loss associated with selinexor are highly variable and 
patient -specific . Therefore, in order to optimize specific anti tumor activity and the patient’s 
tolerability, we will allow for dose or schedule modifi cations as described in Section  12.2 
below and in  Table  9 (pre-specified dose/schedule modifications for AEs related to study 
treatment  and supportive care/dose adjustment guidelines, respectively.  Patients should also 
be treated aggressively with s upportive care to reduce toxicities.  If more than one different 
type of toxicity occurs concurrently, the most severe grade will determine the modification.  
For all ≥  Grade 3 hematological or Grade 3 non -hematological AEs that are NOT treatment  
related, af ter consultation with the Medical Monitor and at the discretion of the Investigator , 
dosing may be maintained provided that the patient can continue to take the agent by [CONTACT_1966].  
For all Grade 4 non -hematologic toxici ties, protocol -specified study treatment  
(selinexor /placebo) must be suspended and the Sponsor Medical Monitor consulted regarding 
options for continuation ( ie requirements for resuming study treatment  or permanent 
discontinuation).

In cases where there is significant disease involvement in the bone 
marrow or pre -existing compromised marrow function (eg,  due to prior 
marrow -toxic therapy), the Investigator in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor may decide to continue selinexor dosing without dose 
reductions and/or interruptions as specified above, provided that platelet 
counts and bleeding symptoms/sign s are closely monitored.  
Grade ≥[ADDRESS_531075] 
recovered to Grade 2 or baseline. When resuming selinexor, red uce by 
1 dose level.  
If recurrent, unless contraindicated, initiate treatment with moderate to 
high doses of thrombopoietin stimulating agents as above.  
Neutropenia  
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
(afebrile)  
OR 
Febrile neutropenia  Institute colony stimulating factors and prophylactic antibiotics as 
clinically indicated per institutional guidelines.  
Interrupt selinexor and check neutrophils at least weekly until recovers 
to Grade  2 or baseline and without fever (if febrile) and the patient is 
clinically stable. Reinitiate selinexor therapy and colony stimulating 
factors per institutional guidelines.  
If recurrent, continue colony stimulating factors, interrupt selinexor until 
neutrophil counts improve to Grade ≤2 or baseline levels, and reduce 
dose of selinexor 1 dose level.  
Anemia  
Treat per institutional guidelines including blood transfusions and/or erythropoietins. Consider transfusing 
for symptoms with hemoglobin  >8 g/dL (Grade <3) or for any Grade 3 (hemoglobin <8 g/dL). If possible, 
maintain selinexor dose as long as patient is clinically stable, but if a dose reduction or interruption is 
desired, consult with the Medical Monitor.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 97 Toxicity and Intensity  Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment Guidelines  
Tumor lysis syndrome  
If TLS risk factors are identified, provide prophylactic IV hydration and regular monitoring of hydration 
(especially when increasing the dose of selinexor), renal function, urine output, and clinical laboratory 
measures of interest for TLS (eg, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, LDH, uric acid). Consider administration 
of hypouricemic agents to reduce the risk o f TLS.  
Hold  selinexor in patient with hyperkalemia (≥7.0 mmol/L) and/or symptoms of hyperkalemia, an increase in 
uric acid, or other changes in biochemical blood parameters suggestive of TLS. Start IV hydration, and 
consider hypouricemic agent until levels  return to normal. Selinexor can be reintroduced at the normal or 
reduced dose.  
Other selinexor -related adverse events  
Grade 1 or 2  Rule out other causes. Maintain dose. Start treatment and/or standard 
supportive care per institutional guidelines.  
Grade  3 or 4  Rule out other causes. Interrupt selinexor until recovers to Grade 2 or 
baseline and reduce selinexor by 1 dose level.  
Isolated values of Grade ≥3 alkaline phosphatase do NOT require dose 
interruption. Determination of liver versus bone etiology sh ould be 
made, and evaluation of gamma -glutamyl transferase, 5' -nucleotidase, or 
other liver enzymes should be performed.  
IV: intravenous; NCCN: National Comprehensive Cancer Network; QD: once daily; PO: oral; SC: 
subcutaneous: TLS: tumor lysis syndrome.  
aFor all  Grade ≥3  hematologic  or non-hematologic AEs  that are NOT  selinexor related, after consultation 
with the Medical Monitor and at the discretion of the Investigator, selinexor dosing may be maintained.  
bFor all selinexor -related AE’s, if the below pre scribed dose reductions/interruptions result in a stabilization 
of [ADDRESS_531076] preceding toxicity.  
Note: When toxicities due to sel inexor have returned to baseline levels or the patient has stabilized, the dose 
of selinexor may be re -escalated in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
12.2.2.  Dose Reduction for Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)  
Selinexor is not significantly eliminated by [CONTACT_10521].  Therefore, no dose alteration of 
selinexor/placebo is required in patients with renal dysfunction.  
12.2.3.  Dose Adjustment in the Setting of Infection  
Patients with active uncontrolled or suspected infections should have treatment interru pted 
until the patient is clinically stab le. When ready to resume dosing , treatment may continue at 
the original dose.  Missed doses will not be replaced.  Patients may continue antibiotics for 
prolonged periods while re -initiating their treatment at the dis cretion of the Investigator .  
12.2.4.  Conditions N ot Requiring Dose Reduction  
The following conditions are exceptions to the guidelines.  Dosing does not need to be 
interrupted  in the following cases:  
• Alopecia of any grade  
• Electrolyte or serum analyte ( eg, urate) a bnormalities that is reversible with standard 
interventions  
• Isolated values of Grade ≥ 3 alkaline phosphatase. Determination of liver versus bone 
etiology should be made, and evaluation of gamma -glutamyl transferase, 
5' nucleotidase, or other liver enzymes  should be performed.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 98 [IP_ADDRESS].  Missed or Vomited Doses  
Missed and Delayed Doses  
A maximum of [ADDRESS_531077] be skipped ( eg, due to recommendation of Investigator ), the next dose will 
be taken as per schedule. Doses should not be administered less than 36  hr apart and all 
missed and delayed doses should be documented.  
Vomited Doses  
If a dose is vomited within one hour of ingestion, it will be replaced.  If vomiting occurs more 
than one hour after dosing, it will still be considered a complete dose.  
If a patient missed a full week of dosing for non -study treatment  related events ( eg, a 
required medical procedure or an unanticipated personal emergency), the days missed will 
not be replaced.  For example, if patient m issed dosing fr om Cycle 2 Day 7 to Cycle  2 
Day 14, then the patient will re -start dosing on Cycle 2 Day 15.  
12.2.5.  Supportive Care and Concomitant Treatments  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Required Prophylactic Therapy with 5 -HT3 Antagonists  
In order to minimize nausea, unless contraindicated,  all patients should  receive 5-HT3 
antagonists ( 8 mg or equivalent) starting before the first dose  of blinded study treatment  and 
continued  2-3 times daily thereafter , as needed . Alternative treatment may be provided if the 
patient does not tolerate 5 -HT3 antagonists.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Supportive Care  
General Supportive Care Recommendations  
Supportive measures for optimal medical care should be provided during part icipation in this 
clinical study . Based on clinical observations  1672  adult patients in Karyopharm -sponsored 
studies as of 31 Ma rch 2018, the main adverse drug reactions are primarily related to 
anorexia with poor caloric and fluid intake, fatigue, and nausea.  Thrombocytopenia also 
occurs, although it is rarely associated with bleeding. Besides the required 5 -HT3 
prophylaxis ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), supportive ca re including anti -nausea / anti -emetic therapy, 
acid suppression (proton pump inhibitors and/or H2-blockers) and other treatments may be 
administered as described below:

Selinexor -Related Adverse Eve nts 
Please see detailed recommendations in  Table  9: Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment 
Guidelines.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Concomitant Medication and Treatment  
Concomitant medication includes any prescription or over -the-counter preparation, including 
vitamins and  supplements.  Patients may continue their baseline medication(s). All 
concomitant medication(s) must be reported in t he eCRF . Any diagnostic, therapeutic, or 
surgical procedure performed during the study period should be recorded, including the 
dates, desc ription of the procedure(s), and any clinical findings.   
Permitted Concomitant Medication  
Patients will receive concomitant medications to treat symptoms, AEs and intercurrent 
illnesses that are medically necessary as standard care.  Medications to treat concomitant 
diseases like diabetes, hypertension, etc., are allowed.  
Contraception Requirements  
For females of childbearing potential, a negative serum hCG pregnancy test must be obtained 
at Screening within [ADDRESS_531079] be obtained at the EoBT Visit (or within [ADDRESS_531080] dose of 
open -label selinexor).  
Patients should not become p regnant or father a child while on this study because the study 
treatments in this study can affect an unborn baby.  
Female patients should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. It is important that patients 
understand the need to use birth control wh ile on this study.  
Female patients of childbearing potential and fertile male patients who are sexually active 
with a female of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception 
throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_531081] dose of study treatment.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are listed in Section  13.3.1 .  
Use of Blood P roducts  
During treatment, pat ients may receive RBC  or platelet transfusions, if clinically indicated, 
per institutional guidelines.  Patients who require repeated transfusion support should be 
discussed with the PI, Sponsor, and Medical Monitor.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 100 Appropriate anti -coagulation is allowed during the study ( eg, low molec ular weight  heparin, 
direct factor Xa inhibitors, etc.).  Warfarin is allowed during the study provided patients are 
monitored for INR twice a week during the first two cycles of therapy, then weekly to 
biweekly thereafter.  
Patients may receive supportive care with erythropoietin, darbepoetin, granulocyte -colony 
stimulating factor (G -CSF) or granulocyte macrophag e-colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF), 
pegylated growth factors, and platelet stimulatory factors, in accordance with  clinical 
practice or institutional guidelines , prior to entry and throughout the study.   
Glucocorticoid Therapy  
Glucocorticoids ≤  20 mg oral prednisone (or equivalent) per day are permitted at baseline 
and during the study for non -malignant conditions ( ie, asthma, irritable bowel disease, etc.), 
as needed, but patients should preferably have been on a stable dose for at least two weeks 
before study entry.  
Radiation Treatment  
If clinically indicated, palliative radiation therapy to non -target lesions is per mitted but study 
treatment  should be interrupted  for two days before the start of pal liative radiation therapy 
and 2  days after palliative radiation therapy.  Treatment shall not be discontinued solely due 
to palliative radiation.  (Radiation may be needed to treat the patient’s  liposarcoma and would 
require discontinuation  of study  treatment .)

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 103 13.  SAFETY DEFIN ITIONS, RECORDING , AND REPORTING  
13.1. Adverse Events  
13.1.1.  Definitions  
• Adverse event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and uni ntended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study 
treatment.  
• Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) : Any event t hat was not present prior 
to the initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in 
either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment.  
• Adverse event of special interest (AESI) : Any AE (serious or nonserious) that is of 
scientific and medical concern specific to the study treatment, for which ongoing 
monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_420882].  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) : Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, 
results in death; is life threatening (ie, an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe); requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226526]; results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. (See Section  13.2.2  
for additional information about SAE reporting.)  
13.1.2.  Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs that begin or worsen after the patient has provided informed consent will be 
recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF, regardless of whether dosing with study drug has 
commenced. AE monitoring should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_531084] dose 
of study treatment (ie, through [ADDRESS_531085] dose or until resolution or through the 
end of the study for events considered related to study treatm ent by [CONTACT_737]). AEs 
(including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be recorded as a separate 
AE. 
The Investigator should ask the patient non -leading questions to determine if AEs occur 
during the study. AEs may also be recorded when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_102], or 
through physical examination, labor atory tests, or other clinical assessments.  
An AE should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 104 severity of the event, the sus pected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions 
required to treat the event, and the outcome.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (ie, are considered to be 
clinically significant, in duce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or 
require changes in  study treatment) should be recorded on the Adverse Events eCRF . 
Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia 
instead of low hemoglob in). Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for an AE should 
be followed until they have returned to baseline (at screening) or an adequate explanation of 
the abnormality is identified. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a 
sign/symptom of an already reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the 
laboratory/test result as an additional event.  
A laboratory abnormality that does not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as 
an AE. A Grade 3 or 4 event (se vere per NCI CTCAE v.  4.03) does not automatically 
indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined in Section  13.1.1  and/or 
as per Investigator’s discretion. A laboratory abnormality that results in a dose being 
interrupted  or modified would, by [CONTACT_108], be an AE and must be recorded as such in the 
eCRFs . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Other Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
As of Ma y 2018, [ADDRESS_531086] been  reported : 4 patients in Karyopharm -sponsored 
studies, 2 patients in Investigator -sponsored studies, and 2 patient s in the expanded access 
program (compassionate use). Of the 8 patients, 5 had MM reported as their underlying 
cancer and 3 had hematolo gical malignancies (including AML and acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia). The event onset latency ranged from 3  to 8 days (median 4 days). The total 
selinexor dose prior to event onset ranged from 40 mg to 320 mg (median 160 mg). The 
outcome was reported as rec overed in 4 patients, not recovered in 2 patient s, and the outcome 
was not reported  in 2 patient. The Investigators assessed 7 of the events as related to 
selinexor. Of the 8 cases summarized above, there were 3 cases with Grade 5 TEAEs 
reported. The cause  of death in each of these cases was reported as: respi[INVESTIGATOR_420845] (Grade 5), sepsis (Grade 5), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
chemotherapy -induced cardiomyopathy and acute lymphoid leukemia (Grade 5). No fatal 
outcomes due to TLS hav e been reported in any studies with selinexor, or in the ongoing 
expanded access program. Although the incidence of TLS is low (~0.3%), the causal 
relationship between selinexor treatment and TLS cannot be completely excluded. Early 
recognition of signs an d symptoms in patients at risk for TLS, including identification of 
abnormal clinical and laboratory values, is key and Investigators must ensure that patients 
being treated with selinexor maintain adequate caloric and fluid intake. Close monitoring and 
management of patients with hematological malignancies for potential signs and symptoms 
of TLS are most relevant. See Table  9 for supportive care and Table  8 for selinexor dose 
modification guidance.

Grading Scale, v. 4.03 (the NCI CTCAE files can be accessed online at the following URL: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html).  
If NCI CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity will be characterized as “mild,” 
“moderate,” “severe,” o r “life -threatening (corresponding to Grades 1 to 4) according to the 
following definitions:  
• Grade 1 (Mild) events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s 
daily activities.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate) events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to 
the patient and may interfere with daily activities.  
• Grade 3 (Severe) events interrupt the patient’s usual daily activities.  
• Grade 4 events are Life -threatening.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of 
relatively minor clinical significance (eg, ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as a 
“serious” AE.  
13.1.4.  Adverse Event Causality  
The Investigator will make a judgment regarding the relationship of the AE to study 
treatment, as defined below.  
• Not related:  These events will lack a temporal relationship of the event to 
the study treatment, making a causal relationship not 
reasonably possible . Exposure to other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions may provide a  
sufficient explanation for the event.  
• Related:  There is a temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment making a definitive relationship, and the event is 
more likely explained by [CONTACT_420883], therap eutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions.  
13.2. Serious Adverse Events  
See Section  13.1.[ADDRESS_531088] be reported (in 
addition to SAEs that occur after the first dose of study treatment).   
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threaten ing, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 106 dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Events that Do N ot Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify study treatment or study procedures 
(i.e., an overnight stay to facilitate 24 -hour urine capture) or other medical procedures are not 
considered SAEs. However, a hospi [INVESTIGATOR_37349] ‘serious’ 
is any inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37350] a minimum of an overnight stay in a health 
care facility. An emergency room visit is not considered a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420846] (eg, undesirable effects of any administered treatment) 
must be documented as an SAE.  
Progression of the malignancy (including fatal outcomes) should NOT be reported as an SAE 
during the study or within the safety reporting pe riod (see  Section  13.2.2 ). Sudden and 
unexplained death should be reported as an SAE. If there is any uncertainty about a finding 
being due solely t o progression of malignancy, the finding should be reported as an AE or 
SAE, as appropriate,  Section  13.1.1 ).  
13.2.1.  Recording of Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to record and document all SAEs occurring from 
the signing of the ICF until at least [ADDRESS_531089] be retained in the Investigator’s 
site file.  
All applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The Investigator must assess and re cord the relationship of each SAE to 
study treatment and complete the SAE Report Form (in English).  
See ICH E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Attachment 1) for key data elements that are required for e xpedited reporting.  
13.2.2.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events

follow -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the follow -up 
information.  
An SAE should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more  frequently, if necessary) of any changes in 
severity of the event, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions 
required to treat the event, and the outcome.  
13.2.3.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serio us adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that are unexpected and 
judged by [CONTACT_37391]. 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with the FDA’s “Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs and Bioanalytical/Bioequivalence Studies” or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
In addition, Karyopharm will communicate all cases of ce rebellar toxicity, Grade 3 or higher, 
to regulatory authorities, central ethics committees (eg, IRBs), and Investigators, in the 
format of an expedited Safety Report, within 7  days of awareness of the event.  
If required by [CONTACT_427], the Investiga tor is responsible for notifying his/her IRB or 
local ethics committee of all SAEs.  
13.3. Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
13.3.1.  Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  
Note: Pregnancy per se is not considered to be an AE; however, it is discussed here because 
of the im portance of reporting pregnancies that occur during studies and because a medical 
occurrence observed in the mother or fetus/newborn would be classified as an AE.  
During both blinded and open -label treatment, f emale patients of childbearing potential and 
fertile male patients will be informed as to the potential risk of conception while participating 
in this study and will be advised that they must use highly effective contraception listed 
below (ie, results in a low failure rate when used consistently and correctly) during the 
dosing period and for a period of at least 3 months after the end of treatment.  
Highly effective methods include:  
• combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
o oral 
o intravaginal  
o transdermal  
• progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:

During both blinded and open -label treatment a  pregnancy test will be performed on each 
premenopausal female patient of childbearing potential prior to the first dose of study drug, 
on Day 1 of Cycles ≥[ADDRESS_531092] knowledge of its occurrence. A pregnancy report form is 
provided by [CONTACT_159430].  
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Pregnancies must be reported to Karyopharm, regardless of whether the patient received 
selinexor or other study drugs, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from the study o r 
the study is completed, for 3 months after the patient receives his/her last dose of study 
treatment. Patients should be instructed to inform the Investigator regarding any pregnancies.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE rep ort form (eg, 
maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_531093] milk. Mothers should not breastfeed 
while being treated with selinexor -containing regimen.

All incidences of overdose, abuse, misuse, medication errors, and occupational exposure are 
required to be reported to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance on an SAE report form, emailed  to 
[EMAIL_633] , regardless of whether or not there is an associated AE 
or SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or accidental administration of any study treatment to a study 
patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the study protocol. 
If an overdose occurs, the Investigator and Karyopharm should be notified immediately, and 
the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Resulting symptoms should be treated, as 
appropriate, and the incident of overdo se and related AEs and/or treatment should be 
documented in the patient’s medical record and in the eCRF. Overdose is to be reported on 
an SAE report form to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance regardless of whether or not an AE or 
SAE has occurred due to the ove rdose. If the overdose is associated with an SAE, the SAE 
report form must be submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_531094] GSH might be considered as part of the overall management 
plan.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Abuse, Misuse, or Medication Error  
Abuse is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment which is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_420884] p sychological effects.  
A medication error is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate study 
treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is in the control of the health care 
professionals or patients. Such incident may be  due to health care professional practice, 
product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, 
including the following: prescribing, order communication, nomenclature, compounding, 
dispensing, distribution, administrati on, education, monitoring, and use.  
All occurrences of abuse, misuse, or medication error with any study treatment are to be 
reported on an SAE report form to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance regardless of whether or 
not an AE or SAE has occurred due to the ab use, misuse, or medication error. If the abuse, 
misuse, or medication error is associated with an SAE, the SAE report form must be 
submitted to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_531095] be submitte d within 24 hours of awareness.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Occupational Exposure  
Occupational exposure is the exposure to a study treatment as a result of one’s professional 
or non -professional occupation.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 111 14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock.  Any deviation from 
the statistical plan will be described in the final report.  
14.1. General Considerations  
This is a multicenter randomized double -blind Phase 2 -3 study of the SINE selinexor given 
orally in patients with advanced unresectable liposarcoma.  
Enrollme nt in Phase 2 has been completed  and the preplanned analysis of PFS (after 40 PFS 
events were observed) was performed . Details are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
There was no break between Phase  2 and Phase 3 enrollment.  
In Phase 3, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive selinexor (60 mg) or 
placeb o. Randomization details are provided in Section  7.7.  
Patients  in the placebo arm  who have PD while they are receiving blinded stud y treatment 
will be allowed to cross  over to open -label selinexor  (see Section  7.2.1).  
Patients who are on blinded study treatment at the time of the primary PFS analysis at the 
end of Phase 3 may proceed as follows:  
• Patients in the placebo arm may cr oss over to open -label selinexor.  
• Patients in the selinexor arm will continue selinexor but as open -label treatment.  
Tabulations will be produced for appropriate demographic, baseline, efficacy, and safety 
parameters.  For categorical variables, summary tabulations of the number and percentage of 
patients within each category (with a category for missing data) of the parameter will be 
presented, as well as two -sided 95% CIs, unless otherwise stated. For continuous variab les, 
the number of patients, mean, med ian, standard deviation , minimum, and maximum values 
will be presented.  Time -to-event data  will be summarized with Kaplan -Meier methodology 
using 25th, 50th (median), and 75t h percentiles with associated 2 -sided 95% CIs as well as 
percentage of censored observations .  
14.1.1.  Determination of Sample Size  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Determination of Sample Size for Phase 2  
Enrollment in Phase 2 has been completed .  
Fifty -seven patients were randomized to selinexor or placebo in a 1:1 allocation. 
Randomization details are provided in Section  7.7.  
The preplanned analysis of PFS (after 40 PFS events were observed) was performed and 
served as a guideline to inform the final design of the Phase 3 portion of the study.  
A summary of the preliminary efficacy results  for Phase 2  is provided in  Section  4.3.2 .

14.1.2.  Blinding and Randomization  
Study treatment  will be administered in a blinded manner.  Randomization will be performed 
across study sites within the stratification factor s, in ord er to maintain the required 
1:1 (selinexor:placebo in Phase 2) or  2:1 (selinexor:placebo  in Phase 3) randomization.  
Randomization will be performed by a centralized system after confirmation of patient 
eligibility by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section 7.6 and Section  7.7). 
14.2. Analysis Population  
14.2.1.  Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients who are randomized to study 
treatment  in Phase 3 . This population will be us ed for primary analyses of efficacy.  Patien ts 
will be analyzed in the treatment arm  to which they were randomized.  
14.2.2.  Per-Protocol Population  
The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of all patients in the ITT population who have 
no major protocol violat ions, including mis -randomizations,  that would compromise the 
assessment of efficacy; this would inclu de receipt of sufficient study treatment  
(80%  compliance or more).  Major violations will be determined independently of knowledge 
of response to study treatment . This population will be used for supportive inferences 
concerning efficacy.  Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
14.2.3.  Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all patients who have received any amount  of study 
treatment . Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.  
14.3. Data Analysis and Presentation  
Summary tabulations will be provided for disposition, demographic, baseline, efficacy, and 
safety data as noted in the following sec tions.  All data collected on the eCRF will be 
provided in by -patient data listings.  
14.3.1.  Disposition of Patients  
A tabulation of patient disposition will be presented including the number in each analysis 
population, the number in each analysis population, the  number censored at each of the PFS 
and OS analyses, the number lost to follow -up, the number that withdrew, and reason(s) for 
withdrawal.  
A by -patient listing of patient disposition information including the reason for study 
withdrawal, where applicable, will be presented.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 114 14.3.2.  Demographic Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939], as well as overall, and 
will include gender, race, ethnicity (Hispanic origin), and age at time of consent.  For gender, 
race, and Hispanic or Latino origin, the summary statistics will be the number and percentage 
of patients within each category.  The categories for race will be those recorded in the 
database. For age at time of consent, the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard 
deviation  will be provided for each arm and the total sample.  No formal hypothesis testing of 
treatment differences will be performed.  
14.3.3.  Baseline Characteristics and Medical History  
Baseline characteristics include ECOG performance status, duration from initial diagn osis, 
response to previous therapy, types of prior therapy, and number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Baseline 
data will be summarized for each treatment group using summary statistics; no formal 
hypothesis testing of treatment differences will be performed.  
Medical history and physical examination  results at baseline will be tabulated by [CONTACT_3148].  
14.3.4.  Efficacy Analysis  
Disease assessments at the date of surgical or radiotherapy intervention may be censored in 
patients receiving such care, since these patients are receiv ing non -protocol specified therapy 
(ie, intervention), which may impact endpoint(s).   
Based on the preplanned  analysis of PFS by [CONTACT_420853] v . 1.1 C riteria  in the Phase 2 
portion of the study , the response criteria fo r the primary analysis (PFS) were  changed from 
WHO to RECIST v . 1.1 C riteria in Version 4.0 of the protocol. Consequently, data from the 
Phase 2 portion of the study will be excluded from the final efficacy analysis in order to 
maintain statistical integrity and preserve overall T ype I erro r rate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Efficacy Analysis for Phase 2  
All Phase 2 analyses will be conducted among Phase 2 patients only.  
Phase 2 Primary Endpoint Analysis:  
The preplanned  analysis of PFS  after [ADDRESS_531099] v. 1.1 , or death due to any cause. Evaluation of the 
radiographic data for the PFS primary endpoint will be ba sed on data from a  scan review 
by [CONTACT_420885] r eader.  
The formal primary Phase 2 PFS analysis will be pe rformed on all 56 eligible patients 
randomized to study treatment  in Phase 2 when their  treatment assignments  are unblinded . 
Patients will be analyzed in the treatment arm to which they are randomize d.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 116 Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model will be used to  assess PFS, adjusted for 
stratification factor and other prognostic covariates. Model assumptions will be examined, 
and in the presence of non -proportional predictors, str atification or including a 
time-dependent variable of the non -proportional predictor s will be considered as 
appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Phase 3 Secondary Key and Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Secondary Key Endpoint Analysis  
Key s econdary  variables will include the following, assessed in hierarchical fashion in the 
order presented  (to preserve the overall Type I error for the study) , according to the 
definitions described in the objectives and study endpoints:  
• OS for non -inferiority  
• OS for superiority  
OS endpoints will be analyzed using the stratified log -rank test as described above. In 
sensitivity analysis for OS, the 2-stage estimation  method  will be implemented to assess the 
impact of cross -over on the effect of selinexor on OS  (Latimer 2017, Latimer 2018 ). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The compa rison of TTP in the current study to TTP on the most recent prior therapy will be 
performed as time -to-event using a stratified log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_420886].  Note that TTP for the 
current study may represent censored results, therefore, to minimize the impact of 
censoring, this analysis may require maturation of the TTP data beyond the required time at 
which the number of events for the primary PFS analysis at the end of Pha se [ADDRESS_531104] 
occurred.  
Comparison of ORR between the two treatment arms will  be performed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) χ2 or exact test as appropriate, stratified by [CONTACT_150087]. For OS, an additional descriptive compar ison of the 
median OS from the randomized selinexor arm will be made to historical OS to the extent 
feasible, to assist in providing the proper context for the ITT analysis of selinexor versus 
placebo.  
DOR and PFS according to the Investigator will be analyzed using the stratified log rank 
test as described above.  
QoL Analysis  
The QoL endpoint as assessed by [CONTACT_20368] -C30 and EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L 
questionnaires will be analyzed as a total score, using a linear mixed effects model with 
fixed effect of tr eatment arm, randomization stratification factors, and the baseline value 
for the parameter in the model as a covariate, as well as random effect of subjects and 
repeated measures over time points. For EORTC QLQ -C30 the transformed score will be 
used, calc ulated according to the EORTC QLQ -C30 Scoring Manual . For the EuroQoL 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, the overall health score will be used.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 118 [IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and 
displayed in tables and listings using MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and Preferred 
Term.  
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment -emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset or worsening of a pre -existing 
condition on or after the first dose of study treatment through [ADDRESS_531106] dose 
of study treatment, or any event considered drug -related by [CONTACT_420887].  AEs with partial dates will be assessed using the available date information to 
determine if treatm ent-emergent; AEs with completely missing dates will be assumed to be 
treatment -emergent.  No formal hypothesis -testing of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_127437]; therefore, in any tabulation, a patient 
contr ibutes only once to the count for a given AE (preferred term).  The number and 
percentage of patients with any TEAE will be summarized for each treatment group, 
classified by [CONTACT_9315].  The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs 
assessed by [CONTACT_420888].  The number and 
percentage of patients with a ny Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_531107] severity 
and/or strongest causal relationship to treatment will be used for purposes of tabulations.   
SAEs will also be tabulated.  
All AEs (treatment -emergent and post -treatment) will be listed in by -patient data listings, 
classified by [CONTACT_3148], patient and day on study.  In addition, separate by -patient listings will 
be provided  for the following: patient deaths; serious AEs; and AEs leading to withdrawal.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory Data  
Clinical laboratory values will be expressed using conventional SI units.  
For each treatment arm, the actual value and change from baseline (Day 1, prior to the first 
administration of study treatment ) to each on study evaluation will be summarized for each 
clinical laboratory parameter, including hematology, clinical chemistry,  coagulation and 
urinalysis.  In the event of repeat values, the last non -missing value per study day/time will be 
used.  In the event that Day 1 data are unavailable for a given patient/parameter, the screening 
value will substitute as the baseline value.  
Severity of select clinical lab measures will be determined using CTCAE criteria ( eg, those 
measures that have a corresponding CTCAE grade classification).  Labs with CTCAE grades 
greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_531108] on -study values relative to CTCAE 
classification ranges will be produced.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 119 [IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs and Physical Examinations  
The actual value and change from baseline (Day 1, prior to the first ad ministration of study 
treatment ) to each on study evaluation will be summarized for vital signs.  
By-patient listings of vital sign measurements will be presented in data listings.  
Abnormal physical examination  resul ts at screening, and abnormal  physical ex amination 
results (AEs) during the study, will be summarized.  All physical examination  findings will be 
presented in by -patient data listings.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Concomitant Medications  
The use of concomitant medications will be included in by -patient data listings.  
14.3.7.  Procedur es for Handling Missing Data  
No imputation of missing efficacy data is planned for the primary analysis of efficacy 
endpoints.  For patient reported QoL measurements, missing data will be handled as described 
in the EORT C-QLQ -C30 and EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L Scorin g Manuals . Additional sensitivity 
analyses will be done using the Jump to Reference (J2R) and last observation carried forward 
imputation approaches.   
For time to event analyses, patients who have no efficacy evaluations will be considered as 
censored at time 0.  For OS, patients will be censored on the date they were last known to be 
alive regardless of disease status.  
For AEs, missing dates will not be imputed; however, if partial dates are available, they will 
be used to assess if the AE occurred during  the treatment period.  Missing severities of AEs 
will not be imputed and will be considered missing in any tabulations of AE severity.  If an 
AE is missing a response to the question regarding relationship to treatment, the event will be 
considered to be re lated.  
14.4. Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analysis  
All deviations from the original statistical analysis plan will be documented and provided in 
the final clinical study report.  
14.5. Clinical S tudy Reports  
A primary clinical study report (CSR) may be written based on all available patients’ data 
following completion of the primary PFS analysis.  The final CSR will be reported when all 
patients have  completed the follow -up period, wi thdrawn consent, lost to follow -up, or have 
died.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 120 15. DATA CO LLECTION AND MANAGEM ENT  
15.1. Data Confidentiality  
Information about study patients will be kept confidential and managed under the applicable 
laws and regulations. Those regulations require a signed patient authorization informing the 
patient of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the Investigator , by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to th e revocation of patient 
authorization. For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect follow -up safety information ( eg has the 
patient experienced any new or worsened AEs) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
The data collection system for this study uses built -in security features to encrypt all data for 
transmission in both directions, preventing unauthorized access to confidential participant 
information. Access to the sy stem will be controlled by a sequence of individually assigned 
user identification codes and passwords, made available only to authorized personnel who 
have completed prerequisite training.  
15.2. Site Monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visi t or at an Investigator ’s meeting, Karyopharm 
personnel (or desig nated contract research organization ) will review the protocol and CRFs 
with the Investigator s and their staff. During the study, the monitor will visit the site 
regularly to check the comple teness of patient records, accuracy of entries on the CRFs, 
adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice ( GCP), progress of enrollment, and 
to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to 
specifications.  Key study personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these 
visits.  
The Investigator  must maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, la boratory data, ECG s, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All 
information recorded on CRFs must be traceable to source documents in the patient's file. 
The Investigator  must also keep the origi nal signed ICF  (a sign ed copy is given to the 
patient).  
The Investigator  must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency with the CRF entries. Karyopharm monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed conse nt, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data 
with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 121 15.3. Data Collection  
This study will utilize Electr onic Data Capture (EDC), the designated clinical site staff will 
enter the data required by [CONTACT_420889] e eCRF . The eCRFs have been built using fully 
validated secure web -enabled software that conforms t o [ADDRESS_531109], which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
classification system. Medical history/current medi cal conditions and AE s will be coded 
using the MedDRA terminology.  
15.4. Database Management and Quality Control  
Karyopharm personnel ( or des ignated contract research organization ) will review the eCRF 
data entered by [CONTACT_5375]. Electronic data queries 
stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies  
and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated 
Investigator  site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary 
changes to the data.  
At the conclusion of the study, after discrepancies a nd missing values have been completed 
and the data have been verified to be complete and accurate, the database will be declared 
locked.  
For EDC studies, after database lock, the Investigator  will receive a CD -ROM or paper 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_420847] a rchiving at the investigational site.

16.3. Institutional Review Boards/ Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol and th e proposed ICF (s) must be reviewed and approved by a properly 
constituted IRB/IEC before study start.  Prior to study start, the Investigator  is required to sign 
a protocol signature [CONTACT_5389]/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance 
with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to 
give access to all relevant data and records to Karyopharm monitors, auditors, designated 
agents of Karyopharm, IRBs/IECs and regulatory authorities as required.  
16.4. Informed Consent  
Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, w here 
required by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent . 
In addition to the signing of informed consent by [CONTACT_107605], adolescent patie nts (permitted 
only in countries in which adolescents have been approved by [CONTACT_420870]/local 
regulato ry/ethical authority ) should sign written Assent F orms (witnessed, where required by 
[CONTACT_6617]).  
Informed consent for blinded study treatment must be obtai ned before conducting any 
study -specific procedures ( ie, all of the procedures described in the protocol). Informed 
consent for open -label selinexor must be obtained before any study -specific measures for 
open -label selinexor are co nducted at the Open -label C1 D 1 Visit. The process of obtaining 
informed consent  should be documented in the patient source documents. The date when a 
patient ’s Informed Consent was actually obtained will be captured in their CRFs.  
Karyopharm will provide to Investigator s, in a separate document, proposed ICF s that are  
considered appr opriate for this study and comply  with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory 
requirements. Any changes to the  ICFs suggested by [CONTACT_420890]/IEC, and a copy of the approved version (s) must 
be provided to the Karyopharm after IRB/IEC approval.  
Females of  child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment  may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that 
in order to participat e in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement s for the 
duration of the study. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably comply, they 
should not be entered in the study.  
Selinexor (KPT -330)  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-[ADDRESS_531110] ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by 
[CONTACT_420891]. Signed ICF s and patient enrollment log s 
must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site.  
16.5.1.  Study Documentation, Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_420848] , 
in compliance with Section 4.9 of the ICH E6 GCP, and regulatory and institutional 
requirements f or the protection of confidentiality of patient s. As part of participating in a 
Karyopharm -sponsored study, each site will permit authorized representatives of 
Karyopharm and regulatory agencies to examine (and when required by [CONTACT_1289], to 
copy) cli nical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of 
the study safety and progress.  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or othe r 
activities in a clinical study  necessary for  the reconstruc tion and evaluation of the study . 
Examples of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patients’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists, p harmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_16213], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, and 
patient files and reco rds kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico -technical 
department s involved in the clinical study . 
Data collection is the resp onsibility of the clinical study  staff at the site, under the 
supervision of the site Investigator. The stu dy eCRF  is the primary data collection instrument 
for the study. The Investigator  should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported in the eCRFs and all other required reports. Data reported on 
the eCRF that are derived from s ource documents should be consistent with the source 
documents or the discrepancies should be explained. All data requested on the eCRF must be 
recorded. Any missing data must be explained. An audit trail will be maintained by [CONTACT_420892].  
The Investig ator/institu tion should maintain the study  documents as specified in Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6 Section 8) and as required by 
[CONTACT_64122]/or guidelines. The Investigator /institution should take measures t o 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  
Essential documents (written and electronic) should be retained for a period of not less than 
fifteen (15) years from the completion of the clinical study  unless Karyopharm provides 
written permission to dispose of them or, requires their retention for an additional period of 
time because of applicable laws, regulations and/or guidelines.  
16.6. Publication of Study Protocol and Results  
Karyopharm assures that the key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly 
accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study completion and

16.7. Discontinuation of the Study  
Karyopharm reserves the right to discontinue this study under the conditions specified in the 
clinical study agreement.  
16.7.1.  Audits and Inspections  
Source data/documents must be available to inspections by [CONTACT_420893].  
16.8. Protocol Adherence  
Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. All 
significant protocol deviations w ill be recorded and reported in the CSR.  
16.9. Amendments to the Protocol  
Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment 
that must be approved by [CONTACT_159430], Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC. 
Only amendm ents that are required for patient safety may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC 
approval. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the 
Investigator  is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any patient 
included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such 
cases, Karyopharm should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should 
be informed according to local regulations ( eg, [LOCATION_006] requires the notific ation of urgent safety 
measures within 3 days) but not later than 10 working days.

Clinical Study Protocol: KCP -330-[ADDRESS_531124] Version  1.1  
(Modified from Eisenhauer 2009 ) 
All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE on study classified as outlined below:  
Complete Response  (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lym ph nodes (whether target or  
non-target) must have reduction in the short axis to <  10mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.  
Stable Disease (SD)  
Steady state of disease.  Neither suff icient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD.  
Progressive Disease  (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the 
smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment start ed. In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Appearance of one or more new lesions will also constitute PD.  
Response Duration  
Response duration will be measured from the time measure ment criteria for CR/PR 
(whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or PD is 
objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.  
Stable Disease Duration  
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of therapy until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.

Version 9.0  Confidential  Page 134 Method of Measurement  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  
Clinical Le sions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial ( eg, skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_30575] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommend ed.  
Chest X -ray 
Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
CT (preferred) or MRI   
CT (preferred) and MRI imaging might be the best currently available and reproducible 
methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and 
MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_531126], abdomen and pelvis.  Head & neck and extremities usually require specific 
protocols.  
Ultrasound  
When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) 
should not be used to measure tumour lesions that are clinically not easily accessible.  It is a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements for superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disapp earance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
Cytology, Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for example, 
residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known  residual benign 
tumours can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumour has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate be tween response or stable disease 
(an effusion may be an adverse drug reaction of the treatment) and/or  PD.

A Phase 1b/2 Study of FT -2102 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Gliomas with an IDH1 
Mutation   
Cohort 1  will include 16-46 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory glioma (per World Health 
organization [ WHO] criteria 2016) with confirmed IDH1 mutation.  
Cohort 2 will include approximately 21- 78 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory hepatobili ary 
tumors with confirmed IDH1 mutation previously treated with an approved therapy for hepatobiliary 
cancer (HBC). 
Cohort 3 will include approximately 16- 46 evaluable patients with recurrent, refractory or either locally 
advanced or metastatic chondrosarcoma with confirmed IDH1 mutation not amenable to complete 
surgical excision.  
Cohort 4 will include approximately 21- 77 evaluable patients with advanced, nonresectable or 
metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with confirmed IDH1 mutation not eligible for curative resection or transplantation.  
Cohort 5 will include up to 6 patients with relapsed or refractory other tumors with confirmed IDH1 
mutation . 
Study Duration:  
It is estimated that this study will last approximately 30 months. The expected duration of study 
treatment for each patient will be approximately 26 weeks.  
Patients will remain on study treatment (either single -agent FT -2102 or combination therapy) until  
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . 
Patients will be followed for safety for [ADDRESS_545275] dose of study drug or until resolution or 
stabilization of ongoing adverse events ( AEs).  
Patients may be followed for survival approximately every [ADDRESS_545276] 
dose of study treatment or for up to 12 months after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).  
The end of the study will be defined as last patient last visit (LPLV) . 
Study Centers:  
Enrollment is anticipated at approximately 50 global sites  (in North America, Europe, and Asia 
Pacific).

(Version 5) 28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 113  Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2, open -label, multiple -cohort study examining the efficacy and safety 
of FT -2102 as a single agent or in combination for the treatment of patients with advanced solid 
tumors and gliomas with an IDH1 R132X mutation.  
The starting dose of FT -2102 is 150 mg twice daily ( BID) admini stered continuously in 28-day 
cycles; the selection of the starting dose is based on results from a Phase 1 study in patients with 
hematologic malignancies.  
Safety Lead -in Period: Phase 1b  
Safety Lead -In, Single -Agent:  The study will consist of a Safety L ead-in Period to confirm the safety 
and tolerability of single -agent FT -2102 150 mg BID administered over 28 days (1 cycle). The Safety 
Lead -in Period will employ a traditional 3+3 design, whereby 3 patients with any of the specified 
solid tumors and (Coho rts 2a-5a) or glioma (Cohort 1a)  are treated with FT -2102 150 mg BID and 
monitored for dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of study treatment.  
• If no dose -limiting toxicities occur in the first 3 patients in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 
2a-5a inclusive ) or the glioma group (Cohort 1a) , and available pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic ( PD) data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the 4 disease -
specific cohorts described below.  
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients in either group, an additional 3 patients will be treated at 
that dose level in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 2a -5a inclusive ) or the glioma group 
(Cohort 1a) . If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients (ie , <2 DLTs per 6 patients) and 
available PK/ PD data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the 4 disease -specific cohorts 
described below.  
• If there are ≥ 2 DLTs at the starting dose, 150 mg once daily of FT -2102 will be evaluated 
following review  by [CONTACT_7244] (SRC). Likewise, higher doses may be 
evaluated based upon safety, PK, and PD  data as determined by [CONTACT_12217].    
Safety Lead -In Combination: DLTs will be evaluated within the first 3 (or 6) patient s of any cohort 
examining combination therapy to confirm the safety and tolerability of combination therapy 
administered over 28 days (1 cycle) for Cohort 1b, Cohort 2b, Cohort 3b, and Cohort 4b using a 3+3 
design (i .e., up to the first 6 patients in each combination cohort ).  The cohort will be stopped if there 
is more than [ADDRESS_545277] 6 patient s, and additional dose levels will be evaluated as follows:  
• If no DLTs occur in the first 3 patients in a combination cohort and available PK/PD  data 
support the dose, enrollment will continue in  that disease -specific cohort.  
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients in a combination cohort, an additional 3 patients will be 
treated at that dose level. If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients (ie, < 2 DLTs per 
6 patients) and available PK/PD data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the specific 
combination cohort.  
• If there are ≥ 2 DLTs at the starting dose, the following dose de -escalations of either the 
combination agent or FT -2102 will be evaluated following review  by [CONTACT_431076]. Following that 
evaluation, the SRC will evaluate the available safety, PK , and PD data to determine the dose(s) 
to be used in the combination Phase 2.

each cohort will be treated with study therapy (either  single -agent FT -2102 or in combination with 
antineoplastic agents) and evaluated for efficacy and safety.  
After up to [ADDRESS_545280] 4 cycles of study treatment, disease-
specific efficacy data will be evaluated to determine continued enrollment to Stage 2. Enrollment will 
continue during the Stage 1 evaluation. If Stage 1 efficacy criteria from any single -agent FT -2102 
cohort is not met, then examination of combination therapy may  be initiated in a new Simon’s 2 -
stage design.  
Safety data from Stage 1 will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_163257]. Significant safety 
findings may lead to an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_431064] 2 of any cohort.  
For the Safety Lead -in Period and Stage 1 of each disease- specific cohort, blood samples for PK and 
PD will be obtained. Limited PK and PD  samples will be obtained during Stage 2.  
Overall response is defined as follows:  
- Glioma:  the proportion of patients with a best response of complete response/remission ( CR) 
or partial response/remission (PR ) or minor response ( MR) (low -grade glioma [ LGG]) 
- Hepatobiliary cancer: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR

Statistical Methodology  
Sample Size Determination  
This study will enroll up to approximately 200 patients.  
A single-agent Safety Lead -in Period will be implemented that may enroll approximately 12 patients, 
which includes approximately 6 patients with glioma and 6 patients with solid tumors. Following 
successful completion of the Safety Lead -in Period, the study will then enroll 4 disease -specific 
cohorts examining FT- 2102 as either single -agent or in combination. These cohorts include Cohort 1 
(glioma) with approximately 16-46  patients; Cohort 2 (HBC) w ith approximately 21-78 patients; 
Cohort 3 (chondrosarcoma) with up to 16-46 patients; and Cohort 4 (IHCC) with approximately 21-
77 patients.  There will be a fifth cohort of IDH1 mutant solid tumors, non-CNS with up to 6 patients, 
single -agent only.  
Cohor t 1a, Cohort 2a, Cohort 3a (single -agent FT -2102)  
Cohorts 1a, 2a, and 3a  will employ an optimal Simon’s 2 -Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, 
power of 80%, null hypothesis of 5% ORR and alternative hypothesis of 25%  ORR . Stage 1 of each 
single -agen t cohort will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or more 
responses, Stage 2 will initiate with additional 15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the 
total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5%  ORR  will b e rejected. If there is no response in Stage 1 
with single -agent FT -2102, combination therapy may  be evaluated.  
Cohort 4a (single -agent FT -2102)  
Cohort 4a employs an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 80%, 
null hypothesis of 8%  ORR  and alternative hypothesis of 35%  ORR . Stage 1 will evaluate 8 patients 
and if there are 2 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with additional 14 patients. If there are 5 or more responses out of the total 22 patients, the null hypothesis of 8%  ORR  will be rejected.  If there 
is 0 or 1 response in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102, combination may  be evaluated.  
Combination Cohorts (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b)  
If there is no response in Stage 1 with single -agent FT -2102 combination cohorts m ay be examined.  
Cohort 1b and Cohort 3b  
For Cohorts 1b and 3b (combination therapy), an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design will be implemented with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, 80% power, with a null hypothesis of 5%  ORR  and 
alternative hypothesis of 25%  ORR . Stage 1 of each cohort will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 
4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or more responses, Stage 2 will initiate with additional 15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5%  ORR  will be 
rejected.

agent FT -2102, combination FT -2102 + 5-azacitidine, combination FT-2102 + GemCis, and 
combination FT -2102  + PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab) who either experienced a DLT during Cycle [ADDRESS_545286] 75% of the prescribed Cycle 1 dose. This analysis sets will be used to assess the 
tolerability of FT-2102.  
The Safety Analysis Set  is defined as all patients who received any amount of study drug(s) (FT -
2102 and combination agents, if appropriate).  
This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all safety endpoints, excluding DLT evaluation. 
Safety analysis will be by [CONTACT_431083] 1 dose or dosing combination are initiated for a particular indication cohort.  
The Response-Evaluable Analysis Se t is defined as all patients with measurable disease at baseline 
who received the study drug(s) specific to the part of their particular cohort (either FT -2102 
monotherapy or FT-2102 in combination) and had at least [ADDRESS_545287] -baseline response assessment or 
discontinued the treatment phase due to disease progression (including death caused by [CONTACT_388834]) within 8 weeks (+2 -week window) of the first dose of study treatment. This analysis set 
will be the primary analysis set for efficacy endpoints. All response evaluations will be by [CONTACT_9084], 
and by [CONTACT_431084] [ADDRESS_545288] one primary PK parameter (e.g. C

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 19.0 or higher and will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE , v 4.03.  
For the Safety Lead -in Periods, the number and type of DLTs experienced by [CONTACT_431085]/combination, accompanied by a by -patient listing of DLT events. 
The listing will include the description, severity, and relationship of the events to study drug(s).  
Summaries of AEs will be based on treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs). A TEAE is an AE that starts 
or worsens in the period from the first dose of study treatment to [ADDRESS_545290] dose of study 
drug (any of the combination agents, whichever is later).  
TEAEs will be summarized by  [CONTACT_431086] (SOC s) and Preferred T erms (PT s). 
Separate tabulations will also be produced for TEAEs assessed as related to study drug(s), TEAEs 
that led to treatment discontinuation, TEAEs that led to death, and TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 in severity. 
Treatment -emergent serious AEs (SAEs) and SAEs related to study drug(s) will also be tabulated.  
Shifts in grade from baseline to the maximum post -baseline grade will be summarized by [CONTACT_431087]. Laboratory values ≥ Grade 3 in severity will be

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  [ADDRESS_545303] demonstrated reduction of methylation 
and growth inhibition in IDH1 mutant glioma xenografts and patient derived glioma initiator 
cells ( Borodovsky et al, 2013; Turcan et al, 2013 ). An investigation of single- agen t IDH1 
inhibitor and combination therapy with a demethylating agent with known safety profile, 
azacitidine, is proposed in the clinical study.  
IDH1 mutations have been reported in a subset of clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma and 
associated with poor prognosis in a single center investigation ( Lee et al, 2017 ). Histone 
modification and epi[INVESTIGATOR_431068]1-type 
chemokines and subsequently determine effector T- cell trafficking into the tumor 
microenvironment (Peng et al, 2015 ). Thus, cancer epi[INVESTIGATOR_431069]1-
type chemokine repressive marks and promote effector T -cell trafficking into the tumor 
microen vironment and improve the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. 
The PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab, has demonstrated clinical activity in advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma  (El-Khoueiry et al, 2017 ). The proposed clinical study investigates single -agent FT-
2102, then possibly in combination with nivolumab in patients with HBC with the R132X IDH1 
mutation.  
Mutations of the IDH 1/2 gene s are present in up to 50% of chondrosarcomas and reported with 
the enchondromatosis-associated non- hereditary Maffucci and Ollier syndromes, suggesting that 
the IDH mutation may represent an early tumorigenic event ( Amary et al, 2011; Meijer et al, 
2012).  IDH mutations have been shown to create a hypermethylation phenotype in 
chondrosarcoma cells which may be reversed with demethylating agents, 5- azacitidine ( Lu et al, 
2012).  The proposed clinical study will evaluate single-agent FT-[ADDRESS_545304] of care includes combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin  
(Valle et al, 2010) with a short duration of progression free survival ( PFS; 8.0 months, CI: 
6.6-8.6 months) and overall survival (OS)  of 11.7 months (CI: 9.5 -14.3 months). Other 
combination agents have been evaluated with comparable PFS and OS ( Eckmann et al, 2011).  As 
IDH mutations  have been reported to occur in up to 25% of IHCC ( Goyal et al, 2015 ), an 
evaluation of FT-2102 as a single agent followed by [CONTACT_431090] + cisplatin for patients with advanced unresectable IHCC is proposed. 
1.4. Determination of Starting Doses and Regimen  
1.4.1. Single -Agent FT -2102 
Clinical Study  2102- HEM -101 is an ongoing Phase 1/[ADDRESS_545305] 
been evaluated . FT-2102 is administered orally in continuous 28-day cycles. There were no 
DLT s observed at any doses and an MTD was not determined. The Phase 1 single-agent study 
has been completed and a review of available safety data, including all adverse events ( AEs) 
reported in patients treated with the 150 mg BID dose concluded that the safety profile was 
consistent with that of patients treated in dose escalation; no new safety signals were observed  in 
the expansion cohorts.

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 113  Based on this review , in combination with achievement of targeted 2 -HG depletion in plasma 
and preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) , FT-2102 150 mg BID was declared the RP2D for 
further evaluation  in hematologic malignancies (additional details in the IB).   
As part of the safety evaluation of the combinations, in each combination cohort, there will be a 
3+[ADDRESS_545306] been extensive evaluations of azacitidine in patients with hematologic malignancies leading to the currently approved dose is 75 mg/m
2/day × 7 days delivered either subcutaneously 
or intravenously every 28 days ( VIDAZA US Prescribing Information ). In the Clinical Study 
2102- HEM -101, as of 7- April-2018, 26 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies 
received FT -2102 in combination with azacitidine at 75 mg/m2/day × 7 days every 28 days (20 
patients: FT -2102 at 150 mg BID ; 7 patients: FT -2102 at 150 mg QD).  When given i n 
combination, when compared to single- agent FT -2102, there were additional gastrointestinal 
toxicities noted in combination (nausea, constipation, and diarrhea) and electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) which are known toxicities of azacitidine (additional 
details i n IB and azacytidine PI  (VIDAZA US Prescribing Information ). 
Clinical investigations of azacitidine in solid tumors however are quite limited.  Jeurgens 
evaluated the combination of a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat, with azacitidine dosed at either 30 mg/m
2/day or 40 mg/m2/day × 10 days (with a 48- hour interruption at Day 6) 
in patients with relapsed/refractory non -small cell lung carcinoma. The Investigator s concluded 
that 40 g/m2/day is a tolerable dose in this small subset of patients ( Juergens et al, 2011).  A meta -
analysis of 11 clinical studies in a total of 694 patients with a variety of solid tumors found 
response plus stable disease rates of ~35% in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.  The authors found that intravenous dosing was supported by [CONTACT_431091] (not subcutaneous) 
and that 67.5 mg/m
2/day correlated favorably with response rates in gastrointestinal ( GI), lung 
and breast cancer (Cowan et al, 2010 ). Thus, the proposed study will investigate initially in a 3+3 
dose confirmation an azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m2/day for a total of 7 doses permitting a 48-
hour window as needed for patient convenience. If there is toxicity at that dose, additional doses 
will be investigated.  If the patient has intolerance to azacitidine, they can continue with FT-2102 as a single agent.  
1.4.3. FT-2102 in Combination with Nivolumab  
The dose of the PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab is based upon the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved dose for hepatocellular carcinoma, specifically 240 mg IV every 2 weeks. This 
dose will be the basis for sites where nivolumab is not approved for hepatocellular carcinoma.  If 
the patient is intolerant of nivolumab, they can continue on single- agent FT -2102. Clinical 
experience to date with FT -2102 includes as a single agent or in combination with azacitidine.  
Based on the mechanism of action of nivolumab and FT- 2102, it is not anticipated that there will 
be overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], but it is unknown at this time.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 113  1.4.4. FT-2102 in Combination with GemCis  
The dose of gemcitabine/cisplatin is based upon the standard of care regimen established by 
[CONTACT_431092] ( Valle et al, 2010 ) and a reasonable global standard  in a review by [CONTACT_431093] ( Weber et al, 2015 ): cisplatin (25 mg/m2) followed by [CONTACT_35421] (1000 mg/m2), 
each administered on Days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks for eight cycles for up to 24 weeks. For patient convenience and data analysis, cycle duration will be 28 days +/- 7 days when 
gemcitabine/cisplatin is being given with FT-2102. Following completion of the 24 weeks of 
therapy or if intolerant of either agent, the patient can continue on single-agent FT-2102 with 
28-day cycles. Clinical experience to date with FT -2102 includes as a single agent or in 
combination with azacitidine. Based on the mechanism of action of gemcitabine, cisplatin and FT-2102, it is anticipated that there may be overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685] (myelosuppression and/or hepatic toxicity) but it is unknown at this time.

This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2, open -label, multiple -cohort study examining the efficacy and 
safety of FT -2102 as a single agent or in combination for the treatment of patients with advanced 
solid tumors and gliomas with IDH1 R132X mutations.  
Please see Figure 1 for an overview of the study. The starting dose of FT-2102 is 150 mg BID 
administered continuously in 28- day cycles; the selection of the starting dose is based on results 
from a Phase 1 study in patients with hematologic malignancies . 
4.1. Safety Lead- in Period: Phase 1b  
4.1.1. Single -Agent  
The study will consist of a Safety Lead- in Period to confirm the safety and tolerability of single-
agent FT-2102 150 mg BID administered over 28 days (1 cycle). The Safety -Lead-in Period will 
employ a traditional 3+3 design, whereby 3 patients with any of the solid tumors (Cohorts 2a-5a) and 3 patients with gliomas (Cohort 1a) are treated with FT -[ADDRESS_545307] cycle of study treatment.  
• If no DLTs  occur in the first 3 patients in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 2a -5a) 
or the glioma group (Cohort 1a), and available PK/PD data support the dose, 
enrollment will continue in the 4 disease -specific cohorts described  below.   
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients  in either group, an additional 3 patients will be 
treated at that dose level  in either the solid tumor group (Cohorts 2a-5a) or the glioma 
group (Cohort 1a). If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients ( ie, <2 DLTs per 
6 patients) and available PK/PD  data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the 
4 disease -specific cohorts described below.  
• If there are ≥2 DLTs at the starting dose, 150 mg once daily of FT-2102 will be 
evaluated following review  by [CONTACT_7244] (SRC). Likewise, higher 
doses may be evaluated based upon safety, PK, and PD  data as determined by [CONTACT_203851]. 
The 3+[ADDRESS_545308] 3 (or 6) patient s of any cohort examining combination 
therapy to confirm the safety and tolerability of combination therapy administered over 28 days 
(1 cycle) for Cohort 1b, Cohort 2b, Cohort 3b, and Cohort 4b using a 3+3 design (ie, up to the 
first 6 patients in each combination cohort).  The cohort will be stopped if there is  more than [ADDRESS_545309] 6 patients, and additional dose levels will be evaluated as follows:  
• If no DLTs  occur in the first 3 patients in a combination cohort and available PK/PD  
data support the dose, enrollment will continue in the that disease -specific cohort .  
• If a DLT occurs in the first 3 patients  in a combination cohort, an additional 3 patients 
will be treated at that dose level. If no DLTs occur in these additional 3 patients (ie ,

of the study drug- related AEs to  ensure that the combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431070] . 
4.2. Disease -Specific Cohorts: Phase  2  
Four disease-specific cohorts will employ a Simon’s 2- stage-wise design, whereby [ADDRESS_545311] stage of each cohort will be treated with study therapy (either single -agent FT -2102 or in 
combination with antineoplastic agents) and evaluated for eff icacy and sa fety. After up to 
[ADDRESS_545312] 4 cycles of study treatment, disease- specific 
efficacy data will be evaluated to determine continued enrollment to Stage 2. Enrollment will continue during the Stage 1 evaluation. If Stage 1 efficacy criteria from any single -agent  
FT-2102 cohort is not met, then examination of combination therapy will be initiated in a new 
Simon’s 2 -stage design.  Combination therapy in cohorts 1 -4 may also be examined in the event 
that the single agent cohort passes the futility analysis and the enrollment in the single agent 
cohort is completed .
 
Safety data from Stage 1 will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_163257]. Significant safety 
findings may lead to an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_431071] 2 of any cohort.  The Simon’s 2 -stage design is based upon Response Evaluable 
population.  Patients who are not in the Response Evaluable population will not be counted in the numerator or denominator of the number of patients needed in Phase 2. 
For the Safety Lead -in Period and Stage 1 of each disease- specific cohort, blood samples for PK 
and PD  will be obtained. Limited PK and PD  samples will be obtained during Stage 2.    
4.2.1. Cohort 1: Glioma (n=16-46) 
Cohort 1 will include patients with glioma harboring an IDH1 R132X mutation  that is relapsed 
or refractory . Glioma patients will be initia lly treated with single -agent FT -2102 ( Cohort 1a). 
Cohort 1a will employ a Simon’s 2 -stage design, in which 8 patients will be treated with single -
agent FT-2102 for 4 cycles (cycle= 28 days) and assessed for efficacy and safety (Stage 1).  
If ≥1 clinical response is observed in Stage 1, then Stage 2 (n=15) will initiate with single -agent 
FT-2102.   If no clinical responses are observed in Stage 1 with single- agent FT -2102, then combination 
therapy may be examined (FT-2102 + 5- azacitidine) (Cohort 1b ).  
Cohort 1b will employ the same Simon’s  2-stage design, enrolling  8 evaluable patients in Stage 1 
and 15 evaluable patients in Stage 2 with combination therapy.  
If ≥1  clinical responses are  observed in Stage 1 of Cohort 1b, then Stage 2 (n=15) will be 
initiate d with combination therapy. 
During Stage 1 aggregate safety data will be monitored by [CONTACT_12217]. If unacceptable toxicity is 
observed in Stage 1, then the dose and schedule may be modified by [CONTACT_12217].

4.5. Treatment Discontinuation  
Treatment discontinuation is defined as any patient  who stops receiving study medication . A 
patient  should be discontinued from study treatment if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2515] , it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient . 
All patient s who discontinue study treatment should enter Safety  Follow-up ( see Section  6.5).  
Patients may  be discontinued from treatment in case of any of the following reasons: 
• An AE that requires permanent discontinuation of study treatment 
• Disease progression  with no evidence of clinical benefit as measured by [CONTACT_431098]  
• Noncompliance to protocol  
• Investigator decision  
• Patient  becomes pregnant  
• Patient  death  
• Patient  lost to follow -up  
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_1034] 
• Voluntary withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_431099], resolution to 
baseline or until the e vent is considered stable or chronic. 
If a patient discontinues study treatment, then a n End of Treatment (EoT) Visit should occur  
within [ADDRESS_545316] a Safety Follow -up visit approximately 28 (+7) days after the  last dose of 
study drug. If possible, this visit should occur prior to the initiation of any subsequent anticancer 
therapy. At a minimum,  this visit should include collection of AEs and concomitant 
medications/procedures.  
For combination cohorts, patients who discontinue FT-[ADDRESS_545317] discontinued 
study treatment. Patients who discontinue azacitidine, nivolumab, or GemCis are allowed to 
continue FT -2102 until disease progression.

Each patient’s complete medical history will be obtained, including demographics, cancer 
history, and documentation of all previous treatments and treatment results (ie, best response to 
previous disease- specific treatments), prior procedure s, current medications, and all medications 
used within 30 days prior to Screening.  
6.1.4. Prior/Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
At Screening, concomitant/previous medications and procedures will be assessed including all 
medications/procedures that have occurred within the previous 30 days. 
6.1.5. Physical Exam 
A full physical exam (PE) will be performed at Screening and will include vital signs 
(temperature, blood pressure [sitting for 5 minutes], pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), height, and 
weight. If vital signs need to be repeated during a single visit, assessments should be conducted 
approximately 5 minutes apart.  All other physical exams performed on study should be 
symptom- led assessments.  
Following Screening, physical examination wi ll be symptom- directed , and will include 
collection of vital signs. Results from the symptom- directed physical exams will be used for 
assessment of disease response. Any new clinically significant abnormality from baseline or 
significant worsening of pre -existin g abnormality should be recorded as an AE. 
6.1.6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
ECOG Performance Status  will be assessed at Screening . If the ECOG Performance Status 
assessed at Screening is performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1, the Screening assessment can be used and does not need to be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose). Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_545329] period  and obtained in 
triplicate within approximately a 5 -minute time period  at the time points outlined in Table  1, 
Table  6 and Table  7.

include serum ALT, serum AST, total and direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase.   
• Weekly liver function testing is required through Cycle 2. 
• Patients with hepatobiliary and cholangiocarcinoma only: alpha feto protein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA 19-9 (pre -dose and on treatment per 
Table  8).  
• PT/aPTT will be assessed in all patients at C1D1 only. 
Unscheduled assessments should be performed  as clinically indicated  and recorded in the eCRF . 
Clinically significant laboratory findings  at Screening should be recorded as medical history.    
For Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose), hematology and blood chemistry (including liver function tests) evaluations may be performed within [ADDRESS_545331] of the Cycle 1 Day 1 results. 
Clinically significant laboratory findings, including but not limited to those findings resulting in 
a drug interruption/hold/reduction/discontinuation or medical intervention, should be reported as 
AEs (see Section  8.1.1 for definition of an AE).   
6.1.9. Additional Screening Laboratory Measurements  
At Screening, the following ass essments will be performed  to determine eligibility:  
Hepatitis: All patients will be tested for anti-hepatitis C antibody (anti- HCV) and hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg) at Screening. Reflex Hepatitis C RNA if antibody test is positive , then 
only patients with hepatitis C RNA <615 IU/L or 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml per National Genetics Institute 
assay or local institutional standard will be eligible.    
6.1.10. Urinalysis  
Complete urinalysis with qualitative analysis for protein (dipstick) should be performed  at 
Screening  as outlined in  Table  [ADDRESS_545332] recent tumor sample, in the form of formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded ( FFPE) block or cut 
slides and accompanying pathology report for all patients will be collected as described in the

sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should not be used while taking FT-2102.  
If the patient’s clinical condition requires a medication of concern, the clinical condition should 
be reviewed with the study Medical Monitor. Refer  to Appendix [ADDRESS_545338] of strong CYP3A4 
inducers and sensitive substrates.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Concomitant Medications Prohibited  
During study treatment and for three months following FT-2102, receipt of live vaccines is prohibited (including the yellow fever vaccine). Annual influenza vaccine is permitted. 
Concomitant medication(s) associated with known risk of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) are 
prohibited (s ee Appendix 3). Medications used as needed [PRN] [e.g., Zofran] are permitted.  
Concomitant medications that would be contraindicated with any of the combination agents are 
prohibited during the trial, based on approved prescribing information. For example, highly 
nephrotoxic agents with cisplatin.   
6.8. Precautions 
6.8.1. Differentiation Syndrome  
Differentiation syndrome has been observed i n patients participa ting in the hematologic 
malignancy protocol ongoing study and has also been reported in patients with AML/MDS 
receiving another therapy targeting the IDH1 -R132 mutation ( Birendra et al, 2016) o r receiving 
azacitidine ( Laufer et al, 2015).  It would be unlikely to occur in patients with solid tumors. If 
there are unexplained fevers, weight gain, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645], interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, 
and pleural or pericardial effusion, with or without hyperleukocytosis ( Frankel et al, 1992),  
FT-2102 should be held and consideration given to prompt initiation of dexamethasone 10 mg IV 
every 12 hours. Discussion with the Medical Monitor  would be required to reinitiate FT-2102.

Patients on active treatment with FT -2102 should be informed to promptly notify study staff if 
they develop any clinical symptoms of jaundice and to avoid personal habits (excessive ethanol 
consumption, over- the-counter hepatic injurious medications, herbal medications [e.g., 
cannabidiol or comparable products]) that may cause additional risk of hepatic injury.

 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 113  [IP_ADDRESS]. Contraception Guidelines  
Acceptable methods of contraception under this protocol are listed below. Periodic abstinence 
(calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides 
only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Male patients  who can father a child must agree to use 1 highly effective method of 
contraception, which includes:  
• Abstinence: abstinence can be used, when in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient.  
• If a male patient  confirms that his female partner(s) is not of childbearing potential 
(i.e., postmenopausal or post- surgical sterilization, as defined above) or is using a 
highly effective method of contraception, this is acceptable as the only means of contraception.  
Examples of highly effective methods of contraception for male patient s’ female partner(s) 
include:  
• Hormonal contraceptives  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
Alternatively, two effective methods of contraception can be utilized and may include:  
• The use of a male condom with spermicide with a female occlusive cap (such as a 
diaphragm or cervical cap) with spermicide  
Male patients with documented infertility or surgical sterilization (performed at least six months 
before the first dose of study drug) are exempt from the contraception requirement. Infertility 
may be documented through examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_431101] (Day 1).  
Female patients who are considered of childbearing potential must agr ee to use a highly 
effective method of contraception, which may include:  
• IUD  
• Abstinence: abstinence can be used, when in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient.  
• If a female patient  confirms that her male partner(s) has been confirmed  to be 
clinically sterile, this method is acceptable as the only means of contraception.  
Alternatively, effective double -barrier contraception may be used, to include:  
• The use of a male condom with spermicide with a female occlusive cap with 
spermicide (such as a diaphragm or cervical cap)  
Hormonal contraceptives are not considered an effective method of birth control for female patient s participating in this study. Male condoms with female condoms should not be used 
together.

Patient s will be monitored continuously for toxicity while on study treatment. Toxicity severity 
will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE  v. 4.03. If a patient has an AE related to  FT-2102, dose 
interruptions/holds with possible modifications may occur as described below. 
7.5.1. Dose Holds  and Modifications   
Dose modifications apply only to patients beyond a DLT period, either single -agent or in 
combination. If patients have a DLT, study agent should be stopped.  
For patients beyond a DLT period: a dose may be withheld up to 28 days for toxicity. Doses 
withheld for > 28 days may result in discontinuation from the study, unless approved by [CONTACT_35041].  For azacitidine, nivolumab, gemcitabine and cisplatin, all dose modifications 
outside of DLT periods are at the discretion of the treating investigator and the following are 
provided as guidelines.

 (Version 5)  [ADDRESS_545352] medical occurrence associated wi th the use of a drug, or with 
study participation, whether or not consider ed related to study treatment.   
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
AEs include worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, as well as clinically significant 
changes from baseline laborat ory values/conditions. Worsening of the preexisting medical 
condition (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) means that it has increased in CTC grade as compared to 
baseline.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened during the study is not considered an 
AE. 
8.1.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  
- Electi ve or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing 
the ICF (as documented as medical history on the eCRF)  is not considered 
an SAE  
- Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for transfusion support or convenience, is not considered an SAE  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered  an important medical event  
- If an AE  does not meet one of the serious criteria, but the Investigator or 
Sponsor considers an event to be clinically important, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of “Important medical event.” 
Examples of such medical events may include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

nivolumab if applicable).  after the last dose of FT -2102. An AE will be followed until it is either 
resolved, has returned to baseline, or is determined to be a stable or chronic condition.  
All SAEs occurring fro m the signing of ICF through [ADDRESS_545356] dose of FT-2102 (and 
for [ADDRESS_545357] dose of nivolumab if applicable) will be processed as outlined in 
Section  8.2.2.  
All AESIs, as defined in Section 8.2.3, from first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_545358] assign the following AE attributes:  
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s) if known 
• If not known at time of the report, record the signs and/or symptoms as AEs and 
provide an updated report with diagnosis when obtained 
• Dates of onset and resolution 
• Severity as defined per protocol  
• Assessment of relatedness to each study drug  
• Action taken with each  study drug as a result of the AE  
In general, an AE that is the primary cause of subsequent events should be identified by [CONTACT_86187] ( e.g., for dehydration due to diarrhea, the AE would be diarrhea). However, AEs 
occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events (e.g., sepsis secondary to pneumonia, both events should be recorded).  
The signs and symptoms of progressive disease that meet the AE criteria should be reported as 
specific AEs, and not as disease progression .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must assess whether the AE may be related to each study drug or study 
mandated procedure, when applicable. The relationship is defined below :   
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Not Drug Related”:  
• None:  The event is related to an etiology other than the study product administration (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study patient ’s medical record).

related to factors other than study product. 
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Drug Related”:  
• Possible: There is an association between the event and the administration of FT-2102, and there is a plausible mechanism for the even t to be related to the study 
product; but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the patient ’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
• Probable: There is an association between the event and the administration of 
FT-2102, there i s a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study 
product, and the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_431104] ’s clinical status or an alternative etiology is not apparent.  
• Definite: There is an association between the event and the administration of FT-2102, there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product and causes other than FT-[ADDRESS_545359] been ruled out and/or the event

[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Severity  
The Investigator will assess the Grade of the AE per the NCI CTCAE  v. 4.03. Toxicities that are 
not specified in NCI CTCAE  will be defined as follows:

[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Laboratory and Electrocardiogram Values 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing clinical laboratory test and ECG results and 
determin ing whether an abnormal value in a patient  represents a clinically significant change 
from patient ’s baseline value. In general, abnormal laboratory findings and ECGs without 
clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as AEs. In 
general, an abnormal l aboratory test and ECG result s should be reported as an AE if the 
laboratory result:  
• Requires an adjustment or discontinuation of study drug

related , and unexpected AE(s), or significant risks to patients, per local country requirements. 
The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_276327], including correspondence with 
FORMA or IRBs/LECs . 
8.2.3. Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
As described in Section 6.8.2, adverse events potentially associated with liver injury have been 
identified as A ESI. These AESI (regardless if serious  or non-serious) include the following : 
a.All events of Grade [ADDRESS_545364], or total bilirubin in patients with
normal LFTs at baseline; in patients with elevated LFTs at baseline, one Grade shift orhigher in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin;
b.Any hepatic adverse event, e.g., acute hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, orhepatic insufficiency
AESI occurring from time of first dose through [ADDRESS_545365] be reported as outlined below: 
a. Report to FORMA Therapeutics Pharm acovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of
event
b.If the event meets both AESI and SAE criteria, complete both the SAE and AESI form
c.If the event is non- serious, complete the AESI form alone
Relevant forms (AESI, SAE, or both) should be submitted via fax ( ) or email 
to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance. 
8.2.4. Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure 
FT-2102 has not been evaluated in pregnant or nursing women. Thus, pregnant women or 
women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception are excluded from 
this study ( see Section  6.8.4 for instructions on birth control and pregnancy testing). 
Pregnancies occurring in patient s, or partners of male patients are considered immediately 
reportable events if the pregnancy occurs during the study treatment through 90 days after the patient ’s last dose of study drug. If a pregnancy occurs in a patient, study drug must be 
discontinued immediately. The pregnant woman should be referred to an 

Protocol 2102- ONC-102  FORMA Therapeutics, Inc.  
FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 91 of 113  obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling. 
The pregnancy must be reported to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form.  
The Investigator will follow the pregnant patient (or pregnant partner of male patient) until 
completion of the pregnancy and must notify the Sponsor of the pregnancy outcome within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the outcome. The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy Report Form.  
If the pregnant patient (or pregnant partner of a male patient) experiences an SAE during 
pregnancy, or the outcome of the pregnancy meets any of the serious criteria (ie, sp ontaneous 
abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs (ie, report the event to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of 
causality) should be reported as SAEs to FORMA Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance. In addition, any infant death or congenital anomaly occurring after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to FORMA 
Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance.  
Please refer to the Pregnancy Report  Form and associated completion guidelines on where 
and how to submit the form.  
8.2.5. Disease Progression  
If progression of the underlying disease (i.e., the condition being treated with study drug) might 
be reasonably anticipated given the nature and severity of the underlying disease, then 
progression of the underlying disease per se will not constitute an AE. However, if the 
progression of the underlying disease meets the criterion for “serious” categorization of AEs (e.g., the underlying disease results in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), then the progression of 
underlying disease should be reported as an SAE ( Section  8.1.2).

 (Version 5)  [ADDRESS_545366] ICAL METHODS  
Details of the statistical methods for this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). The SAP may modify the statistical methods outlined in the protocol; however, any major 
modification will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
9.1. Sample Size 
This study will enroll u p to approximately  200 patients.   
A single- agent Safety Lead -in Period will be implemented  that may enroll approximately 
12 patients, which includes approximately 6 patients with glioma and 6 patients with solid 
tumors . Following successful completion of the Safety Lead-in Period, the study will then enroll 
4 disease -specific cohorts examining FT -2102 as either a single agent or in combination. These 
cohorts include Cohort 1 (glioma) with approximately 16 -46 patients; Cohort 2 (HBC) with up to 
approximately 21-78  patients; Cohort 3 (chondrosarcoma) with approximately 16-46 patients; 
and Cohort 4 (IHCC) with approximately 21-78 patients.  There will be a fifth cohort of R132X 
IDH1 mutant solid tumors, non-CNS with up to 6 patients, single-agent only. 
Cohort 1a, Cohort 2a, Cohort 3a (single- agent FT -2102) 
Cohorts, 1a, 2a and 3a  will employ an optimal Simon’s 2-Stage design with a 1- sided alpha of 
0.025, power of 80%, null hypothesis of 5% and alternative hypothesis of 25%. Stage 1 of each 
of these cohorts will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or 
more responses, Stage 2 will initiate with additional 15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5% will be rejected. If there is no response in 
Stage 1 with single- agent FT-2102, or if the null hypothesis is not rejected at t he end of Stage 2, 
combination therapy may be evaluated.  
Cohort 4a (single- agent FT -2102) 
Cohort 4a employs an optimal Simon’s 2- Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 
80%, null hypothesis of 8% and alternative hypothesis of 35%. Stage 1 will evaluate 8 patients 
and if there are 2 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with additional 14 patients. If there are 5 
or more responses out of the total 22 patient s, the null hypothesis of 8% will be rejected.  If there 
is 0 or 1 response in Stage 1 with single- agent FT -2102, or if the null hypothesis is not rejected at 
the end of Stage 2 , combination may be evaluated.  
Combination Cohorts (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b)  
If there is no response in Stage 1 with single- agent FT- 2102 combination cohorts may be 
examined.  
Cohort 1b and Cohort 3b 
For Cohorts 1b and 3b (combination therapy), an optimal Simon’s 2 -Stage design will be 
implemented with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, 80% power, with a null hypothesis of 5% and 
alternative hypothesis of 25%. Stage 1 of each cohort will evaluate 8 patients for efficacy over 
4 treatment cycles; if there are 1 or more res ponses, Stage 2 w ill initiate with additional 
15 patients. If there are 4 or more responses out of the total 23 patients, the null hypothesis of 5% 
will be rejected.

Cohort 2b employs an optimal Simon’s 2- Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 
80%, null hypothesis of 20% and alternative hypothesis of 40%. Stage 1 will evaluate 13 patients 
for efficacy; if there are 4 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with an additional 42 patients. If there are 17 or more responses out of the total 55 patients, the null hypothesis of 20% will be 
rejected.   
Cohort 4b  
Cohort 4b employs an optimal Simon’s 2- Stage design with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.025, power of 
80%, null hypothesis of 20% and alternative hypothesis of 40%. Stage 1 will evaluate 13 patients 
and if there are 4 or more responses Stage 2 will initiate with additional 42 patients. If there are 17 or more responses out of the total 55 patient s, the null hypothesis of 20% will be rejected.   
Cohort 5 
Cohort 5, due to the diverse population, this is an exploratory cohort without pre- defined 
efficacy/futility determinations (n= 6).  
9.2. Analysis Sets

9.3. Background Characteristics  
9.3.1. Patient  Disposition  
The number and percentage of patients in each disposition category (e.g., enrolled, included in each Analysis Set, completing a given number of treatment cycles, discontinuing treatment, and 
discontinuing study, with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9084]. 
9.3.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_431106]: sex, race, age, type of cancer, tumor stage (tumor -node- metastases), ECOG 
performance status, time elapsed since cancer diagnosis, and prior anti- cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Additional parameters may be provided in the SAP.  
9.4. Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Total number of cycles  is defined as the maximum number of treatment cycles that a patient  
receives. Total cumulative dose (mg) is the sum of the actual doses that the patient receives across cycles. Total planned dose (mg) is the sum of the plann ed doses. The total number of days 
on treatment, total number of cycles, total cumulative dose (mg), total planned dose (mg) will be 
summarized.  
The study drug exposure will be summarized based on the Safety  Analysis Set by [CONTACT_431107]. 
9.5. Efficacy Analyses  
All analysis in this section will be based on patients in the Response -Evaluable Analysis Set 
unless otherwise specified.  
Best response will be summarized as determined by [CONTACT_431081], for disease 
specific cohorts (see Appendix 2 for definitions). RANO (LGG) for low -grade glioma, RANO 
for high-grade glioma, RECIST 1.1 for cholangiocarcinoma , HBC and other solid tumors.  
ORR is defined as follows: 
• Glioma: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR or MR (LGG)  
• HBC: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 of 113  • Chondrosarcoma: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR  
• Cholangioca rcinoma: the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or PR  
It will be summarized by [CONTACT_431108] 9 0% confidence interval estimated using 
Clopper-Pearson method. 
Time to event data will be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier (KM) methods for each cohort. The 
median time will be tabulated along with the 95% confidence intervals. The estimated 
probability of survival over time will be plotted as KM curves for each cohort (or by [CONTACT_331603]).  
For time to event variables, the following is considered:  
• PFS will be defined for all patients in the Response Evaluable Analysis Set. It is the 
time between first dose of study drug and disease progression, death from any cause, 
or start of other (non -protocol study drug) new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first. For a patient with none of these events before the end of study follow-up, P FS 
will be censored on the date of the last follow -up examination. 
• TTR will only be defined for patients who achieve a response (CR/ PR) . It is the  time 
between the first dose of study drug and documentation of the first response by 
[CONTACT_431081].  
• DOR wi ll be defined only for patients who achieve a response. It is the time between 
documentation of the response by [CONTACT_431109], whichever is earlier. For patients who die without documentation/report of disease progression, DOR will be censored on the 
date of death, regardless of cause, or any other new anticancer  therapy (non-protocol 
study drug), whichever is earlier. For patients with no report of disease progression  
by [CONTACT_1008]-up data collection, DOR will be censored on the date of the last follow -up examination. Since DOR is patient  to the competing risk of death 
without progression, estimates of the cumulative incidence of progression will be 
reported for each cohort. Similarly, the duration of overall response will also be analyzed .  
• OS will be defined based on the Safety  Analysis Set. It is the time from study entry 
until death from any cause. For patients who are not known to have died by [CONTACT_317227]-up, OS will be censored on the date the patient was known to be alive. Patients who are lost to follow up with  be censored on the last date the patient was 
known to be alive.  The percentage of patients who are alive will be estimated at selected landmark timepoints such as 3 months, 6 months, etc.  
• TTP will be defined for all patients in the Response Evaluable An alysis Set. It is the 
time between first dose of study drug and disease progression. D eath from any cau se 
or start of other (non -protocol study drug) new anticancer therapy are censoring 
events . For a patient with none of these events before the end of stu dy follow-up, TTP  
will be censored on the date of the last follow -up examination. 
Additional efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP.

LGG/RANO ( van den Bent et al, 2011)  
Complete response 
Comp lete response requires all the following criteria compared with the baseline scan:  
1. Complete disappearance of the lesion on T2 or FLAIR imaging (if enhancement had  been 
present, it must have resolved completely)  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effects, and no new or inc reased enhancement;  
3. patients must be off corticosteroids or only on physiological replacement doses; and  
4. patients should be stable or im proved clinically  
Partial response 
Partial response requires all of the following criteria compared with the baseline scan:  
1. greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the product of perpendicular diameters of the  
lesion on T2 or FLAIR imaging sustained for a t least 4 weeks compared with baseline;  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with  
3. radiation effects, and no new or increased enhancement; and  
4. patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greater th an the dos e at time 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically  
Minor response 
Minor response requires the following criteria compared with baseline:  
1. a decrease of the area of non-enhancing lesion on T2 or FLAIR MR imaging between 
25% and 50% compared with baseline;  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effect, and no new or increased enhancement; and 
3. patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greater than the dose at  time 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically 
Stable disease 
Stable disease is present if the changes do not qualify for complete, partial, or minor  response, or 
progression and requires:  
1. stable area of non -enhancing abnormalities  on T2 or FLAIR imaging;  
2. no new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effect, and no new or increased enhancement; and 
3. patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greater than the dose at t ime 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 108 of 113 Progression  
Progression is defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  
1. development of new lesions or increase of enhancement (radiological evidence of 
malignant transformation);  
2. a 25% increase of the T2 or FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiati on of therapy, 
not attributable to radiation effect or to comorbid events;  
3. definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor, or 
decrease in corticosteroid dose; or  
4. failure to return for evaluation because of death or deteriorating condition, unless caused 
by [CONTACT_398156]-related disorders.

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 109 of 113 RANO ( Wen et al, 2010 ): 
Complete Response 
Complete response requires all of the following  with a confirming scan at least 4 weeks later. In 
the absence of the confirming scan, the response will be considered stable disease :  
1. complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and nonmeasurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks; and 
2. no new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions; and  
3. patient must be off corticosteroids or on physiologic replacement doses only, and 
4. stable or improved clinically.  
Partial Response  
Partial response requ ires all of the following  (In the absence of a confirming scan at least 4 
weeks later, this response will be considered only stable disease) :  
1. ≥50% decrease, compared with baseline, in the sum of products of perpendicular 
diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks;  and 
2. no progression of nonmeasurable disease; and 
3. no new lesions; and 
4. stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; and  
5. patient must be o n a corticosteroid dose not greater than the dose at time of baseline scan 
and is stable or improved clinically.  
Stable Disease 
If the patient does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression (see next 
section) and requires the fol lowing: 
1.  stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids 
compared with baseline scan and clinically stable status.  
(In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without 
confirmation of disease p rogression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging shows 
that this increase in corticosteroids was required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose) 
Progression  
Progression is defined by [CONTACT_39132] (Failure to return for evaluation as a result of 
death or deteriorating condition should also be considered as progression) :  
1. ≥25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions 
(compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids;

FT-2102  
 (Version 5)  28 January 2020     CONFIDENTIAL  Page 110 of 113 2.  a significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compared wit h baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, 
not due to comorbid events; or 
3. the appearance of any new lesions;  or 
4. clear progression of nonmeasurable lesions; or 
5. definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from th e tumor, or to 
decrease in corticosteroid dose.  
Increase in corticosteroid dose alone, in the absence of clinical deterioration related to tumor, 
will not be used as a determinant of progression.  
*Patients with stable imaging studies whose corticosteroid dose was increased for reasons other 
than clinical deterioration related to tumor do not qualify for stable disease or progression. If 
their corticosteroid dose can be reduced back to baseline, they will be considered as having 
stable disease; if further clinical deterioration related to tumor becomes apparent, they will be considered to have progression. The date of progression should be the first time point at which 
corticosteroid increase was necessary.  
**The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the treating physician, but it is 
recommended that a decline in the Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS) from [ADDRESS_545378] 1.1  (Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ): 
 
Response  Definition  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions. All 
pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to <10 mm in 
short axis  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum of diameters  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR no r sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Sum of diameters increased by [CONTACT_2669] 20% from the smallest 
value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest) The sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 
mm, for example, does not qualify.)

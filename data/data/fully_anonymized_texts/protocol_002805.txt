  1  Study Title: A Comparison of Two Methods of Lidocaine Injection on Propofol Injection Pain   
  
Principal Investigator, Co -investigator: Timothy Harwood MD; Patrick Grace MD  
  
Sponsor or funding source: WFUHS Department of Anesthesiology   
  
Background, Rationale and Context   
Intravenous lidocaine is routinely given through the IV prior to injection of propofol to reduce the 
amount of pain during propofol injection. We want to study if giving the lidocaine through the IV 
while the forearm with the IV has a tourniquet applied to it to prevent “washing out” of the 
lidocaine prior to propofol injection helps reduce propofol injection pain.  
  
Objectives   
We expect that tourniquet lidocaine will be superior to straight non -tourniquet lidocaine in 
reducing prop ofol injection pain. We also want to determine the association of tourniquet 
duration on reduction of pain with propofol administration.  Small studies indicate that 60 
seconds of tourniquet lidocaine is superior to 30 seconds or less of tourniquet duratio n or mixed 
lidocaine/propofol for injection. We suspect many clinicians do not use the [ADDRESS_464073] Health, an academic medical center, in 
the Endoscopy Suite where 10 -30 patients per day are scheduled to  receive propofol as part of 
their sedation or anesthetic.   
  
Subjects selection criteria  •  Inclusion Criteria   
Any patient aged ≥18 years scheduled to receive propofol as part of their sedation or 
anesthetic.  
  
 •  Exclusion Criteria   
Since children (age<18 years) frequently receive induction of anesthesia by [CONTACT_370908], they will 
be excluded.  
Any patient receiving pre -medications prior to their sedation that could alter their recall or 
perception of the pain such as fentanyl or midazolam.

We estimate that [ADDRESS_464074] the hypothesis 
based on prior studies.  
  
Interventions and Interactions  •  There will be two groups:  o Group 1: 50mg of 2% lidocaine 
given just prior to the propofol dose  through the IV line.  
  
o Group 2: 50mg of 2% lidocaine given IV with venous occlusion applied when the 
patient is positioned on the operating room table and timed until the onset of 
propofol administration. The tourniquet will either be a latex free tour niquet or 
McKesson Quick Release tourniquet applied to the forearm 10cm distal to the 
elbow joint in the tourniquet group.  Venous stasis will be confirmed with 
cessation of flow from hanging IV fluid.    
    
• For both groups, no premedication shall be given, which is the normal practice for these 
procedures.  Study procedures will involve a 20 gauge intravenous (IV) catheter placed in a 
vein distal to the mid forearm.  Venous occlusion will be achieved by [CONTACT_81787] r a latex free 
tourniquet or McKesson Quick Release tourniquet applied to the forearm 10cm distal to the 
elbow joint.  Tourniquet pressure will be somewhat variable but sufficient to cause venous 
stasis as confirmed by [CONTACT_370909].  Injecti ons will be delivered at roughly 1 
ml/sec.      
• For studies involving interactions the survey, questionnaire or method of observation should 
be described.    
o Please see Data Collection Form Attached   
  
• The time required should occur within their usual a nesthetic parameters and should not delay 
their procedure nor increase the duration of anesthesia significantly.    
  
• Table illustrating the schedule of events in the study:  
Day prior to the 
procedure  Describe study to the patient by [CONTACT_370910]:  
holding area   Consent patient for  
Day of procedure:  
holding area  Randomly assign patient to one of two groups  
Day of procedure:  
procedure area  Accompany patient to the operating or procedure room, perform 
instructions from the group they are assigned to while noting outcome 
measures such as self -described discomfort and observer graded 
discomfort  
Day of procedure:  
recovery area  Revisit patient in recovery to determine post -procedure recall of 
discomfort  
Post-study period  Analyze data  
  
Outcome Measures   
1. Self-described discomfort level using 4 -point verbal pain scale (None, mild, moderate, severe)  
 
Protocol version: 1.0  
  3  2. Observer -graded discomfort level (Nonverbal vocal complaints, verbal vocal complaints, facial 
grimace/winces, and restlessness/withdrawal)  
3. Post-procedure recall of discomfort using 4 -point verbal pain scale (same as #1)  
  
Analytical Plan   
We will analyze results initially using descriptive statistics.  Comparison between groups will be done 
using chi square tests for proportions, and t -tests or ANOVA procedures for continuous variables.   
Regression analysis will be performed to identify independent outcome predic tors.  Other inferential 
statistical analysis will be conducted as appropriate.  
  
Human Subjects Protection   
  
Subject Recruitment Methods   
  
Informed Consent   
  
Signed informed consent will be obtained from each subject.  One of the two investigators will obtain 
informed consent. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_370911]. Full written consent, 
after answering qu estions, will have to be performed in the holding room prior to the procedure since 
most patients will have their pre -procedure examination performed in the holding room and will not be 
seen prior to the day of surgery.   
  
Confidentiality and Privacy   
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_117689], 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify 
subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner.  To help ensure subject privacy and 
confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form.  Any collected 
patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a 
linkage file, store separately from the data.  The linkage file will be kept secure, with access limited to 
designated study personnel.  Following conclusion of data collection, subject -identifying information will 
be destroyed three years after closure of  the study by [CONTACT_370912],  consistent with data validation 
and study design, producing an anonymous analytical data set.  Data access will be limited to study staff.  
Data and records will be kept locked and secured, with any computer data password pr otected.  No 
reference to any individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise 
from the study.

to receive propofol as part of your anesthetic . Your participation is voluntary. Plea se take your time in 
making your decision as to whether or not you wish to participate. Ask your study doctor or the study 
staff to explain any words or information contained in this informed consent document that you do not 
understand. You may also discus s the study with your friends and family.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
The purpose of this research study is to compare two different methods of giving lidocaine in reducing the 
pain of administration of intravenous propofol, which you will be receiving as part of your anesthetic. 
Giving lidocaine though the IV is known to reduce the discomfort of the injection of intravenous propofol, 
but the best method has yet to be determined.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY ? 
[ADDRESS_464076] Health  sites will take part in this study.  In order to identify the 50 subjects 
needed, we may need to screen as many as 75 because some people will not qualify to be included in the 
study.  
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY ? 
In this study , [ADDRESS_464077] not given us enough evidence to choose one over the other scientifically.  
 
A) In your procedure room, we will give you a small dose of lidocaine through your IV 
mixed with the injection of propofol that will have you go to sleep.  
Or: 
B) In your procedure room, we will place a light tourniquet on the forearm above your IV 
site. We will th en give the same amount of lidocaine through the IV line and let the 
lidocaine stay in your vein while we prepare you for the start of your anesthetic. This will 
usually take [ADDRESS_464078] the lidocaine and how long 
we let it stay in the vein in relation to when we give you propofol.  
 
 
Protocol version: 1.[ADDRESS_464079] an equal  chance of being placed in 
either  group.  
 
• If you take part in this study, yo u will have the following tests and procedures:  
o A [ADDRESS_464080] medications as normally planned for the procedure.  
o If you are in Group A:  
▪ You will have standard monitors pla ced on you.  
▪ When everything is ready, y ou will then be given 50 mg of intravenous  
lidocaine immediately followed by [CONTACT_370913].  
o If you are in Group B:  
▪ Once in the procedure room, you will then have a l ight tourniquet placed 
on your mid -forearm  in your IV arm . We will then inject 50 mg of 
intravenous lidocaine.  
▪ You will then have standard monitors placed on you.  
▪ When everything is ready, you will have the tourniquet removed  
▪ You will then be given intrave nous propofol in an amount judged 
appropriate by [CONTACT_370914].  
o We will observe you for signs of IV discomfort  
o After your procedure, before you are discharged, we will give you a short survey 
about any discomfort you recall while going to sleep.  
o In both groups, all other care will be as usual and you will be discharged per usual 
routine.  
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY ? 
You will be in the study for about until you have a survey of your recall of discomfort prior to your 
discharge from the procedure u nit. 
 
You can stop participating at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the study we encourage you 
to talk to the investigators or study staff first to learn about any potential health or safety consequences , 
however, we expect no differences in your care.

Investigational Products, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with 
Investigational Products:  
 
• Nivolumab  3 mg /kg IV every 2 weeks for up to 2 years .  
 
• Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks for up to 2 years.  
 
• Radiotherapy to a total dose of 45 Gy, given in 15 consecutive fractions of 3 Gy each fraction  
 
 
Study Phase :  II 
 
 
Research Hypothesis :  This study will test the hypothesis that hypofractionated  radiotherapy ( 45 
Gy in 15 fractions) will result in reduced treatment -induced severe lymphopenia and 
immunosuppression compared to standard chemoradiation and enhance the efficacy of 
combination imm une checkpoint therapy to improve the  overall  survival of newly diagnosed 
MGMT -unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) subjects.

Objectives : 
 
Primary  
 
• Main Study Cohort:  To estimate  the overall survival at 1 year (1 -yr OS) of adults with 
newly diagnosed, MGMT unmethylated GBM administered nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879655]. 
 
• Surgical Study Cohort:  To assess Safety, Feasibility, and Tolerability of neoadjuvant 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762] (prior to tumor re -resection) , and estimate rate of T -cell pathway 
induction.   
 
Secondary  
 
• Main Study Cohort  
o Assess safety and tolerability  
o Estimate additional measures of efficacy, including 2 -year OS, median OS, median 
PFS, radi ographic response rate, and median duration of response.  
• Surgical Study Cohort  
o Estimate efficacy measures including 1 -yr OS, 2 -year OS, median OS, median 
PFS, radiographic response rate, and median duration of response.  
Exploratory  
 
• Assess association of 1 -yr OS with: tumor tissue biomarkers including mutation burden, 
neoantigen load, immune marker expression [e.g. PD -L1, lymphocyte activation gene 3 
(LAG3), indoleamine -2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and T -cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 
3 (TIM3)], and PD -1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  
 
• Assess association of 1 -yr OS with baseline and change at 6 weeks in levels of circulating 
biomarkers, including: regulatory T cells (T reg); myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSC); 
and immune c ell populations as profiled by [CONTACT_5019] -parameter flow cytometry that 
simultaneously quantifies expression of proteins related to checkpoint inhibitors (PD1, 
CTLA4, TIM3, TIGIT, 41BB, CD150, LAG3, BTLA), differentiation status (CD45RA, CCR7, 
CD57, CD95, CD127) , and other traits (CD25, IL12R, CXCR3, CXCR6).  
 
• Evaluate effect of study regimen on total lymphocyte counts (TLC) and CD4 counts at 
fixed timepoints for up to 1 year compared to baseline.  
 
• Explore whether sodium MRI , a non -invasive surrogate measure of c ell death in tissue , 
can differentiate between treatment -related cell death/necrosis ("pseudoprogression") 
versus tumor progression and serve as a potential non-invasive pharmacodynamic 
biomarker.

Study Design : 
 
This is an open -label, phase II trial of nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879656], MGMT  unmethylated GBM (confirmed centrally at 
NYUSoM ) with the primary objective of determining the overall survival at 1 year.   
 
Safety Lead -In: The study will start with a Safety Lead -In consisting of the first 6 subjects (Section 
6.1) to further define the safety and tolerability of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879657], newly diagnosed GBM 
patients wit h unmethylated MGMT  promoter. Note, the patients enrolled in the Safety Lead -In 
cohort will subsequently be analyzed in the Main Study Cohort (see below). Also note, special 
safety provisions are included for the first 3 subjects enrolled (see Section 6.1. 1). After the first 6 
subjects are enrolled, enrollment will stop and subjects will be observed for 40 days for dose -
limiting toxicities (DLTs). After all subjects in the Safety Lead -In cohort have completed the DLT 
observation period, the safety data will  be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034] /Overall PI  [INVESTIGATOR_879658]. If [ADDRESS_1229022] 6 subjects experiences a DLT at the end of the 28 day DLT observation period, 
the study will continue enrollment onto the phase II part of the stu dy.  
 
Main Study Cohort : The Phase II tria l is an open -label,  one-stage phase II  study  and will enroll a 
total of [ADDRESS_1229023] s in the Safety Lead-In. A Bayesian monitoring 
approach will be applied to assess safety throughout the Phase II trial with pre -defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626] .  
 
Surgical Study Cohort:  The Surgical Study Cohort will open once the Safety Lead -In is completed. 
We will use a single -stage design and enroll up to 16  subjects with newly diagnosed MGMT -
unmethylated glioblastoma who are amenable to a larger resection will be included in this cohort.

sponsor  Study Procedures:  
 
After screening procedures and registration,  within [ADDRESS_1229025] diagnostic surgery for 
glioblastoma, all subjects will initiate study treatment with one dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg and one 
dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg .   
• Patients in the Safety Lead -In/Main Study Cohort  will begin hypofractionated 
radiotherapy (HFRT) within [ADDRESS_1229026] nivolumab and ipil imumab dose.   
• Patients in the Surgical Study Cohort  (opens once Safety Lead -In completed) will 
undergo craniotomy and tumor re -resection within [ADDRESS_1229027]  dose of 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879659] 3 weeks following surgery  
 
All subjects will receive HFRT  to a total dose of 45 Gy, given in 15 consecutive fractions of 3 Gy 
each fraction.  
 
All subjects will continue to receive nivolumab  3 mg/kg IV every  2 weeks and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg 
every [ADDRESS_1229028] nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288]. One treatment cycle will 
be defined as 42 days (6 weeks), corresponding to [ADDRESS_1229029].  
 
Subjects will be evaluated every 8 weeks with radiographic  imaging to assess response to 
treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint will be overall survival at 1 year. Disease assessments 
on study will be made using the Response Assessment for Neuro -Oncology (RANO) criteria. 
However, non -traditional Immunotherapy R esponse Assessment for Neuro -Oncology  (iRANO) 
criteria may be considered for patient management. Adverse events will be monitored throughout 
the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.   
 
End of treatment assessments will be performed within [ADDRESS_1229030] drug administration or 
within 7 days after decision to end treatment.  Site visits and safety laboratories are to be 
performed at 30 days (±7 days ) and 90 days (±14 days) after the last study drug is given, unless 
the subject is unable to travel due to deteriorating medical condition, due to the potential risk for 
delayed immune -related toxicities. Post-treatment, all participants will be followed u ntil resolution 
or stabilization of any serious or reportable adverse events occurring during treatment or starting 
within [ADDRESS_1229031]  continue to be followed for collection of outcome and/or 
survival follow -up data until death, withdrawal of permission to record at least survival data, or 
subject is lost to follow -up. 
 
Following the [ADDRESS_1229032] -drug visit, all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (±14 days) to 
assess for study -treatment related toxicities , initiation of any new anti -cancer treatments, and 
survival status. Contact [CONTACT_879798] a site visit, telephone contact, e -mail, or mail.

sponsor  Study Assessments : 
 
Efficacy  
 
Efficacy assessment consisting of a c ontrast -enhanced brain MRI  will be performed every 8 
weeks on study, ±7 days, until disease progression is documented or treatment is discontinued 
(whichever occurs later). Response Assessments will be performed on every brain imaging 
assessment performed on protocol per RANO crite ria. 
 
Safety  
 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety if they have received any study drug. Toxicity assessments 
will be continuous during the treatment phase. Once subjects reach the survival follow -up phase, 
either in person or documented telephone calls t o assess the subject’s status are acceptable. 
Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03.  
 
 
Statistical Considerations : 
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879660] (1yr -OS) of the phase II study.  
Sample Size :  
 
Main Study Cohort: Based on historical measures, a 12 month (1yr -OS) of 35% will be 
considered non -promising; an increase in the 1yr -OS to 60% will be considered promising.  We 
will use a single -stage design and enroll 24 patients.  This will provide 80% power to detect an 
increase in the 1 -year OS from 35% to 60%, using a 0.[ADDRESS_1229049].  
 
Surgical  Study Cohort:  Based on historical measures, a T -cell pathway induction rate of 33% will 
be considered non -promising; an increase in the T -cell pathway induction rate to 64% will be 
considered promising.  We will use a single -stage design and enroll 16 patien ts.  This will provide 
80% power to detect an increase in the 1 -year OS from 33% to 64%, using a 0.[ADDRESS_1229050].  
 
Endpoints :   
 
1yr-OS and radiographic response rates will be estimated with exact 95% confidence intervals; 
with 24 patients, a 95% CI will be no more than 0.[ADDRESS_1229051] follow -up if the patient remained alive. The Kaplan –Meier curves will be used to 
summarize PFS and OS and to estimate the medians.  
 
Adverse events will be graded using CTCAE version 4.03. All subjects who initiate therapy 
(receive at least one dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879661]/or radiotherapy) will be evaluated for 
safety. A Bayesian monitoring approach will be applied to assess s afety throughout the Phase II 
trial with pre -defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted in accordance with 
US government research regulations, and applicable international standards of Good Clinical Practice , 
and institutional research policies and procedures . 
1.1 Backgroun d 
1.1.1  Study Disease  
About 15,000 new glioblastomas (GBM, WHO grade IV) are  diagnosed each year in the US,1 and nea rly 
all are fatal. Even with the relatively recent US FDA approvals of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_879667]  (temozolomide in 2005)  or recurrent (bevacizumab in 2009) GBM, t he pro gnosis of 
GBM has not signific antly changed in over [ADDRESS_1229069] a particularly disma l median survival of 12 months and only 6% survive [ADDRESS_1229070] emerged as highly effective for the treatment of several cancer 
types, including melanoma, head an d neck squamous cell, prostate cancer,  renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
and squamous and non -squamous non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumors may modulate and 
evade the host immune response through a number of mechanisms, including down regulation of tumor -
specific antigen expression and presentation, secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation 
of inhibitory ligands. One immunotherapy strategy that has proven effective for several cancer types is 
enhancement of the anti -tumor immune response us ing agents that target T cell inhibitory checkpoint 
receptors such as cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4) and programmed death 1 (PD -1, CD279).  
Inhibition of the immune checkpoints using antibodies against CTLA -4, PD -[ADDRESS_1229071] resulted in 
durable regressions of several types, leading to recent US FDA approvals of several systemic agents.8-11 
T cell checkpoint regulators such as CTLA -4 and  PD-1 are cell surface molecules that, when engaged by 
[CONTACT_20378], induce signalin g cascades down -regulating T cell activation and proliferation. Under 
normal conditions, PD -1 is expressed on the cell surface of activated peripheral CD4+ and CD8+  T-cells 
as well as B-cells, T regs and Natural Killer (NK) cells, and down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.12 One proposed model by [CONTACT_773478] T cell 
checkpoint inhibitors derive antitumor activity is through breaking of immune tolerance to tumor ce ll 
antigens.13,14  
  
CTLA -4 is a cell -surface receptor expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T cells with homology to the T -cell costimulatory 
molecule CD28. Although CD28 and CTLA -4 are both ligands for B7 -1 (CD80) and B7 -2 (CD86), they 
serve opposing roles in regulating T -cell activation. CD28 provides costimulatory signals required for T -
cell activation, whereas CTLA -4 negatively modulates T -cell responses by [CONTACT_879800] T-cell priming; thus, CTLA -[ADDRESS_1229072] important during priming. PD -1 binds programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD -L1; B7-H1 or CD274) expressed by [CONTACT_713199], various immune cells, mesenchymal 
support cells, and vascular cells. T his interaction negatively regulates T -cell activa tion when engaged with 
an antigen presenting cell  and/or effector function when engaged with other PD -L1-positive cells. Binding 
of PD -L1 to its receptors suppresses T -cell migration and proliferation and restricts cancer  cell killing . 
Thus, PD -1 is import ant in regulating effector functions after CD8+  T cells are activated.13 PD-1 and

optimally phased for maximum efficacy. Indeed, combination therapie s targeting the two checkpoints 
CTLA -4 and PD -1 has demonstrated improved efficacy  in patients with metastatic melanoma , sma ll cell 
and non -small cell lung cancer.15-19 
 
The PD -1/PD -L1 receptor -ligand axis is hijacked by [CONTACT_879801]. Healthy organs express little, if any,  PD-L1, whereas a number of cancers  
including GBM  constitutively and abundantly express PD -L1 and PD -L2.12,[ADDRESS_1229074] 
prominent diffuse/fibrillary expression of PD -L1 (61% to 88% of tumors).21-23 In addition, GBMs also 
upregulate PD -L1 expression in circulating monocytes and tumor -associated macrophages (TAMs).[ADDRESS_1229075] that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway may be  a rational target for therapy.  
 
However, GBM tumors have a dominant immune suppressive microenvironment mediated by a variety of 
redundant immune mechanisms.25,26 These include secretion of immunosuppressive factors, expression 
of cell surface immunosuppressive factors such as PD -L1, and presence of immune cells that mediate 
immunosuppression such as tumor -associated macrophages of the M2 lineage and myeloid -derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs).25,26  Moreover, membranous expression of PD -L1 on 5% of tumor cells occurs 
in a minority of GBM tumors (7.8% -38%),21-23 while tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are generally 
sparse, with PD -1+ TILs reported to be identified in only a third of tumors.21,[ADDRESS_1229076] immune cell phenotype 
rendering them more susceptible to alternate checkpoint  inhibitors and thereby [CONTACT_104094] -tumor 
activity.   
 
Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD -1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may  improve 
antitumor activity. In vitro  combinations of nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_179450] -γ production 2 - to 7-
fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased  antitumor activity of the 
combination was also obs erved in 3 of 5 syngeneic murine cancer  models. In a murine melanoma 
vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA -4 or PD -1 antibodies  increased the proportion of CTLA -4 and 
PD-1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating T effector  cells, and dual blockade increas ed tumor 
infiltration of T effector cells and decreased  intratumoral T regulatory cells, as c ompared to either agent 
alone.34 
 
Nivolumab  is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds  PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD -1 and 
its ligands PD -L1 and 2 PD -L2. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a human mAb that binds to CTLA -4 and blocks the

1.1.4  Radiation Therapy to Enhance Immun e Checkpoint E fficacy  
Radiation Therapy (RT) has emerged as a strategy to enhance the ability of immune therapy to augment 
anti-cancer immune responses.35-37 RT and immune c heckpoint therapy each activates mostly non -
redundant immune stimulating mechanisms and a major contribution of radiotherapy appears to be 
increased T -cell receptor (TCR) diversity .36,37 RT also induces major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
class I presentation, increases antigen presentation and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) recognition of irradiated 
cells.36,38,39 and enhances the diversity of the TCR repertoire  of the expanded peripheral T cell clones .37 A 
recent study also demonstrated that fractionated radiotherapy leads to CD8+ T -cell–dependent adaptive 
upregulation of tumor cell PD -L1 expression.[ADDRESS_1229079] antitumor immune responses, tumor regressions, long-term survival and 
generation of antitumor immunity .32,33 Notably, one stud y using  orthotopic, immunocompetent murine GL -
261 GBM models demonstrated that the combination of RT and immune checkpoint inhibition (anti-CTLA -
4 with/without 4 -1BB activating antibody) was required to see survival benefit over either modality alone.32 
RT has been shown to increase tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), including 4 fold increases in total 
CD4+ and 4.5 fold increases in total CD8+ cells, and also mildly increases NK cell infiltration.38,44 
Additionally, RT alone can decrease intratumoral T reg levels, and RT + immune checkp oint inhibitor 
therapy synergize to increase cytotoxic T cell (CTL) infiltration and significantly increase the CTL to T reg 
ratio in the tumors.[ADDRESS_1229080] RT regimen for GBM (60 Gy over 30 fractions) frequently results in 
immunosuppression, including  lymphopenia and leukopenia despi[INVESTIGATOR_879671].45-[ADDRESS_1229081] RT regimen for GBM alone, without chemotherapy, 
lowers total CD4 counts to <  200 cells/L in 24% of glioma patients.47 Concurrent temozolomide 
exacerbates lymphopenia, lowering CD4 counts to <  200 cells/L in >  40% of patients and total lymphocyte 
counts (TLC) to <  500 cells/L in one third of patients.45,[ADDRESS_1229082] a year.  Importantly, patients with 
lymphopenia and CD4 counts of <200 cells/mm3 experience tumor progression sooner and have a 
shorter median survival of 13.1 months compared to patients with higher CD4 counts.46 
 
The cause of cranial RT -associated lymphopenia is thought to be irradiation of circulating lymphocytes as 
each daily fraction  (2 Gy)  delivers a lymphotoxic dose.49,50  In a modeling study, 6 weeks of partial -brain 
RT was estimated to deliver a lymphotoxic dose to 99% of circulating blood.50 In this model, the 
percentage of blood receiving lymphotoxic doses increased rapi[INVESTIGATOR_879672], 
with >60% of the circulating blood receiving lymphotoxic doses by 10 fractions, suggesting lymphopenia 
is dependent on the total number of fractions  rather than the total RT dose.  Indeed, a historical study 
showed that in patients given the same total dose of cranial RT, lymphopenia was dependent on the 
number of fractions into which the total dose was divided.49

(BCNU) was highly immunosuppressive, resulting in sustained  systemic  lymphodepletion  even after 
completion of treatment.[ADDRESS_1229084] tumor responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor in 
preclinical studies of melanoma. A three or five fraction regimen of radiation (8 Gy x 3 frac tions or 6 Gy x 
5 fractions in consecutive days) in one study resulted in superior responses at the primary tumor site 
compared to a single fraction radiation regimen (20 Gy) when combined with an anti -CTLA4 antibody.42  
In addition, in this study the three and five fraction regimens induced  an "abscopal effect", which resulted 
in regression in non -irradiated metastases  that was not observed with the single fraction regimen . 
 
Clinical data  
In newly diagnosed GBM, h ypofractionated , short course RT regimens d elivering therapeutic doses in [ADDRESS_1229085] RT regimen in 
several phase I and II trials.52-56 In an international randomized phase III trial conducted by [CONTACT_879802] a short course RT regimen consisting of 
25 Gy given over 5 consecutive daily fractions  was compared  to a RT regimen consisting of 40 Gy 
delivered in 15 fractions  in elderly patients with newly diagnosed GBM and poor functional status  (KPS 
50-70). This study  found the 25 Gy regimen to be non -inferior with no difference in quality of life.57 This 
trial enrolled patients aged 65 (defined as el derly) or aged 50 with poor functional status (KPS 50 -70). A 
recent phase I trial combined 5 fraction stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent and adjuvant 
temozolomide in newly diagnosed GBM (maximum Clinical Target Volume/CTV of 150 mm3) at total dose 
levels ranging from 25 -45 Gy. A tot al of 30 patients were enrolled  and only 2 protocol defined dose -
limiting toxicities were observed, with the per -protocol MTD defined as 40 Gy in 5 fractions.52 No CTCAE 
grade 3 -5 radiatio n necrosis events were observed, and the median overall s urvival was  15.0 months 
(11.3 months for MGMT  unmethylated tumors) . 
 
Hypofractionated radiotherapy schemata have been established and are now considered standard of care 
for elderly patients (≥65 years) diagnosed with glioblastoma. In a prospective case se ries, 26 patients 
received HFRT (45 Gy in 15 fractions) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. Median overall 
survival was 15.6 months and comparable to the EORTC/NCIC trial .6,58 No increased toxicities were 
observed.59 Similarly, HFRT  was well tolerated in a prospective series in 31 patients with newly 
diagnosed glioblastoma who received 45 Gy in 15 fractions.60  
 
In a more recent prospective phase III study, 562 patients older than 65 years with newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma were randomized to receive HFRT (total dose 40 Gy in 15 fractions) alone or combined with 
concurrent/adjuvant temozolomide. Patients who received HFRT with temozolomide had superior median 
overall survival (9.3 months) compared to patients who received HFRT alone (7.6 months). More 
importantly, treatment was well tolerate d in both treatment arms and no significant toxicities aside from 
the temozolomide -related hematologic side effects were seen.61

1.2 Study Drugs  
1.2.1  Nivolumab  (BMS -936558 or MDX1106 ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Background and Mechanism of Action  of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab  is a human monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G4  [IgG4] -S228P) that targets the 
programmed death -1 (PD -1) cluster of differentiation 27 9 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD -1 
is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD -1 to its 
ligands, programmed death –ligands 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the i nteraction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes immune 
responses and antigen -specific T -cell responses to b oth foreign antigens as well as self -antigens. 
Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (C HO) ce lls and is produced using standard 
mammalian cell cultivation a nd chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical study product is a 
sterile solution for parenteral administration.   
 
OPDIVOTM (nivolumab) is approved for use in multiple countries in cluding the [LOCATION_002] (US, Dec -
2014), the European Union (EU, Jun -2015), and Japan (Jul -2014).   
 
For detailed information on Nivolumab refer to the Investigator's Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Studies  of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab has been shown to bind specifically to the human P D-1 receptor and not to related members 
of the CD28 family.  Nivolumab inhibits the interaction of PD -1 with its ligands,  PD-L1 and PD -L2, resulting 
in enhanced T -cell proliferation and interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) release in vitro . Nivolumab bind s with high 
affinity to activated human T -cells expressing  cell surface PD -1 and to cynomolgus monkey PD -1. In a 
mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR),  nivolumab promoted a reproducible concentration -dependent 
enhancement of IFN - release.  
 
In intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was well  tolerated 
at doses up to 50 mg/kg, administered weekly for 5 week s, and at doses up to 50 mg/kg, administered 
Nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + RT in MGMT  unmethylated GBM (s17 -[ZIP_CODE])  Page 7 
Version: 5/29/[ADDRESS_1229092] highlighted the potential for enhanced toxicity  when combined with other 
immunostimulatory agents.  
 
In addition, an enhanced pre - and postnatal development (ePPND) study in pregnant cynomolgus  
monkey s with nivolumab was conducted.  Administration of nivolumab at up to 50 mg/kg 2QW  was well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_162621]; however, nivolumab was determined to be a selective  developmental 
toxicant when administered from the period of organogenesis to  parturition at  10 mg/kg (area under the 
concentration -time curve [AUC] from time zero to 168 hours  [AUC(0 168 h)] 117,000 g•h/mL). 
Specifically, increased dev elopmental mortality (including late gestational fetal losses and extreme 
prematurity with ass ociated neonatal mortality) was noted in the absence of overt maternal toxicity. There 
were no nivolumab -related changes in  surviving infants tested throughout the 6 -month postnatal period. 
Although the cause of these  pregnancy failures was undetermined, ni volumab -related effects on 
pregnancy maintenance are  consistent with the established role of PD -L1 in maintaining f etomaternal 
tolerance in mice.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Effects  of Nivolumab  in Humans  
The PK, clinical activity, and safety of nivolumab have been assessed in subjec ts with non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, clear -cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma 
(cHL) in addition to other tumor types. Nivolumab monotherapy is approved in multiple countries, 
including the US and EU, for unrese ctable or metastatic melanoma, previously treated metastatic NSCLC, 
and previously treated advanced RCC; it is also approved for the treatment of cHL in the US. In addition, 
nivolumab has been approved for use in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_489852] e melanoma in 
multiple countries, including the US and EU.  
 
Nivolumab is being investigated both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Additional clinical activity and safety information are av ailable and 
summarized from clinic al studies in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [SCCHN], small cell 
lung cancer [SCLC], gastric cancer, urothelial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], colorectal cancer 
[CRC], and glioblastoma [nivolumab monotherapy]; SCLC, gastric cancer, NSCLC, RCC, and CRC 
[nivolumab combination therapy]; and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. [ONO] studies in Japanese or 
Korean subjects).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Clinical Pharmacokinetics  of Nivolumab  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg 
administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks.  
 
The geometric mean (% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vs s) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination half -life (t 1/2) was 
26.7 days (101%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 weeks when 
administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3 -fold. The exposure to 
nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0 .1 to 10 mg/kg administered every [ADDRESS_1229093] on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, 
race, baseline LDH, PD -L1. A PPK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, 
gender, race, solid tumor type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment. Although E COG status, 
baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and mild hepatic impairment had an effect 
on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. When nivolumab is administered in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the CL of nivol umab was increased by 24%, whereas there was no effect on 
the clearance of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].

lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4, cluster of differentiation [CD] 152), which is expressed on a subset of 
activated T cells. CTLA -4, an activation -induced T -cell surface molecu le, is a member of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin superfamily that competes with CD28 for B7. CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of T -cell 
activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CTLA -4 and blocks the interaction of 
CTLA -4 with its ligand s, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has been shown to augment T -cell activation 
and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T -effector cells. Inhibition of 
CTLA -4 signaling can also reduce T -regulatory cell (T reg) funct ion, which may contribute to a general 
increase in T -cell responsiveness, including the anti -tumor response.

for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], encompassing more than 19,500 subj ects (total number of subjects enrolled in ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79320]) in several cancer types in completed and ongoing studies, as well as a compassionate use 
program. The focus of the clinical p rogram is in melanoma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, with

clinically  meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit in pretreated advanced me lanoma and  
previously untreated advanced melanoma, respectively. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879681]. The combination is approved in the US for the treatment of advanced 
melanoma.  
 
The safety profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879682] a) the majority  adverse 
events (AEs) being inflammatory in nature, which is consistent with the proposed  mechanism of action of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; b) the same types of such immune -mediated events in the  gastrointestinal (GI)  tract, skin, 
liver, and endocrine system being reported; and c) most of these  events being manageable with immune 
suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
The unique immune -based mechanism of action is reflected in the clinical patterns of anti -cancer  activity 
in some pat ients. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879683], and measurable clinical effects emerge 
after the immunological effects. Tumor infiltration with lymphocytes and the  associated inflammation 
(documented by [CONTACT_396]) is likely the cornerstone  of the effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879684]. In some cases, inflammation may 
not be noted by [CONTACT_879803], and  objective response is observed with the first tumor 
assessment in  a manner seen in patients  receiving other types of anti -cancer treatments. In other cases, 
response may be preceded by [CONTACT_879804]/or the appearance of new 
lesions, which may be  mistaken for tumor progression on radiol ogical evaluations. Therefore, in patients 
who are not  experiencing rapid clinical deterioration, confirmation of progression is recommended (at the  
investigator’s discretion) to better understand the prognosis, as well as to avoid unnecessarily  initiating  
potentially toxic alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_879685]. Immune -related 
response criteria were developed based on these observations to  systematically categorize novel 
patterns of clinical activity and are currently bein g prospectively  evaluated in clinical studies.  
 
In metastatic diseases, stabilization is more common than response, and in some instances is  associated 
with a slow, steady decline in tumor burden over many months, sometimes improving  to partial and/or 
comp lete responses (CRs). Thus, the immune -based mechanism of action of  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879686], sometimes with novel patterns of response, which  contribute to its unique 
improvement in OS.  
 
The unique immune -based mechanism of action is also reflected in the safety profile. Such immunological 
safety events are described as immune -related  adverse events (irAEs) or immune -mediated adverse 
reactions (imARs). The irAEs are described  as AEs of unknown etiology, which were consistent with an 
immune phenomenon and  considered causally related to drug exposure by [CONTACT_431]. The irAEs 
primarily involve the  GI tract and skin. Immune -related AEs in the liver were also observed, particularly in 
subjects  receiving 10 mg/kg. Endocrinopathy and neurop athy were important irAEs that were observed  
less frequently . The early diagnosis of inflammatory events is important to initiate therapy and minimize  
complications. Inflammatory events are generally manageable using symptomatic or  immuno -suppressive 
thera py as recommended through de tailed diagnosis and management guidelines.

Version: 5/29/[ADDRESS_1229097] -line therapy in 
subjects with advanced NSCLC . In CA209012, early combination cohorts evaluated  2 dosing schedules 
that were studied in the CA209004 study in melanoma15: 
 
• Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by  [CONTACT_20382] 3 
mg/kg q 2 weeks (Arms G and H, n=24);  
• Nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by  [CONTACT_20382]  3 
mg/kg q 2 weeks (Arms I and J, n=25)  
 
These regimens resulted in significant toxicity, with 39% of subjects discontinuing treatment due  to a 
treatment -related adverse event. Thus, additional combination cohorts were initiated  (Arms N, O, P, Q), 
using lower doses of both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], or the approved dose  of nivolumab with less 
frequent dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. These new regimens were much better  tolerated, and the safety data are 
not dissimilar to what has been observed in the nivolumab  monotherapy cohort (Arm F in CA209012).  
 
Activity was observed in all cohorts, with response rates greater than 39% in the 2 cohorts in  
which nivolumab was dosed at 3 mg/kg (N3). PFS and OS is also encouraging in the nivolumab  
3 mg/kg cohorts . Clinical act ivity was observed in subjects with and without PD-L1 expressing tumors, 
though there was a greater magnitude of efficacy in subjects with PD -L1 expressing tumors. In subjects  
with PD-L1 expressing tumors (  1% level), the response rate was 57% with nivolu mab 3  mg/kg and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_1229098] numbers are small. For subjects with  PD-L1 expressing and non -
expressing tumors, the nivolumab 3 mg/kg eve ry 2 weeks plus  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_1229099] -line NSCLC (CA209227). This dosing schedule will also 
be used in the experimental arm of the  CA209722 study.  
 
Based on these data, and consultation with BMS, the combination strategy for this study will be to use 
lower doses and less frequent dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 mg/kg q6 weeks) that has demonstrated 
acceptable safety and preliminary efficacy in ongoing combination treatment studies in lung cancer.

To minimize risk to the subject, vital signs, symptom -directe d physical exams and safety labs will be 
performed at frequent intervals throughout the study  and as indicated . In addition, subjects will be asked 
to report any potential adverse events and concomitant medications continually throughout the study as 
indicated in the Schedule of Events, and complete physical exams performed prior to the initiation of

recommend discontinuing further treatment across the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79297], if necessary.  
1.3.2  Risk with Radiation Therapy  (RT) 
Radiation therapy is a stan dard treatment modality for  GBM  patients  and has been established to be 
generally safe and well tolerated.  However, the risk of radiation necrosis and other adverse events listed 
below may be increased with hypofractionated radiation therap y due to the inc reased dose given per 
fraction in hypofractionated prescriptions . However, in recent years, a number of small phase I and II 
studies  and one large phase III trial  have reported hypofractionated RT regimens to be well tolerated and 
result in  similar early - and delayed -RT adverse effect  profiles  compared to  standard radiotherapy 
regimens in selected newly diagnosed GBM patients.52-57,68 
 
Expected acute radiation  therapy adverse events  include skin reaction, including dryne ss, redness, 
itching (pruritis), tanning, soreness and  hair loss, fatigue , nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, altered taste,  
decrease in blood counts,  short -term hearing impairment due to reactions in the ear canals and on the 
ear, serous otitis media (fluid in th e middle ear) as well as temporary aggravation of brain tumor 
symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and weakness.  
 
Expected early delayed radiation therapy adverse events  (occurring 1 -3 months after radiotherapy 
treatment)  include  fatigue,  lethargy and tr ansient worsening of existing neurological deficits.  
 
Expected late delayed radi ation therapy adverse events (occurring 3 months or more after radiation 
therapy treatment)  include radiation necrosis (severe local damage to normal brain tissue), which may 
result in  permanent neurocognitive deficits  (difficulties with short term memory, calculations, language 
and more severe neurocognitive deficits) or motor dysfunction, leukoencephalopathy, permanent hearing 
impairment, radiation injury to the visual st ructures  includ ing the optic nerve and chiasm, which can result 
in partial or complete blindness , cataracts endocrine dysfunction  and radiation -induced neoplasms . 
Radiation necrosis can mimic recurrent brain tumor and may require surgery for diagnosis and treatment . 
 
To minimize risk to the subject, modern RT te chniques will be used  including fractionated stereotactic 
radiotherapy , protons, and IMRT,  which  allow for highly conformal treatment  to a considerably more 
precise target volume . These technologies have  the potential to significantly reduce t he toxicity 
associated with hypofractionated radiation .69

3.1.3  General Overview Study Procedures  
All Subjects : After screening procedures and registration, within [ADDRESS_1229112] diagnostic 
neurosurgical procedure, all subjects  will initiate  study treatment with one dose of nivolumab IV (3 mg /kg) 
followed by [CONTACT_879807][INVESTIGATOR_870840] (1  mg/kg) .   
 
Safety Lead -In/Main Study Cohort :  
 
On C1D8, seven days after nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288], all subjects will be administered  
radiotherapy ( RT) to a total dose of 45 Gy, given in  15 consecutive fractions of 3 Gy each fraction .  
 
On C1D15, subjects will receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg  IV. Thereafter, n ivolumab administration will c ontinue 
once every 2 weeks .

tumor progression and serve as a potential non-invasive pharmacodynamic biomarker.  
3.5 Primary Safety Endpo ints 
3.5.1  Phase II Safety Analysis  
For the phase II portion of the study, we consider a rate of unacceptable toxicity of 40%  or greater (defined 
as CTCAE grade 3, grade 4, or intolerable grade 2 toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
study therapy) to be unacceptable.  Intolerable grade 2 toxicity will be defined as any grade 2 toxicity that 
results in study  discontinuation . Monitoring  for toxicity will follow a Bayesian -based rule for the probability 
that the rate of unacceptable toxicity  exceed s a maximal tolerated le vel of 4 0%.90 We will assume a 
Beta(2,3) prior, which is prior information equivalent to two unacceptable toxicit ies observed in 5 treated 
patients. This minimally informative prior is justified  as there is some clinical experience with the 
combination the rapy. Early termination for unacceptable toxicity will be considered based on a posterior 
probability (in parentheses), that the unacceptable toxicity rate exceeds 30%. Toxicity wil l be carefully 
monitored in the 24 Phase II  patients. Termination will be considered if unacceptable toxicity is observed 
in: 2 of 3 patients (0. 71), 4 of 6 patients ( 0.83), 5  of 9 patients (0.77 ), 7 of 12 patients (0.86 ), 8 of 15 patients 
(0.81 ), 9 of 18 patients (0.77 ), 11 of 21 patients (0.85 ), or 12  of 24 patients (0.81 ). 
3.5.2  Special I nterim Safety A nalysis

months or more after radiation therapy treatment)  will be conducted d ue to a possible  incre ased incidence 
of CNS toxicity  from delayed radiation necrosis  or radiation injury  occurring du ring the first [ADDRESS_1229121] a 
minimum 24 week overall survival follow -up time, an interim safety analysis for delayed treatment -induced 
neurotoxicity  will be performed . If the incidence of  CTCAE grade 3 CNS (neurologic) toxicity  deemed  
possibly, probably, or definitely  related to treatment  is 33% or higher  (i.e., [ADDRESS_1229122] 
12) in this group , the trial will be halted due to lack of  safety.

extensive, non -palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents or devices for 
treatment of glioblastoma)  
• Antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV  
• Caution should be applied in the administration of over -the-counter medications and herbal 
preparations during the conduct of the study. Consultation with the Sponsor is encouraged.  
 
If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited 
during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The treating investigator 
should discuss any questions regarding this with the overall study PI [INVESTIGATOR_28678].  The final decision 
on any support ive therapy or vaccination rests with the treating  investigator . 
4.3.4  Other Restrictions and Precautions  
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes (e.g., allergy history, 
diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast regimen for each subject. 
Imaging contraindications and contrast risks should be considered in this assessment. Subjects with renal 
insufficiency should be assessed as to whether or not they should receive contrast  and if so, what type 
and dose of contrast is appropriate.  
 
Specific to MRI, subjects with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 
30 mL/min/1.73m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast  should not be 
given to this subject population. In addition, subjects are excluded from MRI if they have metallic 
implants, MRI -incompatible pacemakers, etc. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual

5.1.2  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (BMS company code: BMS -734016 , MDX -010) 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Yervoy®; Bristol -Myers Squibb) is a fully human mAb (IgG1κ ) that binds to the CTLA -4, a 
negative regulator of T -cell activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_120967] -4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA -4 with 
its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has been shown to augment T -cell activation and 
proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T -effector cells.  Inhibition of 
CTLA -4 signaling can also reduce T -regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general increase 
in T-cell responsiveness, including the anti -tumor immune response. C ombined nivolumab - (anti-PD-1) 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -mediated inhibition results in enhanced T -cell function that is gre ater than the effects of 
either antibody alone, and results in improved anti -tumor responses in metastatic melanoma.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879701] -appro ved in the treatment of advanced melanoma as a monotherapy (irrespective of BRAF

deficiencies a nd 7% with panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297]. While  patients with glioblastoma rarely survive to six years, 
it is still important to consider radiation -induced hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] (RIH) as a potential complication.  
  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], doses of [ADDRESS_1229152] fractionation are given to low grade brain tumors,  including 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_44079], with known (RIH) as a complication.  For higher doses of radiotherapy given to 
suprasellar tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, RIH is more common, suggesting both a possible dose 
or dose -volume correlation to the side effect.  I nvestigators have suggested that doses above 
approximately [ADDRESS_1229153] fractionation (1.8 -2.0 Gy 
per fraction).  Single fraction radiosurgery has been used to treat secretory and non -secretory pi[INVESTIGATOR_879711].

tumors and 10 for normal tissue).  For 45 Gy delivered in 15 fractions, alpha/beta of 3 yields an equivalent 
dose of 54 Gy and alpha/beta ratio of 10 yields and equivalent dose of 49 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction.  Given 
that we do not know the alpha -beta of pi[INVESTIGATOR_879713] 40 Gy at 2 Gy / fraction, it is reasonable to set a dose constraint for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304].  
  
A reasonable constraint would be to contour the pi[INVESTIGATOR_879714] 45 Gy 
(no more than 3 Gy per fraction) in order t o lower the risk of RIH.

Image -guided radiotherapy with cone -beam CT along wit h daily treatment kV/kV imaging will be 
performed daily . 
Imaging for treatment planning will be obtained with the patient in the same position and immobilization 
device as for treatment. All patients will be positioned via a combinati on of rigid immobilization and daily 
image guidance to ensure positioning accuracy of 3 mm or better, and of a magnitude that justifies the

BRAVO). Additionally, a T2 sequence (e.g., FLAIR or T2, preferably stereotactic, thin slice, contiguous) is 
helpful to identify any non -enhancing tumor.  
Immobilization must be rigid (e.g., thermoplastic masks). For daily treatment, localization will include t he 
steps of a) immobilization with the same device used for simulation, and b) daily image guidance using at 
a minimum orthogonal pairs of radiographs aligned to DRRs as a computer -assisted process . Daily cone -
beam CT will be used as well.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Planni ng/Target Volumes  
A GTV will be defined using the simulation CT scan.  Fusion of the pr e- and post -operative  MRI scans  are 
fused to the CT simulation scan for target delineation.   
The GTV includes the post -operative resection cavity if no residual enhanci ng or non -enhancing tumor is

The treatment parameters should be modified to optimize the conformity of the prescription isodose 
volume to the target volu me while minimizing dose to critical structures. OAR limits for newly diagnosed

[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  for the Safety Lead -In 
The DLT period  for the Safety Lead -In is considered the first 40 days of study therapy , and will 
include labs and other evaluations taken at C1D40 (end of the f irst 40 days).  The frequency, time to 
onset, and severity of toxicities, as well as the success of standard medical management and dosing 
interruptions/  delays, will be analyzed to determine if a given toxicity should be considered a DLT for 
dose decision  purposes.  The final decision of whether or not the AE meets the DLT definition will be 
based on a careful review of all relevant data  by [CONTACT_879806] . The treating 
investigator may also be consulted.  
 
A DLT is defined  as any non-hematologic grade ≥3 adverse event (AE) that is at least possibly, 
probably or definitely related to nivolumab or  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879727] . 
 
The following will be  classified as DLT: 
• Any Grade 2 drug -related  uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_61780] 1 severity within 7 days  OR requires systemic 
treatment . 
• Any Grade ≥ 2 drug -related pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease that does not resolve  to 
Grade 1 within 7 days  and systemic steroids (also see Pulmonary Adverse Event Management 
Algorithm  in Appendix  4). 
• Any Grade 3 drug -related bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction, 
regardless of duration . 
• Any Grade 3 non -hematologic , drug -related adverse event, with the following criteria : 
o Grade 3 drug -related uveitis, pneumonitis, diarrhea, or colitis  of any duration  will be  
classified as DLT . 
o Grade ≤3 symptoms attributable to brain/intracranial edema that downgrades to G rade ≤2 
within 7 days, or to Grade ≤1 or baseline within 14 days after onset will not be classified 
as DLT  (for rules for managing brain/intracranial edema , see Section 6.2.5  below) . 
o Any ≥ gr ade 2 neurological AE lasting > 7 days will be  considered a DLT.  
• Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia  (<50,000 mm3), which will be  classified as DLT  
• Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (ANC < 1000  mm3), which will be  classified as DLT  
• Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria will be 
classified as DLT (also see Hepatic Adverse Event Management Algorithm):  
• AST or ALT (> [ADDRESS_1229184] ) for > 2 weeks  
• AST or ALT (> [ADDRESS_1229185] ) 
• Total bilirubin (> [ADDRESS_1229186] ) 
• Concurrent  AST or ALT ( > [ADDRESS_1229187] ) and total bilirubin (> [ADDRESS_1229188] ) 
• Grade ≥ 3 lymphopenia  will not be classified as DLT as this is frequently observed at baseline in 
newly diagnosed GBM patients.87

unlikely  related to  study treatment, and are reversed  within 48 hours with  replacement will not be 
considered  DLT. However, recurrence of the same g rade ≥ 3 electrolyte abnormality during the 
DLT period will be considered a DLT.  
 
While rules for adjudicating DLTs are sp ecifie d above, an AE of Grade < 3 (except if listed as exempt 
above), may also be defined as a DL T after a consultation with the overall study Principal 
Investigator, based on the safety profile of nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . In the absence of clinical 
abnormali ty, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior 
to designation as a DLT.

6.2 Dose Delay  and Discontinuation Criteria  
6.2.1  Immune -Related Adverse E vents (irAEs)  
Special attention must be paid to adverse events (AEs) that may be suggestive of a potential immune -
mediated pathophysiology. Since inhibition of immune checkpoints stimulates the immune system, 
immune -mediated adverse events may occur.   
 
Immune -related adverse events (irAEs) are AEs of immune nature (i.e., inflammatory) in the absence of a 
clear alter native etiology.  Immune -mediated AEs are specific events (that include pneumoniti s, 
diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, nephritis/renal dysfunction, rash, and endocrine [adrenal insufficiency,  
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and hypophysitis]) for which  subjects 
received immunosuppressive medication for treatment of the event, with the exception  of endocrine 
events (hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, diabetes  mellitus, adrenal insufficiency), 
which are included regardless of treatment since these events are  often managed without 
immunosuppression.   
 
IrAEs  include events, regardless of causality, occurring w ithin [ADDRESS_1229193] dose.  IrAEs  are limited 
to subjects who received immunosuppres sive medication for treatment of the  
event, with the exception of endocrine events (hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism,  
hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency), which are included regardless of  
treatment since these events are ofte n managed without immunosuppression.  
 
An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. All AEs of 
unknown etiology associated with drug exposure should be evaluated to determine possible immune 
etiology. I f an i rAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin 
or other etiologic causes. Subjects who develop a Grade 2 or higher i rAE should be discussed 
immediately with the overall Principal Investigator.  
 
Managemen t Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents  
 
Immuno -oncology (I -O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration  than AEs 
caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879729] -oncology agents in this prot ocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated  
with immuno -oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management Algorithms have been  
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs  (see 
Appendix 4  and the nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879730] s): 
 
• Gastrointestinal  
• Renal  
• Pulmonary

6.2.5  Rules for Intracranial/ Brain Edema  
Development of edema in the brain  or central nervous system necrosis  is common followin g fractionated 
brain radiation therapy and may be asymptomatic (solely a radiographic finding) or associated with mild, 
moderate or severe symptoms. Therefore, brain edema will be considered an expected  event related to 
study therapy ( RT) and will not be considered a DLT  and will not require permanent study drug 
discontinuation  unless symptoms from brain /intracranial  edema meets criteria for discontinuation below .  
 
Note , the CTCAE v4.03 term "Edema cerebral"  only has grade 4 clas sification in the CTCAE v4.03. 
Therefore , the "Edema cerebral" CTCAE v4.03 term should be used only if the event meets  grade 4 
criteria  per CTCAE v4.03 criteria (i.e., l ife-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated ).  
Grade 4 Edema cerebral  is defined by [CONTACT_31617] o f the following criteria:  
• Any neurosurgical procedure is required to manage brain edema  
• Requires  mannitol for management of symptomatic brain edema  
• Requires >8 mg per day of dexamethasone or bioequivalent for more than 7 consecutive days to 
manage symptoms  of brain edema

sponsor  • Brain edema is deemed life -threatening per judgment of the treating investigator  
For study purposes, the AEs deemed attributable to brain or intracranial edema that do not meet "Edema 
cerebral (Grade 4 )" criteria per CTCAE v4.03 should be d escribed by [CONTACT_4167] (e.g. headache, 
nausea, focal neurological deficit) and graded for severity accordingly . In addition, the term "Nervous 
System Disorders - Other" may be used with a description to specify the AE . 
 
If appropriate, the investigator should use the term " Central nervous system necrosis " per CTCAE 4.03 
criteria if the investigator deems the radiographic findings are consistent with central nervous system 
radiation necrosis without symptomatic Grade 4 severity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Criteria for Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879747]:  
• Grade ≤3 AEs  that are attributable brain /intracranial  edema  or central nervous system 
necrosis  will not be classified as DLT (if in the Safety Lead -In cohort) and will not require 
permanent study drug discontinuation if: 
 
o The grade 3  AE downgrades to Grade ≤ 1 within 7 days  after onset of the event  with maximal 
supportive care, including bevacizumab (see bevacizumab guidelines below) and/or systemic 
corticosteroid administration  (no more than 7 consecutive days of dexamethasone dosed at 
>8 mg per day or bioequivalent) . 
o The gr ade 2 AE improve s to grade ≤1  or baseline within 7 days after onset of the event with 
maximal supportive care, including bevacizumab and/or systemic corticosteroid 
administration (no more than 7 consecutive days of dexamethasone dosed at >8 mg per day 
or bioequivalent).  
• Grade 4 sympto ms attributable to brain or intracranial edema or central nervous system necrosis  
will be considered a DLT and require immediate discontinuation of nivolumab and  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . 
• Grade 4 "Edema cerebral " will be considered a DLT require immediate discontinuation of 
nivolumab and  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . 
Subjects who experience Edema cerebral Grade 4 will  be classified as having a DLT (if in the Safety

Note  on Pseudoprogression : Tumor infiltration with immune cells may be associated with increasing 
enhancement and edema on brain MRI  or CT (i.e. pseudoprogression ) and may mimic therapy -related 
central nervous system radiation necrosis or disease progression. Due to the well -described difficulty in 
differentiating between immune -mediated pseudoprogression and true tumor progression usi ng standard 
imaging techniques,[ADDRESS_1229232] be made to events that ar e

an AE that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_879752]/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879753], then RT may be continued while nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879754].  
 
If a subject meets criterion for permanent discontinuation and the investigator is unable to determine 
whether the event is related to RT, nivolumab, or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] , the subject should discontinue all study 
treatment  and be taken off the treatment phase of the study.  
6.2.8  Management of  Nivoluma b or Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879755] /Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Acute infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2 hours after the 
infusion is completed. Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential ad verse 
effects (e.g., antihistamines, bronchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and/or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate use.  
 
Since nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_871218],  they are 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if  such  reaction s 
were  to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash,  pruritus, arthralgias, hypo - or 
hypertension, bronchospasm, or other sympt oms.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4  infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the Sponso r and reported as an 
SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should b e graded according to NCI CTCAE 4.03 guidelines.  
 
Treatment recommendations are provided bel ow and may be mo dified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:

sponsor  For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention  
not indicated)  
 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recove ry from sym ptoms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infus ions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1229243] 30 minutes before  additional nivolumab or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782].  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but  responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [e .g., antihistamines, non -steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophyl actic  medications indicated for ≤ 24 
hours)

with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325  to 1000 mg; 
remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid  and/or bronchodilator 
therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is  interrupted, then restart the infusion at 
50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms res olve;  if no further complications ensue after 30 
minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the  original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If 
symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab or  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114569]. Administe r

mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_1229245] 
30 minutes before nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45784]. If  necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of 
SoluCortef or equiva lent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grad e 3: prolonged [i .e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_86025]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of  symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879756] [e .g., renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor  or ventilatory support indicated)  
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a  1:1000 solution for 
subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected  slowly for IV  administration, 
and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylp rednisolone 100  mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject 
should be monitored until the investigator is  comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879757]. In vestigators should follow their institutional guidelines for 
the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the symptoms.  
 
In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e .g., appearanc e of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment),  symptomatic treatment may be given (e .g., oral  antihistamine or 
corticosteroids).  
6.3 Screening Procedures  
After providing informed consent, patients will undergo screening for eligibility to participate in the study. 
Screening will start within 21 days prior to initiation of study treatment (first dose of nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ). Refer also to the Schedule o f Events  (Appendix  1) for complete details of study 
procedures.  
 
The following procedures will be performed or obtained at Screening  for the purpose of determining 
study eligibility : 
 
• Pathology report confirming the diagnosis  of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma , WHO grade IV .

sponsor  • MGMT  promoter DNA methylation status  must be determined by [CONTACT_200029] (see central MGMT  
testing details below) . Only subjects with unmethylated MGMT  promoter confirmed by [CONTACT_879815].   
o Frozen tumor tissue or [ADDRESS_1229247] be submitted to NYUSoM  
for MGMT  methylation testing.  
• Collection of archived tumor material for research: The subject will be asked to arrange to provide 
archival tumor tissue from a surgical resection that demonstrates histopathological evidence of 
glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) or gliosarcoma as specified in the Eligibility Criteria . 
• Documentation that no  IDH1  or IDH2  mutation s are present in the tumor by a CLIA approved 
laboratory is required prior to initiation of study treatment.  
• A contrast -enhanced MRI must be obtained within [ADDRESS_1229248] dose of study treatment.  
• Medical history , eligibility , and concomitant medications : The subject must be eligible by [CONTACT_879816] 4 . Concomitant medications  will be  reviewed f or allowed or 
prohibited medications.  
• Adverse event assessment  
• Chest x -ray: Chest x -ray is required at screening if not performed within  60 days  prior to initiation of 
study treatment . 
o Note: Baseline chest x -ray is required as this may assist in subsequent clinical assessments 
that may occur during the study. For example, in a circumstance in which a patient presents 
to a provider with signs and symptoms that may be related to a pulmonary process, standard 
clinical practice often is to obtain a ch est x -ray. In order to interpret a chest x -ray in this 
situation, it is clinically helpful to have a recent baseline chest x -ray on file. Hence, a baseline 
chest x -ray is required if not performed in the prior [ADDRESS_1229249] been sufficient.  
• 12-Lead ECG : A standar d 12-lead ECG will be required  only at screening . The ECG strips or reports 
will be retained with the source. The ECG will be reviewed by [CONTACT_093] (paper or electronic 
tracing) and will be available for comparison with subsequent ECGs by [CONTACT_28798] . Any 
ECG finding performed during the study period after screening that is judged by [CONTACT_1694] a 
clinically significant change (worsening) compared to the baseline value will be considered an AE, 
recorded, and monitored.  The following wi ll be recorded on the CRF:  
o PR Interval (msec)  
o QRS Interval (msec)  
o QT Interval (msec)  
o Heart Rate (BPM; recorded from the ventricular rate).  
• Physical exam and laboratories:   Subjects will have the following vital signs, physical exam and 
laboratory procedures  evaluated for eligibility  if not already performed within 21 d ays prior to initiation 
of study treatment (first dose of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ). For complete details see the Schedule

Local reading (investigator assessment) will be used to determine eligibility and for participant 
management. Response Assessments will be performed on every brain imaging assessment performed 
on protocol per standard RANO criteria .90 However, due to the known for patient management, non -
traditional  iRANO  criteria may be used .73 
 
• Refer to Appendix  [ADDRESS_1229273] measurable disease present at 
baseline (obtained within 14 days of Cycle 1, Day 1) scan and have received at least  one dose of therapy 
will be considered evaluable for response. These participants will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated in  Appendix  3. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease 
progression or die prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
6.6.3  Continuation of therapy pending confirmation of radiographic disease 
progression  
If using iRANO  criteria for patient management , iRANO  recommends confirmation of disease 
progression on follow -up imaging 3 months after initial radiographic progression  if there is no new

sponsor  or substantially worsened neurological deficits that are not due to comorbid events or concurrent 
medication, and  it is 6 months or less from starting immunotherapy  (see Appendix  3 for iRANO 
criteria details). A decision of whether a patient should continue immunotherapy pending confirmation of 
radiographic disease progression should be established based on perceived benefits and risks. 
Continuation of immunotherapy may be considered pending f ollow -up imaging as long as subjects are 
deriving apparent clinical benefit with minimal and acceptable toxic effects.  
 
By [CONTACT_22242], investigators may consider interrupting immunotherapy for subjects who need a substantial 
increase in corticosteroids (i.e ., >4 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent per day) for evolving symptoms 
associated with brain edema or who have more than mild treatment -related toxic effects such as at least 
grade [ADDRESS_1229275] of the subjects. As a general guidance, resumption of immunotherapy 
might be taken into account when systemic dexamethasone is decreased to 4 m g/day or less and the 
contrast -enhancing tumor burden is classified as stable disease, partial response, or complete response 
on a follow -up scan, or when relevant treatment -related toxic effects have resolved to grade 1 or less or 
pre-treatment baseline.

Based on these historical measures, a 12 month (1yr -OS) of 35% will be considered non -promising in 
MGMT  unmethylated, newly diagnosed GBM subjects ; an increase in the 1yr -OS to 60% will be

Most recently, a phase II randomized multicenter clinical study in patients with recurrent glioblastoma 
suggest that treatment with the PD -1 inhibitor pembrolizumab results in significantly prolonged overall 
survival when given neoadjuvantly (prior to tumo r re-resection) as compared to pembrolizumab adjuvantly 
(after tumor re -resection). This increase in overall survival was associated with upregulated T cell -activation 
and Interferon -γ-gene expression signatures and downregulation of cell -cycle related gen e expression 
signatures in tumor cells. In this study, interferon - and T cell -pathway induction was seen in 9 of 14 tumors 
(64%) from patients who received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab compared to 5 of 15 tumors (33%) from 
patients who received pembrolizumab adjuvant -only.[ADDRESS_1229301] induction rate of 33% will be considered non -promising; an 
increase in the  T-cell pathway induction rate to 64% will be considered promising.

Adverse events (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) and predefined limits of change in 
laboratory, and vital sign parameters will be summarized with descriptive statistics (counts, percentage, 
mean, standard deviation, etc.). Continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory, and 
vital signs parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for 
baseline, on -treatment, and change from baseline values.

A single -stage d esign will be utilized  to estimate overall survival ,83,84 with a hypothesized 1yr-OS of 
60%=H 1 and 35 %=H 0.  We will enroll 24 patients ; this design has a  two-sided  Type I error of 0.05 and a 
power of 80%.   
 
For endpoint analyses, one  year will be defined as 48 weeks  (8 cycles)  and two years will be defined as 
96 weeks  (16 cycles) . Patients will be  evaluated for radiographic responses by [CONTACT_879824] [ADDRESS_1229304] 9 5% confiden ce intervals; with 2 4 
patients, a 95% CI will be no more than 0.[ADDRESS_1229305] disease assessment.  The Kaplan –Meier curves will be used to summarize OS and to estimate the 
medians.   
 
PFS is  defined a s the time between treatment initiation and fir st occurrence of disease progression or 
death, and will be censored at last follow -up if the patient remained alive without disease progression. 
PFS is defined as the  time from the first dose of study treatment to the earlier of disease progression or 
death due to any cause. Patients who initiate alternate anticancer therapy in the absence of documented 
progression will be censored at the latest disease assessment prior to initiation of such therapy. Patients 
with no post -baseline disease assessments will b e censored at the Cycle [ADDRESS_1229306] planned assessment (in which case the death will be considered a PFS event).  
The Kaplan –Meier curves will be used to summarize PFS and to estimate the medians.  
 
Overall response rate ( ORR ) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve best overall response of 
complete or partial response at any time after initiation of study treatment (prior to initiation of alternate 
anticancer treatment). Duration of response  is defined as the number of months from the time criteria are 
first met for either CR or PR, until the first date th at PD is objectively documented . The duration of 
objective response will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.

be examined using Wilcoxon signed rank tests for paired measurements.  Logistic regression will be used 
to predict 1yr -OS (binary) based on baseline levels and the changes from baseline.  Optimal cutpoints for 
changes from baseline will be estimated for the separation of those patients who are alive at [ADDRESS_1229308] -enhancemen t

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.) 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
ADVERSE EVENT  (AE) 
 
An adverse eve nt (AE)  is defined as any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens 
in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse 
events.  An AE also includes any  worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if t he abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_879825] -ended questioning, examination, 
or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects sho uld not be questioned regarding 
the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)  
 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 
• fatal 
• life-threatening  (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; i t does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)  
• requires or prolongs in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  (In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a

• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions)  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  - Important medical events are those that may not be immediately l ife 
threatening, but are clearly of  major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and 
may require intervention to prevent one of the othe r serious outcomes noted above.  For example, 
drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in i n-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive 
treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event  (see below  
for the definition of po tential DILI).  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the stud y 
drug.   
• Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported 
as an SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).  
 
Although pregnancy, study drug overdose, potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI), and development of 
another cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these ev ents must be handled as SAEs.  
 
NOTE: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28688] a serious adverse event unless specifically instr ucted otherwise in this protocol.  Any 
condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Exceptions : Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], no r surgery are reported as 
an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879773] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was u neventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879774] a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of he alth status (e.g., routine 
colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the 
study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28690].  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and 
requires no m edical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs.  
 
NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
 
All adverse events that do not meet  any of the criteria for Serious Adverse Event (defined above ) should 
be regarded as non-serious adverse events . 
 
Progression of underlying malignancy

sponsor  Progression of underlying malignancy  will not be considered an AE if it i s clearly consistent with the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_28686] (including time course, affected organs, etc.). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_879775] b e considered a SAE. Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the 
symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to the progression of the underlying malignancy, or 
does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease under st udy. 
 
If there is any uncertainty about an AE being due only to progression of the underlying malignancy, it 
should be reported as an AE o r SAE as outlined in Section 8.4.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written 
consent to part icipate in the study and for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_1229314] be collected that relate to any later protocol -
specified procedure (e .g., an optional tumor biopsy).  
 
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as S AEs if they become 
serious. Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study 
drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one th at is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.

At screening, an y clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adve rse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
inves tigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any deat h or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated 
in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following institutional 
procedu res.  
 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, specific corrective therapy, etc. 
• The abnormality  leads to a change in dosi ng (outside of protocol -stipulated dose adjustments)  
• The abnormality  leads to discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant 
medication, or other therapy  
• The laboratory test result is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE

Version: 5/29/[ADDRESS_1229315] result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined in 
Section 8.2 .1. 
 
Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should  occur prior to 
the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, 
must be reported as SAEs (see Section 8.4 for reporting details).  
 
Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is defined as:  
 
1)  AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
 
AND  
 
1)  Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1229316], without initial findings of chole stasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)  
 
AND  
 
3)  No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but 
not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other 
drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
 
Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational produc t, it is subsequently discove red that a study participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational produc t exposure, including during at 
least [ADDRESS_1229317] administration  (within [ADDRESS_1229318] ), the 
investigational product w ill be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for p articipant).   
 
The investigator  must immediately notify [EMAIL_555]  of this event via the  Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form  [provided upon request from BMS]  in accordance with SAE reporting procedures. 
The investigator must also immediately notify the Sponsor/Overall PI [CONTACT_12581].  
 
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and fol low-up must be performed on the 
participant.  Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, i ncluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, wher e applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pr egnancy Surveillance 
Form . 
 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study partici pant should be reported to BMS. 
Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. In order for  Sponsor 
or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the fem ale partner, the female partner 
must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.

SAE.  
 
Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted  during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, X -rays, 
and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_12695], should also be recorded as a non -serious or serious AE, as appropriate, an d reported 
accordingly.  
 
Expected Adverse Events for Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879776], the following AEs will 
be considered as expected  and meet the threshold of causal association (based on comprehensive 
medical evaluation considering the mechanism of action a nd temporal relationship after excluding other 
possible etiologies) defined by [CONTACT_104081][INVESTIGATOR_879777]:  
 
• Infusion -related reactions including drug hypersensitivity reactions  
• Immune -mediated adverse reactions such as immune -mediated colitis, immune -mediated 
hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis, immune -mediated thyroid disorders including 
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroiditis, immune -mediated 
pneumonitis, i mmune -mediated skin reactions including rash, pruritus, rash generalized, rash 
maculo -papular, erythema, pemphigoid, other immune -mediated reactions including myocarditis, 
adrenal insufficiency, uveitis, iritis, myositis.  
 
Expected Adverse Events fo r Radia tion Therapy  
Development of edema in the brain is common following brain radiation therapy and ma y be 
asymptomatic (solely a radiographic finding) or associated with mild, moderate or severe symptoms. 
Therefore, brain edema will be considered an expected e vent related to study therapy ( RT). Additionally, 
alopecia, fatigue, transient worsening of baseline neurological symptoms, seizures, skin irritation, 
neurocognitive dysfunction and cerebral radiation necrosis are all expected adverse events associated 
with radiation therapy.  
8.2 Evaluation of Severity and Causalit y 
8.2.1  Evaluation of Severit y 
The severity of AEs (including test findings classified as AEs) will be graded using the current version of 
the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse  Events (NCI -CTCAE) grading 
system. Adverse events not listed in the NCI -CTCAE, will be graded according to the following scale:  
 
1 (Mild):  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indi cated.  
 
2 (Moderate):  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
 
3 (Severe):  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536355]; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL**.  
 
4 (Life -threatening):  Life-threatening consequences ; urgent intervention indicated . 
 
5 (Death):  Death related to AE .

8.2.[ADDRESS_1229321] udy Drug : 
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], and will be a clinical decision 
based on all available information. The following question will be addressed:  
 
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been  caused by [CONTACT_5257]?  
 
The possible answers are:  
 
Not Related : There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_28811] : There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
 
The sponsor will request information to justify the causality assessment of SAEs, as needed.  
 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of pre vious therapy or a complication of a study procedure), 
the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
Appendix  [ADDRESS_1229322] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], a s appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Inform ation on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
record ed in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1229323]’s written 
informed consent to participate in the study, all AEs and SAEs, whether related or not related to study 
drug, are  to be continuously collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified 
procedures. The i nvestigator should report any SAE occurring after these aforementioned time periods, 
which is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
 
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or un til it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study 
treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they becom e 
serious. Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study 
drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.

The investigator (or designee) will seek information on AEs at each patient contact, and record all AEs 
that occur from the time the informed consent is signed until [ADDRESS_1229325] treatment will be collected from the time of the event until re solution of the event, 
or until the patient’s last study visit, whichever comes first. Serious adverse event information will be 
collected until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
 
Study treatment includes nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_879778].  
 
Investigators and the protocol sponsor must conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats 
and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible, but at a minimum those events 
that must be reported are those that are: 
 
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others (see definitions, section 8.1).  
 
Note: Immediately reportable criteria must be reported to the IRB at each annual review . 
 
Serious adverse event reportin g will begin in conjunction with the date of informed consent. Any SAEs 
occurring prior to study drug administration that the investigator believes may have been caused by a 
protocol procedure must be reported immediately to the Sponsor or its designee and  recorded on the 
case report form.   
 
All fatal or life -threatening adverse events must be immediately reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_16062] 
e-mail. Within 24 hours of the event, the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Form supplied by [CONTACT_879826]  (Overall PI ), who must then inform the NYUSoM  IRB, PCC CTO, and DSMC  
within [ADDRESS_1229326] to the 
event should be included with the SAE form. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient’s identity is 
protected and th e patient’s identifiers (as assigned at the time of study enrollment) are properly 
mentioned on any copy of source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the 
laboratory normal ranges.  
 
In case of accidental or intentional overdos e of study drug ( nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ), even if 
asymptomatic or not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, the overdose is to be reported to the Sponsor 
immediately (within 1 working day) using the AE and SAE forms supplied by [CONTACT_879827] . Overdose of study  
drug is defined  in Section 8.1 . 
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_28815], the Sponsor will report the adverse event to all regulatory authorities with jurisdiction 
over ongoing tr ials with the study drug and to all other investigators involved in clinical trials with the study 
drug. The investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate IRB, DSMC, and FDA.

Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to  submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than  5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applica ble investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.   
– Related to the research procedures : An event is related to the research procedures  if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than not to be 
caused by [CONTACT_28821].   
– Harmful : either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 
Other Reportable events:  
The following events  also require prompt reporting  to the IRB , though  no later than  5 working days : 
• Complaint of a research subject  when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or v iolations  (includes intentional and accidental/ unintentional deviations  
from the IRB approved protocol) for any of the following situations :  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm   
– the event has the potential to occur again  
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant  when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. (e.g. a nalysis indicates lower -than-expected response rate or a 
more severe or frequent side effect; Other re search finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; 
FDA labeling c hange or withdrawal from market)  
 
Reporting Process  
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the form: “ Reportable Event Form ” or

after completion of the study and  protocol -specified correlative biomarker research to be banked for future 
research studies. Future studies may include, but are not limited to, genetic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_18193], and molecular 
studies with the  overall goal of correlating any scientific findings with th e patients’ outcome to protocol 
therapy.   Leftover samples will be stored in a repository in the NYUSoM  Center for Biospecimen 
Research and Development (CBRD) and labeled with an assigned protocol -patient identification number 
without subject identifiers . The assigned protocol -patient identification numbers will be stored in a central 
database on a password -protected NYUSoM  server . This central database will contain the key to 
decoding assigned protocol -patient identification numbers used for sample labelin g and patient’s 
identifiable medical information (PHI).  Only the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_28700] . 
 
For each leftover research sample, key clinical information including, but not limited to, gender, age at 
diagnosis, tumor lo cation, prior treatment and histology will be abstracted from the medical record and 
recorded with the assigned protocol -patient identification number on a separate  database  from the central 
database containing the identifiable PHI . This de -identified  database  will also be on a password -protected 
NYUSoM  server and will be administered by [CONTACT_28778]. Only the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397] -approved study 
investigators with permission from the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_879782] -identified database.  
 
The de -ident ified samples and data may be made available to researchers at NYULH (NYU Langone 
Health), NYUSoM  (NYU Langone Medical Center), NYU SoM (NYU School of Medicine), and other 
NYUSoM  affiliates, as well as researchers outside of NYU. De -identified samples may be shared with for -
profit companies that are working with NYULH, NYUSoM , NYU SoM or other NYU LH affiliate researchers 
on a specific IRB-approved research project. De -identified specimens may also be made available to 
other researchers through research organizations whose mission focuses on the acquisition, 
authentication, production, preservation, development and/or distribution of data and materials for 
research in the life sciences, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, a collaboration between the  National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).  
 
Patients not agreeing to allow their leftover samples/data to be stored for future use will be able to fully 
participate in the study with no restrictions. The central database and de -identified database maintained 
for at least 5 years after termination of  the study.

10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
This study will be monitored according to the monitoring plan  detai led below .  The investigator will 
allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or 
other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related 
documents an d study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate 
space to conduct the monitoring visit.  A risk -based, data -driven monitoring approach will be used to verify 
data for this trial which will also include a centralized review of data for quality, trends, consistency and 
general safety review.  A quality assurance specialist will make regularly scheduled trips to the 
investigational site to review the progress of the trial, study data and site processes.  At each visit, t he 
monitor will review various aspects of the trial including, but not limited to: screening and enrollment logs; 
compliance with the protocol and with the principles of Good Clinical Practice; completion of case report 
forms; source data verification; stu dy drug accountability and storage; facilities and staff.  
 
During scheduled monitoring visits, the investigator and the investigational site staff must be available to 
meet with the quality assurance specialist in order to discuss the progress of the trial , make necessary 
corrections to case report form entries, respond to data clarification requests and respond to any other 
trial-related inquiries of the monitor. In addition to on -site monitoring visits, the Sponsor and/or 
representatives will also be rout inely reviewing data. Any queries identified through this review will be 
managed within the systems established for query resolution and tracking. Inquiries related to study 
conduct, which require further information or action will be discussed within the study team for appropriate 
and documented escalation plans. It is expected that response to data clarification requests and other 
trial-related inquiries will occur throughout the course of the study through regular communication with the 
site monitor, the  Sponsor or representatives, and review/entry of data into the electronic study database.  
 
At any time during the course of the study, representatives of the FDA and/or local regulatory agencies 
may review the conduct or results of the study at the investi gational site. The investigator must promptly 
inform BMS  of any audit requests by [CONTACT_21652], and will provide BMS  with the results of any such 
audits and with copi[INVESTIGATOR_118649].  
 
In accordance with HIPAA and  associated privacy regulations, a patient’s authorization to use personal 
identifiable health information may be required from each patient before commencement of research 
activities. This authorization document must clearly specify what parties will have  access to a patient’s 
personal health information, for what purpose and for what duration.  
 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also 
ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality ass urance reviewer is given access to all the above 
noted study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), 
and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
 
At the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center, all inve stigator -initiated protocols are subject to a standardized 
data and safety monitoring, which includes scientific peer review, IRB review and DSMC review as well as 
internal auditing.  
 
The review of AEs and trial conduct for this trial occurs at several le vels: 
 
(1) Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_28705], data manager and research team.  
 
(2) DSMC, quarterly

protocol violations, and current status of subjects as well as available research data.  
 
(4) In addition, the quality assu rance unit will  provide extensive monitoring, including real -time review 
of all eCRFs to ensure completeness and compliance with the protocol.  A first subject audit will be 
conducted within 4 weeks of enrollment. Additionally, monitoring of this trial wil l progress every 4-6 
weeks  thereafter  to verify adherence to the protocol; the completeness, accuracy and consistency of 
the data; and adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related mo nitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201]/EC , the sponsor, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, stu dy data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by g overnment 
regulatory authorities and applicable University compliance and quality assurance offices.  
11 Ethical Considerations

21. TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone ) and  free T4 (free t hyroxin e) are require at the indicated study timepoints . 
22. 12-lead ECG: A standard [ADDRESS_1229380] X -ray: Required only at screening  if not performed within 60 days prior to initiation of study treatment . 
24. Radiation therapy ( RT): Administered [ADDRESS_1229381] day (C1D8) of HFRT , adverse event assessment, a symptom -
directed physical exam and limited vital signs (temperature, resting blood pres sure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487])  
must be performed.  
25. Nivolumab  will be administered every 2 weeks  (±3 days of scheduled visit)  in an outpatient setting as an IV 
infusion . The nivolumab  dose will depend on individual body weight. The dose of nivolumab  must be adjusted 
each dose  for changes in body weight of ≥10%. Dose adjustments for changes in body weight of <10% will be at 
the discretion of the investigator.  Nivolumab administration wi ll continue for all subjects for 2 years  (96 weeks)  or 
until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, or the subject m eets another withdrawal criterion  per 
protocol .

C2D1, C4D1, C6D1, and C8D1 . 
36. After informed consent, if subjects undergo tumor resections or biopsies prior to treatment initiation, during the 
study period, or after progression on study drug, a small amoun t fresh surgical specimen (approximately 0.5 
cm2, approximately equivalent to amount required for a stereotactic needle bi opsy) will be collected for short -
term (6 -8 days) patient -derived organotypic tumor spheroid (PDOTS) culture and for dissociation into single cell 
suspensions for flow -cytometry -based immunoprofiling. Tumor sample will be collected in medium (DMEM) in a 
sterile cryotube and immediately transported on ice to [CONTACT_80974] -Kin Wong's laboratory at NYU Langone for 
immediate processing.

oncology) Criteria  
Tumor r esponse will be assessed every 8  weeks for patients treated on this study  using RANO criteria, 
however non -traditional iRANO criteria73,85 may be considered  for patient management as outlined  in the 
Study Procedures  (Section 6 ).  
 
Anti-Tumor Effect Definitions  
 
Evaluable for objective response . Only those participants who have measurable disease present at 
baseline (obtained within 14 days of cycle 1, day 1) scan and have received at least one dose of therapy 
will be considered evaluable for response. These participants will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease progression or 
die prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Measurable disease . Bi-dimensionally, contrast -enhancing, measurable lesions with clearly defined 
margins by [CONTACT_28842], with a minimal diameter of [ADDRESS_1229405] two to be followed before a par ticipant is entered on 
study. The remaining lesions will be considered non -measureable for the purpose of objective response 
determination. Unless progression is observed, objective response can only be determined when all 
measurable and non -measurable les ions are assessed.  
 
Non-measurable evaluable disease . Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not 
clearly defined, lesions with maximal diameter < 1cm.  
 
Response/Progression Categories  
 
Complete response (CR).  All of the following criteria must be met:  
 
1. Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non -measurable disease sustained for 
at least 4 weeks. In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this scan will be considered 
only stable disease.  
2. No new lesions *. 
3. All measurable and non -measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as 
baseline.  
4. Participants must be on no steroids or must not be on increased doses of steroids within 2 weeks 
of assessment relative to the dose taken at the time of the previous assessment  
5. Stable or improved non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions  
6. Stable or improved clinically, for clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline and recorded to 
be disease related  
 
Participants with non -measurable disease cannot h ave a complete response. The best response possible 
is stable disease.  
 
*See immunotherapy considerations below regarding new lesions  
 
Partial response (PR).  All of the following criteria must be met:  
 
1. Greater than or equal to 50% decrease compared to base line in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks. In 
the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this scan will be considered only stable disease.  
2. No progression of non -measurable  disease.  
3. No new lesions. * 
Nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + RT in MGMT  unmethylated GBM (s17 -[ZIP_CODE])  Page 98 
Version: 5/29/[ADDRESS_1229406] not be on increased doses of steroids within 2 weeks 
of assessment relative to the dose taken at the time of the previous assessment  
6. Stable or improved non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids 
compared to baseline scan.  
7. Stable or improved, for clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline and recorded t o be 
disease related clinically.  
 
Participants with non -measurable disease cannot have a partial response. The best response possible is 
stable disease.  
 
*See immunotherapy considerations below regarding new lesions  
 
Progressive disease (PD) . Any of the following criterion must be met:  
 
1. 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (over best 
response or baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids  
2. Patients who decrease corticosteroid use within 2 weeks of MRI assessment relative to the dose 
taken at the time of the previous assessment cannot be classified as having progressive disease 
and should be classified as non -evaluable.  
3. Any new enhancing measurable lesion * 
4. Clear clinical deteriorati on not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (e.g. seizures, 
medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infection, etc.). The 
definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the investigator but  it is recommended 
that a decline in the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) from [ADDRESS_1229407] 7 days, be considered neurologic det erioration, unless attributable to co -morbid events or 
changes in corticosteroid dose.  
5. Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition  
 
*See immunotherapy considerations below regarding new lesions  
 
Stable disease (SD) . All of the following criteria must be met:  
 
1. Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.  
2. All measurable and non -measurable sites must be assessed using the same techniques as 
baseline.  
3. Stable clinically.  
 
Unknown response status . Progressive disease has not been  documented and one or more measurable 
or non -measurable lesions have not been assessed.  
 
Special Considerations for Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
Appearance of new lesions is a criterion that defines progression of disease by [CONTACT_28843]. However, 
transient appeara nce of new enhancing lesions at either local or distant sites might occur in patients with 
neuro -oncological malignancies receiving immunotherapy . In such situations, careful radiological and 
clinical assessments are warranted. In some cases, new enhancing  lesions might represent immune 
responses directed against infiltrative brain tumor  cells.  In addition, Immune -related response criteria 
guidelines for non -brain tumor cancers state that early  increases in lesion size or new lesions do not 
define progressi ve disease unless further progressive changes are confirmed upon follow -up imaging, 
provided that patients do not have a clinical decline.[ADDRESS_1229408] response assessment metrics including RANO.

Confirmation of radiographic progression to define progressive disease  in iRANO : 
 
• iRANO recommends confirmation of disease progression on follow -up imaging 3 months after 
initial radiographic progression  if there is no new or substantially worsened neurological 
deficits that are not due to comorbid events or concurrent medication, and it is 6 months or less 
from starting immunotherapy.  
• Imaging within the 3 -month follow -up can be done as medically appropriate at the discretion of 
the treating clinician.  
• The appearance of new lesions 6 months or less from the  initiation of immunotherapy alone does 
not define progressive disease.  
• If follow -up imaging confirms disease progression, the date of actual progression should be back -
dated to the date of initial radiographic progression.  
 
Note on continuation of therapy pending confirmation of radiographic disease progression : iRANO  
recommends confirmation of disease progression on follow -up imaging 3 months after initial 
radiographic progression  if there is no new or substantially worsened neurolo gical deficits that are not 
due to comorbid events or concurrent medication, and it is 6 months or less from starting immunotherapy 
(see Appendix  3 for iRANO  criteria details). A decision of whether a patient should continue 
immunotherapy pending confirmat ion of radiographic disease progression should be established based 
on perceived benefits and risks. Continuation of immunotherapy may be considered pending follow -up 
imaging as long as subjects are deriving apparent clinical benefit with minimal and accep table toxic 
effects.  
 
By [CONTACT_22242], investigators may consider interrupting immunotherapy for subjects who need a substantial 
increase in corticosteroids ( i.e., >4 mg of dexamethasone or equivalent per day) for evolving symptoms 
associated with brain  edema  or who have more than mild treatment -related toxic effects such as at least 
grade [ADDRESS_1229410] of the subjects. As a general guidance, resumption of immunotherapy 
might be taken into account when systemic dexamethasone is decreased to 4 mg/day or less and the 
contrast -enhancing tumor  burden is classified as stable disease, partial res ponse, or complete response 
on a follow -up scan, or when relevant treatment -related toxic effects have resolved to grade 1 or less or 
pre-treatment baseline.  
 
The iRANO Response Criteria to be used in this study are summarized in the Table below .

Summ ary of iRANO Response Criteria  
 
 
 
 
Note : iRANO recommends confirmation of disease progression on follow -up imaging 3 months after initial 
radiographic progression if there is no new or substantially worsened neurological deficits that are not due 
to comorbid events or concurrent medication, and it is 6 months or less from starting immunotherapy. If 
follow -up imaging confirms disease progression, the date of actual progression should be back -dated to 
the date of initial radiographic progression. The ap pearance of new lesions 6 months or less from the 
initiation of immunotherapy alone does not define pr ogressive disease. FLAIR=fluid -attenuated inversion

Note : Typographical error in the Progressive Disease definition, the correct criteria shoul d be "increase" 
rather than "decrease".

These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_388379]. The guidance applies to all immuno -oncology (I -O) agents and regimens, 
including nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently e valuated according to standard 
medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately  treated.  
 
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology d rug-related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with  low-grade 
toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account  when switching to 
the equivalent d ose of oral corticosteroids.  
 
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or  therape utic 
procedure, is recommended.  
 
The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by [CONTACT_879838] l depend  on the 
immuno -oncology agent or regimen being used.  
 
The following pages include Management Algorithms to assist investigators in assessing and managing 
the following groups of AEs:  
 
• Gastrointestinal  
• Renal  
• Pulmonary  
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathy  
• Skin 
• Neurological  (non-brain edema related)  
 
Note : For Rules for managing  brain/intracranial edema , see Section [IP_ADDRESS].    
 
For subjects who are suspected to have study treatment -related symptomatic intracranial or brain 
edema at any time during the study, VEGF inhibition  (bevacizumab)  is preferred over corticosteroids  
for management of suspected intracranial or brain edema, ra diation necrosis, or intracranial hypertension, 
due to the risk that corticosteroids may suppress immune response against the tumor.  See section 
[IP_ADDRESS] for details on VEGF inhibition in this study.

4. Research MRI (sodium MRI)  
 
Research MRIs (sodium) will be performed on all subjects at baseline (within 21 days of study drug 
initiation ) and and at every response assessment timepoint on study treatment (i.e., every 8 weeks after 
study drug initiation, and then every 8 weeks thereafter). Research MRIs can be performed within 7 days 
(±7 days) of scheduled assessment.  Research MRIs must be performed at NYUSoM . Research MRIs will 
be performed on M RI equipment housed at the same NYU facility where patients obtain clinical MRIs . 
 
We will explore whether metabolic brain sodium (23Na) MRI (sodium MRI)  can distinguish between  tumor 
progression from immunotherapy -related treatment effect , i.e. "pseudoprogression" . Response 
assessment in immunotherapy  remains a challenge and this problem i s magnified in neuro -oncology,  
where standard response assessment criteria can be  unreliab le even for standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Abnormal 
contrast -enhancement on conve ntional brain MRIs can indicate either tumor progression or treatment -
related c ell death/necrosis  (pseudoprogression). C ell death/necrosis results in elevated tissue sodium 
concentration on 23Na (sodium) MRI, therefore sodium MRI has the potential to diffe rentiate between 
treatment -related cell death/necrosis versus tumor progression and serve as a non-invasive 
pharmacodynamic biomarker in GBM patients being treated with radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy.  
 
We will perform sodium MRI in all subjects, correla ting imaging findings with  conventional contrast -
enhanced MRI and histopathology  if available (for patients who require surgery during or after the study 
and provide optional tumor biopsy consent). Sodium MRI  can be implemented in clinical MRI scanners 
and does not require intravenous contrast agents.  
 
Background :  Metabolic brain sodium (23Na) MRI is based on the direct detection of endogenous sodium 
ions (Na+) from salt in brain tissues,  instead of water protons (1H) as in standard MRI. Cells in healthy 
tissues maintain a large sodium concentration gradient  between the intracellular and extracellular 
compartments, and any impairment of energy metabolism or insult to the cell  membrane integrity leads to 
an increase of intracellular sodium concentration. Sodium concentrations are therefore very  sensitive to 
changes in the metabolic state of tissues and integrity of cell membranes.  
 
Cell damage induced by [CONTACT_879840] (the steady -state 
maintenance o f asymmetric ion concentrations inside and outside  cells) in the abnormal cells that 
constitute the malignant tumor, through changes in their pH, membrane depolarization, and  dysregulation 
of trans -membrane ion transporters (such as the Na+/K+ pump, or the  Na+/H+ and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers),

Version: 5/29/[ADDRESS_1229430] udy 
sponsor  leading  ultimately to cell death. As a consequence, large variations of Na+ concentrations inside the cells 
are induced, which can be  quantified with 23Na MRI in vivo .  
 
Measuring variations of both intracellular sodium co ncentration C 1 (due to loss of ion  homeostasis) and 
extracellular volume fract ion α 2 (due to cell death ) with 23Na MRI may provide new  metabolic information 
on the early effects of therapy on brain tumors, as reporte d by [CONTACT_409637] (references be low).

Sodium MRI Protocol : 23Na MRI will be acquired on a PRISMA clinical scanner, with a house -made dual 
tuned 1H/23Na radiofrequency coil. The sodium protocol consists of two 3D whole -brain acquisiti ons  
of durations: 8 min (for whole  sodium in the brain), and 12 min (with suppression of the sodium signal in 
CSF and in the extracellular compartment). Sodium image  resolution is [ADDRESS_1229431] MPRAGE (5 -6 min) and/or FLAIR (5 -6 min) are added for tumor detection  and coregistartion 
with 23Na data. Allow about 5 min for shimming at the beginning of the scanning session. Total duration is  
about 30 -35 min. Sodium images reconstruction is performed offline in Matlab (2 -3 min). Post -processing 
to create the 3D brain maps of C 1 and α 2 is also performed in Matlab.  
 
Statistical considerations : Imaging features of tumor cell death and inflammation will be defined as 
increased contrast -enhancement on conventional MRI, and a statistically significant elevation of mean 
tissue  sodium concentration (TSC) by [CONTACT_2669] 25% on 23Na MRI.

associated neoantigens, and T cell receptor ( TCR) diversity.  
▪ RNA -Seq to assess expression of predicted mutation -associated neoantigens.

expression [e.g.  lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), indoleamine -2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and 
T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM3)], and PD -1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes

C. Specific Planned Analyses  
 
1. Tumor Tissue Whole -Exome Deep Sequencing  
Objectives : To assess the association between PFS6 and :  
A) Tumor Mutation Burden ;  
B) Total predicted neoantigen load;  
C) T cell receptor (T CR) diversity  
A) Tumor Mutation Burden : Recently, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden and hypermutation 
phenotype have been associated with clinical benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD -1 
inhibitors.86-89 We will c ompare the association of tumor mutation burden  between tumors that achieve 
1yr-OS and those that do not.  We will analyze archival GBM tissue from all patients with whole -exome 
deep sequencing.  
B) Total predicted neoantigen load : We will compare the potential mutation -associated neoantigen load 
between tumors that achieve 1yr-OS and th ose that do not.  Using somatic exome data, we will assess 
the hypermutant cases for their immunogenic potential in the context of each patient's major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype.  To assess the potential for mutant peptide binding, somatic  
exome data combined with each individual patient’s class I HLA haplotype will be applied to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_879794],90,91 which provides an estimate of the total number of mutation -associated 
neoantigens in each tumor.  
C) T cell receptor ( TCR) diversity :  One strategy to  reverse the suppression of tumor immune 
responses involves the use of radiation therapy (RT), which has been shown to augment anti -cancer 
immune responses and enhance the efficacy of immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_879795] . Preclinical studies examining combined radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibition indicate that 
each activate mostly non -redundant immune stimulating mechanisms and the major contribution of 
radiotherapy appears to be increasing T -cell receptor (TCR) diversity . RT induces major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class I presentation, increases antigen presentation, and increases cytotoxic T cell (CTL) 
recognition of irradiated cells35,36 and enhances the diversity of the TCR repertoire of the expanded 
peripheral T cell cl ones.37   
We will characterize the base line pre -treatment intratumoral TCR diversity and use intratumoral TCR 
diversity data (e.g., the top [ADDRESS_1229433] frequent intratumoral TCR clonotypes) to examine TCR clonotype 
frequencies in pre -treatment (Baseline)  and post -treatment (C2D1 ) blood samples.  U sing combined 
tumor tissue and pre -treatment (baseline) blood, we will generate whole -exome sequencing data and 
analyze frequencies/counts of TCR clonotypes to estimate the TCR diversity.  The Shannon’s diversity 
index (DI)92 normalized to the number of reads (DI= –Σ(pi[INVESTIGATOR_28720])/ln n, where n is the number of clones, pi [INVESTIGATOR_879796], and sigma is summed from i = 1 to i = n) was calculated for each 
sample. This gives a value between [ADDRESS_1229434] -treatment tum or tissue  is available : Additionally, if patients undergo tumor resections or 
biopsies during study therapy or after progression on study , we will whole -exome sequence multiple 
spatially distinct regions, if possible, of the progressive tumor to determine whether alterations in the 
clonal hypermutation distribution, TCR clonotype  distribution  or predicted neoantigens have occurred.  
 
2. Tumor Tissue RNA -Seq 
Nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + RT in MGMT  unmethylated GBM (s17 -[ZIP_CODE])  Page 115 
Version: 5/29/[ADDRESS_1229435] udy 
sponsor  Objective : To use  tumor tissue RNA -Seq data to e valuate the fraction of predicted mutation -associated 
neoantigens derived from somatic whole -exome sequencing data that is expressed and assess the 
association of PFS6 and number of expressed mutation -associated neoantigens . 
Expression of predicted mutation -associated neoantigens :  We will estimate the propor tion of 
predicted mutation -associated neoantigens that are expressed by [CONTACT_16638] -Seq and compare the expressed 
predicted mutation -associated neoantigen load between tumors that achieve PFS6 and those that do not.  
Total RNA will be extracted from FFPE tumor tis sue using RNA extraction kits, treated to remove genomic 
DNA, quantified, and analyzed for integrity. RNA -Seq libraries will be prepared using standard protocols 
to purify poly -adenylated mRNA, generate double -stranded cDNA and ligate adapters and then sub mitted 
for next -generation sequencing  
Clonality of mutation -associated expressed neoantigens : If enough tumor tissue is available to 
assess distinct regions of an individual tumor, we will perform RNA -Seq analyses on different regions of 
each tumor to asse ss the clonality of expressed neoantigens.  
 
3. Tumor Tissue Immunohistochemistry (IHC)  
Objectives :  To assess the association of PFS6 and :  
A) Tumor tissue PD -L1 expression,  
B) baseline density and subtype of TIL populations.  
A) Tumor cell programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) expression :  We will assess the association of 1yr-
OS with baseline membranous and diffuse tumor cell PD -L1 expression.  Tumor PD -L1 has been 
associated with  response to PD -1 inhibitor therapy in studies of other solid cancers (see Rationale and 
Background) however the association of tumor tissue PD -L1 expression and response to anti -PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1 therapy is unknown.  
IHC staining of paraffin -embedded sec tions for PD -L1 will be performed on archived formalin -fixed 
paraffin -embedded archival tumor spec imens as previously described.93  The IHC assay for PD -L1 will 
incorporate an anti –PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 28 -8), which was developed on an 
automated platform by [CONTACT_28863]. Consecutive sections will be stained for PD -L1 and a 
negative control reagent to control for nonspecific s taining. A sample will be deemed PD -L1 positive for 
membranous staining if ≥5% of tumor cells, in a minimum of [ADDRESS_1229436] observable 
PD-L1–positive staining at any intensity. Specificity of the 28 -8 antibody clone has been exte nsively 
validated previously.93 
In addition, we will explore the association of T reg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) levels in tumor tissue and in 
circulation at baseline.  Circulating T reg levels will be quantified as below, and tumor tissues will be stained 
for CD4 and FoxP3 to assess infiltrating T regs.  
B) Tumor Infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) :  We will assess the density and subtype of TILs in baseline 
pre-treatment FFPE tumor tissue by [CONTACT_28864]3, CD4, CD8, CD56, FoxP3, and PD -
1. 
If Post -treatment tumor tissue  is available : Additionally, if patients undergo tumor resections or 
biopsies during study therapy or after progression on study , we will assess for changes in tumor tissue 
PD-L1 expression and TIL density a nd subtype after study treatment .

B) Characterization of baseline cytokine profiles in patient -derived organotypic tumor spheroid (PDOTS) 
short term culture system92,93 and change in cytokine profiles after immune checkpoint blockade.  
 
A) Flow cytometry -based immunoprofiling of dissociated, single cell suspensions :  A small portion 
of freshly resected tumor tissue  (0.5 cm2, equivalent to 4 stereotactic needle biopsy specimens) placed in 
a sterile cryotube  in media (DMEM ) will be taken  immediately on ice to [CONTACT_80974] -Kin Wong's lab at 
NYULH.  In the lab, half the tumor specimen will be immediately processed into single cell suspensions 
for flow cytometry -based immunoprofiling  in the Immune Core at NYU. The other half of the specimen will 
be used for objective B below.  
 
B) Characterization of baseline cytokine profiles in patient -derived organotypic tumor spheroid 
(PDOTS) short term culture system92,93 and change in cytokine profiles after immune checkpoint 
blockade :  Half of the fresh surgical tumor s pecimen will be used immediately  for short -term (6 -8 days) 
ex vivo  PDOTS culture . PDOTS cultures isolated from human tumors retain autologous lymphoid and 
myeloid cell populations,  thus incorporating features of the tumor microenvironment,  in short -term 3 -
dimensional microfluidic culture. 92,93 The PDOTS microfluidic culture  system was developed by [CONTACT_879841] -Kin 
Wong, MD, PhD, and these experiments will be performed in his lab at NYULH.  Cell su spensions from 
the fresh surgical specimens  will be  prepared and  loaded into 3D microfluidic devices .  After 3 days, 
PDOTS culture fresh medium +/ - immune checkpoint blockers (anti -PD-L1 and anti -CTLA4 antibodies) 
will be added. After further  3-[ADDRESS_1229438] -immune checkpoint blockade  cytokine and chemokine profiling  using Luminex arrays . 
 
All fresh surgical tumor specimen collected will be used for these specific purposes only. No cell lines will 
be generated and true genetic testing will  not be performed.  
5. Peripheral Blood Flow Cytometry  
Objectives :  To assess the associatio n of 1yr-OS and baseline level of T regs or MDSCs within PBMCs or 
their change after study treatment initiation  
Circulating T regs and MDSCs in PBMCs : We will test whether the baseline level of circulating regulatory T 
cells (Tregs) or myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)  within peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs ) or their change at C2D1 are associated with 1yr-OS.  In GBM  patients, T reg and MDSC 
populations have been reported to facilitate tumor immune evasion.  T regs have been found  an increased 
fraction of the circulating CD4 compartment in GBM patients and correlates with proliferati ve defects 
among CD4+ T cells.94  MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of immature myeloid -derived cells that are 
capable of suppressing the immune system and are increased in the blood and tumor tissue of patients 
with various tumors.  Recently, MDSCs were found to be increased in the blood of GBM patients compare 
to healthy controls, while a subset of MDSCs [polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN -MDSCs)] were highly 
prevalent in GBM tumor tissue.[ADDRESS_1229439] research blood drawn at baseline and at C2D1  for flow cytometry studies. 30 mL of 
(EDTA purple top  tube) whole blood will be drawn and immediately processed at the study sites using 
Ficoll technique  for isolation of PBMCs.  Processed study samples will be frozen and stored until shipment 
to NYUSoM  for analysis.  In melanoma patients treated with nivolumab , Tregs decreased in responders and 
stable patients and significantly increased in non -respo nders at 12 weeks.93  At the Immune Monitoring  
Core at NYUSoM , PBMCs will be  thawed and  analyzed by [CONTACT_4133].  Functional and phenotypic 
markers of T cells will be evaluated by [CONTACT_28867], except 
where indicated.  PBMCs will then be stained with Live/Dead  violet dye (Invitrogen) to gate on live cells.  
Then, cells will be assessed for expression of CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, PD -1 (MIH4 from eBioscience), 
and CTLA -4.

sponsor  Tregs will be defined as cells with CD4+CD25+CD127lowFoxP3+ (eBioscience). MDSCs will be defined  as 
MHC class II negative, CD33+, CD15+ cells as previously described.[ADDRESS_1229441], -DP, -DQ and CD15 (Becton Dickinson).  Data will be acquired on an LSR 
II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with Flowjo software (TreeStar).   
 
5. Peripheral Blood Deep Sequencing  
Objective s: Peripheral blood will be collected for deep sequencing for the purposes of:  
A) Sequencing normal (germline) DNA to identify tumor somatic mutations  
B) Assessing for alterations  in TCR clonotype frequencies in pre - and post -treatment blood  
C) Exploring the potential of identifying circulating tumor D NA in patients with glioblastoma  
B) TCR clonotype frequencies (All subjects) :  We will determine whether study treatment results in 
peripheral expansion of TCR clonotypes found in TIL clones identified by [CONTACT_28868] -exome 
sequencing and alters the TCR repertoire of the most expanded TCR clonotypes. Previous studies 
indicate radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition activate non -redundant immune mechanisms and 
the major contribution of radiotherapy may be increasing TCR diversity and s hapi[INVESTIGATOR_879797] T cell clones.37  DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood cells and analyzed 
with whole -exome deep sequencing to analyze frequencies/counts of the top [ADDRESS_1229442] frequent TCR 
clonotypes identified in baseline tumor tissue.  
C) Circulating tu mor DNA in patients with  GBM : We will sequence cell -free fractions of blood to high 
depths to attempt to detect circulating mutant TERT  allele and also attempt to compare the changes in 
the allele fraction between baseline and post -treatment blood.  
All subjects will have research bloo d drawn at baseline and at C2D1 . 10 mL of whole blood in EDTA 
tubes (purple top tubes) will be drawn at each timepoint and processed. From the whole blood sample, a 
1mL aliquot will be immediately taken and frozen separately  in a cryovial.  The remaining sample will be 
spun to separate the plasma, buffy coat, and cells.  The buffy coat and plasma will each be separated 
and placed in cyrovials for freezing. Samples will be batch -shipped to the NYUSoM  Center for 
Biospecimen Res earch and Development (CBRD) .  DNA will be extracted and analyzed with whole -
exome deep sequencing to analyze frequencies/counts of the top [ADDRESS_1229443] frequent TCR clonotypes 
identified in baseline tumor tissue.

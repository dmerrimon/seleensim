(7).  Colonoscopy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_468373], however 
there is little data to support this  practice.  Throughout the colonoscopy, patients are often re -positioned in a 
variety of ways (shifted into a prone or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) to facilitate passage of the endoscope.   There are a 
number of patient characteristics that are known to make colonosco py more technically challenging 
necessitating positional changes, including female gender, prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, and BMI > 30.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_306046], there is minimal data in the literature to guide endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_468374]. It is estimated that 35% of 
adult men and 40.4% of adult women were identified during recent a recent study to fall into the “obese” 
category with BMI ≥30 (8). Patient repositioning and application of pressure to the abdomen, another 
frequently used technique, can be particularly difficult for endoscopy staff to employ in a sedated, obese 
patient (9).   The time from starting the colonoscopy until the colonoscope  is advanced to the cecum, cecal 
intubaton time, is standardly recorded during colonoscopy. Longer cecal intubation times reflect more 
technically challenging procedures.   
 
Several published studies investigating the Trendelenburg position (1) suggested d ecreased cecal intubation 
time, particularly in patients with significant sigmoid diverticulosis. However this technique revealed the 
increased occurrence of transient oxygen desaturation in obese patients which limited its use in this 
population.  The rig ht later decubitus position is frequently used to help advanced of the endoscope within the 
cecum or into the terminal ileum (2). In particular, women and patients who have previously undergone 
abdominal surgery seemed to benefit from right lateral decubit us position with improved cecal intubation 
times (4).  
The prone position has been shown to successfully reduce ileal intubation times in a study involving 150 
patients (3) regardless of BMI.  
One study in particular (5) completed in 2012 at the North [LOCATION_007] VA Medical center showed patients with a 
BMI of >[ADDRESS_599973] related complications.  It has been postulated that the 
prone pos ition may actually be associated with a lower risk of obstructive apnea during sedation since the 
tongue is less likely to fall back (6).  
Cecal intubation time is frequently used as a target metric for improvement in endoscopy as a shorter 
procedure in tur n reduces length of time sedation is required.  
Objectives/Hypothesis  
Prone position of both male and female patients with BMI > 30 will be less technically difficult in the prone 
position than in the more commonly used left lateral decubitus position.  This will result in a more comfortable

 patient experience as well as a reduced procedure times resulting in decreased need for seda tion.  There is no 
expected difference in complication rate for either position.

Statistical Considerations  
1. Is stratification/randomization involved?  
Yes – Randomization only  
 
►IF YES, describe the stratification/ randomization scheme.  
 
Study participants w ill be randomized to either left lateral decubitus or prone position at the time of 
colonoscopy. Randomization order will be computer generated with allocation concealment using sequentially 
numbered, sealed envelopes. Patients and co -investigators performing col onoscopy will not be blinded.  
 
►IF YES, who will generate the randomization scheme?

2.  What are the statistical considerations for the protocol?  
-Prospective Randomized trial.  
-Enrolled participants will be ran domized to colonoscopy in the left lateral decubitus or prone position.  
-The primary endpoint is cecal intubation time.  Cecal intubation time is standardly recorded during all 
colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Null hypotheses is that there will be no difference in cecal i ntubation times between the [ADDRESS_599978] size of 60 seconds difference between the 2 groups (left later decubitus vs prone 
position) with a standard deviation of 120 seconds for the average colonoscopy = ~125 total study participants  
- 63 per group (alpha = 0.05 / type I error rate).  Type II error rare: 0.2. Goal to enroll [ADDRESS_599979] for 
variability in cecal intubation time.  
 
-Two secondary endpoints will be measured: complication rate in each group as well as sedation use.  
-Complica tions during the procedure will be noted and charts will be reviewed for complications occurring 
within [ADDRESS_599980] as mg of fentanyl and mg of 
midazolam.

4.  What is your plan for primary variable analysis?  
 
T test for comparison of mean cecal intubation time in each group.  
 
5.  What is your plan for secondary variable analysis?  
 
T test for comparison of mean amount of sedation used in  each group as well as number of adverse events/ 
complications  
 
6. Have you been working with a statistician in designing this protocol? No 
 
7.  Will data from multiple sites be combined during analysis?  no 
Study Procedures -Biomedical Research  
 
1.  What will be done in this protocol?    
Patients that have been scheduled for colonoscopy will undergo chart review by [CONTACT_22888] -investigator (GI 
attening) scheduled to perform the colonoscopy or the  GI fellow. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be 
invited to participate at the time consent is obtained for the colonoscopy.  Participants will then be 
randomized to one of two colonoscopy starting positions.      
After randomization, patients will begin the colonoscopy in either th e prone position or le ft lateral decubitus 
position.   
Adjusting patient starting position to the prone rather than left lateral decubitus position is not expected to 
result in any additional risk to the patient beyond the standard risks related to colonoscopy. It is common 
practice to re -position the patient during endoscopy (including supi[INVESTIGATOR_191625]) and some 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_468375], although there is no estimate in 
the literature as to the prevalence of this practice . 
 
No additional interventions will be performed for research purposes.   
During the colonoscopy, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_468376], as usual, to adjust patient position as needed to 
complete the procedure.  Cecal intubation time, amount of sedation used, an d any intra -procedural 
complications (hypoxia, hypotension, etc) will be recorded for data analysis.  This information is standardly 
recorded in the procedure report in the patient’s medical record. The study will not affect any interventions 
performed dur ing the colonoscopy such as polyp removal or biopsies as, clinically indicated.   Per endoscopy 
unit protocol, patients will be monitored in the recovery area and discharged home with supervision.  The 
study requires no further direct patient interaction a fter the colonoscopy is completed.  Charts will be 
reviewed at 30 days to assess for any delayed and unexpected complications.

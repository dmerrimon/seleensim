Trial title  
A phase III, randomi sed, open-label, comparative safety and efficacy trial of intravenous iron 
isomaltoside (Monofer®) and iron sucrose in subjects with iron deficiency anaemia and non -
dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease  
Trial design 
The trial is a randomi sed, comparative, open -label trial. Subjects with iron deficiency ana e-
mia (IDA) and non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD -CKD) will be rando m-
ised 2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:  
 Group A: iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos,  Holbæk, Denmark)  
 Group B: iron sucrose (Venofer®) 
Phase of trial 
The trial is a phase III trial. 
Background  
IDA is often associated with many chronic diseases such as renal diseases, cancer, infections, 
chronic heart failure, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
Subjects are often treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in order to stimulate 
erythropoi esis. This therapy requires rapid mobilisation of iron reserves in order to meet the 
demands of new red blood cell (RBC) growth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_317057], 
the demands of this therapy can outstrip the body’s ability to mobilise iron stor es resulting in 
“functional iron deficiency”.  
IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and  
treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of no r-
mal haemoglobin (Hb) concent rations and iron stores. Iron replacement can be accomplished 
by [CONTACT_317088]. The KDIGO guidelines recommend either treatment with 
intravenous (IV) iron or alternatively [ADDRESS_390081] . Oral 
iron can be inadequately absorbed in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) subjects and is often as-
sociated with gastro -intestinal adverse effects and therefore IV iron might improve the sub-
ject compliance and treatment success . 
Iron sucrose is a widely used parenteral iron product and therefore this product has been ch o-
sen as comparator in t his trial which is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV iron 
isomaltoside compared to IV iron sucrose in subjects with IDA and NDD -CKD. 
Objectives  
The primary safety objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of IV iron isomaltoside  
compared to iron sucrose  in subjects with IDA and NDD -CKD. 
The primary efficacy objective of the trial is to evaluate and compare the effect of iron iso-
maltoside  to iron sucrose in its ability to increase Hb in subjects with IDA and NDD -CKD. 
The secondary efficacy objective of the trial is to evaluate and compare the effect of iron

Endpoints  
The co-primary safety endpoint is serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction starting on or 
after the first dose of randomised treatment (i.e. treatment -emergent). The hypersensitivity 
terms are defined as standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  query (SMQ) 
terms (including four additional terms) in Appendix A.  
 
The adverse events (AEs) will be adjudicated in a bli nded fashion by [CONTACT_10981] C linical 
Endpoint Adjudication C ommittee  (CEAC) (described in a separate adjudication charter ). 
The specified definition of adjudicated endpoints will be given in the charter . 
The secondary safety endpoints are the following:  
 Composite cardiovascular AEs starting on or after the first dose of randomised trea t-
ment (i.e. treatment -emergent). The adjudicated composite AEs  includes the follo w-
ing: 
 Death due to any cause  
 Non-fatal myocardial infarction  
 Non-fatal stroke  
 Unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Congestive heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317058]  
 Arrhythmias  
 Hypertension 
 Hypotension  
 
The AEs will be adjudicated in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_317089] (described 
in a separate adjudication charter ). The specified definition of adjudicated endpoints 
is given in Appendix B.  
 Time to first composite cardiovascular safety AE  
 S-phosphate < 2 mg/dL at any time from baseline to week s 1, 2, 4, or 8 
 
In addition, physical examinations and measurements of vital signs, height, weight, electr o-
cardiogram (ECG), and safety laboratory parameters will be measured as part of stan dard 
safety assessments.  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint is change in Hb from baseline to week 8.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are the following:  
 Hb increase of ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline to week s 1, 2, 4, or 8 
 Time to change in Hb ≥ 1 g/dL 
 Hb level of > 12 g/dL at any time from week 1  to week 8

Trial treatment  
The subjects will be dosed with either iron isomaltoside  (group A) or iron sucrose (group B) 
as described below.  
In group A, iron isomaltoside  will be administered as a single IV infusion of 1000 mg at 
baseline diluted in 100 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride and given over approximately 20 min utes 
(50 mg iron/min).  
In group B, iron sucrose will be administered as 200 mg undiluted IV push injections over

up to a maximum of five times (1000 mg) within the first two weeks starting at baseline.  A 
cumulative dose of 1000 mg is recommended.  The cumulative dose of iron sucrose should be 
specified and documented at baseline.  
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued . 
Sample size calculations  
The co-primary endpoints are treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious 
hypersensitivity AEs and change in Hb from baseline to week 8.  
Safety: 
Data from previous trials conducted with iron isomaltoside suggests that the incidence of 
treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hyperse nsitivity AEs for an IDA pop u-
lation can be expected to be approximately 1 % (IBD -01/IBD-02/CIA-01/PP-01: n = 3/341 = 
0.9 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.2 %; 2.5 %), and similar for iron sucrose (CKD -03: n 
= 1/114 = 0.9 %, 95 % CI: 0.0 %; 4.8 %). A com mon incidence of 1.5 % will be assumed for 
the current trial.  
As these are relatively rare events, an incidence of 0 % for placebo is assumed. Iron is o-
maltoside should be at most 50 % worse than the difference between iron sucrose and plac e-
bo, correspondin g to a maximum relative risk of 2 (1.5 %/(1.5 % -0 %)2). 
This trial will primarily assess the risk of the test drug under investigation. Arguing back 
from a relative risk of 2 gives that the upper bound of the 95 % CI for the incidence of treat-
ment-emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hypersensitivity AEs should be at most 3 % 
(2×1.5 %) for the iron isomaltoside treatment group.  
Efficacy: 
IDA-301 was a double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to compare the safety and 
efficacy of 1000 mg IV feru moxytol to placebo. In this trial, 608 subjects were treated with 
ferumoxytol and 200 received placebo. The change in Hb from baseline to week 5 was the 
primary efficacy endpoint for the European Union regulators, and one of the secondary en d-
points for U.S . regulators. The mean change was 2.6 g/dL (standard deviation (SD): 1.5) for 
IV ferumoxytol and 0.1 g/dL (SD: 0.9) for placebo. The estimated treated effect of IV fe r-
umoxytol (i.e. the difference between ferumoxytol and placebo) was estimated to be appro x-
imately 2.5 g/dL with a 95 % CI ranging from 2.3 to 2.7 g/dL. The point estimate will be 
used as estimate of the treatment effect. Preserving 80 % of this effect is believed to provide 
reasonable assurance that iron isomaltoside is efficacious. Hence, the non-inferiority margin 
is set to (1 -0.8) × 2.5 g/dL ~ 0.5 g/dL.  
Power: 
The significance level is set to 5 %. With n = 1000 in the iron isomaltoside treatment group, 
there is 88 % power for demonstrating that the upper bound of the 95 % CI of the incidence 
of treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hypersensitivity AEs  is less than 3 
%. And with n = 500 in the iron sucrose treatment group, assuming no difference between the 
treatment groups, and assuming a common SD = 1.5 g/dL, there is 100 % po wer for demo n-
strating non -inferiority of the change in Hb from baseline to week 8, using a non -inferiority

Confidential    Page 9 of 53 margin of -0.5 g/dL.  
This yields a total power for demonstrating both co -primary endpoints of 88 % in the trial.  
The IDA-03 trial will run in parallel with this trial and the sample size is the same, yielding a 
total of 2000 subjects to be treated with iron isomaltoside and 1000 with iron sucrose. In a d-
dition to the efficacy and safety analyses performed for this trial alone, an eff icacy and safety 
assessment will be performed for the two trials combined. This is briefly described in Section 
15.6. 
Subjects will be stratified according to current eGFR ( <46, 46-<60, or 60 -<90 
mL/min/1.73m2) and baseline cardiovascular risk (history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or 
congestive heart failure ; yes/no). 
Statistical analyses  
The co-primary safety endpo int will be analysed by [CONTACT_317096] -sided 95 % CI 
of the incidence of treatment -emergent serious and/or severe non -serious hypersensitivity 
AEs in the iron isomaltoside  treatment group. If the upper bound of the 95 % CI is < 3 %, the 
safety objective has been met.  
The co-primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML)-based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. All subjects in the 
intention to treat (ITT) analysis set with p ost baseline Hb data will be included with their o b-
served data. For subjects without post baseline Hb values will have change from baseline set 
to [ADDRESS_390086] -baseline visit.  The model will include the fixed, categorical effects of 
treatment ( iron isomaltoside  and iron sucrose), week, treatment -by-week interaction, strata, 
as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline Hb value and baseline Hb -by-week 
interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the within -subject 
errors. If, unexpectedly, this analysis fails to converge, the following structures will be a p-
plied, in the following order; first -order ante -dependence, heterogeneous compound sy m-
metry, compound symmetry. The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to  estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. The primary comparisons will be the contrasts between iron 
isomaltoside  and iron sucrose at week [ADDRESS_390087]. The estimated mean difference ba sed on this model will be r e-
ported with two -sided symmetric 95 % CI, and if the lower bound of the 95 % CI is > -0.5 
g/dL, the efficacy objective has been met.  
All the statistical analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan.  
Ethical aspects  
The trial will follow International Conference on Harmonization -Good Clinical Practice  
(ICH-GCP) guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration, and all subjects will sign informed co n-
sent before inclusion.  
The protocol will be submitted to relevant authorities ( Institutional Review Board  
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) , Competent Authorities , and Data Protection 
Agencies) according to local regulatory requirements prior to trial initiation.

2.1 Background 
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common problem associated with many chronic diseases 
such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, infections, chronic heart failure (CHF), and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is also common in pregnant women and occurs in the 
elderly. IDA is primarily caused by [CONTACT_317098], poor diet, or impaired gastrointestinal 
iron absorption. The major causes of anaemia in CKD subjects are iron and erythropoietin 
deficiencies and a decreased responsiveness to the actions of erythropoietin [Mehdi & Toto, 
2009].  
Subjects are often treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in order to stimulate 
erythropoiesis. This therapy requires rapid mobilisation of iron reserves in order to meet the 
demands of new red blood cell (RBC) growth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_317057], 
the demands of this therapy can outstrip the body’s ability to mobilise iron stores resulting in 
“functional iron deficiency” [Hotta et al., 1991]. 
IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and 
treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of no r-
mal haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and iron stores. Iron replacement can be accomplished 
by [CONTACT_317088]. The KDIGO guidelines recommend either treatment with in-
travenous (IV) iron or alternatively 1-3 months of oral iron therapy in non -dialysis-dependent 
chronic kidney disease ( NDD-CKD) patients with IDA based on the severity of iron deficien-
cy, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior 
iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost [KDIGO guideline, 2012]. Oral iron can be inad e-
quately absorbed in CKD patients [KDIGO guideline, 2012] and is often associated with ga s-
tro-intestinal adverse effects and therefore IV iron might improve the patient compliance and 
treatment success [Charytan et al., 2005]. 
Iron sucrose (Venofer®) is a widely used parenteral iron products and therefore this product 
has been chosen as comparator in this trial which is planned to evaluate the safety and effic a-
cy of IV iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos, Holbæk, Denmark) compared to 
IV iron sucrose in subjects with IDA and NDD-CKD. 
2.2 Iron Isomaltoside  
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C nuclear magnetic re s-
onance (NMR) of repeating α- (1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally 
different from the branched dextran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside 
[ADDRESS_390095] been chemically 
modified to further reduce the potential for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, iso-
maltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 2011]. 
Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
and rapid dosing.

eliminated by [CONTACT_8212] [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection containing 100 mg iron/ml 
with pH between 5.0 and 7.0.    
2.3 Trial Rationale 
Among the various formulations of parenteral iron available on the market, iron isomaltoside 
may allow flexibility in terms of high and rapid dosing. The use of parenteral iron, especially 
in high doses, may result in better compliance, fewer visits to the medical practitioner, and 
overall improvement in QoL. 
Thus, this trial is planned to compare the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside with another 
parenteral iron preparation (iron sucrose) in subjects with IDA and NDD-CKD.

Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection/infusion containing 100 mg 
iron/mL with pH between 5.0 and 7.0. 
Iron sucrose 
Iron sucrose (Venofer®) is an aqueous complex of polynuclear iron (III)-hydroxide in sucrose 
for IV use. Iron sucrose injection has a molecular weight of approximately 34,000-60,000 
Daltons [Venofer® prescribing information ([LOCATION_003]), 01/2014, local Summary of Product Cha r-
acteristics (SmPC), or local product monography].  
Iron sucrose is provided as a brown, sterile solution in 5 mL single dose vials (100 mg el e-
mental iron per 5 mL) and 10 mL single dose vials (200 mg elemental iron per 10 mL). Iron 
sucrose must be administered intravenously by [CONTACT_317107] 2-5 
minutes in this trial, which is an approved treatment course.  
10.2 Dosage, Administration and Blinding of Trial Drug 
The subjects will be randomised 2 :1 to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 Group A, iron isomaltoside will be administered as a single IV infusion of 1000 mg at 
baseline diluted in 100 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride and given over approximately 20 
minutes (50 mg iron/min).  
 Group B, iron sucrose will be administered as [ADDRESS_390112] practice or phys i-
cian choice up to a maximum of five times (1000 mg) within the first two weeks star t-
ing at baseline. A cumulative dose of 1000 mg is recommended. The cumulative dose

12 ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined in the ICH-GCP guideline as “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not ne c-
essarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). An AE can therefore be 
any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A clin-
ically significant abnormal laboratory finding is also regarded as an AE if the effect is unf a-
vourable for the subject. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review the laboratory test

eral, a clinically significant laboratory value which suggests disease progression and/or r e-
quires active management is considered as an AE. Clinical significant efficacy laboratory p a-
rameters (including related parameters) are not to be recorded as AEs unless these are consid-
ered lack of efficacy or overdose.     
Clinical significant findings in physical examinations and ECGs are to be recorded as medical 
history if they are observed at baseline. Otherwise they should be recorded as AEs.  
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (e.g. cancer or diabetes) must also be recorded 
as an AE (e.g. if there is an increase in severity, frequency, duration of the condition or wor s-
ening of outcome). Pre-planned procedures and pre-existing medical conditions (planned or 
present at the time of signing the ICF) that have not worsened are not considered AEs. These 
are recorded on the medical history pages of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
12.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that  
 is fatal 
 is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317066] (a min i-
mum of an overnight stay in a health care facility) 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is a medically important event or reaction 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317067].  
If the above interventions are performed as standard of care and not associated with an AE, 
the health issue for which the intervention is being performed will not be considered an SAE. 
If there is a complication as a result of the procedure and the complication meets at least 1 
serious criterion, that complication would be reported as an SAE. 
12.3 Definition of an Adverse Drug Reaction 
An adverse drug reaction ( ADR) is an AE that is judged by [CONTACT_317108] 
A/S to be “related” or “possible related” to the trial drug (see classification of relatedness in 
Section 12.4).  
If the ADR fulfils at least 1 of the criterion for an SAE, it is considered a serious adverse rea c-
tion (SAR). If the SAR is not listed as an expected side effect for iron isomaltoside [Monofer® 
Investigator’s Brochure, current version] or for iron sucrose [Venofer® prescribing info r-
mation ([LOCATION_003]), 0 1/2014, local SmPC, or local product monography], it is considered a sus-
pected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
It is the responsibility of Pharmacosmos A/S to evaluate the SARs for expectedness.

Confidential    Page 34 of 53 12.4 Collection of Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in Section 12.1) observed 
by [CONTACT_317109]-
ject’s medical record as well as in the AE pages of the e CRF. 
Screen failures : All SAEs will be reported in the eCRF from the time a subject has signed the 
ICF and until he/she exits the trial.  Non-serious AEs occurring in subjects who are never 
treated with the trial drug will not be collected.  
Randomised subjects : From the time a subject has signed the ICF and until he/she exits the 
trial, all AEs/SAEs will be reported in the eCRF. AEs/SAEs occurring before administration 
of the trial drug are considered as non-treatment emergent, and those occurring after admin-
istration of the trial drug are considered as treatment emergent.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the trial because of an AE, this information must 
be included in the final visit form. 
An AE should be described in the following manner: The nature of the event will be described 
in precise, standard medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by [CONTACT_17210]-
ject). If known, a specific diagnosis should be stated. Furthermore, the Investigator should 
describe an AE regarding seriousness (see Section 12.2), severity, relatedness, action taken, 
and outcome.  
Severity 
 Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal 
functioning level, but may be an annoyance 
 Moderate: The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to 
health, but is uncomfortable and/or an embarrassment 
 Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and 
is a hazard to the subject 
Relatedness 
 Related: The AE is related to the medicinal product  
 Possible related: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
 Unlikely related: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the medi c-
inal product 
 Not related: No relatedness to the medicinal product 
The categories "related" and "possible related" will be classified as related AEs and the cat e-
gories "unlikely related" and "not related" will be classified as unrelated AEs in the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
Outcome 
 Recovered/resolved: Complete clinical recovery without any sequel attributable to the 
event as per Investigator’s discretion 
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Complete clinical recovery but with one or more 
sequels attributable to the event as per Investigator’s discretion

15 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
15.1 Hypotheses 
The co-primary endpoints are treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hyperse n-
sitivity AEs and change in Hb from baseline to week 8.  
The following hypotheses will be tested: 
Safety: 
The incidence of treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs 
in the iron isomaltoside treatment group is less than 3 %. 
H01: πiron isomaltoside ≥ 3 % 
against the alternative: 
HA1: πiron isomaltoside < 3 %, 
where, π iron isomaltoside denote the incidence of treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-
serious hypersensitivity AEs.  
The null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative by [CONTACT_317114]-
sided exact 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the incidence. 
Efficacy: 
H02: µiron isomaltoside - µiron sucrose ≤ -0.5 g/dL 
against the alternative: 
HA2: µiron isomaltoside - µiron sucrose > -0.5 g/dL, 
where, µ iron isomaltoside and µiron sucrose denote the change from baseline to week 8 in Hb. 
Trial ID: P-Monofer-CKD-04  
Protocol Version: 4.0 (amendment 3)  
Date of Document :  [ADDRESS_390120] the alternative by [CONTACT_2164] a two-sided 95 % CI 
of the difference in change in Hb, deducted at week 8 from a mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM). 
15.2 Sample Size Determination 
Safety: 
Data from previous trials conducted with iron isomaltoside suggests that the incidence of 
treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs for an IDA popu-
lation can be expected to be approximately 1 % (IBD-01/IBD-02/CIA-01/PP-01: n=3/341=0.9 
%, 95% CI: 0.2 %; 2.5 %). And similar for iron sucrose (CKD-03: n=1/114=0.9 %, 95% CI: 
0.0 %; 4.8 %). A common incidence of 1.5 % will be assumed for the current trial. 
As these are relatively rare events, an incidence of 0 % for placebo is assumed. Iron isomalto-
side should be at most 50 % worse than the difference between iron sucrose and placebo, co r-
responding to a maximum relative risk of 2 (1.5 %/(1.5 %-0 %)2). 
This trial will primarily assess the risk of the test drug under investigation. Arguing back from 
a relative risk of 2, gives that the upper bound of the 95 % CI for the incidence of treatment-
emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs should be at most 3 % 
(2×1.5 %) for the iron isomaltoside treatment group. 
Efficacy: 
IDA-301 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to compare the safety and eff i-
cacy of 1000 mg IV ferumoxytol to placebo. In this trial, 608 subjects were treated with fe r-
umoxytol and 200 received placebo. The change in Hb from baseline to week 5 was the pr i-
mary efficacy endpoint for the European Union regulators, and one of the secondary en d-
points for U.S. regulators. The mean change was 2.6 g/dL (standard deviation (SD): 1.5) for 
IV ferumoxytol and 0.1 g/dL (SD: 0.9) for placebo. The estimated treated effect of IV fe r-
umoxytol (i.e. the difference between ferumoxytol and placebo) was estimated to be approx i-
mately 2.5 g/dL with a 95 % CI ranging from 2.3 to 2.7 g/dL. The point estimate will be used 
as estimate of the treatment effect. Preserving 80 % of this effect is believed to provide re a-
sonable assurance that iron isomaltoside is efficacious. Hence, the non-inferiority margin is 
set to (1-0.8) × 2.5 g/dL ~ 0.5 g/dL. 
Power: 
The significance level is set to 5 %. With n = 1000 in the iron isomaltoside treatment group, 
there is 88 % power for demonstrating that the upper bound of the 95 % CI of the incidence of 
treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious hypersensitivity AEs is less than 3 %. 
And with n = 500 in the iron sucrose treatment group, assuming no difference between the 
treatment groups, and assuming a common SD = 1.5 g/dL, there is 100 % power for demon-
strating non-inferiority of the change in Hb from baseline to week 8, using a non-inferiority 
margin of -0.5 g/dL.  
This yields a total power for demonstrating both co-primary endpoints of 88 %. 
The IDA-03  trial will run in parallel with this trial and the sample size is the same, yielding a 
total of 2000 subjects to be treated with iron isomaltoside and 1000 with iron sucrose. In add i-
tion to the efficacy and safety analyses performed for this trial alone, an efficacy and safety

15.6. 
15.3 Data Analysis Sets 
The following data analysis sets will be used in the analyses of the data: 
Intention to treat (ITT) analysis set: The ITT analysis set will include all randomised subjects. 
Subjects will be included as randomised. This will be the primary analysis set for evaluating 
efficacy. 
Safety analysis set: The safety analysis set will include all randomised subjects who received 
at least one dose of the trial drug. This will be the analysis set for evaluating safety. 
Full analysis set (FAS): The FAS will consist of all randomised subjects, received at least one 
dose of the trial drug, and have at least one post baseline Hb assessment. Subjects will be in-
cluded as randomised. 
Per protocol (PP) analysis set: The PP analysis set will include all subjects in the FAS who do 
not have any major protocol deviation of clinical or statistical significance. Major protocol 
deviations are defined in Section 17.3. 
The classification of the subjects will be performed before database lock. 
15.4 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be performed.  
15.5 Key Elements of the Analysis Plan 
The statistical analyses will be described in detail in a statistical analyses plan. 
15.5.1 Safety Analyses 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) current 
version. An AE will be regarded as treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) if it occurs after admin-
istration of randomised treatment. Related or possible related AE’s are defined as ADRs. 
Treatment emergent AEs will be summary tabulated by [CONTACT_317115] i-
cating number and percentage of subjects and number of events. Number of subjects who e x-
perience an ADR including S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be compared between treatment groups.  
The following AE listings will be made as a minimum: 
 Non-treatment emergent AEs (defined as AEs collected before dosing including AEs 
reported for subjects never exposed to trial drug) in randomised subjects 
 Treatment emergent AEs (non-serious and serious) in randomised subjects 
 Treatment emergent SAEs in randomised subjects 
 SAEs in non -randomised subjects 
 ADRs 
 AEs leading to dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment 
 Fatal SAEs 
 Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis 
The co-primary safety endpoint is treatment-emergent serious and/or severe non-serious h y-
persensitivity AEs. The SMQs/preferred terms are listed in Appendix A. 
An exact two-sided 95 % CI of the incidence of treatment-emergent serious and/or severe 
non-serious hypersensitivity AEs in the iron isomaltoside treatment group will be constructed. 
If the upper bound of the 95 % CI is <3 %, the safety objective has been met. 
In addition, as supportive information, the risk difference between iron isomaltoside and iron 
sucrose will be assessed by [CONTACT_2164] a 95 % CI of the risk difference. Both an unadjusted 
CI (with continuity correction), and a CI adjusted for strata using the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel method will be produced. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analyses 
The incidence of composite cardiovascular safety AEs will be tabulated and compared b e-
tween the treatment groups by a Fisher’s exact test. 
The time to first composite cardiovascular safety AEs will be presented by a Kaplan-Meier 
plot, and the treatment groups will be compared by a log-rank test. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, ADR, and SARs will be tabulated and co m-
pared between the treatment groups by a Fisher’s Exact Test. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Safety Analyses 
Vital signs, ECG, and standard laboratory data will be presented by [CONTACT_9086]. The 
incidence of treatment-emergent potentially clinically significant laboratory and vital sign 
values will be tabulated. 
Physical examination will be tabulated (by [CONTACT_6764]) as described for categorical data 
above.  
15.5.2 Efficacy Analyses 
The co-primary efficacy endpoint will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML)-based MMRM approach. All subjects in the ITT with post baseline Hb data will be 
included with their observed data. For subjects without post baseline Hb values will have 
change from baseline set to [ADDRESS_390121]-baseline visit. The model will include the fixed, 
categorical effects of treatment (iron isomaltoside and iron sucrose), week, treatment- by-week 
interaction, strata, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline Hb value and bas e-
line Hb-by-week interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the 
within-subject errors. If, unexpectedly, this analysis fails to converge, the following structures 
will be applied, in the following order; first-order ante-dependence, heterogeneous compound 
symmetry, compound symmetry. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate 
the denominator degrees of freedom. The primary comparisons will be the contrasts between 
iron isomaltoside and iron sucrose at week [ADDRESS_390122]. The estimated mean difference based on this model will be 
reported with two-sided symmetric 95 % CI, and if the lower bound of the 95 % CI is > -0.5 
g/dL, the efficacy objective has been met. If the lower bound of the two-sided 95 % CI is > 0 
g/dL superiority will be declared, and the p-value for the test of superiority will be presented. 
As sensitivity, the analysis above will be repeated for the FAS and PP analysis sets.

Confidential    Page 40 of 53 Some level of data missingness is expected, and the primary analysis (MMRM) is valid under 
the assumption that the data is Missing at Random (MAR). Simulation trials do suggest that 
MMRM is robust to accommodate some level of data Missing Not at Random. Since it is un-
clear how the level of missingness of this type of data will influence the outcome at this stage, 
choosing a pre-specified primary analysis valid under MNAR accurately will be very difficult. 
As such, sensitivity analyses valid under relevant cases of data MNAR will be performed. In 
particular, pattern-mixture models will be used. Different delta (imputation of how much 
worse response subjects who discontinue would have compared to those who complete the 
trial and who have the same profile up to time to withdrawal) will be applied as described by 
C. H. Mallinckrodt, Q. Lin, and G. Molenberghs [Mallinckrodt et al., 2012]. These analyses 
will be performed for the ITT, FAS, and PP analysis sets.  
The proportion of subjects with an Hb increase of ≥ 2 g/dL from baseline to any time from 
week [ADDRESS_390123] baseline Hb values will 
be set as failures. The estimated treatment ratio of iron isomaltoside versus iron sucrose will 
be presented with 95 % CIs and corresponding p-value. 
Time to change in Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL will be presented by a Kaplan-Meier plot, and the 
treatment groups will be compared by a log-rank test. Subjects without post baseline Hb va l-
ues will be set as censored at day 0. 
The proportion of subjects who achieve Hb level of > 12 g/dL at any time from week 1 to 
week 8, the proportion of subjects who achieve an increase in Hb concentration ≥ 2 g/dL at 
any time from week 1 to week 8, and the proportion of subjects who achieve serum ( s-) ferri-
tin level of ≥ 100 ng/mL and TSAT of 20-50 % at any time from week 1 to week 8 will be 
analysed by a logistic regression model similar to above. Subjects without Hb values at week 
1-8 will be set as failures. 
The change in concentrations of Hb to weeks 1, 2, and 4, and change in s-ferritin, TSAT, and 
s-iron from baseline to weeks 1, 2, and 8, and change in fatigue symptoms (FACIT) will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_317116]-primary efficacy end-
point. 
Pharmacoeconomics will be assessed by [CONTACT_317117].  
15.6 Combined Analysis of IDA-03 and CKD-04 
The two trials IDA-03 and CKD-04 will run in parallel. With n=1000 treated with iron iso-
maltoside and n=500 treated with iron sucrose, each trial is powered to show that the inc i-
dence of serious and/or severe hypersensitivity AEs in the iron isomaltoside group is less than 
3 % and, with a non-inferiority margin of -0.5 g/dL, to demonstrate non-inferiority of iron 
isomaltoside versus iron sucrose for change in Hb to week 8. 
Pooled analyses will be performed of the two trials.  
For safety, in addition to estimating the absolute risk (incidence and 95 % CI) of iron iso-
maltoside, a non-inferiority analysis will be performed of iron isomaltoside versus iron su-
crose. For iron sucrose, a similar rate of 1.5 % will be assumed. As iron isomaltoside should 
be no worse than 3 %, the non-inferiority margin will be set to 1.5 % points. The non-
inferiority assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_317118] t-
ed 95 % CI , adjusting for trial using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method.

Confidential    Page 41 of 53 With a total of 2000 subjects treated with iron isomaltoside, and 1000 subjects treated with 
iron sucrose, assuming common incidences of 1.5 %, and using a significance level of 5 %, 
the power to demonstrate non-inferiority is 87 %. 
As sensitivity, the incidence will be estimated from a Kaplan-Meier curve of time to serious 
and/or severe hypersensitivity AEs. The log-log transformation will be used to estimate the 
standard errors for each treatment group, and the 95 % CI will be constructed by [CONTACT_317119]. 
For efficacy, the same non-inferiority assessment as in the individual trials will be performed, 
including the specified sensitivity analyses. A similar MMRM model as for the individual 
trials will be applied, with trial added as fixed factor. The power for demonstrating efficacy is 
100 %. 
Hence, with a total of 2000 subjects treated with iron isomaltoside, and 1000 subjects treated 
with iron sucrose, the combined power of demonstrating the two primary endpoints is 87 %. 
Similar to the individual trials, if the upper bound of two -sided 95 % CI of the risk difference 
(iron isomaltoside - iron sucrose) < 0 for the incidence of serious and/or severe hypersensitiv i-
ty, or the lower bound of two-sided 95 % CI of the mean difference (iron isomaltoside - iron 
sucrose) in change in Hb from baseline to week 8 is 0 g/dL superiority will be declared, and 
the p-values for the test of superiority will be presented. 
The CSR can be finalised without the combined analysis, which will be done when both trials 
are finalised. The combined analysis will be included as an appendix to the CSR.

jects, as appropriate. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_317076], figures, and reports and will be able to review the results for the entire trial at 
a Pharmacosmos A/S site or other mutually agreeable location. 
18.6 Finance and Insurance 
All agreements between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_317077] A/S or designee must be signed prior to 
screening of the first subject in the clinical trial. The agreement must clearly state the rights 
and obligations of the parties concerned and include a detailed financial settlement. 
Every subject participating in the trial will be insured in accordance with the local legal r e-
quirements against trial related injuries to health, which may occur during the trial.  
Excluded from this, however, are injuries to health and deteriorations of illnesses already in 
existence which would have occurred or continued to exist even if the subject had not taken 
part in the clinical trial. 
The insurance cover is jeopardised if the subject fails to report immediately to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] r e-
sponsible physician any injury to health, which might have resulted from participation in the 
clinical trial, or if the subject undergoes any other medical treatment without their consent 
before the clinical trial has been completely finished, insofar as the individual subject is con-
cerned. 
The subject insurance will be arranged by [CONTACT_317084] A/S on the basis of the final trial 
protocol.

2. Myocardial infarction:  A myocardial infarction (MI) will be defined as the presence of 
the characteristic changes in cardiac enzyme markers in the setting of either temporally rela t-
ed symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome or electrocardiographic (ECG) changes co n-
sistent with either ischemia or infarction. 
Cardiac enzyme markers indicative of an MI will include: 
 An appropriate rise and fall in serum troponin (I or T) or creatine kinase-MB where at 
least 1 value is ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN). Where only 1 value has been 
measured, if it is ≥ 2 × ULN, an event may be adjudicated based on the totality of the 
clinical evidence. 
 Where only total creatine phosphokinase is measured, serial changes (i.e. at least 2 
values) need to be ≥ 2 × ULN. 
Symptoms indicative of ischemia will need to have been present for > [ADDRESS_390133] tightness. Dyspnoea, diaphoresis, or nausea may 
be considered symptoms of ischemia and will be judged based on the totality of the clinical 
evidence. 
ECG changes will be defined as: 
 New Q waves in 2 or more contiguous leads 
 Evolving ST-segment to T-wave changes in 2 or more contiguous leads + (such as ≥ 
0.[ADDRESS_390134]-segment depression) 
 New left bundle branch block 
 [ADDRESS_390135]-segment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads 
 
3. Stroke: A stroke is defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden onset that is not r e-
versible within 24 hours that results from a vascular cause involving the central nervous sy s-
tem and is not due to another readily identifiable cause (i.e. brain tumour or trauma). Strokes 
will be sub-classified as haemorrhagic, ischaemic, or unknown.

onary artery 
 
5. Congestive heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317081]: 
1. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317082] a visit to an 
emergency department that results in at least a 12-hour stay (or a date change if the 
time of admission/discharge is not available) 
AND 
2. Clinical manifestation of congestive heart failure including at least one of the follo w-
ing: new or worsening dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, oede-
ma, pulmonary basilar crackles, jugular venous distension, or radiological evidence of 
worsening heart failure 
AND 
3. Additional/increased therapy 
a. Intravenous treatment with diuretic, inotrope, or vasodilator therapy  
OR 
b. Mechanical or surgical intervention (mechanical circulatory support, heart 
transplantation, or ventricular pacing to improve cardiac function) or the use of 
ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, or dialysis that is specifically directed at 
treatment of heart failure 
 
6. Arrhythmia will be defined as any symptomatic deviation from normal sinus rhythm exp e-
rienced by [CONTACT_317126] a health care provider. The evaluation 
may include a physical exam during an outpatient visit, an ECG, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. A r-
rhythmias may include any conduction abnormality, atrioventricular heart block, prolongation 
of QTc interval, supraventricular/nodal arrhythmia, vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], ventricular arrhyth-
mia, or other cardiovascular arrhythmia. 
 
7. Hypertension  
 During the observation period immediately following trial drug administration, hype r-
tension will be defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg that r e-
sults in a value > 180 mm Hg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg 
that results in a value > 105 mm Hg  
 Following the release of a subject from the trial visit during which they are receiving 
medication, hypertension will be defined as requiring an unscheduled outpatient health 
care visit, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a change in medical therapy (e.g. administration of 
antihypertensives) in conjunction with the objective criteria, a rise in blood pressure 
(an increase in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg that results in a value > 180 mm 
Hg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg that results in a value > 105

sults in a value < 90 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure > 15 mm Hg that 
results in a value < 50 mm Hg. 
 Following the release of a subject from the trial visit during which they are receiving 
medication, hypotension will be defined as requiring an unscheduled outpatient health 
care visit, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a change in medical therapy (e.g. fluid/volume r e-
pletion, holding of antihypertensives) in conjunction with the objective criteria, a de c-

The risk of cardiovascular event is calculated based upon the Framingham model [Wilson et 
al., 1998]. A risk of cardiovascular event < 10 % is categorised as low risk (group 1), a risk 
between 10-20 % is categorised as intermediate risk (group 2), and a risk of > 20 % is catego-
rised as a high risk (group 3).

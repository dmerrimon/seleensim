IND #115,[ADDRESS_34363]-000504-41
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, 12-week, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -blind, 
Placebo- controlled Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy , Safety , and 
Tolerability  of 2Fixed Doses of Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) in 
the Treatment of Subjects with Agitation Associated with 
Dementia of the Alzheimer’s Ty pe
Clinical Phase: 3
Treatment Indication: Agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s t ype
Objective(s): Primary:   To compare the efficacy  of 2 fixed doses (1 mg/day 
and 2 mg/day) of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34769]’s t ype, as 
assessed b y the Cohen -Mansfield Agitation Inventory  (CMAI) 
after 12 weeks of treatment.
Secondary:  To evaluate the safet y and tolerability of 2fixed 
doses of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (1 mg/day and 2 mg/day) compared with 
placebo in subjects with agitation associated with dementia of 
the Alzheimer’s ty pe after 12 weeks of treatment.
Trial Design: This is a phase 3, 12 -week, multicenter, randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3-arm, fixed- dose trial 
designed to assess the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability  of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (1 mg/day  and 2 mg/day ) in the treatment of 
subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the 
Alzheimer’s ty pe.  The trial population will include male and 
female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive), 
who are living in either an institutionalized setting or in a 
non-institutionalized setting where the subject is not living 
alone . In both the institutionalized and non- institutionalized 
settings, the subject must have a caregiver who can spend a 
minimum of 2hours per dayfor4 day sper week with the 
subject in order to assess changes in the subject’s condition.
All subjects must have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s 
disease according to the National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s 
Disease and Related Disorders Association 
(NINCDS -ADRDA) criteria.

This trial will be monitored under the supervision of an 
independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  The DMC 
will monitor safety  periodically , based on a predetermined 
schedule.  The details of the DMC structure and its roles and 
responsibilities will be documented in a DM C charter.
The trial is organized as follows:
Screening Period:
The screening period will range from 2 day s to 42 day s and will 
begin when the informed consent form (I CF) is signed, prior to 
the initiation of any  procedures.  The screening period may  be 
extended after discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_35011].
The investigator must assess the capacit y of the subject to 
provide informed consent during the screening period and 
throughout the course of the trial. Determ inations by  [CONTACT_35012]/or on behalf of the subject under each potential 
circumstance will be made and implemented according to strict 
criteria.
 
An interactive voice response sy stem (IVRS) or interactive web 
response s ystem (IWRS) will be used to obtain the subject trial
identification number for each subject with a signed I CF.
The purpose of the screening period is to determine the 
subject’s eligibility  and to washout prohibited concomitant 
pharmacotherap y prior to randomization.  The subject should 
be randomized into th e double -blind treatment period as soon 
as all the screening assessments are completed, the screening 
and baseline eligibility  criteria have been met, and the required 
washout period has occurred.

Subjects who complete both the 12- week double -blind 
treatment period and the 30- day safety  follow -up visit are 
eligible to enroll into Trial 331-13- 211, which is a 2 -month, 
observational, rollover trial to evaluate the safet y of subjects 
with agitation ass ociated with Alzheimer's disease who 
previously  participated in Trial 331 -12-283. For those subjects 
who plan to enroll into Trial 331 -13-211, the 30- day safet y 
follow -up visit for Trial 331-12- 283 will occur as a clinic visit 
at either the investigator’s siteorresidential facility , if 
applicable . 
Subject Population: The subject population will include male and female subjects 
between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive), who are living in 
either an institutionalized setting or in a non -institutionalize d 
setting where the subject is not living alone. In both the 
institutionalized and non -institutionalized settings, the subject 
must have a caregiver who can spend a minimum of [ADDRESS_34367]’s condition. All subjects must have a 
diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease according to the 
NINCDS -ADRDA criteria.  Subjects must have a previous 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography  
(CT) scan of the brain, which wa s performed after the onset of 
symptoms of dementia, with findings consistent with a 
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.  If a previous MRI  or CT 
scan of the brain performed after the onset of the symptoms of 
dementia is not available, then an MRI /CT scan sh ould be 
performed during screening.  Additionall y, at both the 
screening and baseline visits, subjects must have a Mini- Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score of 5 to 22, inclusive, and a

for the treatment of agitation per the investig ator’s judgment, 
after an evaluation for reversible factors ( eg, pain, infection , 
polypharmacy ) and a trial of nonpharmacological interventions.
Subjects must have been residing at their current location for at 
least [ADDRESS_34369] safet y by [CONTACT_35014].  All attempts should be made to 
maintain the sub jects’ normal routine with regard to 
appointments with phy sicians and overnight 
accommodations.  Subjects in an institutionalized setting may 
receive supervised day  passes at the discretion of the 
investigator and may  also receive supervised overnight passes 
at the discretion of the investigator as long as such overnight 
stays are part of the subjects’ normal routine .
Subjects in a non- institutionalized setting may have a caretaker 
as well as a caregiver. The subject’s caretaker is the person 
who lives with and cares for the subject on a regular basis .  The 
caretaker may  be supported in providing care to the subject by  a 
professional(s), friend(s), or family  member(s).  For purposes 
of this trial, t he subject’s caregiver is the person who has 
sufficient contact [CONTACT_35015]’s s ymptoms and who 
has direct observation of the subject’s behavior in order to 
participate in the interview for the CMAI, NPI/NPI -NH, and 
other applicable trial assessments.  
For subjects in an institutionalized setting, there is only  one role 
defined and that is the role of caregiver.  The identified 
caregiver can be a staff member of the institutionalized setting 
or another individual ( eg, family  member, famil y frien d, hired 
professional caregiver) who has sufficient contact [CONTACT_35016]’s s ymptoms and who has direct observation of the

Dose, Formulation, 
Mode of 
Administration:The IMP will consist of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34772] (identical 
0.25- mg, 0.5 -mg, 1-mg, and 2 -mg tablets) and matching 
placebo tablets.  The 0.25 mg/day  dose will be supplied as a

0.5mg/day , 1mg/day, and 2 mg/day  doses will be supplied as a 
weekl y blister card containing sufficient tablets for 
7(+2)days.  An IVRS or I WRS will be used at each trial site 
to assign the specific blister -card number to be dispensed to 
each subject at each visit.
After a 2 -to 42 -day screening period, eligible subjects will be 
randomly  assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups ( 2active

Pharmacokinetic samples for determination of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34775] (s)will be collected at the baseline visit and at 
the Week 8 and Week 12/ET trial visits, at the same time as the 
sample collection for the clinical laboratory tests.  
 
 
 
 
Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistics will be provided for all efficacy and safet y 
variables in general.  Continuous variables will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_35017], median, range, and standard deviation 
(SD).  Tabulations of frequency  distributions will be provided 
for categorical variables.  The primary  endpoint will be
analyzed using a mixed- effect model repeated measure 
(MMRM) methodology .  The model will include fixed 
class -effect terms for treatment, trial center, visit week, and an 
interaction term of treatment by  [CONTACT_35018] a covariate.  The primary  efficacy  outcome measure is 
the mean change from baseline (Day  0 visit) to the end of the 
double -blind treatment period (Week 12 visit) in the CMAI 
total score.  
 
 
The primary  statistical comparisons of interest are 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day versus placebo and brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
1mg/day versus placebo.  To protect the experiment -wise alpha 
level at 0.05 when making 2 comparisons of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34776], the statistical testing will be carried out 
using a hierarchical testing procedure in the order of 1) 
comparison of 2 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34777] 2) 
comparison of 1 mg/day  brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34778].  Thus, if 
the test y ields a statistically  significant result at 0.05 ( 2-sided) 
for the comparison of 2 mg/day  brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34778], 
then the comparison of 1 mg/day  brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34779] 0.05 ( 2-sided) .

a statistically  significant result at 0.05 ( 2-sided) for both of the 
comparisons of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day  and 2 mg/day  versus 
placebo, then the corresponding comparison for the key  
secondary  efficacy  variable (CGI -S score) will be tested at an 
alpha level of 0.05 ( 2-sided) using another hierarchical testing 
procedure in the order of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 m g/day  versus 
placebo and brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day  versus placebo.  Thus, 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day  versus placebo will be tested only  if 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day  versus placebo reaches significance at 
0.05 (2- sided) for this key  secondary  efficacy  variable.
The s ample size was calculated based on the treatment effect of 
6.5 points with a n SD of 16.5 in the change from baseline 
(Day 0 visit) to the end of the double -blind treatment period 
(Week 12 visit) in the CMAI  total score, to achieve 8 5% power 
at a 2- sided al pha level of 0.05.  This results in 117 subjects in 
each of the groups ( ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1mg/day, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]

admission.5
Neurops ychiatric s ymptoms, including agitation and aggression, are core features of 
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.  Alzheimer’s disease -associated behavioral 
disturbances lead to frequent emergency  room visits and can lead to mismanagement of 
other medical conditions.  These behavioral disturbances are also associated with major 
adverse effects on quality  of life (QoL) and reduced time to institutionalization.  
Neurops ychiatric s ymptoms also have a major adverse effect on caregivers.[ADDRESS_34385] and caregiver distress6and increased 
healthcare costs7and may even lead to institutionalization .8
Currently , there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease and no treatment approved in the 
[LOCATION_002] for the man agement of behavioral disturbances, including agitation, in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease.  In some countries of the European Union (EU), 
risperidone is indicated for the short- term treatment (up to 6 weeks) of persistent 
aggression in subject s with mo derate to severe Alzheimer's dementia unresponsive to 
nonpharmacological approaches and when there is a risk of harm to self or others.[ADDRESS_34386]

Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (also referred to as OPC-[ZIP_CODE] or Lu AF41156) is an organic compound 
synthesized by  [CONTACT_35022], L td, that is a partial agonist at dopamine 
type2 (D2), dopamine t ype 3 (D3), and serotonin ty pe 1A (5- HT1A) receptors and an 
antagonist at serotonin type 2A (5 -HT2A) receptors; and has a low binding affinity  for 
histamine and muscarinic receptors.  Details of the receptor affinity  profile of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34782] 1.1.1.  Activity  at dopamine and serotonin

[IP_ADDRESS]. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
The use of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34820] a djunctive therapy  for the treatment of MDD has been 
studied in 2 completed, phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials (Trials 
331-08- 211 and 331-09- 222).  Additionally , 6 studies are ongoing: 2 [LOCATION_002] ( US)
trials (1 phase 1, randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled trial in elderly  adults 
[aged 70 -80years] with MDD [Trial 331-12- 291]; 1 long -term, open- label safet y trial 
[Trial 331-08- 212]); and 4 multinational trials (2 randomized, double -blind, 
placebo- controlled trials [Trials 331 -10-227 and 331 -10-228]; 1 randomized, 
double -blind, placebo - and active comparator- controlled trial of flexible -dose 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34821] y in the treatment of adults with MDD 
[Trial 331-12- 282];  and 1 open- label, 52- week safety  trial [Trial 331 -10-238]).
Trial 331-08- 211 was a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
designed to assess the safety  and efficacy  of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (0.15 to 2 mgdaily ) as 
adjunctive treatment to an assigned open -label antidepressant therapy  (ADT) in subjects 
with MDD.  Subjects received brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 0.15 mg/day, 0.50 0.25 mg/day, 
1.50.50 mg/day, or matching placebo.  In this trial, adjunctive brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34822] 
1.50.50 mg/day was superior to adjunctive placebo with respect to the primar y 
endpoint (change in Montgomery  Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] Total 
Score) and several secondary  efficacy  endpoints.  The 1.5 0.50 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34823] a favorable safet y profile.  Few subjects experienced 
serious treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or discontinued due to TEAEs.  The 
analysis of laboratory  data, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and EPS scales did not 
indicate an y concerns of clinical significance.
In Trial 331-09- 222, randomized subjects received a flexible dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 to 
3mg/day (average dose 2.2 mg/day) or placebo as adjunctive treatment to an assigned 
open -label ADT.  In this trial, the MADRS Total Score decreased at each visit for both 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34824], howe ver, the decrease observed in the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34825].  The MADRS response rate ( ≥ 50% decrease MADRS Total Score) and remission 
rate (MADRS Total Score ≤ 10) were statistically  significant at endpoint.  Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34826] 3 mg/day was well tolerated when administered as adjunctive therap y to a 
marketed ADT in subjects with MDD.  During the double -blind treatment phase, TEAEs 
were reported in 76.2% of subje cts in the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34827] 63.6% of subjects in

increased weight (11.4%), and insomnia (9.2%).  The Columbia- Suicide Severit y Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS) and adverse event (AE) data showed no suicidal behavior during 
double -blind treatment.  No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for subjects in 
the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34828], and 3 subjects (1.6%) in the placebo group experienced an SAE; 
4.9% of subjects who received adjuncti ve brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34829] 1.1% of subjects who 
received adjunctive placebo discontinued treatment due to TEAEs.  There were no 
clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  values, ECG parameters, or vital sign 
measurements, except body  weight (mean increase of 1.92 kg in the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34830] 0.13 kg in the placebo group), in brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]- treated subjects.  The minimal 
changes in scores for EPS scales during double- blind treatment were not clinically  
relevant.  An EPS -related AE was observed in 21.6% of s ubjects in the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34831] 9.6% of subjects in the placebo group.
Trial 331-08-[ADDRESS_34393] demonstrated an incomplete response to prospective 
treatment with the same ADT.  Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34832]

The use of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34834] y for the treatment of schizophrenia has been 
studied in 2 completed, multinational, phase 2, double- blind, placebo -controlled trials 
(Trials 331 - 07- 203 and 331 -08-210). In addition, 4 multinational, phase 3 trials are 
ongoing:  3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials (Trials 331 -10-230, 
331-10- 231, and 331-10-232) and 1 open- label, 52 -week safet y trial (Trial 331 -10-237).
Trial 331-07- 203 was a dose -ranging , placebo-controlled trial (with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34820] a 
positive control to confirm the assay  sensitivity  of the trial) in subjects experiencing an 
acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.  Although the results showed that neither 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (dose range, 0.25 -6mg/day) nor aripi[INVESTIGATOR_34835] 6 
(last-observation -carried- forward [ LOCF ]), numeric improvements in efficacy  scale 
scores were similar between the low, mid, and high flexible -dose groups of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34836], including the primary  endpoint (the Positive and 
Negative S yndrome Scale [PANSS] total score, which measures the severity of 
symptoms of schizophrenia).  Factors such as sex, a ge, and race did not appear to have a 
consistent influence on efficacy  outcomes; however, the small sample size in many  of the 
subgroup categories precluded definitive conclusions.  The collective efficacy  data from 
this trial suggest an active dose range of 1to 6mg/day of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34837].  The frequency  of TEAEs was similar in the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (69.7%), 
placebo (70.5%), and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] ( 70.0%) groups.  The frequency  of SAEs was similar 
between the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (3.8%) an d placebo (3.2%) groups.  The C -SSRS and AE data 
showed no suicidal behavior during double -blind or open -label treatment.  Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34838], clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  values, vital 
signs, or ECG parameters.  St atistically  significant increases in weight, body  mass index 
(BMI ), and waist circumference were observed in the 2.5 ± 0.5 mg/day and 
5.0 ± 1.0 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34839].
Eligible subjects from Trial 331-07-[ADDRESS_34394] continued into the multicenter, 
52-week, open- label trial (Trial 331-08- 210) designed to assess the safet y and tolerability 
of 1 to 6 mgof oral brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34840].  Twenty -eight 
subjects were included in the 52- week trial: 20 subjects who had received prior 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 6 who had received prior placebo, and 2 who had received prior 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].  Assessment of efficacy  as a secondary  objective showed improvement from

[IP_ADDRESS]. Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
For ADHD, 1 phase 2 trial (Trial 331-08- 213) has been completed.  Trial 331-08-213 was 
a proof -of-concept, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
flexible -dose trial in which adults with ADHD who had an incomplete/partial response to 
stimulant therapy  in a prospective treatment phase were randomized to double -blind 
treatment with either brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] -plus- stimulant or placebo -plus- stimulant.  Results 
showed no statistically  significant improvement in the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34844] ( ie, the Conners’ 
Adult ADHD Rating Scale -Observer:  Screening Version [CAARS -O:SV]), the key  
secondary  efficacy  endpoints ( ie, Wender -Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder

11 of 155 [7.1%] subjects) were reported in greater than 5% of subjects in the 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34828].  Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity .  During the 
double -blind treatment phase, 2 subjects reported SAEs (pneumonia and urinary  tract 
infection), both of whom were in the placebo group.  There were no unexpected or 
clinically  relevant findings related to assessments of movement disorders, metabolic 
syndrome, EPS rating scales, or suicidality  (based on the C -SSRS) during the 
double -blind phase.
1.3. Know n and Potential Risks and Benefits
Based on the Investigator’s Brochure,16combined data from the completed phase 1 
clinical trials indicate that brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34845] 0.2 to 6 mg and at multiple oral doses up to 2 mg/day .  Data from the 
completed multiple -dose clini cal trials indicate brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34846] 12 mg/day  in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; up 
to 4mg/day  when coadministered with marketed ADT in subjects with MDD; and up to 
4mg/day  when coadmi nistered with marketed stimulant therapy  in subjects with ADHD. 
Based on data from the 18 completed phase 1 clinical trials in healthy  subjects or special 
populations (including healthy  subjects from 2 phase 1 trials conducted in special 
populations) (15 in the US, 2 in Japan, and 1 in Korea), the most frequently  reported 
TEAEs (incidence ≥ 5% or more of all healthy  subjects who received brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34847], administered either alone or with another marketed drug) were:
Health y subjects (N = 15 trials conducted in the US):  dizziness, headache, postural 
dizziness, nausea, somnolence, constipation, and diarrhoea
Health y subjects (N = 3 trials conducted in Japan and Korea):  nausea, orthostatic 
hypotension, somnolence, and dizziness
By [CONTACT_35023], the most frequentl y reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 5% or more of all

In the single completed phase 1 trial in subjects with schizophrenia conducted in Japan, 
TEAEs reported in 3 or more subjects who received brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (of 21 total subjects) 
were:

Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34770] e did not result in any  consistent, clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  
values, vital signs (blood pressure or heart rate), or ECG parameters in the completed 
phase [ADDRESS_34397] to 
movement disorders in subjects with MDD at doses up to 3 mg/day  (Trial 331-09- 221) 
and in subjects with schizophrenia at doses up to 12 mg/day  (Trial 331-08- 205).  In the 
dose-ranging trial that enrolled subjects who were experiencing an acute exacerbation of 
schizophrenia (Trial 331 -07-203), an increase in the incidence of EPS was observed at
the highest dose (ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 5 1mg/day ).
Two deaths have been reported in the 30 completed clinical trials.  One death was 
reported in the completed phase 2 double- blind trial in adult subjects with acute 
schizophrenia (Trial 331-07- 203).  The s econd death was reported in the completed 
phase 2 open- label MDD trial (Trial 331 -08-212).  None of these subject s weretaking 
IMP at the time of death and none of these fatal events were considered by [CONTACT_35024] I MP.  Additionally , [ADDRESS_34398] been reported in 2 ongoing 
phase 3 open- label trials of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].  One death was reported in an ongoing 
schizophrenia trial (331 -10-237) and 3 deaths were reported in an ongoing MDD trial 
(331-10-238).  One of the deaths (completed suici de in Trial 331 -10-238) was considered 
by [CONTACT_35025] I MP.
Serious TEAEs have been reported for 64 subjects who received brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34849] 
30completed trials.  In ongoing trials of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 120 subjects receiving 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34850].

clinical safet y data.[ADDRESS_34399] s with Alzheimer’s 
disease and related dementias and develop in the majority  of dementia subject s.  The 
presence of agitation in subject s with Alzheimer’s disease places a significant burd en not 
only on subject s and their caregivers but also on the healthcare s ystem.

In light of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) boxed warning of increased 
mortality  with the use of antipsy chotics in elderl y subject s with dementia -related 
psychosis a nd similar caution advised by  [CONTACT_35026], the clinical trial 
will be conducted in an environment that allows for close safet y monitoring, in subjects
who are living in either an institutionalized setting or in a non- institutionalized setting 
where the subject is not living alone and has a caregiver who can spend a minimum of 
2hours per dayfor [ADDRESS_34400]’s condition.  Furthermore, a slow titration schedule will be implemented with 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34854] (2 mg/day) over a 4-week 
period.   
 
 
2.2. Dosing Rationale
Doses of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day will be studied in this fixed- dose trial.  
Doses will be increased slowly  so that the highest dose will be reached at end of the 
fourth week of treatment ( ie, at the Week 4 visit).
The doses to be used in this indication have been determined based on results from 
completed phase 1 safet y and tolerability trials; from a PET trial of dopamin e receptor 
occupancy ; from phase 2 and phase 3 trials in subjects with schizophrenia, MDD, or 
ADHD; and from review of data from trials of similar medications in subjects with

phase 1 single -and multiple -ascending -dose clinical trials:
Up to 6 mgfrom single -dose trials and up to 2 mg/day from multiple -dose trials in 
healthy  subjects
Up to 12 mg/day from multiple -dose trials in subjects with schizophrenia or 
schizoaffecti ve disorder (the maximum tolerated dose [MTD] was not reached)
Up to 4 mg/day from a multiple -dose trial in subjects with MDD when 
coadministered with marketed ADT (the MTD was not reached)
Up to 4 mg/day from a multiple -dose trial in subjects with ADHD when 
coadministered with marketed stimulant therap y (the MTD was not reached)
In the multiple -ascending -dose studies of subjects with schizophrenia, MDD, and ADHD, 
the studies ended when a prospectivel y chosen daily  dose was reached.  In all 3 studies, 
the M TD was not reached.  The MTD of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34855] 12 mg/day.  The MTD in subjects with MDD and ADHD, when 
coadministered with ADT and stimulant therap y, respectivel y, is greater than 4 mg/day.  
These data indicate that doses of at least 4 mg/day are well tolerated in nonpsy chotic 
adult psy chiatric subject s.
Efficacy  in treating schizophrenia b y dopamine D2 antagonists has been associated with 
occupancy  of greater than 65% of the dopamine receptors.17,18,[ADDRESS_34402], 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], are greater than 80%20,21and the occupancy  associated with therapeutic 
benefit of the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34856].  To further define 
the proper dose range for brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], the binding of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34857] D2/D3 
receptors was investigated in a PET trial in healthy subjects (Trial 331 -07-202).  Single 
doses of up to 6 mgof brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34858] 15 subjects.  Results from the 
trial predicted stead y-state receptor occupancies of 80% to 90% at brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34859] 
1 to 2 mg(79.3% predicted occupancy  at 1 mgbrexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 88.8% at 2 mg
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], and 95.1% at 4 mgbrexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]).  Based on the single- dose D2/D3 
receptor occupancy  data and steady -state pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic modeling, 
it wa s predicted that the D2/D3 receptor occupancy  after multiple daily  dose 
administration of 1 mgto 2mgdoses would result in 80% to 90% D2/D3 receptor 
occupancy .

  Since 4 mg/day has been well tolerated and to ensure 
that D2 occupancy  levels at and above 80% are achieved, doses up to 4 mg/day are being 
studied in the phase 3 trials in schizophrenia and up to 3 mg/day in adjunctive treatment 
of MDD.  In the phase [ADDRESS_34403] dose was 3 mg/day.
Three studies of another compound discovered b y Otsuka, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (Abilif y), have 
been conducted to investigate its benefit in the treatment of psy chosis in subjects with 
Alzheimer’s dementia.21,22,[ADDRESS_34404] population was suggested by  [CONTACT_35027][INVESTIGATOR_34860] 2 secondary  endpoints, the Cohen- Mansfield Agitation I nventory  
(CMAI )and the agitation item of the Neurops ychiatric Inventory -Nursing Home 
(NPI-NH).  In the fixed dose trial, which included 2 mg/day, 5mg/day, and 10 mg/day 
dose arms, there were significant differences found on both measures for the 5 mg/day 
and 10 mg/day groups.  Significant differences compared with placebo on both measures 
were also observed in the second flexible- dose trial of the 2 mg/day to 15 mg/day dose 
range.
Because of concerns about tolerability  and safet y in subject s, the doses of antipsy chotics 
used in clinical trials in subjects with dementia have generally  been lower than the doses 
recommended for subjects with schizophrenia.21,22,24  While the dose range for 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34861] 1 mg/day to 4mg/day, the selected dose range 
in the Alzheimer’s population is 1mg/day to 2mg/day, to maximize tolerability  while 
investigating doses that should achieve the occupancy of the D2 receptor associated with 
benefit in the alleviation of target s ymptoms by  a D2 partial agonist.  Slow titration of the 
dosing will also be employ ed to maximize tolerability .

This is a phase 3, 12 -week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
3-arm, fixed- dose trial designed to assess the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (1 mg/day and 2 mg/day) in the treatment of subjects with agitation 
associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s t ype.  The trial population will include male 
and female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age (inclusive), who are living in either 
an institutionalized setting or in a non -institutionalized setting where the subject is not 
living alone . In both the institutionalized and non- institutionalized settings, the subject 
must have a caregiver who can spend a minimum of [ADDRESS_34405]’s condition .All subjects must 
have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease according to the National I nstitute of 
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and 
Related Disorders A ssociation (NINCDS- ADRDA) criteria .  
The trial comprises a [ADDRESS_34406] -treatment follow -up period.   
 
    
This trial will be monitored under the supervision of an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC).  The DMC will monitor safety periodicall y, based on a 
predetermined schedule.  The details of the DMC structure and its roles and 
responsibilities will be documented in a DMC C harter (refer to Section 3.7.8 ).
The trial is organized as follows (refer to Figure 3.1 -1for a schematic of the trial design):
Screening Period
The screening period will range from 2 day s to 42 day s and will begin when the informed 
consent form (I CF) is signed, prior to the initiation of any  procedures.  The screening 
period may  be extended after discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_7195].

identification number for each subject with a signed I CF.
The purpose of the screening period is to determine the subject’s eligibility and to 
washout prohibited concomitant pharmacotherapy  prior to random ization (refer to 
Section 4.1).  The subject should be randomized into the double-blind treatment period as 
soon as all the screening assessments are completed, the screening and baseline eligibility  
criteria have been met, and the required washout period has occurred.
 
 
 
  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects are 
eligible for enrollment into the trial and for assessing subject safet y throughout the trial.  
 
In addition, starting at screening and continuing throughout the [ADDRESS_34407]’s behavior will be logged into a diary  by [CONTACT_35028]/or facility  staff.  This diary  data along with the collection of progress notes will be 
sent to the  on a routine basis in order to corroborate information recorded on 
the CMAI .  Since the diary  data is a tool to assist  in monitoring CMAI  rater 
training, the diary  data will not be statistically  analy zed.
While it is preferred that diary  data are collected [ADDRESS_34408] and submit as much data as 
possible.  Caretakers, facility personnel, and/or family  members may  provide information 
to the caregiver to complete the diary , but this is not a requirement.
Details around this procedure can be found in the operations manual.

3.4.1. Informed Consent
[IP_ADDRESS]. Determinations of Capacity
The investigator must assess the capacit y of the subject to provide informed consent 
during the screening period and throughout the course of the trial.  This assessment will 
be made in accordance with the investigator’s standard practice.  Once these
determination s are made by  [CONTACT_3170], the following options for obtaining informed 
consent from and/or on behalf of the subject must be followed:
If the subject is deemed capable b y the investigator, written informed consent will be 
obtained from the subject prior to the i nitiation of any  trial protocol -required 
procedures.  In such cases, acknowledgement from the subject’s legall y acceptable 
representative (an individual, or judicial or other body , authorized under applicable 
law to consent to the subject’s participation i n the clinical trial on behalf of that
prospective subject) will also be obtained, if required, in accordance with state and/or 
local regulations prior to initiation of any  trial protocol -required procedures.   
If the subject is deemed incapable by  [CONTACT_35036] (eg,
subjects with severe dementia) , written informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject’s legall y acceptable representative prior to initiation of any  trial
protocol -required procedures.  In such cases, assent from t he subject ,if possible ,will 
be confirmed in accordance with state and/or local regulations prior to the initiation 
of an y trialprotocol -required procedures. 
If the subject cannot provide assent, and does not dissent, then the consent of the 
legally  acceptable represen tative is sufficient unless otherwise required b y the 
governing ethics bod y and/or applicable state and/or local regulations.
If the subject dissents, then the subject is not eligible for participation in the trial .
If the subject initially  provided assent at trialentry, but subsequent lydissents to 
participate in the trial, the subject will be earl y terminated from the trial. 
If the subject was initially  deemed capable of providing informed consent but is no 
longer deemed so, informed consent must be obtained from the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative, and assent from the subject, if possible, will be confirmed 
in accordance with state and/or local regulations prior to the initiation or continuation

investigator agrees to obtain sponsor approval of any  written I CF used in the trial prior to 
submission to the I RB/IEC.
Investigators may discuss trial availability  and the possibility  for entry  with a potential 
subject and subject’s legally  acceptable representative without first obtaining consent.  
However, informed consent must be obtained and documented prior to initiation of an y 
procedures that are performed solely  for the purpose of determining eligibility  for this 
trial, including withdrawal from current medication(s). The subject must be informed 
about the trialto the extent compatible with the subject’s understanding and, if capable, 
personall y sign and date the consent or assent form , depending on local re gulations .
If the subject or subject’s legally  acceptable representative is unable to read or sign due to 
physical limitations, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed 
consent discussion.  After the subject’s legally  acceptable r epresentative and subject 
orally  consent and have signed, if capable, the witness should sign and personally  date 
the consent and/or assent form attesting that the information is accurate and that the 
subject’s legall y acceptable representative and subject understand and have freel y given 
consent.
The informed consent and any  other information provided to the subject and the subject’s 
legally  acceptable representative should be revised whenever important new information 
becomes available that is relevant to the consent, and should receive IRB/IEC approval 
prior to use.

3.7.2. Efficacy  Assessments
It is required that adequately  trained and experienced clinicians administer the CMAI, 
NPI-NH, NPI/NPI -NH, CGI-S,  and   In addition, the raters must be 
certified for this trial to administer the CMAI ,NPI-NH, an d NPI/NPI -NH.  Notations in 
the subject’s trial records should substantiate the ratings.  Training, certification, and 
materials for rating will be provided b y a rater training group.
A caregiver must be identified during the screening period for participation in the 
interview for the CMAI, NPI -NH, NPI/NPI -NH, and other applicable trial assessments. 
In addition to providing responses to trial questionnaires, the identified caregiver will be 
interviewed b y the trial personnel regarding the subj ect’s general medical condition, 
behavioral s ymptoms, and activities of daily  living.  If the subject is in an 
institutionalized setting, the identified caregiver will gather information from several 
informants, including staff from the day , afternoon, and night shifts, as well as from 
reliable family  members or friends, in order to provide an accurate and comprehensive 
overview of the subject’s behavioral s ymptoms and condition.  If the subject is in a 
non-institutionalized setting, the identified caregive r can gather information from the 
caretaker (if different than the identified caregiver) or from other informants who are in a 
position to observe the subject and provide information regarding behavioral sy mptoms 
and activities of dail y living.   Details on the caregiver requirements can be found in 
Section 3.3.1.

originall y used in nursing home resi dents.  It consists of [ADDRESS_34445] agitation syndromes include:  aggressive behavior, 
physicall y nonaggressive behavior, and verbally agitated behavior.  A sample of the 
CMAI  is provided in Appendix 6.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Global Impression -Severity  of Illness Scale (CGI -S)
The severit y of agitation for each subject will be rated using the CGI -S.27  To perform 
this assessment, the investigator (or designee) will answer the following question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally  
ill (as related to agitation) is the subject at this time?”  Response choices are 0 = not 
assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally  ill; 3 = mildly  ill; 
4 =moderatel y ill; 5 = markedl y ill; 6 =severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely

procedures will aid in the standardization of these measurements:
The subject should be minimally  clothed ( ie, lightweight clothing; no heavy  
overgarments).
Waist circumference should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately  
the same time at each visit.
Measurement will be accomplished by  [CONTACT_35059] a weighted measuring tape in a horizontal plane around 
the abdomen at the level of the crest.  Before reading the tape measure, the assessor 
should assure that the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to 
the floor.  The measurement is to be made at the end of a normal exhalation .39
The investigator (or designee) is responsible for performing the ph ysical examination .  If 
the appointed designee is to perform the ph ysical examination, he or she must be 
permitted by  [CONTACT_35060]/her name [CONTACT_35216] t he FDA Form

Any condition present at the post- treatment ph ysical examination that was not present at 
the baseline examination should be documented as an AE and followe d to a satisfactory  
conclusion.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Neurological Examination
A detailed neurological examination will be performed by  a phy sician at screening , 
Week 12/ET, and as needed during the trial for new onset neurological symptoms. The 
neurological examination will c onsist of an evaluation of the subject’s mental status, 
cranial nerves, motor s ystem ( eg, motor strength, muscle tone, reflexes), cerebellar 
system ( eg, coordination), gait and station, and sensory  system.
The physician is responsible for performing the neurological examination and must be 
included on the Form FDA 1572.  Whenever possible, the same physician should perform 
all neurological examinations.  Any  condition present at the post- treatment neurological 
examination that was not present at the baselin e examination and that is determined to be 
an AE should be documented as an AE and followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.   If new 
potentially  clinicall y relevant neurological signs or sy mptoms are identified, referral to a 
neurologist is recommended.

Vital sign measurements will include body  weight, body  temperature, sy stolic blood 
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate.  The following guidelines 
will aid in the standardization of body  weight measurements:
The same scale should be used to weigh a given subject each time, if possible.
Scales should be calibrated and reliable; scales should be at zero just prior to each 
subject’s weigh- in session.
A subject should void prior to being weighed and be minimally  clothed ( ie, no shoes 
or heav y overgarments).
Weight should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately  the same 
time at each visit.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be made in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting, and 
standing positions .  The supi[INVESTIGATOR_34881], followed by  [CONTACT_35061], 
and finally  standing.  Blood pressure and heart rate measurements in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_34882] l ying for at least 5 minutes. The sitting and 
standing measurements should be taken within 1 to 3 minutes of changing positions.  
Vital signs scheduled at the same visit as blood samples are to be completed before blood 
is drawn.
Subjects with uncontrolled hy pertension (screening DBP > 95 mmHg in any  position) or 
symptomatic hy potension are excluded from the trial as are subjects with orthostatic 
hypotension, which is defined as a decrease of 30 mmHg in SBP and/or a decrease of 
20mmHg in DBP within 3 minutes ofstanding compared t o the previous supi[INVESTIGATOR_34883] (see Table 3.7-1).  In addition, subjects should be 
excluded if they  have any  other vital sign measurement at screening that, in the 
investigator’s judgment, is medically  significant in that i t would impact the safet y of the 
subject or the interpretation of the trial results.  However, an y abnormal screening vital 
sign result(s) considered to be clinically  significant should be repeated to confirm the 
finding(s) before excluding the subject fro m the trial.  Refer to Appendix 4for a list of 
potentially  clinicall y significant vital signs.

Standard 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at screening and at the visits specified in 
Table 3.7-1.  An y ECGs scheduled for the same visit as blood samples are to be 
completed before blood is drawn.  ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has 
been supi[INVESTIGATOR_34884] 5 minutes.  Additional 12- lead ECGs may  be obtained

qualified designee) will review, sign, and d ate each ECG reading, noting whether or not 
any abnormal results are of clinical significance.  The ECG will be repeated if any  results 
are considered to be clinically  significant.  A central ECG service will be used for reading 
all ECGs in order to standa rdize interpretations for the safet y analysis.
If, according to the investigator's judgment, an y abnormal ECG finding is deemed 
medically  significant (impacting the safety  of the subject and/or the interpretation of the 
trialresults) or meets an exclusion criterion (see Table 3.4.3-1), the subject should be 
excluded from the trial.Abnormal results for ECGs should be repeated once at screening 
with [ADDRESS_34451] based on the criteria noted above. Each ECG recording should be 
taken approximately  5 minutes apart (the ECG result reported will be evaluated at each 
time point). The central ECG service will provide the corrections for the 3 ECGs 
performed.  Based on the QT interval as corrected by  [CONTACT_6550]’s formula (QTcF) 
reported b y the central service, a subject will be excluded if the corrections are 
≥ 450 msec in men and ≥ 470 msec in women for 2 of the 3 time points of the ECGs 
done, unless due to ventricular pacing. If onl y 1 ECG time point has a QTc Fof

3.8.3. Individual Subject
If a subject discontinues the trial prematurel y, the reason must be fully evaluated and 
recorded appropriately in source documents and the eCRF.  If the subject is being 
withdrawn because of an AE, the AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal.
All subjects have the right to withdraw at an y time during treatment without prejudice.  
The inves tigator can discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial at any  time if 
medically  necessary .  In addition, subjects meeting an y of the following criteria must be 
withdrawn from the trial:
1)Occurrence of an y AE, intercurrent illness, or abnormality  in a laboratory  assessment

5.Reporting of A dverse Events
5.1. Definitions
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.
A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  
that the drug caused the AE.  For the purpose of IND safet y reporting, “reasonable 
possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and 
the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty  about causality .
An SAE includes an y event that results in any of the following outcomes:
1)Death
2)Life-threatening, ie , the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate
risk of death from the event as i t occurred.  It does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
3)Persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
4)Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] (NOTE:  A 
prescheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34909].)
5)Congenital anomal y/birth defect
6)Other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may  require m edical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above, eg, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
Non-serious adverse events are AEs that do not meet the criteria for an SAE.

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-12-[ADDRESS_34467] be indicated on the AE page of the eCRF. Examples of AEs that are 
considered extrapy ramidal sy mptoms include, but are not limited to: generalized rigidity , 
dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, brady kinesia, akinesia, dy stonia, hy pertonia, akathisia, tremor, 
flexed posture, involuntary  muscle contractions, athetosis, and chorea.  If a subject is 
experiencing two or more of these s ymptoms, whether or not treatment with an 
anticholinergic is required, this is considered as extrapy ramidal s yndrome and must be 
entered as “extrap yramidal sy ndrome” on the AE page of the eCR F instead of the 
individual sy mptoms.
Immediately Reportable Event (IRE)
Any SAE
Any AE that necessitates discontinuation of the IMP
Potential Hy ’s law cases (an y increase of AST or ALT≥ [ADDRESS_34468] with an 
increase in total bilirubin ≥ 2 times the UL N)
Pregnancies are also defined as IREs.  Although normal pregnancy  is not an AE, it will 
mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an I RE form to INC Research.  
Pregnancy  will only  be documented on the AE eCRF if there is an abnormality  or 
compl ication.
Clinical Laboratory Changes
It is the investigator’s responsibility  to review the results of all laboratory  tests as they  
become available.  This review will be documented by  [CONTACT_093]’s dated signature 
[CONTACT_35217].  For each abnormal laboratory  test result, the investigator needs 
to ascertain if this is an abnormal ( ie, clinicall y significant) change from baseline for that 
individual subject. (This determination, however, does not necessarily  need to be made 
the first time an abnormal value is observed.  The investigator may  repeat the laboratory  
test or request additional tests to verify  the results of the original laboratory tests).  If this 
laboratory  value is determined by  [CONTACT_35067], this is considered an AE.

Protocol 331 -12-283
Confidential -Otsuka Proprietary Information 102 10Sep 2015Severity
All AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated on the eCRF.  The 
intensity  of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily  activity
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y
3 = Severe: Inability  to work or perform normal daily  activity
IMP Causality
The causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP will be assessed as follows:
Related: There is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship
Possibly  related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the IMP and the 
AE.  Dechallenge is lacking or unclear
Unlikely  related: There is a temporal relationship to the I MP administration, but 
there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the IMP and 
the AE
Not related: There is no temporal or reasonable relationship to the I MP 
administration
5.2. Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events
The investigator will periodically  assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs.  To avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following nonleading question: "How 
have you felt since your last visit?"  AllAEs (serious and nonserious) reported by [CONTACT_35068] e source documents and eCRFs provided b y the sponsor or 
designee .
In addition, INC Research (refer to Appendix 2) must be notified immediately  by 
[CONTACT_35069] 5.3.  Special attention should be paid to recording 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34910].
5.3. Immediately  Reportable Events (IRE)
The investigator must immediately  report within 24 hours after either the investigator or 
site personnel become aware of an y SAE or potential Hy’s law cases (refer to 
Section 5.4) by  [CONTACT_35070] ,as outlined in Appendix 2.  
An IRE form must be completed and sent by  [CONTACT_35071].  
(Note:  the IRE form is NOT the AE eCRF.)

abnormalities) should be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_34469].
5.4. Potential Hy ’s Law Cases
For subjects that experience an elevation in AST or ALT that is ≥ [ADDRESS_34470], a 
total bilirubin level should also be evaluated.  If th e total bilirubin is ≥ [ADDRESS_34471], 
confirmatory  repeat laboratory  samples should be drawn within 48 to 72 hours of the 
initial draw.  If these values are confirmed, trial personnel will complete an I RE form 
with all values listed and also report the e vent as an AE on the eCRF.  Please note: if the 
subject was enrolled into the trial with non- exclusionary  elevated transaminase levels at 
baseline, please discuss any  potential drug- induced liver injury  events with the medical 
monitor .
5.5. Pregnancy
Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually  active must use an effective 
method of birth control during the course of the trial and for at least [ADDRESS_34472] is ster ile (ie, 
women who have had an oophorectom y and/or h ysterectom y or have been 
postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months; or men who have had orchiectom y) 
or remains abstinent, two of the following precautions must be used:  vasectomy , tubal 
ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control depot 
injection, birth control implant, condom or sponge with spermicide, or an y other method 
approved b y the medical monitor.  Any  single method of birth control, including 
vasec tomy and tubal ligation, may fail, leading to pregnancy.
Before enrolling women of childbearing potential in this clinical trial, investigators must 
review guidelines about their participation in this trial.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_34911] y 
include:
General information
Informed consent
Pregnancy  prevention information

Contraceptives in current use
Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy
Prior to trial enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the 
importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors 
for an unintentional pregnancy .  The subject must sign an ICF stating that the above-
mentioned risk factors and the consequences were discussed with her.
During the trial, all women of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_35072] y if they  suspect they  might be pregnant ( eg, missed or late 
menstrual cy cle).
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to I MP 
administration, the I MP administration must be withheld until the results of serum 
pregnancy  tests are available.  If the pregnancy  is confirmed, the subject must not receive 
the IMP and must not be enrolled in the trial.  If pregn ancy  is suspected while the subject 
is taking the IMP, the IMP must be withheld immediately  (if reasonable, taking into 
consideration an y potential withdrawal risks) until the result of the pregnancy is known.  
If pregnancy  is confirmed, the I MP will be pe rmanently  discontinued in an appropriate 
manner ( eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y) and the subject withdrawn from 
the trial.  Exceptions to trial discontinuation may  be considered for life- threatening 
conditions only  after consultation as indicated in Appendix 2.
The investigator must immediately  notify  the sponsor (or sponsor’s designee) of any  
pregnancy  associated with I MP exposure, including at least [ADDRESS_34473] it to the sponsor (or sponsor’s designee).
Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow- up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy ( eg, x-ray studies).  Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.  In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor (or sponsor’s designee), on appropriate Pregnancy  
Surveillance form(s), follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , 
including perinatal and neonatal outcome.  Infants will be followed for a minimum of 
6months.

situation, unblinding of the IMP will not be dependent upon the investigator receiving 
approval from the sponsor /CRO medical monitor ( ie, the investigator will be able to 
obtain the code break information independent of the sponsor/CRO medical advisor).  
The investigator must contact [CONTACT_456]/CRO medical advisor b y telephone with an 
explanation of the need for opening the treatment assignment code within [ADDRESS_34475]’s medical record with the date and 
time the blind was broken and the names of the personnel involved.  Once the blind is

5.7.1. Follow -up of Nonserious A dverse Events
Nonserious AEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_35073].  All nonserious events that are ongoing at this 
time will be recorded as ongoing on the eCRF.
5.7.2. Follow -up of Post -Trial Serious A dverse Events
All SAEs that are identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_35074] 5.3.  This may  include unresolved previously  reported SAEs or new SAEs.  The 
investigator will follow SAEs until the events are resolved or the subject is lost to 
follow -up.  Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health, or 
the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s 
condition.  The investigator will continue to report any  significant follow -up information 
to OPDC up to the point the event has been resolved.
This trial requires th at subjects be activel y monitored for SAEs up to [ADDRESS_34476] or at an y other time point after the defined trial 
period ( ie, up to last scheduled contact).  The investigator should follow related SAEs 
identified after the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_35075] -up.  The investigator should continue to report an ysignificant follow -up

Pharmacokinetic samples will be anal yzed for brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE]) and its 
metabolite (s)and descriptive statistics will be calculated.  No formal statistical 
comparisons are planned.  A separate population or pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic 
modeling may  be performed using the data from this trial and other trials.
7.Statistical A nalysis
7.1. Sample Size
The sample size was calculated based on the treatment effect of 6.[ADDRESS_34477] 
deviation (SD) of 16.5 in the change from baseline (Day  0 visit) to the end of the 
double -blind treatment period (Week 12 visit) in the CMAI total score, to ac hieve 85% 
power at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05.  This results in 117 subjects in each of the groups 
(ie, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1mg/day, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2mg/day, and placebo).  After allowance of 
10% non-evaluable subjects, the total number of subjects to be rand omized is 132 per 
treatment arm .  The sample size was estimated based on a 1:1:1 randomization ratio 
(brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day , brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2mg/day , placebo).

7.2. Datasets for A nalysis
The following samples are defined for this trial:
Randomized: consists of all subjects who were randomized into this trial
Safety : consists of all subjects who were administered at least one dose of IMP
Efficacy : The intent -to-treat (ITT) population consists of all subjects in the 
randomized sample who took at least 1 dose of IMP (brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day , 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day , or placebo) and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline 
evaluation for the CMAI total score .
In general, baseline of an efficacy  endpoint is defined as the last observation of the 
endpoint before the subject is randomized.
The core dataset for all efficacy  anal yses is based on the ITT population, which is defined 
in the efficacy  sample above.  As will be described below, in order to handle missing data 
and restrictions imposed by  [CONTACT_35076] t ypes of analyses ( eg, change from baseline

7.4.1. Primary  Efficacy  Analysis
The primary  endpoint will be anal yzed using a nMMRM model.  The primary  efficac y 
outcome measure is the mean change from baseline (Day  0 visit) to the end of the 
double -blind treatment period (Week 12 visit) in the CMAI total score.  The primary  
statistical comparisons of interest are brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day versus placebo and 
brexpip razole 1 mg/day versus placebo.  The null hy potheses of these comparisons are 
that there is no difference between the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34912].  To protect the experiment- wise 
2-sided alpha level at 0.05 when making 2 comparisons of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34913], the statistical testing will be carried out using a hierarchical testing procedure in 
the order of 1) comparison of 2 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34777] 2) comparison 
of 1 mg/day  brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34778].  Thus, if the test y ields a statistically  
significant result at 0.05 ( 2-sided) for the comparison of 2 mg/day  brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34914], then the comparison of 1 mg/day  brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34915] 0.05 ( 2-sided) .
The statistical comparison will be performed b y the MMRM analysis with an 
unstructured variance covariance matrix for the repeated measures in which the change 
from baseline (Day  0 visit) in CMAI  total score (at We eks2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) will be 
the dependent variable based on the OC dataset.  The model will include fixed 
class -effect terms for treatment, trial center , visit week, and an interaction term of 
treatment b y visit week and include the interaction term of baseline values of CMAI  total 
score by [CONTACT_35077] a covariate.   The primary  comparison between brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34916] [ADDRESS_34478] squares 
(LS) means from the interaction term of treatment by  [CONTACT_35078].

The key  secondary  efficacy  variable is the change from baseline to endpoint in the CGI -S 
score, as relate d to agitation.  I t will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_35079], based on the ITT population.  
In order to control the overall ty pe I error rate for this key  secondary  efficacy  analy sis, a 
hierarchical testing procedure will be used so that the overall experiment -wise ty pe I 
error rate is maintained at 0.05.  Thus, if the primary  efficacy  anal ysis for the CMAI total 
score (as described in Section 7.4.1) y ields a statistically  significant result at 0.05 
(2-sided) for both of the comparisons of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day  and 2 mg/day  versus 
placebo, then the corresponding comparison for this key  secondary  efficacy variable 
(CGI -S score) will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05 ( 2-sided) using another hierarchical 
testing procedure in the order of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day  versus placebo and 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day  versus placebo.  Thus, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day  versus placebo 
will be tested only  if brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day versus placebo reaches significance at 0.05 
(2-sided) for this key  secondary  efficacy  variable.

Confidential -Otsuka Proprietary Information 118 10Sep 201512. Confidentiality
All information generated in this trial will be considered confidential and will not be 
disclosed to any one not directly  concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission.  Subject confidentialit y requirements of the region(s) where the trial 
is conducted will be met.  However, authorized regulatory  officials and sponsor personnel 
(or their representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and cop y the records.  All 
IMPs, subject bodil y flui ds, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely  in 
accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing b y the sponsor.
Subjects will be identified only  by [CONTACT_35091].  Per 
country  regulations, if subject initials cannot be collected, another unique identifier will 
be used.  Their full names may , however, be made known to a regulatory  agency  or other

13. Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make an y changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent and subsequent approval by  [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  Any  permanent change to the 
protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial site(s), must be handled 
as a protoc ol amendment.  Any  amendment will be written by  [CONTACT_456].  Each 
amendment will be submitted to the I RB/IEC.  Except for “administrative” or 
“nonsubstantial” amendments, investigators will wait for IRB/IEC approval of the 
amended protocol before implementing the change(s).  Administrative amendments are 
defined as having no effect on the safet y of subjects, conduct or management of the trial, 
trial design, or the quality or safet y of IMP(s) used in the trial.  A protocol change 
intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented 
immediately , followed by  [CONTACT_1744]/IEC notification within 5 working day s.  The sponsor will 
submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory  agencies.
When the I RB/IEC, investigators, and/or the s ponsor conclude that the protocol 
amendment substantially  alters the trial design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currently  approved written ICF will require similar modification.  I n such 
cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained before expecting continued participation.

Section [IP_ADDRESS] Actigraphy
Added section:
The CST will perform ongoing reviews of CMAI raters by [CONTACT_35108], 
including patterns of movement using actigraphy technology.  Motion 
will be collected through an actigraphy device resembling a wristwatch 
worn by [CONTACT_35109] 24 hours/day during 
the screening and treatment periods.  If the subject decides not to wear 
the actigraph at any time after the consent is obtained, the assessment 
may be discontinued and continued study participation will not be 
affected.  Study staff will be respons ible for uploading actigraphy data 
from the device to the actigraphy vendor at regular intervals 
corresponding to the date of the CMAI assessment. 
Actigraphy uses a portable Motionlogger device (actigraph) that records 
movement over extended periods of ti me and is most commonly worn on 
the wrist (refer to Appendix 6).  The actigraph accelerometers samples 
physical activity [ADDRESS_34513] data are typi[INVESTIGATOR_34935]’s epoch length (15 seconds, in this study).  The subject is 
advised to wear the actigraph continuously, at all times, including

confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.Clinical Study Report 331-12-[ADDRESS_34514]’s wrist, and it tracks the time 
that it is not being worn.  An event marker on the device can be used to 
mark t he occurrence of significant events such as bedtime, or the time of 
a rating (e.g., such as the CMAI).  The actigraph data will be 
downloaded from the device, verified, and transferred to Clinilabs’ core 
laboratory at each study visit (except the Day 3 vis it) by [CONTACT_35110] a 
docking station connected to a computer that allows communication 
with the software program on the computer.  The computer program 
summarizes these data and can display and print a histogram (called an 
actogram), which shows the su bject’s activity levels for each epoch over 
successive 24- hr periods. The computer program provides validated 
algorithms that summarize activity data. The data are then reviewed for 
active periods and rest periods.  The actigraph will be put on the subject
after the ICF/Assent is signed and taken off at the Week 12/ET visit.
Investigator progress notes as well as other efficacy data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_35111] -trial CMAI data quality oversight 
method.  Any clinically relevant findings gen erated by [CONTACT_35112], 
and measures may be taken to enhance training when needed.  Details 
of this CMAI quality review may be found in the Operations Manual.
Since actigraphy data a re tools to assist the CST in monitoring CMAI 
rater training, actigraphy information will not be made available to site 
personnel, and will not be statistically analyzed
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Electronic Diary (eDiary)
Added section:
The CST will perform ongoing reviews of CMAI raters by [CONTACT_35108], 
including daily behavior logs collected by [CONTACT_35113] 
(refer to Appendix 7).  Caregivers will record observations of the 29 
agitated behaviors listed in the CMAI as they occur using an eDiary.  All

ADDITIONAL RISK TO THE SUBJECT:
The addition of the requirement for performing an MRI/CT scan of the brain during 
screening to confirm eligibility for enrollment in the study does pose some additional 
risk to these subjects; however, the sponsor has determined that the benefit derived 
from confirming the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and from r uling out other causes 
for dementia in the subjects enrolled in this study outweighs the risks to the subjects.

Protocol 331 -12-283
Confidential -Otsuka Proprietary Information 285 10Sep 2015Amendment Number: 3
Issue Date: 07 Jul 2014
PURPOSE:
The sponsor has determined the need for a third formal amendment to the second 
amendm ent of the original protocol.  This amendment serves to reflect clarifications and 
additions to study  procedures intended to enhance subject safet y and accuracy of data.  In 
addition, administrative clarifications were made, including changes to text to en hance 
readabilit y and consistency ,and changes to correct ty pographical, punctuation, and 
formatting errors.  These changes were minor and do not change the design or content of 
the protocol, and therefore, are not summarized in this appendix.
The purpose of amending Protocol 331-12-283, issued 16 Dec 2013, was to:
  
  
 
 
Allow the inclusion of non- institutionalized subjects .
Clarify  the caregiver /caretaker requirements.
Modify  the Neurops ychiatric Inventory -Nursing Home scale (NPI -NH) by  [CONTACT_35139] -NH questions with the Distress questions from 
the Neurops ychiatric Inventory  (NPI) for subjects in a non-institutionalized setting.
Add the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) assessment for both 
non-institutionalized and institutionalized subjects.
Increase the number of planned trial centers from 55 to 75.
Modify  inclusion criteria #6 and #7.
Modify  exclusion criteria #8, #13, #14, #31, #32, and #40.
Remove exclusion criterion #27 (this resulted in renumbering of exclusion criteria 
#28 through #41) .
Change the anal ysis of the primary  and key  secondary  endpoints from the Hochberg 
procedure to a hierarchical testing procedure.
Add another primary  medical contact.
Change the medical monitor for Europe.

to care for the subject on a regular 
basis, has sufficient contact [CONTACT_35145]’s symptoms, and 
has direct observation of the 
subject’s behavior must be identified 
during the screening period for 
participation in the interview for the 
CMAI, NPI -NH, and other 
applicable trial assessments.   Subjects 
in a non -institutionalized se tting may 
have a caretaker as well as a caregiver. 
The subject’s caretaker is the person 
who lives with and cares for the 
subject on a regular basis .The 
caretaker may be supported in 
providing care to the subject by a 
professional(s), friend(s), or fami ly 
member(s).  T he subject’s caregiver is 
the person who has sufficient contact

when making 2 comparisons of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34955], 
the statistical testing will be carried 
out using Hochberg’s procedure for 
the primary efficacy endpoint.  The 
alpha used in the analysis of the key 
secondary endpoint is 0.05 ( 2-sided), 
if both of the comparisons of the 
higher dose groups versus placebo in 
the primary efficacy endpoint are 
statistically significant under the 
Hochberg procedure.
The Hochberg procedure at the alpha 
level of 0.05 (2 -sided) w ill be used for 
the [ADDRESS_34586] of 6.5 points 
with an SD of 16.5 in the change from 
baseline to the endpoint i n the CMAI 
total score, to achieve 8 0% power at a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.025 adjusted 
for 2 comparisons versus placebo 
(brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day versus 
placebo and brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day mg/day versus placebo.  To protect the

when making 2 comparisons of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34955], the 
statistical testing will be carried out 
using a hierarchical testing procedure 
in the order of 1) comparison of 2 
mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34956] 2) comparison of 1 mg/day 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34778].  Thus, if 
the test yields a statistically significant 
result at 0.05 ( 2-sided) for the 
comparison of 2 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34957], then the comparison of 
1 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_34958] s placebo 
will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05 
(two sided) Hochberg’s procedure for the primary efficacy endpoint.  The 
alpha used in the analysis of the key 
secondary endpoint is 0.05 (2 -sided), 
if both of the com parisons of the 
higher dose groups ver sus placebo in 
the primary efficacy endpoint are 
statistically significant under the 
Hochberg procedure .
If the primary efficacy analysis for the 
CMAI total score yields a statistically 
significant result at 0.05 ( 2-sided) for 
both of the comparisons of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day 
versus placebo, then the corresponding 
comparison for the key secondary 
efficacy variable (CGI -S score) will be 
tested at an alpha level of 0.05 (two -
sided) using another hierarchical 
testing procedure in the order of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day versus placebo 
and brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 mg/day versus 
placebo.  Thus, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 1 
mg/day versus placebo will be tested 
only if brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2 mg/day versus 
placebo reaches significance at 0.05

Trial RationaleIn light of the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) boxed warning 
of increased mortality with the use of 
antipsychotics in elderly subjects with 
dementia -related psychosis and 
similar caution advised by [CONTACT_35154], the clinical trial 
will be conducted in an environment 
that allows for close safety 
monitoring, specifically in subjects 
who are residing in a dementia unit, 
nursing home, assisted living facility, 
or any other residential care facility 
providing long -term care.  The 
settings wil l provide the type of 
medically supervised environment 
needed to closely monitor trial 
participants, particularly for events 
related to cardiac and pulmonary 
disease that may contribute to the risk 
of increased death.  In light of the Food and Drug

investigator's judgment, any abnormal 
ECG finding is deemed medically 
significant (impacting the safety of the 
subject and/or the interpretation of the 
study results) or meets an exclusion 
criterion (see Table 3.4.3 -1), the 
subject sho uld be excluded from the 
study. Abnormal results for ECGs 
should be repeated once at screening 
with [ADDRESS_34645] 
based on the criteria noted 
above. Each ECG recording should be 
taken approximately 5 minutes apart 
(the ECG result reported will be 
evaluated at each time point). The 
central ECG service will provide the 
corrections for the 3 ECGs performed.  
Based on the QT interval as corrected 
by [CONTACT_6550]’s formula (QTcF) 
reported by [CONTACT_35178], a 
subject will be excluded if the 
corrections are ≥450 msec in men and 
≥ 470 msec in women for 2 of the 3 
time points of the ECGs done.  If only 
1 ECG time point has a QTc Fof ≥450

Issue Date: 10 Sep 2015
PURPOSE:
The sponsor has determined the need for a fourth formal amendment.  This amendment 
serves to reflect clarifications and changes to trialprocedures intended to enhance subject 
safet y and accuracy of data , as well as to streamline the exclusion criteria .  In addition, 
administrative clarifications were made, including changes to text to enhance readability  
and consistency , and changes to correct ty pographical, punctuation, and formatting 
errors.  These changes were minor and do not change the design or content of the 
protocol, and therefore, are not summarized in this appendix.
The purpose of amending Protocol 331 -12-283, issued 07 Jul2014, was to:
Increase the number of screened subjects from 560 to 840 and the number of 
trialsites from 75 to 85.
Increase the time from enrollment of first subject to last subject’s last trial visit from 
4 to 4.5 y ears and the time for recruitment from 3.5 t o 4 y ears.
Broaden the definition of subjects in an institutionalized setting and add overnight 
passes (at the investigator’s discretion) for these subjects.
Broaden the location of trialvisits.
Add that the screening period can be extended or that subjects can be rescreened more 
than once with the approval of the medical monitor.
Modify  inclusion criteri on #8.
Modif yexclusion criteria #1, 3, 7, 8, 11, 13, 18, 21, 23, 30, 33, 36, and 39, and

resulted in the renumbering of the exclusion criteria. 
Remove HIV testing at screening.
Remove urinal ysis, prolactin, and urine pregnancy testing at Week 4 and Week 8.

  
Change telephone contact [CONTACT_35191] 3, 5, and 7 during the double -blind treatment 
period.
Change electron ic diaries to paper diaries , as well as remove the diary line item from 
Table 3.7-1 (Schedule of Assessments) ,remove Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Electronic Diary ), 
and remove Appendix 7 (Electronic Diary ).

Appendix 6
Actigraphy 
DescriptionActigraphy utilizes a portable device 
(actigraph) that records movement 
with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_35005].  The actigraph 
accelerometers samples physical 
activity [ADDRESS_34721] data are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_35006]’s 
epoch length (15 seconds, in this 
study).  The subject is advised to w ear 
the actigraph continuously, at all 
times, including during sleep 
beginning after the informed c onsent 
is signed to Week 12/ET.  If the 
subject must remove the device for 
any reason, the subject is instructed to 
place it back on the wrist as soon as 
possible.  The device is able to detect 
when it is not on the subject’s wrist, 
and it tracks the time that it is not 
being worn.  The actigraphy data w ill 
be downloaded from the device, 
verified, and transferred to Clinilabs’ 
core laboratory at each study visit 
(except the Day 3 visit)  by [CONTACT_35210] a docking station connected to a 
computer that allo ws communication 
with the software program on the 
computer.  A computer program 
summarizes these data and can display 
and print a histogram (called an 
actogram), which shows the subject’s 
activity levels for each epoch over 
successive [ADDRESS_34722] periods.
In addition, activity will be analyzed 
over each 24 -hour period (“Daily” 
intervals) for maximum, total and 
avera ge activity levels to understand 
the amount of day time movement 
from the subject and to evaluate 
restlessness, agitation, and increased 
random movements like those seen in 
akathisia.  Raw activity data will also (this appendix was removed)

be generated that allows the total 
number o f epochs with zero activity 
counts to be calculated during baseline 
and treatment period for both groups 
over each 24 -hour period.  In addition, 
for non -zero epochs, the mean activity 
can be calculated over each 24 -hour 
period.
To evaluate the diurnal activity 
patterns, the activity counts for one-
hour blocks at 8:00 am, 12:00 pm, 
4:00 pm, and 8:00 pm will be 
provided.  This w ill provide for the 
possibility of measuring “time of day” 
specific activity related to agitation.  
Since actigraphy will be collected 
twenty four hours per day for 
extended periods of time, sleep 
parameters will be evaluated as a 
continuous evaluation of these 
multiple day indices.  Sleep -wake 
patterns are estimated from periods of 
activity and inactivity ba sed on this 
movement during the rest period.  
Actigraphy is based on the principle 
that there is reduced movement during 
sleep and increased movement during 
wake.  The computer programs can 
estimate sleep and wake based upon 
computer algorithm -defined 
thresholds of activity.  Thus, the 
estimated sleep -wake parameters such 
as sleep latency, total sleep time, 
number and frequency of awakenings, 
sleep efficiency can be derived.  
Circadian rhythm parameters, such as 
the amplitude (peak -to-nadir 
difference) or a crophase (time of peak 
activity), can also be typi[INVESTIGATOR_35007].

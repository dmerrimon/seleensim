decreasing anxiety and promoting copi[INVESTIGATOR_516065] .  In this initial 
phase of the research, we will pi [INVESTIGATOR_397194] 25 malignant glioma  caregivers in order to 
assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.  
 
1.2 Specific Aims  
1) To refine a caregiver -directed intervention and study protocol based on acceptability feedback from 
an open pil ot study with exit interviews.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_668958] on a 
patient’s family and friends (“caregivers”). There is increasing recognition that caregivers who experience 
substantial distress related to their loved one’s serious medical illness have worse physical and 
psychological health, which also may negatively impact  the patient’s health and outcomes.5-[ADDRESS_668959] of the cancer on the patients’ 
central nervous system. Specifically, these caregivers m ust cope with their loved one’s progressive 
cognitive decline, personality and behavior changes, and accumulation of neurological d eficits as the 
disease progresses.15-18  This is physically, financially and emotio nally draining, and caregivers of patients 
with malignant gliomas experience poor quality of life and high rates of psychological distress.19-21 We 
conducted a prospective study of patients with newly diagnosed mal ignant glioma and their caregivers 
(DF/HCC 15 -500), with preliminary results demonstr ating that more than 50% of caregivers had 
clinically significant anxiety at the time of their loved one’s diagnosis, with almost two -thirds 
endorsing anxiety over their c ourse of illness.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_516066] m alignant gliomas, few interventions have been developed to address the unique supportive care and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_516067].[ADDRESS_668960] used qualitative data collected from caregivers of patients with malignant glioma 
(DF/HCC 15 -500 and DF/HCC 18 -171) to refine the intervention and ensure that it is targeted to the 
specific needs of this caregiver population. Our study population wil l include caregivers within the first 
six months of their loved one’s diagnosis with malignant glioma who report clinically significant anxiety. 
We opted to enroll caregiv ers with clinically significant anxiety as they are in greatest need of a behavioral 
intervention focused on their distress and concerns about their loved one’s health and diagnosis. Enrolled 
caregivers will participate in six weekly, cognitive -behavioral therapy -based, individual sessions with a 
mental health clinician, designed to provid e them with the strategies and copi[INVESTIGATOR_516068]’s illness. Findings from this project may inform the development of a 
future  randomized efficacy trial to demonstrate the impact of the intervention on caregiver s’ psychological 
outcomes, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and well -being.  
 
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
The population for this study will include English -speaking adults (age ≥ 18) who are  the primary 
caregiver for an individual diagnosed with a malignant glioma within the past [ADDRESS_668961] mild anxiety  symptoms, de fined as a 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) score 
of 5 or greate r. See Table 1 for a summary of study inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
 
Table 1. Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Rationale for inclusion/exclusion:  This research is focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_516069]. Only participants within 6 -months of their loved one’s brain tumor diagnosis are 
eligible to participate, as the intervention is targeted at the stres sors caregi vers may face during this time. 
Participants must be able to speak and read in English as we do not have the resources to c onduct the 
intervention in additional languages.  Participants must report clinically significant anxiety symptoms, 
defined as a Gene ralized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7) score ≥5 , as our intervention intends to address 
anxiety symptoms in caregivers. Caregivers deemed inappropriate for the study by [CONTACT_102]’s clinician 
or the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_516070].  Pregnant wom en will be included in the study. Adults 
unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults, and prisoners will not be included.

primary treating oncologist will be contacte d to inform them  that we plan to approach the patient’s 
caregiver for study participation and to inquire about any concerns regarding study participation. If 
clinicians have specific concerns about the appropriateness of enrolling a particular caregiver, w e will 
not conta ct that caregiver.  
 
9.2 Enrollment  
A member of study staff (e.g. PI, Research Assistants) will obtain informed consent in  person prior to 
initiating any study measures. Participants will be c onsented next time they are in clinic. Research 
assis tants, all of wh om previously have received CITI and consent training, will be provided study -
specific recruitment training. Caregivers who would like more time to consider participation at in -clinic 
approach are able to take the consent forms home with th em to review. Ca regivers will be provided with 
study staff contact [CONTACT_516084].  
 
9.3 Registration  
Study staff will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore 
as required by D F/HCC SOP REGIS T-101 after the participant completes the brief enrollment survey. 
Caregivers who report GAD -7 scores <5  will be considered ineligible for the study and will not be 
registered in OnCore. If a caregiver’s GAD -[ADDRESS_668964] -intervention

9.5 Selection of Instruments  
 
9.5.1 7 -Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) 
The GAD -7 (Appendix 31. 01)[ADDRESS_668965] 2 
weeks us ing a likert -type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly eve ry day).  Scores of 5 to 9 are 
categorized as mild anxiety, scores of 10 to 14 as moderate anxiety, and scores of 15 or greater as severe 
anxiety. Patients with scores ≥ 5  on the GAD -7 (mild  symptomatology ) will be eligible for 
participation.25 The estimate d time for completing this scale is 1 -3 minutes.  
 
 
9.5.2 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)  
We will use the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) to assess symptoms of depression and 
anxiety in all study participants. The HADS is a [ADDRESS_668966] week ( Appendix 31 .02)26. Used 
extensively in samples of patients with cancer and their caregivers, the questionna ire consists of a four -
point item response format that quantifies the degree to which participants experience mood symptoms. 
Scores on each subscale range from 0 to 21, with a cutoff of 8 or greater denoting clinically significant  
anxiety or depression.  T he estimated time for completing this scale is 2 -5 minutes.  
 
9.5.3 Brief Demographic Survey  
This includes self -reported information about participants’ gender, race, ethnicity, religion, education, 
relationship status, household members, employment status,  relationship to the patient, and years they 
have known the patient. It is estimated that these qu estions ( Appendix 31 .03) will take approximately [ADDRESS_668967] information for participants and information necessary for 
registration in OnCore, including full name, address, phone number(s), email address, and date of birth. 
It also asks participants their preferr ed mode of communication with the stu dy team (phone, text, or 
email). It is estimated that these questions ( Append ix 31 .04) will take approximately 1 -3 minutes to 
complete.  
 
9.5.5 Caregiver Quality of Life (QoL)  
We wi ll use the CareGiver Oncology QoL que stionnaire (CarGOQoL), a 29 -item, well -validated 
instrument specific to caregivers for patients with cancer, to measure family caregiver QoL in multiple 
domains.27  It is estimat ed that the CarGOQoL ( Appendix 31 .05) will take approximately 2 -4 minutes to 
complete.  
 
9.5.6 Caregiving Burden  
Caregiving burden will be measured using the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA).28 It is esti mated 
that this tool ( Appendix 31 .06) will take approximately 3 -5 minutes to complete  
 
9.5.7 Self-Efficacy  
We will use the Lewis Cancer Self -Efficacy Scale (CASE) to measure caregivers’ confidence in 
managing the impact of their loved one’s illness.29  The CASE questio nnaire is included as Appendix 
31.07 and will take approximately 2 -4 min utes to complete.  
 
9.5.8 Perceived Copi[INVESTIGATOR_516072] (MOCS) to assess caregivers’ self -perceived status on skills 
targeted by [CONTACT_516085] y to relax, recognizing stress -inducing situations, 
restruc turing maladaptive thoughts, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].30  The MOCS is included as Appendix 31 .08.  It is 
estimated that the MOCS will take approximately 2 -4 minutes to comple te. 
 
9.5.9 Qualitative Exit Interview  
We will use a semi -structured interview guide that will explore 1) caregiver perception of the 
acceptability and content of the intervention; and 2) caregiver perceptions of the benefits of receiving 
the intervention. Facilitators will use probes to obtain comprehensive unders tanding of the caregivers’ 
perspectives. The semi -structured interview  guide is detailed in Appendix [ADDRESS_668968] 
approximately 30 minutes.  
 
9.6 Description of Intervention  
We utilized the findings f rom our longitudinal and qualitative studies and a thorough review of the 
literature to identify the necessary components of our planned caregiver in tervention. The preliminary 
content includes three essential components: 1) a psychoeducational component t o address preparedness, 
manage expectations, and develop caregiving skills; 2) a psychosocial component focusing on copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274], mindfulness, a nd facilitating acceptance while living with uncertainty; and 3) a self -care 
component to promote caregiver  health and well -being. We anticipate that the psychological 
intervention will consist of six individual sessions ( 45 minutes each), which will provi de sufficient dose 
to promote effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_516073]. Whenever possible, we will coo rdinate 
sessions with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516074]  (using a HIPAA -
compliant video platform provided by [CONTACT_4224] H TeleHealth ) to minimize participant burden and facilitate 
adherence. The intervention will be delivered b y a social worker or psychologist in the MGH Cancer 
Center, specifically trained on the intervention content and delivery. Interventionists may conta ct 
caregivers directly via text message, phone call, or email  to coordinate session scheduling  only. No 
identifying information will be shared via text or email; these will be used solely for scheduling 
purposes.  In the Locator Form (Appendix 31. 04), participants will be asked to indicate their preferred 
method of communic ation (phone call, text, or email), and the study team will use this response to 
determine how to contact [CONTACT_4317].   In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will  enroll [ADDRESS_668969] refined  the intervention to tailor 
it to the needs specific to this population of caregivers, based on our qualitative interview data .  
 
9.7 Instrument Administration  
A member of study staff trained in qualitative interviewing will facilitate the interview s over the phone 
or in person using a semi -structured interview guide with open -ended questions  and response probes 
(Appendix 31. 09), and the interview will last approximately 30 minutes. All interviews will be audio -
recorded; study staff will ask for permission to turn on the  audio -recorder prior to beginnin g each 
interview.  A script for administration of the qualitative interview over the phone is included as 
Appendix 31.1 4. 
 
The brief en rollment survey (Appendi ces 31.03, 31.04) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
measure ( Appendix 31.01 ) may be completed by [CONTACT_516086] , online using a 
secure website (REDCap), over the phone, or in clinic at MGH, in accordance with participant 
preferences and availability.  The message templates for administration of the GAD -[ADDRESS_668970] a 
GAD -7 score ≥5 will be registered in OnCore and complete the  qualitative interview. Caregivers with 
GAD -7 scores <5 will be considered ineligible for the study.  If a caregiver is ineligible based on his or 
her GAD -7 score but is still interested in the study, we will re-approach in 3 months and re -administer 
the GAD -7. 
 
10.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
N/A 
 
11.[ADDRESS_668971] 70% (+/ - 18%) of eligible caregivers are enrolled in the study and if at least 70% of 
enrolled participants complete ≥50% of the sessions.31-[ADDRESS_668972] Practices for Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences.35  Study  staff will 
independently review the transcripts to create a thematic framework for interpretation.  Two individuals, 
including the Principal Investigator , will independently code  the data to enhance validity and credibility, 
until high reliability is achi eved (Kappa>0.80). The planned sample size will allow us to collect 
comprehensive feedback and ensures sufficient number of participants to achieve thematic saturation.  In 
an exp loratory analysis, we will also examine changes in caregiver -reported outcome s from baseline to 
post-intervention using paired t -tests.

12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
N/A. This study does not involve more than Minimal Risk to subjects.  
 
 
13.[ADDRESS_668974] will be notified. Additionally, we will offer 
participants who remain distressed an opportunity to meet with either the principal investigator ([CONTACT_516104]) or a clinical psychologist ([CONTACT_516105] ph Greer, a co -investigator) to help address their 
distress.  Should participants require further support, we will offer them an opportunity to meet with the 
MGH Neuro Oncology Clinic social worker for additional follow -up. 
 
 
15.[ADDRESS_668975] demonstrated that more than 50% of caregivers of patients with malignant 
gliomas have clinically significant anxiety at the time of their loved one’s diagnosis, with almost two -
thirds endorsing anxiety over their course of illness. Th e proposed psychological intervention aims to 
decrease anxiety and promote copi[INVESTIGATOR_516075]. Participation in this 
study may help to improve caregivers’ mental health by [CONTACT_516091][INVESTIGATOR_516076]. 
 
 
16.0 Vulnerable Populations  
We plan to include pregnant women in this study. As this is a psychological and behavioral study only, 
additional safeguards are not needed for this population.  No other vulnerable populations will be 
included in this study.  
 
17.0 Community -Based Participatory Research  
N/A 
18.[ADDRESS_668976] ([CONTACT_516106]) is responsible for full oversight of the project. [CONTACT_516106] 
currently has 60% of her time protected to conduct research activities. She will be meeting with study 
staff on weekly basis (and more often as urgent iss ues arise) to ensure the study  process is being 
followed accurately and to address potential challenges or issues as t hey may arise. [CONTACT_516106] is a 
member of the MGH Cancer Outcomes Research Program (CORe).  CORe has extensive experience 
conducting support ive care intervention studies in oncology and has the necessary expertise to ensure 
the success of the proposed project. Research coordinators, all of whom previously have received CITI 
and consent training, will be provided study -specific recruitment trai ning.  
20.2 Other Resources  
There ar e approximately 100 new malignant glioma patients in the Yawkey 9E Brain Tumor Clinic each 
year, so we will need to recruit abou t 33% of these patients’ caregivers in order to reach our target 
accrual of [ADDRESS_668977] data via a HIPAA w aiver. This 
will ensure that caregivers are potentially eligible to participate in the study prior to contact[CONTACT_516083]. Prior to contact[CONTACT_516080], the p atient’s 
primary treating oncologist  will be contact[CONTACT_516092]’s caregiver for s tudy participation and to inquire about any concerns regarding study 
participation. The email template  for obtaining permis sion from oncologists  is included as  Appendi x 
31.[ADDRESS_668978] that caregiver.  
 
A member of study staff (e.g. PI, Research Assistants)  will obtain informed consent in -person prior to 
initiating any study measures. Research assistants, all of whom previously have received CITI and consent 
training, will be provided study -specific recruitment training. C aregivers who would like more time t o 
consider participation at in -clinic approach are able to take the consent forms home with them to review. 
Caregivers will be provided with study staff contact [CONTACT_516093].  
 
Study staff will regis ter eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore 
as required by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC SOP REGIST -101 after the participant completes the brief enrollment survey. 
Caregivers who report GAD -7 scores <5  will be considered ineligible for the s tudy and will not be 
registered in OnCore. Caregivers who do not complete the brief enrollment survey will not be registered 
in OnCore.  
 
23.0 Local Number of Subjects  
A total of 25 subjects  (excluding screen failures)  will b e accrued locally. We expect more th an 50% to 
demonstrate at least mild anxiety (GAD -7 score of 5 or greater)  so total accrual of no more than [ADDRESS_668979] participant inform ation and confidentiality, all data will be stored in locked cabinets in

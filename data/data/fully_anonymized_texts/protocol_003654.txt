Exalenz Bioscience Ltd.    201 8  CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Study Population:  Subjects  that are  enrolled into either of two separate BMS sponsored IND 
studies (MB130 -068, MB130 -069) at selected study sites  will be offered  the 
opportunity  to perform the MBT . These will be considered as two separate 
study cohorts (cohort 1  and 2, respectively)  within this companion protocol.  
Each cohort consists of four treatment arms (BMS -986036 10mg, 20mg, 
40mg QW or matching placebo QW) , as defined in the respective BMS 
sponsored protocols.  
 
Cohort 1 consists of Subjects  with NASH and stage 3 fibrosis , as assessed 
by a central laboratory reader of the liver biops ies (n=160 ), and who  meet all 
the MB130 -068 study criteria . 
 
Cohort 2  consists of Subjects  with NASH and compensated  liver cirrhosis  
(stage 4 fibrosis) , as assessed by a central laboratory reader of the liver 
biops ies (n=100 ), and who  meet all the MB130 -069 study criteria.  
 
This feasibility companion protocol will include the 2 cohorts of subjects , 
with a planned total of up to 260 subjects from approximately 75 sites 
worldwide ([LOCATION_003]  and Japan ) for the two BMS IND studies, while the MBT 
will only be conducted in the [LOCATION_003] .  
Not all participating sites will elect to perform the MBT. The total number 
of subjects expected to perform the MBT may reach up to 250 subjects  (also 
accounting for drop outs) . Each subject will perform up to 3 MBTs over 1 
year; approximately on e every 24 weeks . 
Primary Efficacy 
Objectives:  To demonstrate the ability of the MBT to evaluate patient response to 
treatment with BMS -986036 , comparing placebo to each treatment arm  
individually . Assessment will be performed at the 24 and 48 week visits and 
compared to  day 1 (change from baseline) and the respective preceding visit  
(change between visits) , when available . Assessments will be done for each 
study cohort independently , according to availability , and on the combined 
population of the two  cohorts  by [CONTACT_551939] .

1. To demonstrate the short and long -term prognostic value (3 
months , 6 months and 1 year, respectively) of MBT for liver 
disease deterioration  (reported as liver -related clinical outcome 
events) . Assessment will be performed using MBT from the day 1, 
and [ADDRESS_725430]  biopsy 
proven changes in fibrosis and/or NAS  as assessed by a central 
reader  at week 24 (or at least week 20 in case s of an  early 
termination time point) ( for cohort 1 ) or at week 48 ( for cohort 2 ) 
compared to the baseline biopsy from the screening visit.  
3. To assess the ability of changes in the MBT to  reflect  changes in 
liver stiffness as measured by [CONTACT_551942] 
(MRE) where available at weeks 24 and 48 (or at early termination)  
compared to baseline MRE from the screening visit . 
4. To assess the ability of changes in the MBT to  reflect  changes in 
Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) as measured by [CONTACT_235277] (MRI)  where available - at weeks 24  and 48 (or 
early termination), compared to baseline  MRI from the screening 
visit.  
 
To assess the ability of changes in the MBT to reflect changes in Serum Pro -

companion protocol as two separate study cohorts  (1 and 2, respectively)  
with the exception of the MBT . The MB130 -068 and MB130 -069 studies 
are Phase 2b, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of BMS -
986036 in the treatmen t of subjects with NASH and stage 3 liver fibrosis or 
compensated cirrhosis with up to 48 weeks of treatment.  The study is 
feasibility for drug response monitoring however the data may be 
used for Exalenz for future submissions . 
 
As de scrib ed in the BMS protocols, subjects will be enrolled and 
randomized via intera ctive response technology (IRT)  to receive BMS -
9860936 10mg QW, BMS -986036 20mg QW, BMS -9860936 40mg QW or 
matching placebo QW in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.  
 
The BMS studies' treatment durations will each  consist of two periods:  
1. A 48 -week, Double -Blind Treatment Period, during which the 
subjects will receive blinded study medication (BMS -986036 
10mg, 20 mg, 40mg QW or matching placebo QW). During the 
Double -Blind Treatment Period, subjects will be evaluated for 
safety and efficacy  every 4 weeks (±5 days) through week 24 and 
every 8 weeks (±5 days) from week [ADDRESS_725433] 6 months and up to 14 months after 
the week 52/  PTFU Visit for the collection of additional DXA 
assessment (in all participants) and immunogenicity assessments 
(in participants for whom Long -Term Immunogenicity Follow -Up 
Visits are required.)  Any liver related complica tion event will be 
recorded.

Exalenz Bioscience Ltd.    201 8  CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  3 BACKGROUND  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic 
liver disease in the world today. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the most  
progressive form of NAFLD, is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis and 
inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning), with or without fibrosis. NASH is 
associated with increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular -, liver -, and cancer -related  
deaths.   
Currently, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of NASH. With the increasing 
prevalence of obesity and obesity -related diseases, NASH could soon become the leading  
indication for liver transplantation and the leading cause of hepatocellu lar carcinoma 
(HCC). There is an urgent need to develop preventative and therapeutic strategies against 
NASH , as clearly described in the BMS' -studies main protocol s. 
Standard biochemical and clinical tests are not capable of providing good correlation s with 
disease staging and grading. Furthermore, it is known that in a substantial percentage of the 
diseased population, standard liver function tests do not show abnormal results . 
Histolog ical parameters have  been  shown to be correlated to liver  disease severity ,(1) but 
biopsies have limitations such as sampling error and the risks involved in the biopsy 
procedure  itself . Furthermore, biopsies are not a measure that can be repeated often enough 
in standard practice in order to monitor disease progression  and effect of  therapeutic 
treatments.  
The unmet clinical need for a non -invasive means to evaluate liver disease progression or 
response to therapy accurately is clearly a challenge that needs to be addressed as new 
NASH treatments are being developed.  
The concept of a  metabolic test that could be utilized to assess the severity of liver disease 
was first explored several decades ago. Such tests are performed by [CONTACT_17801] a 
compound , either orally or intravenously, with the compound being taken up by [CONTACT_551946] . The end -products of the metabolic process can be measured in either blood, 
bile, urine, saliva or exhaled breath, supplying a measurable value to the level of liver 
metabolic activity . Several compounds have been utilized to evaluate hepatic met abolic 
function in this manner, including indocyanine green, galactose, aminopyrine, caffeine, 
lidocaine, phenylalanine, Methacetin (N -(4-Methoxy -phenyl) acetamide) and Octanoate 
(sodium -octanoate). For example, previous studies have demonstrated that hepa tic 
metabolism of lidocaine to monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) decreases with liver 
fibrosis and cirrhosis and improves with successful treatment of the underlying liver 
disease. Furthermore, these studies showed the lidocaine test could  accurately predict

cases are estimated to be due to NAFLD (NAFL or NASH). In those who have 
concomitant features of the metabolic syndrome, the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_551935] 90%. It is also known that in a substantial percentage of the diseased population, 
standard t ests do not show abnormal results, especially in the NAFLD population.  
Furthermore, the standard biochemical and clinical tests do not provide good correlation 
with disease staging and grading.  
Currently, such subjects  are offered a liver biopsy as standard of care to diagnose NASH 
and assess the risk of potential cirrhosis. Although histology results have been shown to be 
correlated to liver disease severity ,(1), biopsies have limitations such as sampling error and 
risks involved in the actual biopsy procedur e. Additionally, given the sheer numbers of 
subjects with NASH in the world, it is not logistically feasible to biopsy all subjects with 
NASH. Furthermore, biopsies are not a measure that can be repeated often enough in 
standard practice in order to monito r disease progression  or response to treatment . 
Based on all of the above, there is a great need for a simple non -invasive method to assess 
and monitor disease progression in the NAFLD/NASH population . 
Breath testing with 13C-labeled substrates provides a safe, non -invasive means for 
evaluating hepatic impairment as it pertains to liver metabolic function. 13C is a stable, non -
radioactive isotope, which can be incorporated into a specific location within a test 
substrate so it can be metabolized to 13CO [ADDRESS_725445] update : February 20, 2018

marketing in Europe and cleared in the [LOCATION_003] for other disease testing, namely  H. pylori

The 13C-labeled substrates (in this case 13C-Metha cetin) are meta bolized by [CONTACT_551947] (in this case the liver), producing 13CO 2 which in turn leads to changes 
in the 13CO 2/12CO [ADDRESS_725446] 's exhaled breath over time. These ratio changes are 
displayed in real time on the device's screen and printed at the  end of  the test. 
Breath tests using the 13C-Methacetin are being evaluated in this protocol in an attempt to 
find an effective non-invasiv e tool to monitor liver disease progression/regression with and

cumbersome to perform and the acquisition of results is slow . The recent development of 
the BreathID® MCS  analyzer offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate a metabolism -
based test showing agreement with disease progression /regression  and liver biopsy  
measures.  
In advanced liver disorders, the liver has reduced Methacetin metabolic capacity , leading to 
low MBT values. Low values of Methacetin metabolism are suggestive of Subjects  who 
have advanced liver disease. Several MBT output variables (percentage dose recovery rate 
and cumulative percentage dose recovered - PDR/CPDR values at different time points  and 
their combination ) may be used to assess  metabolic capacity and subsequently liver  disease 
progression /regression . 
It has been shown in preliminary studies that MBT  correlate s with both CTP and MELD 
values. It may be even more sensitive and a better predictor of liver function because 
generally function deteriorates prior to the development of complications of cirrhosis and a 
decline in liver function as assessed by [CONTACT_551948](3).  
It is hypothesized that a decline in liver function as assessed by [CONTACT_551949] ( such as 
variceal bl eeding, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy) and worsening in liver function as 
assessed by [CONTACT_551950] . 
The MBT , by [CONTACT_551951] , could aid in decision making in Subjects  with 
cirrhosis awaiting liver transplant. Such a test may in the future help in  decision -making

[IP_ADDRESS]  Histological Assessments  
The NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) system will be used to score the histologic 
samples. The NASH CRN system is based on the concept that necro -inflammatory lesions 
and stage of fibrosis should be evaluated separately; it assesses liver biopsies for degree of 
steatosis (0 -3), lobular inflammation (0 -3), hepatocellular ballooning (0 -2), and fibrosis (0 -
4). The first 3 components are added together in an unweighted fashion to determine the 
NASH activity score (NAS) that ranges from 0 to 8. Fibrosis is staged separately on a 0 -4 
scale: 0 (none); 1 (perisinusoidal or periportal); 2 (perisinusoidal and porta l/periportal); 3 
(bridging fibrosis); 4 (cirrhosis). It should be noted , the NAS should not be considered a 
replacement for a p athologist’s diagnosis of NASH.

7.7.3 Magnetic Resonance Elastography  (MRE)  
Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE ) is a non-invasive  medical imaging technique 
that measures the stiffness of soft tissues by [CONTACT_551961]. In NASH Subjects , MRE is reproducible, and it has a higher inter -
observer agreement for staging fibrosis compared to histopathology. Additionally, an 
improvement in MRE has been associated with an improvement in liver fibrosis, as 
observed on liver biopsy.  
While the abil ity to perform MRE is expanding, appropriate hardware and software is not 
available at every institution and therefore, MRE use is still limited. In this study, MRE 
will only be conducted at selected sites with MRE  capability . Images will be collected by 
[CONTACT_57113].  Last update : February 20, 2018

Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance t hat are not directly associated with 
the objectives of the study should be evaluated and handled by [CONTACT_551962]’s standard of care and clinical judgment.  
MRE will be performed at selected sites at Screening,  week 24 and week 48 or early 
termination.  
For subjects discontinuing study treatment, MRE will only be conducted if the date of 
discontinuation is more than 8 weeks from the date of the previous MRE.  
7.7.4 Fibroscan® Elastography  
Fibroscan® is a non -invasive device that assesses the ‘hardness’ (or stiffness) of the liver 
via the technique of transient elastography. This procedure will only be performed for 
study cohort 2. Liver hardness is evaluated by [CONTACT_551963] a vibration w ave 
(also called a ‘shear wave’) generated on the skin. Shear wave velocity is determined by 
[CONTACT_232793] a particular depth inside the liver. 
Because fibrous tissue is harder than normal liver, the degree of hep atic fibrosis can be 
inferred from the liver hardness.  
With the subject lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], an ultrasound -like probe is placed on the skin over the liver 
area, typi[INVESTIGATOR_232745] -axillary line. The subject will feel a gentle ‘flick’ each time 
a vibration  wave is generated by [CONTACT_32975].  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_725463] a 60% success rate and an interquartile range 
of ≤ 30% of the median value, are taken with the results expressed in kilopascals (kPa).  
7.7.5 Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI)  
At selected sites, proton density hepatic fat fraction Hepatic Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI ) will be employed to determine hepatic fat fraction.  This is a non -invasive and 
accurate MRI -based biomarker utilized for liver fat quantification  by [CONTACT_35755] t he

Blood samples will be collected at each visit for the assessment of exploratory biomarkers. 
Exploratory biomarkers in serum, plasma, and whole blood, will be used to assess markers 
of fibrosis and associated diseases and pathwa ys (including cardiovascular disease, 
inflammation, diabetes, kidney disease as well as liver disease, and possibly bone). These 
studies include  amongst others , Serum Pro -C3, AN N-terminal propeptide of type 3 
procollagen (P3NP) and specific fragment of MM P-9-mediated degradation of type III 
collagen (C3M)

The Child -Turcotte -Pugh (CTP) score assesses the severity of cirrhosis  and will be done 
for cohort [ADDRESS_725465] spectrum 
of liver disease. It employs numerical scores of 5 measures of liver disease: total bilirubin, 
serum albumin, international normalized ratio for INR, ascites, and encephalopathy and is

The 13C-Methacetin Breath Test ( MBT ) is a non -invasive tool that provides an estimate of 
liver function by [CONTACT_551965] t o metabolize the non -radioactive 13C-
labeled Methacetin. MBT measures carbon dioxide exhaled into a nasal cannula before and 
after drinking a non -radioactive solution (called ¹³C-methacetin), using a device called the 
BreathID® MCS device. The amount of 13carbon dioxide (13CO 2) exhaled over 60 -85 
minutes will then be measured. The MBT, which consists of both a device and an 
unapproved drug component, is considered an investigational device that has not been 
reviewed, approved or cleared by [CONTACT_551966].  
In Subjects  evaluated/listed for liver transplantation, a reduction in exhaled 13CO 2 has been 
associated with an increased risk of cirrhotic complications (3). MBT will be conducted at 
selected sites in subjects who provide consent . The test will be performed after an [ADDRESS_725467] according to study guidelines and as per the manufacturer ’s instructions.

Preparation of 13C-Methacetin  
Exalenz Bioscience Ltd. will provide 75 mg 13C-Methacetin doses in a 0.05% solution of 
¹³C-Methacetin in purified water, supplied, in amber thermoplastic polyester (PET) bottles 
with a child resistant plastic  cap. No preparation is needed other than pouring the contents 
of the solution into a cup for ingestion.  
Performance of the breath test  
Only trained personnel  will perform the breath test procedure. The actual breath collection 
is automatically performed b y the device and is not operator dependent. If the IDcircuit (a 
nasal cannula manufactured specifically for Exalenz) is not connected properly to the 
subject (e.g. the breath does not reach the device), the BreathID® MCS device will prompt 
the operator to adjust the IDcircuit.  
1. Turn on the device from the switch in the rear and allow up to [ADDRESS_725488], ensure that the BreathID® MCS screen shows that 
the device is in ‘Ready’ state.  
2. The IDcircuit will be attached to the BreathID® MCS device and to the patient. 
Pressing the “Start” button on the device will begin the collection of the patient’s 
baseline exhaled breath. This will take approximately 5 -10 minutes.  
3. The 13C-Methacetin solution is poured into a disposable cup and administrated to 
the patient when prompted by [CONTACT_8121]. The solution should be administered by a 
medical practitioner registered on the delegation log or a research nurse if specific 
training for administration has been given. Immediately after ingestion, the operator  
will press the "Continue" button , which activates the actual measurement. CO [ADDRESS_725489] update : February 20, 2018

4. The patient should re main in a seated position breathing in a normal manner for up 
to 85 minu tes, while data is collected.  
5. The BreathID® MCS device continuously measures and analyzes the patient’s 
exhaled breath in real time. As the 13C-Methacetin is metabolized, the value of the 
13CO 2/12CO [ADDRESS_725490] patient’s breath, or if there is any other 
deviation from the desired test requirements, the device will pr oduce an appropriate 
warning message on the screen.

completed and a printout will be generated. T he IDcircuit is then removed and the 
patient is disconnected from the BreathID® MCS device.  
The patient will be under the supervision of the physician or any other qualified medical 
staff during the entire test.  
The operators will be trained how to terminate the breath test early. In the following 
situations, the MBT  will be terminated and a termination form will be completed:

Co-Investigators:  Ron Jacob, M.D., Paul Leslie, M.D., R. Ward Pulliam, M.D., Melissa

Background  
 
Millions of people in the [LOCATION_002] and around the world have an implanted car diac device. Between 
1993 and 2009, overall pacemaker use increased by 50%, with 2.9 million permanent pacemakers 
implanted (Ferreira, et al, 2014). As of 2003, an estimated three million people met implant criteria for an 
implantable cardiac defibrillator  (ICD) for either primary or secondary prevention (Nazarian, et al, 2006). 
It is further estimated that up to 75% of patients with a pacemaker or ICD will need medical magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) at some point following device implant (Nazarian, et al , 2006). Patients over [ADDRESS_403796] 3 -D analysis. MRI is particularly good for soft 
tissue imaging and is the preferred imaging method for many neurological and musculoskeletal 
conditions (Mollerus, Albin, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_61222], & Lucca, 2008) . In addition to its superior imaging characteristics, 
MRI does not expose patients to ionizing radiation.  
 
Pacemakers and ICDs have long been considered an absolute contraindication MRI due to concerns of 
the potential interactions between MRI and implan table cardiac devices including:  
 
 Tissue heating, especially at the lead tip/myocardial interface  
 Induction of ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation  
 Pacemaker reset  
 Reed switch closure, resulting in suspension of tachyarrhythmia detection/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 Inhibition of pacing  
 Increased pacing threshold/failure to capture  
 Damage to circuitry  
 
In recent years, however, several studies have concluded that MRI can be safe for patients with non -MRI 
conditional pacemakers and/o r ICDs (Nazarian, et al, 2006, 2011). In these studies, investigators limited 
the MRI scans to magnet s generating a field of 1.5 Tesla. Initially, the specific absorption rate (SAR) was 
limited to ≤ 2.0 W/kg, but as investigators found no association betwe en SAR and the device variables 
studied, that restriction was later removed (Nazaraian, 2011). In 2011 Nazarian, et al published the 
results of their study of patients with pacemakers (237) or ICDs (201) who underwent  medically indicated 
MRI. The study ind icated that MRI is safe for pacemaker and ICD patients when appropriate screening 
protocols are in place and followed, with no immediate or long -term events requiring lead or system 
revision or reprogramming (Nazarian, et al., 2011) . A 2008 study determine d that MRI scanning did not 
cause sufficient damage to the myocardium to produce a significant rise in troponin -I levels (Mollerus, 
Albin, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_61222], & Lucca, 2008) . In 2009, Mollerus et al also determined that device patients undergoing 
MRI did not have an y increase in arrhythmic activity during the scan (Molerus, Albin, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_61222], & Lucca, 
2009) .  
 
Registry Purpose  
 
This registry is a pro spective single institution study  of MRI examinations in patients with pacemakers or 
ICD’s who will undergo an MRI that i s ordered for routine clinical care. The purpose of the registry is to 
P a g e  2 | 9 
MRI protocol v 7.0 
7/17/[ADDRESS_403797] physicians’ diagnostic choices for this patient population. Patients with 
conditions for whom MRI is the best diagnostic modality but who have not been able to under go MRI 
scanning may be able to do so  through registry participation. The diagnostic information obtained from 
the scan  may assist physicians’ treatment decisions and may ultimately affect patient outcomes.  
 
In addition, to our knowledge, previous registri es of MRI’s in non -conditional cardiac devices have been 
limited to academic centers. This registry would be among the first to demonstrate the feasibility and 
safety of this approach in a community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].  
 
Study Methods  
 
The registry research i nvolves acquiring and analyzing the data of device function and adverse events 
related to the MRI scan.  
 
The need for MRI will be determined on a case -by-case basis  based on the patient’s medical history and 
treatment plan/goals, independent of the registry and research purposes. Only patients with implanted 
devices with orders for clinically indicated MRI scans will be considered for registry inclusion. Clinical 
review will be performed and the pa tient considered after determination that no other imaging modality 
would be appropriate.  
 
The appropriateness of the MRI study must be discussed,  in person or via phone call , between a  cardiac  
radiologist , as determined by  [CONTACT_327340], M.D., and the requ esting physician. The discussion should 
include c onsideration of alternative imaging modalities and d iagnostic quality of MRI imaging of 
requested body region given implanted device(s) .  The requesting  physician is then responsible for 
discussing  with the patient and/or their medical proxy the reasoning for t he determination, based on the 
final decision  made by a radiologist.  
 
All patients will be screened prior to enrollment. Any patient  with any commercially available pacemaker 
or ICD system implanted aft er 2001 who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria, and who require a medically -indicated MRI as described above will be eligible to enroll in the 
study. The presence/absence of capped/abandoned/epi[INVESTIGATOR_327335]/subcutaneous coil will be confirmed 
and documented by [CONTACT_327341] x -ray obtained .  The x -ray must post -date the most 
recent device/lead intervention , as determined by a review of the patient’s medical record.  
 
If an MRI procedure is deemed absolutely necessary, the MRI will be performed at the Lancaster 
General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327336]. MRI scan sequences , field intensity and field(s) of exposure 
will be selected to minimize risk to the patient while gaining needed diagnostic information for diagnosis 
or therapy management.  
 
The MRI will be performed with a 1.5 T scanner utilizing institutional protocols and the following settings:  
 
 Normal operating mode  
 SAR ≤ 2.0 W/kg per patient.  
 
Prior to the proce dure, a pacemaker technologist or manufacturer clinical representative will interrogate 
the pacemaker or ICD and record the following parameters:  
 
 Patient’s underlying rhythm  
 Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds  
 P-wave and R -wave amplitude  
P a g e  3 | 9 
MRI protocol v 7.0 
7/17/17   Lead impedance (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)  
 Battery voltage  
 Arrhythmia history  
 Tachyarrhythmia therapy  
 
The following pacemaker/ICD parameters will be deactivated for the duration of the MRI:  
 
 Magnet response (ICD)  
 Rate response  
 PVC response  
 Noise reversion response  
 Ventricular sense response  
 Mode switching  
 Tachycardia detection/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ICD)  
 EGM triggers  
 
Patients  who are not pacemaker dependent  will have the ir pacemaker/ ICD programmed to AAI/VVI/DDI 
at 40 beats per minute for  the duration of the MRI. Patients who are pacemaker dependent  (pacing at 
programmed lower rate during the pre-scan interrogation)  will have their pacemaker/ICD programmed to 
AOO/VOO/DOO at the programmed lower rate for the duration of the MRI. Emergency e quipment, 
including a MRI compatible defibrillator and transcutaneous pacemaker, will be available throughout the 
procedure in the event of an adverse clinical event.  In addition to radiology staff, a pacemaker 
technologist or manufacturer clinical repres entative and an EP tech/RN with current ACLS will be present 
for the duration of the procedure. An EP physician/advanced practic e provider (APP) must be  
immediately available (i.e., in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to provide medical intervention, such as placement of a 
temporary external pacemaker i f required.   In the event that a code is called by [CONTACT_327342], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327337].  
 
Radiology staff and the electrophysiology (EP) technologist or nurse with current ACLS certification will 
monitor the following patient parameters at least every 5 minutes throughout the MRI scan:  
 
 Heart rate  
 Heart rhythm  
 Non-invasive blood pressure  
 Oxygen saturation  
 Symptoms  
 
If any of the following adverse symptoms/events occur during the scan, the test will be immediately 
terminated:  
 
 Burning/pulling sensation in device pocket/chest during MRI  
 Potentially lethal/previously non -diagnosed arrhythmias during MRI  
 Spontaneous and unanticipated pacing rate change  
 SOB  
 Chest pain  
 Feeling of heat/p ulling in the chest or device pocket  
 
The patient will be removed from the scanner to the holding area and the device interrogated and 
reprogrammed to original parameters or as indicated by [CONTACT_327343]. If needed, emergency treatment 
will be provided as per ACLS protocols or at the discretion of the monitoring physician. The following 
parameters will be compared to the pre -MRI results:  
 
 Patient’s underlying rhythm  
P a g e  4 | 9 
MRI protocol v 7.0 
7/17/17   Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds  
 P-wave and R -wave amplitude  
 Lead impedan ce (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)  
 Battery voltage  
 
All device -related adverse events/symptoms will be documented on the data collection form and reported 
to the IRB. The patient will remain in the MRI suite holding area until medically stable. The need for 
further treatment will be at the discretion of the monitoring physician.  
 
The EP physician/APP will review and compare the pre/post MRI device data prior to the patient’s 
discharge from the MRI suite. Following testing, the pacemaker or ICD will b e reprogrammed to the pre -
procedure parameters . The need for device reprogramming related to the MRI scan will be based on the 
clinical judgment of the attending electrophysiologist.  
 
Follow -up 
 
Patients who do not experience a device -related adverse event  will continue with their routine 
pacemaker/ICD follow -up. 
 
Patients  who experience one or more device -related adverse events during the MRI  will return 1-[ADDRESS_403798]-MRI for follow -up pacemaker/ICD testing to confirm appropriate function .  At a minimum, d evice 
interrogation /testing  will include:  
 
 Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds  
 P-wave and R -wave amplitude  
 Lead impedance (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)  
 Battery voltage  
 
The need for further follow -up will be determined by [CONTACT_327344].  
 
The results of the follow -up device interrogation , including whether MRI -related adverse events have 
resolved,  will be documented and kept in the device chart and recorded in the Registry database.  
 
If the insurance provider does not cover the MRI and device checks, those costs may be the full 
responsibility of the patient. The patient will be informed of the status of the pre -authorization before 
scheduling the MRI.

MRI protocol v 7.0 
7/17/17  Data Collection  
 
Each patient’s pre procedure and post procedure device data, vital signs, and adverse events as 
described in the protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_327345]. 
Registry data will be entered into a secure research database (RedCap ). Access to the registry data and 
patient information will be restricted to Lancaster Heart & Vascular Institute (LHVI) cardiology research 
staff and physicians. Hard copy data and source documents (data collection forms, informed consent and 
HIPAA author ization, device interrogation data) will be stored in secure files at the LHVI research office.  
 
Registry data will be reviewed and analyzed at least quarterly and after the first [ADDRESS_403800] been 
scanned . Our data  may ultimately expand the routine us e of MRI to include this patient population. We 
will track the incidence of adverse events (as defined in this protocol) , look for data trends (patient types 
that experience AEs, devices that are adversely affected and how, etc.) using the appropriate stat istical 
testing and tools.  
 
We will also collect data on what alternative testing the ordering physician would have used, if any, 
instead of  MRI, and how the use or non -use of MRI affected  patient management.  
 
Data Monitoring Safety Plan  
 
The Internal Safety Committee  for this Registry will be comprised of  three individuals who work at LGH, 
and will include a statistician, a radiologist specializing in MRI procedures, and an EP cardiologist or 
other technical staff familiar with cardiac device parameter s and programming. Neither Paul Leslie, M.D. 
or Sandeep Bansal, M.D. will be a member of the Safety Committee . 
 
The Safety Committee will meet every [ADDRESS_403801] 
meet all of the inc lusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be obtai ned by 
[CONTACT_327346]/her designee  from the study team . A copy of the signed informed consent 
and HIPAA Authorization will be scanned into the patient’s perm anent medical record in EPIC.  
 
Risks of Study Participation    
 
There are no known significant risks associated the exposure to electromagnetic fields from MRI scans. 
However, patients may be unable to tolerate the confined space of the MRI unit. This can lead to:  
 Claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces)  
 Mild diaphoresis (sweating)  
 Hearing impairment (difficulty hearing)  
 Sensation of bodily warmth  
 Body stiffness related to immobility  
 
Pacemakers and ICDs have historically been a contraindication for MRI, due to the potential for tissue 
heating where the lead is in contact [CONTACT_327347], the effect of electromagnetic fields on device 
P a g e  7 | 9 
MRI protocol v 7.0 
7/17/17  function (change of pacing mode or not sensing  or treating abnormal rhythms), and the potential for 
mechanical malfunction. However, several recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that MRI can be 
safe for patients with non -MRI conditional pacemakers or ICDs when protocols are in place and adhe red 
to.  
 
The potential risks associated with the use of MRI with a non -MRI conditional pacemaker or ICD include, 
but may not be limited to, the following:  
 
 Movement and or vibration of the device generator and/or leads  
 Lead electrode (the metal end of the  lead) heating with heart muscle damage resulting in loss of 
sensing or capture or both  
 Device heating resulting in discomfort and/or tissue damage  
 Life-threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) T  
 Other arrhythmias (atria l fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia, SVT)  
 Failure of the device to pace the heart  
 Change in pacemaker or ICD function, including changes in mode, rate or output  
 Inability to detect or treat abnormal heart rhythms  
 Delivery of ICD therapy when it i s not needed  
 Need for device reprogramming )  
 Need for a new device  
 
There may be additional risks associated with study participation that are unknown at this time.  
 
Benefits of Study Participation  
 
There may be benefit from study participation due to the use of a standardized MRI protocol designed to 
minimize the risks associated with MRI use in the presence of a non -MRI conditional pacemaker or ICD. 
This may include the diagnostic benefit of the MRI itself, which is the diagnostic exam of choice for 
sever al disease entities. Study participation may also lead to a generally accepted protocol for MRI for 
patients with a non -MRI conditional pacemaker or ICD. Alternatively, there may be no benefit of study 
participation.  
  
Study Results  
 
The study investigator s and research staff will analyze data  at least  quarterly. Results will be reported to 
the IRB at  least every six months and to CMS quarterly. At a minimum, the reports will include:  
 
 The number of patients screened  
 The number of patients scanned  
 The devic e models scanned  
 Incidence and description of adverse events (as described above) . Adverse events will also be 
reported to the IRB as they occur (see above)   
 Patient outcomes  
Registry r esults will be submitted for publication to one or more peer reviewed j ournals and may also be 
presented internally to physicians and other stakeholders who care for the defined study population. 
Results will also be reported on the ClinicalTrials.gov website on at least an annual basis.

  1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
 
Study Title Paxerol™ (a Novel Formulation of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen) for Treatment of Nocturia - A 
Phase II Placebo-Controlled Trial  
Protocol No. CL-Paxerol-002 
 
Study Phase Phase II 
 
Study Drugs Paxerol Tablets:  Each Paxerol tablet contains acetaminophen 325 mg and ibuprofen 150 mg.  It is 
formulated to release approximately 50% of the acetaminophen and ibuprofen as IR and the 
other 50% being released as SR over 6-8 hours. 
Placebo Tablets:  Placebo tablets are formulated as Paxerol tablets, except that they do not contain 
any acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  
Study 
Objectives The co-primary objectives are: 
A. To assess the effect of different doses of Paxerol on the reduction in the number of nocturia 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
B. To assess the clinical benefit of different doses of Paxerol in reducing nocturia via assessment 
of nocturia quality of life (NQOL).  
The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of different doses of Paxerol on: 
A. Duration of First Undisturbed Sleep (DFUS) 
B. Total hours of nightly sleep 
C. Safety and tolerability 
 
An exploratory assessment is to evaluate baseline urinary PGE2 production on the responsiveness 
of subjects to Paxerol.  
Study Design This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two weeks of daily oral 
administration of one of three dose levels of Paxerol or placebo in subjects with nocturia.  Eligible 
study subjects will be identified according to inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below), and baseline 
assessments will be recorded.  
Due to small sample size of 25 patients per group in this proof-of-principle dosing-finding trial, 
stratification according to gender and BMI will be difficult.  However, similar distribution of 
patient types to the four treatment groups will be attempted by [CONTACT_440038] <25, 25-30, and >30-<40.  
Paxerol or placebo will be taken [ADDRESS_557851] is approximately 4 weeks, which includes screening, baseline 
assessment, two weeks of treatment with study drugs, and follow -up. 
Study 
Center(s) This study is to be conducted in multiple clinical sites with investigators who are experienced in 
urologic management.

small or a large amount at various times.  Remind subjects about the importance of accurate reporting 
responses for all diary questions and review the expectations for diary completion.  Remind subjects to 
void just after taking the study drug and once again just prior to bedtime for best results.  Remind them that

  2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
2.1 Nocturia 
 
Nocturia or Nocturnal Micturition  is defined by [CONTACT_440043] (van Kerrebroeck et al. 2002).  Nocturia is 
a major health problem for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and overactive bladder (OAB) 
patients.  Nocturia is a symptom which interrupts sleep by [CONTACT_440044].  Nocturia is thought to 
be caused by [CONTACT_8544]-related reasons (excess intake of alcohol or diuretics, endocrine or metabolic 
disorders, peripheral edema), sleep-related reasons (insomnia, pain, dyspnea, depression, drugs) 
and lower urinary tract-related reasons (small bladder capacity, detrusor hyperactivity, prostate-
related, overflow incontinence, decreased bladder compliance, sensory urgency) (Resnick et al. 
2002).  Multiple factors may result in nocturia, including pathological conditions, such as 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, lower urinary tract obstruction, anxiety or primary sleep 
disorders, and behavioural and environmental factors (Weiss 2000). 
 
The prevalence of nocturia is higher with increasing age (Fitzgerald et al. 2007).  Although 
nocturia is relatively uncommon among younger adults, by 80 years of age, the prevalence rises to 
80 to 90% in both men and women (Weiss 2000).  Occasional nocturia is present in 50% of men 
and women aged [ADDRESS_557858] 
nocturia; the sex ratio reverses after 60 years of age, with prevalence greater in men than women.  
The prevalence of twice nightly or greater nocturia among men between 70 and 79 is nearly 50% 
(Liew et al. 2006). 
 
Nocturia disrupts sleep, leading to daytime somnolence, depressive symptoms, cognitive 
dysfunction, and a reduced sense of well being and quality of life.  Moreover, nocturia is 
associated with a dramatically increased risk of morbidity and mortality (Stewart et al. 1992; 
Asplund 1999).  While it may take years to have data to conclusively show that reduction in 
nocturia epi[INVESTIGATOR_440016]-induced reduction in lifespan and overall health, the 
correlations between nocturia incidence with longevity, quality of life, and a variety of serious 
medical conditions in these patients is undeniable.  Nocturia is a serious medical condition, 
especially in the elderly and especially when it occurs 2 or more times per night. 
 
A reduced nocturnal bladder capacity alone related to OAB and abnormal bladder function can 
rarely be effectively managed with anti-muscarinics.  Nocturnal polyuria is associated with 
abnormalities of the secretion of arginine vasopressin, lifestyle or dietary factors, and other 
medical conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure, venous stasis disease, sleep apnea).  The first 
approach to treatment is changes in lifestyle and behavioural changes, including the elimination of 
fluid intake in the evening and reducing alcohol and caffeine.  However, these initial measures 
alone are rarely effective.  Moreover, the available medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_440017], which can cause complications, such as hyponatremia, in older 
persons. In addition, the presence of common comorbidities can be associated with potentially 
adverse interactions between the antidiuretics and other medications. Alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-
reductase inhibitors are used for men with BPH.  However, the effectiveness of these drugs for 
nocturia is reported to be only 25-39%.  Novel and second-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_440018], cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, as well as botulinum toxin injected directly into 
the detrusor muscle for overactive bladder.  Medical therapy for BPH and OAB is able to decrease 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 14 of 51 
  this symptom by [CONTACT_726] 50% in only 25-39% of patients.  The low response rate and 
significant side effects cause most users of these drugs to abandon them within 2-3 months. 
 
2.1 Prostaglandins and Nocturia 
 
Cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have been 
shown to decrease urine production, detrusor muscle tone, and inflammation, especially in men 
with BPH (Varilla et al. 2011).  There is increasing evidence that NSAIDs are effective for the 
treatment of nocturia.  Recent reports indicated that NSAIDs are effective for patients with 
nocturia.  Larsen (1995) reported that indomethacin relieves symptoms of BPH.  Le Fanu (2001) 
reported that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_440019]. 
 
Prostaglandins play a role as local modulators of reflex micturition.  By [CONTACT_440045].  Prostaglandins increase the tone of detrusor muscle 
and enhance micturition (Maggi 1992).  Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGE2α, PGE1 and 
thromboxane A2 cause contraction of the isolated detrusor muscle of the human bladder 
(Andersson 1997).  A study showed that prostaglandins synthesis inhibitors reduced the frequency 
of voiding and decreased the urine volume in enuresis (Al-Waili 2002).  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_440020] (Addla et al. 2014).  NSAIDs may play a role in inhibiting 
OAB by [CONTACT_440046]. 
 
Ibuprofen [(±)-2-(p-isobutyl phenyl) propi[INVESTIGATOR_149046]] and acetaminophen [N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) 
acetamide] are among the most widely used non-prescription medications.  Ibuprofen is a 
commonly used and frequently prescribed NSAID.  Through non-selective inhibition of COX-1 
and COX-2, ibuprofen decreases the synthesis of pain- and inflammation-promoting 
prostaglandins (Chavez et al. 2003).  Likewise, acetaminophen is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that 
is synergistic with ibuprofen by [CONTACT_440047] (POX) site 
within COX 1/2 enzymes (Chavez et al. 2003; Anderson 2008). 
 
There is no evidence of drug-drug interactions between acetaminophen and ibuprofen so they can 
be administered concurrently.  The steady state kinetics of acetaminophen and ibuprofen are not 
changed when the two drugs are co-administered.  The combination of both drugs does not affect 
the bioavailability of either drug (Merry et al. 2010; Wright et al. 1983).  Pharmacokinetic studies 
also have demonstrated that administration of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in a fixed-dose 
combination tablet does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic profiles of either drug (Tanner 
et al. 2010).  Since ibuprofen and acetaminophen have different metabolic pathways and do not 
have drug-drug interactions between them, the combination product is not expected to have 
additional safety concerns compared to either of drugs alone. 
 
2.3 Preclinical Data 
 
2.3.1 Non-clinical Pharmacology (Pharmacodynamics) 
 
Ibuprofen is a NSAID.  Through non-selective inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2, ibuprofen 
decreases the synthesis of pain- and inflammation-promoting prostaglandins (Chavez 2003).  
Acetaminophen is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that is additive, if not synergistic, with ibuprofen 
by [CONTACT_440048] 1/2 enzymes (Chavez et al. 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 15 of 51 
  2003).  It may also involve COX inhibition in the central nervous system and activation of central 
serotonergic pathways (Chavez et al. 2003; Anderson 2008). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen 
 
The absorption of ibuprofen was studied in vivo and in vitro.  The main site of absorption of 
ibuprofen occurs is the intestine, though some absorption of drug normally occurs in the stomach 
(Adams et al. 1969).  Tissue accumulation and distribution of ibuprofen was investigated in rats 
and dogs.  The levels of radioactivity in dog tissues did not exceed those in plasma after repeated 
doses of 8 mg/kg twice daily, but extremely high concentrations occurred in bile.  Measurement 
of radioactivity in urine and faeces from dogs revealed that initially 60% of the dose was 
eliminated after 3-5 days.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen 
 
The absorption of acetaminophen by [CONTACT_440049], colon and stomach was studied in vivo 
and in vitro.  Small intestinal in vivo studies, using a wide range of drug concentrations, showed 
that absorption was efficient and uniform throughout the small bowel, no site showing preferential 
absorption and it occurs by [CONTACT_440050] (Bagnall et al. 1979).  In a study that determined the 
concentrations of acetaminophen in blood and other tissues of dog and man, it was found that 
unconjugated acetaminophen is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_440021] 
(Anderson 2008). 
 
2.4 Clinical Data 
 
2.4.1 Pharmacokinetics 
 
The pharmacokinetic parameters for ibuprofen and acetaminophen were similar for the both fixed 
dose combination and monotherapy.  The rate of absorption of both ibuprofen and acetaminophen 
was significantly delayed when the combination tablet was administered in the fed versus fasted 
state; median delay was 25 minutes for ibuprofen (p > 0.05) and 55 minutes for acetaminophen (p 
< 0.001).  The pharmacokinetic parameters of ibuprofen (200 mg) and acetaminophen (500 mg) 
FDC tablet were compared with ibuprofen (200 mg) and acetaminophen (500 mg) monotherapy in 
an open-label, randomized study (Tanner et al. 2010).  The multi-dose pharmacokinetics of the 
fixed-dose combination tablet are comparable to the single-dose pharmacokinetics and three times 
daily dosing may offer enhanced therapeutic effect for longer than twice daily dosing (Tanner et 
al. 2010). 
 
2.4.2 Overview of Potential Efficacy, Safety and Benefit of Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen 
Combination 
 
The efficacy of acetaminophen and ibuprofen combination in the treatment of nocturia is yet to be 
established.  However, several clinical trials have shown that different NSAIDs may be effective 
against nocturia (Araki et al. 2004 and 2008; Addla et al. 2006 and 2014; 2006; Falahatkar et al. 
2008). 
 
An acetaminophen and ibuprophen combination has been found to be more effective than 
individual drugs in other indications such as analgesia (Mehlisch et al. 2010; Merry et al. 2010).  
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.[ADDRESS_557859] (Chavez et al 2003; Anderson et al 2008).  This 
combination may also be more effective than individual drugs in the treatment of nocturia, which 
is one of the objectives of the current study. 
 
There were no changes in the adverse event (AE) profiles when the combination was compared to 
either drug alone (Mehlisch et al 2010).

effects of these agents on bladder smooth muscle cells (the site of action for anti-nocturia 
activities) stimulated by [CONTACT_440051] (LPS) of Salmonella 
typhymurium  (Report from Ohio State Univ. 2012).  The concentrations of acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen used in this in vitro study were 5 and 50 μM, which are below the plasma Cmax 
concentrations after oral administration at therapeutic doses of these drugs in humans (see Table 
2.5.1-1, below).

This in vitro study showed that COX2, PGE2 and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) secretions 
were inhibited by [CONTACT_440052] 5 and 50 μM (Table 2.5.1-2, next 
page).  However, the degrees of inhibition were equivalent at these concentrations for both 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen.  Since the inhibitory effect was not dependent on the 
concentrations between 5-50 μM, doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen that can provide plasma 
concentrations around 5 μM (the lowest effective concentrations) of these drugs were chosen for 
the current clinical trial, suggesting doses of 325 mg and 150 mg for acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen for Paxerol, respectively. 
 
Note that there are acetaminophen/ibuprofen combination dosage forms with doses higher than 
those of Paxerol (see next section).  These combination high dosage forms are for relieving pain 
and decreasing the production of prostaglandins.  It is a more subtle process in the attenuation of 
the activities of bladder smooth muscle cells, and the lower doses of these drugs chosen for 
Paxerol should be effective, as shown with the in vitro study on bladder smooth muscle cells.

2.5.2 Risk Assessment 
 
Maxigesic® is an immediate release (IR) dosage form of acetaminophen and ibuprofen 
combination, with the amount of acetaminophen (500 mg) being higher whereas that of ibuprofen 
(150 mg) being the same as Paxerol.  This combination is an approved product in New Zealand 
and other non-US countries for temporary relief of mild to moderate pain associated with 
migraine, headache, backache, period pain, dental pain, rheumatic and muscular pain, pain of non-
serious arthritis, cold and flu symptoms, sore throat and fever.  The approval of Maxigesic in 
these non-US countries was based on the safety and efficacy profile of this combination. 
 
The fixed dose combination of two other IR dosage forms containing even higher doses of 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen have been investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group clinical trial (Mehlisch et al 2010).  These two higher dose forms were:  
(i) ibuprofen 400 mg + acetaminophen 1,000 mg and (ii) ibuprofen 200 mg + acetaminophen 500 
mg.  These 2 higher combination dosage forms were compared to ibuprofen 400 mg alone, 
acetaminophen 1,000 mg alone, and to placebo.  The results showed that the study drugs were 
well tolerated, with a similar frequency of all adverse events in all treatment arms including the 
placebo arm (Table 2.5.2-1, next page).  There was no evidence that the study drugs had any 
clinically meaningful effects on vital signs.  These results indicated that the combination of 
ibuprofen and acetaminophen in an IR formulation at doses higher than those of Paxerol, the 
investigational drug, were safe and well tolerated.  Accordingly, Paxerol is not expected to induce 
any unexpected risk of adverse events due to its low doses, and because approximately 50% of 
Paxerol consist of IR and the other 50% is released over 6-8 hours via the sustained release (SR) 
formulation.

2.6 Drug-Drug Interactions and Side effects 
 
2.6.1 Acetaminophen 
 
Interactions 
 
Isoniazid: Isoniazid induces the cytochrome P-450 system, resulting in increased metabolism of 
acetaminophen, formation of toxic metabolites, depletion of glutathione stores, and 
subsequent hepatocellular injury. Subjects on isoniazid should use caution when taking 
acetaminophen since the potentially hepatotoxic effects may be amplified due to induction of 
the cytochrome P-450 system (Crippin 1993). 
 
Anticoagulants:  Acetaminophen may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of oral anticoagulants, 
increasing haemorrhagic risk in subjects receiving this combination of drugs (Mahé et al. 
2004; Ornetti et al. 2005).  Acetaminophen potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and 
therefore such subjects will be excluded from the trial (Mahé et al. 2005). 
 
Metoclopramide : The absorption of acetaminophen is accelerated by [CONTACT_177708], a drug 
that stimulates gastric emptying (Nimmo et al. 1973). 
 
Chloramphenicol:  Acetaminophen accelerates the clearance of chloramphenicol (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_440022]. 
1986). 
 
Cholestyramine : Simultaneous oral administration of cholestyramine reduces the absorption of 
acetaminophen (Dordoni et al. 1973). 
 
Side effects 
 
Few clinically significant drug interactions have been documented. There is probable 
potentiation of hepatotoxicity following an overdose from the acetaminophen metabolite N-
Acetyl-P-Benzoquinone Imine (NAPQI) by [CONTACT_28745]-inducing drugs. The absorption of 
acetaminophen is dependent on gastric emptying; other drugs that alter gastric emptying can 
change its pharmacokinetics, but would not cause serious adverse effects (SAEs). Although 
animal experiments have demonstrated that many compounds can modify acetaminophen 
hepatotoxicity, these are unlikely to be important at therapeutic doses (Toes et al. 2005). 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 19 of 51 
  2.6.2 Ibuprofen 
 
Interactions: 
 
Angiotensin Coverting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors : NSAIDs reduce the renal excretion of ACE 
inhibitors and may attenuate the hemodynamic actions of ACE inhibitors (Shionoiri 1993).  
These activities may explain the renal side effects of NSAIDs (see below). 
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: Ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], potentially 
rendering aspi[INVESTIGATOR_440023] 
(Information of Healthcare Professionals at FDA website).  As a result, subjects using Paxerol 
should be instructed that if they are taking low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_440024]. 
 
Diuretics : NSAIDs attenuates the antihypertensive effect of thiazide and loop diuretics. 
NSAIDs may also inhibit the natriuretic response to diuretics with resultant adverse effects in 
subjects with heart failure and other forms of oedema (Webster 1985; Herchuelz et al. 1989). 
 
Lithium:  The administration of ibuprofen can increase steady-state plasma lithium 
concentrations and decrease lithium clearance (Kristoff et al. 1986; Ragheb 1987). 
 
Side effects: 
 
Gastrointestinal : Long term use of ibuprofen is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 
Upper GI bleeding is infrequent with prescription doses of ibuprofen and occurs with high 
doses on long term usage (Bjarnason 2007; Michels 2012).  Ibuprofen at the maximum dose of 
1200 mg/day for 7-10 days is also found to be well-tolerated (Doyle et al. 1999; Rampal et al. 
2002). 
 
Central nervous system : Side effects of NSAIDS include aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and 
cognitive dysfunction. Aseptic meningitis is found most commonly in subjects with lupus 
treated with ibuprofen, but it should be considered in any subject with meningitis if the subject 
has used NSAIDs. Psychosis, although infrequently reported with NSAIDs, should be 
suspected in an elderly subject started on a regimen of indomethacin who acutely develops 
disorientation, paranoia, or hallucinations. There appears to be some potential for memory 
dysfunction and attention deficits in elderly subjects treated with NSAIDs (Hoppmann et al. 
1991).  Drowsiness, tiredness, dizziness, light-headedness, nervousness, irritability and 
unsteadiness are reported with the use of ibuprofen (Furey et al. 1992). 
 
Cardiovascular : Ibuprofen at low doses is least likely to increase cardiovascular risk.  At doses 
more than 1200 mg/d and above, ibuprofen increases the risk (McGettigan et al. 2011; Trelle 
et al. 2011). 
 
In 2015, FDA strengthened the labeling of all NSAIDs regarding increased cardiovascular 
risk, per FDA review of new safety information and the advisory committee’s 
recommendations (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm451800.htm).  The revised 
NSAID labels include the following information: 
 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 20 of 51 
   The risk of heart attack or stroke can occur as early as the first weeks of using an NSAID. 
The risk may increase with longer use of the NSAID. 
 The risk appears greater at higher doses. 
 It was previously thought that all NSAIDs may have a similar risk.  Newer information 
makes it less clear that the risk for heart attack or stroke is similar for all NSAIDs; 
however, this newer information is not sufficient for us to determine that the risk of any 
particular NSAID is definitely higher or lower than that of any other particular NSAID. 
 NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with or without heart 
disease or risk factors for heart disease.  A large number of studies support this finding, 
with varying estimates of how much the risk is increased, depending on the drugs and the 
doses studied. 
 In general, patients with heart disease, or risk factors for it, have a greater likelihood of 
heart attack or stroke following NSAID use than patients without these risk factors, because 
they have a higher risk at baseline. 
 Patients treated with NSAIDs following a first heart attack were more likely to die in the 
first year after the heart attack compared to patients who were not treated with NSAIDs 
after their first heart attack. 
 There is an increased risk of heart failure with NSAID use. 
 
Renal: Ibuprofen can cause renal impairment in elderly subjects and subjects with coronary 
artery disease. Therefore renal function should be monitored when ibuprofen and other 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed (Murray et al. 1990).  Use of ibuprofen 
may cause acute renal failure in subjects with asymptomatic, mild chronic renal failure 
(Welton et al. 1990). 
 
2.6.3 Overdose 
 
Acetaminophen over dose in children 10 years of age or younger can cause hepatotoxicity 
(Rivera-Penera et al. 1997).  Acetaminophen overdose causes acute liver failure. Acetaminophen 
overdose subjects recover with early N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy and supportive care 
(Fontana 2008).  The frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low.  
Mild gastrointestinal disturbances and central nervous system depression were the most common 
adverse effects (McElwee et al. 1990).

  4. STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two weeks of daily oral 
administration of one of three dose levels of Paxerol or placebo in subjects with nocturia.  Eligible 
study subjects will be identified according to inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Section 5.0), and 
baseline assessments will be recorded. 
 
Due to small sample size of 25 patients per group in this proof-of-principle dosing-finding trial, 
stratification according to gender and BMI will be difficult.  However, similar distribution of 
patient types to the four treatment groups will be attempted by [CONTACT_440054] <25, 25-30, and >30-<40. 
 
Paxerol or placebo will be taken 30 minutes before bedtime daily for two weeks.  Nocturia 
frequency, NQOL, DFUS, total hours of nightly sleep, safety and tolerability will be monitored 
before and after a two-week treatment period.  Results from subjects treated with different doses 
of Paxerol and placebo will be assessed and compared.  Baseline urinary PGE2 production will 
also be assayed to assess potential correlation between baseline urinary PGE2 production and 
responsiveness to Paxerol treatment.

  6. TREATMENT  
 
6.1 Study Drugs 
 
The study drugs are:  
Paxerol Tablets:  Each Paxerol tablet contains acetaminophen 325 mg and ibuprofen 150 mg.  It is 
formulated to release approximately 50% of the acetaminophen and ibuprofen as IR and the 
other 50% being released as SR over 6-8 hours.  
Placebo Tablets:  Placebo tablets are formulated as Paxerol tablets, except that they do not contain 
any acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  
It is important that the subjects not cut or bite into the tablets, since that would destroy the tablet’s 
SR capabilities.  Paxerol and placebo tablets are to be taken orally [ADDRESS_557870] been provided with all 
the required study documents, IEC/IRB approval, and have signed a final study agreement with 
the Sponsor (or an authorized representative). 
 
6.2 Treatments to be Administered 
 
Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the four treatment groups, as outlined in Table 6.2-1 
(below).

Paxerol and placebo are provided in tablet formulation.  Paxerol is formulated to release 
approximately 50% of the acetaminophen and ibuprofen as IR and the other 50% being released 
as SR over 6-8 hours.  It is important that the subjects not cut or bite into the tablet, since that 
would destroy the tablet’s SR capabilities.  Paxerol and placebo tablets are to be taken orally [ADDRESS_557871] void residual urine.

Labeling of Paxerol and placebo is consistent with 21 CFR 312.6 for investigational drugs. 
 
6.4 Storage and Dispensing of Study Drug 
 
All clinical drug supplies are to be stored in a secure, monitored, limited-access area in 
accordance with labeled storage conditions.  Paxerol and matching placebo will be stored at room 
temperature at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).  The Investigator is to maintain accurate records related to 
dispensing of all clinical trial supplies during the study.  These records shall include the amounts 
of drug supplied and the dates on which drug supplies are received from the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative), dispensed to the subject, returned by [CONTACT_440056] (or an authorized representative).  If errors or damages in the clinical drug supply 
shipments occur, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_1034] (or an authorized representative) 
immediately. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_557873] will be assigned a Screening number and if eligible for treatment, a Randomization 
number will be assigned.  Due to small sample size of 25 patients per group in this proof-of-
principal dosing-finding trial, stratification according to gender and BMI will be difficult.  
However, similar distribution of patient types to the four treatment groups will be attempted by 
[CONTACT_440057] <25, 25-
30, and >30-<40.

  concomitant illnesses and any therapeutic interventions, e.g., concomitant drug treatment/non-drug treatment, surgery, etc.  
Where applicable, the following will be included:  
(1) the names (generic preferably) of all drug treatments, non-drug treatments or procedures; 
(2) start and stop date; and 
(3) indication.  
Any medication the subject takes, other than the study drugs specified in the protocol, is 
considered concomitant medication.  All concomitant medications and non-drug 
treatments/procedures must be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the CRFs.  
Use of the following medications is prohibited during the study period:  
• Treatment with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, non-ibuprofen NSAID, or any other pain 
medication within 24 hours of study entry, and during participation in the study.  ( Note:  Low 
dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_440026].)  In the event of need for any 
unanticipated use of such drugs during the trial, the timing and doses of such use should be 
carefully recorded and reported at the next visit to the clinic.  This is important due to the 
possibility that Paxerol’s efficacy could be impacted by [CONTACT_440058], in which case the resulting 
data may need to be isolated from the overall results. 
• Treatment with diuretic medication, anti-diuretic medication or SSRIs within 4 weeks of study 
entry, and during participation in the study.  ( Note:  Diuretic medication is allowable if the 
subject is on a stable consistent morning dose.) 
• Daily use of PDE inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil, and udenafil) 
within 30 days prior to or during the study. 
• Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to or during study participation 
• Use of antiplatelet drugs, warfarin or other anticoagulant drugs within 4 weeks prior to or 
during participation in the study. ( Note:  Low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_440027].) 
 
6.[ADDRESS_557876] will be asked to return the remaining medication at the end of the treatment period.  The 
quantity of returned study drugs will be counted for compliance.  If compliance is less than 100%, 
the subject should report on which night he/she failed to use the drug.  The treatment compliance 
data will be summarized and analyzed vs. efficacy and safety. 
 
6.9 Drug Accountability 
 
The Investigator is accountable for all clinical drug supplies shipped to the study site for the 
duration of the study.  A final accounting of the clinical drug supplies will be required at the 
completion/termination of the study.  The Investigator is required to provide written explanation 
for any discrepancies.  All unused clinical drug supplies (except required retention samples) will 
be inventoried and returned to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) by a designated study 
monitor.  The Investigator will not be permitted to return or destroy unused clinical drug supplies 
or packaging materials unless authorized by [CONTACT_1034] (or authorized representative).

CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 30 of 51 
  8. Clinical laboratory evaluation and urinalysis (see Section 8.2.4). 
9. Dispense nocturia diary.  Instruct subject regarding completion of the nocturia diary.  Ensure 
that they know that a bathroom visit which coincides with the intention of getting up in the 
morning should not be considered nocturia.  A bathroom visit that is followed by [CONTACT_440059] a nocturia event.  In this latter case, it should be 
considered nocturia even if the subject fails to fall sleep due to insomnia or some other issue.  
Explain to subject that accurate reporting of the results will be critical in order to ensure 
success of the study.  Advise subject that nocturia symptoms may change by a small or a large 
amount at various times.  Remind subjects the importance of providing the required 
information accurately and review completion of diary by [CONTACT_1766].  Remind subjects to void 
immediately after taking the study drug and once again just prior to bedtime for best results.  
Remind subjects that what they drink and when they drink it will affect urine output, so they 
should if possible try to remain consistent in their drinking habits each day, especially 
regarding drinking after 5 p.m. each day. 
10. Schedule the next appointment, Study Visit 2 on Day 15±1 working day or ±2 weekend day. 
 
Visit 2 (Day 15 - Pre-Treatment): 
 
1. For women of child-bearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test.  (The pregnancy test is 
to be performed within 1 week prior to enrollment or Visit 1.) 
2. Record urinary symptoms based on International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) (see 
Appendix 2). 
3. Record concurrent diseases and symptoms, concomitant medications, and any non-drug 
treatments/procedures. 
4. Collect the subject’s nocturia diary.  Review the diary with subject for completeness.  If the 
subject’s average nightly void when not using the study drug is on average less than [ADDRESS_557882] urine output, 
so they should if possible try to remain consistent in their drinking habits each day, especially 
regarding drinking after 5 p.m. each day. 
7. Dispense study drugs, to be taken on Days 15-28, 30 minutes before bed. 
8. Schedule the next appointment, Study Visit 3, on Day 29±1 working day or ±[ADDRESS_557883] that at Visit 3 he/she will be asked to estimate the average amount of fluid 
consumed with the 3 tablets each night.  If possible, an estimate in terms of ounces would be 
preferable.   ( Note:  A cup of fluid is 8 ounces and a large glass of fluid could be 12-16 
ounces.)  Subject should also be instructed to use the smallest amount of fluid that he/she can 
in order to swallow the tablets comfortably.

8.3 Assessments of Baseline Urinary PGE2 Production 
 
8.3.1 Background, Introduction and Rationale 
 
As an exploratory assessment, baseline urinary PGE2 production will be assayed, and potential 
correlation between baseline urinary PGE2 production and the degree of nocturia reduction 
induced by [CONTACT_440065].  The rationale for this exploratory assessment is 
that subjects with nocturia and OAB average approx. 5 times above normal levels of urinary 
PGE2 production (Kim et al. 2005 and 2006; Cho et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010).  Prostaglandins, the 
locally derived regulatory factor, play an important role in regulating renal water excretion 
(Kramer et al. 1981) and rhythmic contraction of detrusor muscle of the bladder wall (Collins et 
al. 2009, Klausner et al 2011; Takagi-Matsumoto et al. 2004, Tsukimi et al. 2004; Olesen & 
Fenton 2013).  Therefore, nocturia may be related to high urinary prostaglandins production. 
 
It is our speculation that Paxerol responders will be those who have elevated urinary PGE2 
production (thus resulting in low nocturnal bladder capacity), since the two drugs that comprise 
Paxerol synergistically inhibit the production of PGE2 in the bladder (Collins et al. 2009, 
Klausner et al 2011; Takagi-Matsumoto et al. 2004, Tsukimi et al. 2004).  For patients whose 
nocturia is caused by [CONTACT_440066]2 production, Paxerol may not provide any benefit.  Since published 
articles have reported that subjects with nocturia and OAB average approx. 5x above normal 
levels of PGE2 (Kim et al. 2005 and 2006; Cho et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2010), most eligible study 
subjects in this trial (i.e., subjects with OAB) should benefit from Paxerol. 
 
Urinary PGE2 production naturally follows a circadian pattern (see Figure 8.3-1, next page).  In 
order to accurately assay urinary PGE2 production, we need to collect a timed urine sample, 
including the total volume of urine that comprises the sample, the time since the last complete 
bladder void, and the time of day.  Also, the levels are significantly higher for men (average 278-
431 pgs/minute or 400-620 ng/24 hours, according to Mayo Clinic reports) than for women 
(average 115-124 pgs or 166-178 ng/24 hours, according to an NIH publication).  Therefore, 
assessment should subdivided according to the genders.

(1981). 
 
 
8.3.2 Procedures 
 
The procedures in assaying urinary PGE production are outlined below. 
 
A. Collection of Urinary Sample 
 
During Visit 1 (and Visit 2, if collection of urinary sample is not successful during Visit 1), ask 
each subject to drink [ADDRESS_557887]’s bladder as much as possible, and no urinary sample will be 
collected.  For the second void, it is the very next void by [CONTACT_423].  This can be the void that 
the subject naturally intends to have while he/she is still in the clinic during the visit.  If the 
subject does not plan to void while in the clinic, he/she is to be asked to void before leaving the 
clinic.  In the second void, all of the urine needs to be collected for the measurement of urinary 
volume (see Section B below), and the actual time between these two voids is to be precisely 
recorded. 
 
B. Measurement of Urinary Sample Volume 
 
Once collected, the urine sample (in its pre-weighted container) is to be weighed, and the weight 
of the urine sample is the difference between the weight of the urinary sample in its pre-
weighted container and the weight of the container.  The volume of urine (in mL) is the weight 
(1 gm = 1 mL) of the urinary sample collected.  This weight should be recorded. 
 
C. Handling and Storage of Urinary Sample for PGE2 Measurement 
 
Once the weight of the urinary sample has been recorded, approximately 2-3 mL of the urine 
sample should be retained in plastic tube with a screw on top.  ( Note:  The exact volume of the 
urine sample is not important, as long as it is at least 1 mL in volume.)  The rest of the urine 
may be discarded unless it is needed for some other purpose.  The urine sample tube must be 
labeled according to subject ID and date of sample collection.  Records should be kept so that 
each urinary sample vial is linked to patient’s name, the date and time of collection, time 
between voids, and total sample volume collected.  The vial should be stored frozen at -20 ᵒC

E. Description of the Urinary PGE2 Assay 
 
ANALYTICAL PRINCIPLE 
 
Urine samples are diluted and assayed by [CONTACT_260694]. PGE2 is measured by a 
competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA), using goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin coated to 
microtiter plates.  PGE2 antibody (monoclonal) and PGE2 peroxidase are incubated with 
calibrators and samples.  The color is developed using tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate 
and read at 450 nm. The color is low when the concentration of PG-E2 is high.

PROCEDURES 
 
1. Bring all the required reagents to room temperature, including microtiter plate coated with 
goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin. 
2. Dilute the standard in assay diluent from 1.9 to 500 pg/mL. 
3. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] [ADDRESS_557892], diluted controls and diluted samples (1:10) as per 
protocol.  Add 25 μL of horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated PGE2 and 25 ul of 
anti-PGE2.  Incubate at room temperature, shaking in a rotator at 400 RPM for 2 hours. 
4 Following incubation, the plates are washed with wash buffer 4 times (manually). 
5. Add 100 μL of substrate (TMB) to develop the color.  Substrate is incubated for 30 min at 
room temperature, without shaking. At the end of the incubation, 50ul of stop solution is 
added.  The color turns into yellow.  The Developed color is read at 450 nm, within 20 
minutes, in a Multiskan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader. 
 
CALCULATION 
 
A standard curve (four-parameter curve) is produced using the calibrator concentrations and 
the optical density for respective calibrator.  The sample optical density is read using the 
standard curve.  The results for the samples are corrected for dilution and expressed in pg/ml 
of urine. 
 
8.4 Data Management 
 
8.4.1 Case Report forms 
 
Electronic case report forms (eCRF) will be used to record all data as well as other data that will 
be transferred electronically from an external source.  The investigator or an authorized person 
will record subject data in the eCRF in a precise and accurate manner. The data should be 
recorded as soon as they are available. 
 
8.4.2 Data Management Plan and Database Design 
 
The CRO will generate a study specific Data Management Plan (DMP) to detail the data handling 
guidelines and procedures related to managing the data for the lifecycle of the study.  As 
applicable, other study specific plans, guidelines, or specifications will be generated.  For 
example, a Data Review Plan (DRP) will be generated to specify the checks that are to be 
performed on patient data to raise data discrepancies/queries.  Additionally specifications and 
study specific documents will be generated to detail database development and testing activities.   
The DMP will also include data handling guidelines for protocol deviations and details to 
complete database finalization and lock activities.

CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 38 of 51 
  The co-primary objectives of assessing effects of different doses of Paxerol, when compared to 
placebo, on: 
 
A. Reduction in the number nocturia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], based on the number of nightly voids as 
recorded by [CONTACT_440067] 
B. Clinical benefit of the reduction in nocturia, based on NQOL survey  
 
Additionally, the rate of responders who achieve at least 33% of reduction in mean number of 
nocturia in compared to baseline in each treatment arm, and potential dose-related effects will 
also be evaluated. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are change from baseline in the mean values of 
the following variables in each treatment arm, when compared to placebo: 
 
A. DFUS (the time between bedtime and when the subject first go to the bathroom after 
bedtime begins, as recorded by [CONTACT_440067]) 
B. total hours of nightly sleep (the time between bedtime and wakeup time, as recorded by [CONTACT_440068]) 
 
8.6.3 Safety Endpoints 
 
One of the secondary endpoints is safety for assessing the safety and tolerability of different doses 
of Paxerol, compared to placebo. 
 
Safety variables include AEs; discontinuations; vital sign (blood pressure and heart rate); clinical 
lab (hematology, chemistry, and coagulation); urinalysis; physical examinations including 
weight); and body temperature.  All safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively.  No 
statistical inference will be applied to the safety endpoints. 
 
8.6.4 Exploratory Assessment 
 
An exploratory assessment is to examine if there is a relationship between baseline urinary PGE2 
production and the responsiveness of subjects to Paxerol.  Potential correlation between baseline 
urinary PGE2 production and the degree of reduction in nocturia will be examined via regression 
analysis.   
 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.[ADDRESS_557895] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom (including an AE occurring from drug abuse, an AE 
occurring from drug withdrawal and any failure of expected pharmacological action), or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product. 
 
Definition of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
 
In the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all noxious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADRs. The phrase 
“response to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product 
and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
 
Regarding marketed medicinal products, a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended 
and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of 
disease or for modification of physiological function. 
 
An unexpected ADR is an ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information, such as the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or the [LOCATION_002] 
Product Insert (USPI). 
 
9.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
 
AEs will be recorded from the start of Paxerol administration through 30 days after the final visit 
(Visit 3 or early discontinuation).  Any AE should be recorded on the Adverse Events form in the 
CRF and source documents. In order to avoid vague, ambiguous or colloquial expressions, the AE 
should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the subject’s own words. 
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group together into a single term signs and symptoms, 
which constitute a single diagnosis. 
 
The existence of or change in an AE may be concluded due to the necessity to administer a 
concomitant medication, from a spontaneous report of the subject, from the physical examination 
or from special tests like electroncardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), laboratory 
assessments or other study specified tests (source of AE). 
 
AEs that occur at the start of treatment and those that occur up to [ADDRESS_557896] dose of 
study drug will be handled as any other AE occurring during treatment with study drug.  
 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 40 of 51 
  Each AE is to be evaluated for severity, seriousness, duration and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug. The action taken with study drug, the concomitant treatment/therapy 
introduced and the outcome as well as whether the event led to study termination will also be 
recorded. 
 
Severity: 
 
The severity of the AE should be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03.  The website is: 
 
evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf 
 
Drug-Event Relationship:  
 
The causal relationship between the study drug and the AE should be characterized according to 
the following: 
 
- Unrelated – there is not a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE. 
- Possible – the association of the AE with the study drug is unknown, however the event is not 
reasonably supported by [CONTACT_145037]. 
- Probable – a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with drug administration exists and, in 
the Investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely that a causal relationship exists between the 
drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression or 
expression of the disease state, or concomitant medication reactions) do not appear to explain 
the AE. 
- Related - there is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug and the AE. 
 
Outcome:  
 
The outcome of the AE should be classified according to the following definitions: 
 
- Recovered / resolved: the event has resolved (no further symptoms are present and no 
treatment is being received by [CONTACT_423]). 
- Recovered / resolved with sequelae: the event has resolved but there may be lingering effects 
present (e.g., a scar following a cut or abrasion). 
- Fatal: the subject died as a result of the event. This code should only be used for the event that 
caused the death, not any event that was present at the time of the subject’s death.  Fatal 
events require immediately reporting to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative).  
- Unknown: may only be used in the event that the subject is lost to follow-up and no reliable 
data can be obtained. 
 
All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories. 
 
(Note: When the AE is ongoing, provide appropriate wording such as “not yet recovered”, “not 
yet resolved”, “ongoing”, etc. in the outcome section of the Adverse Events form in the CRF.  
Do not leave the outcome section blank.) 
 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 41 of 51 
  9.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
 
All AEs occurring during the study are to be followed up in accordance with good medical 
practice until resolved or judged no longer clinically significant, or if a chronic condition, until 
fully characterized. All follow-up results are to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized 
representative). 
 
9.4 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADRs) 
 
Definitions of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) / Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADRs) 
 
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 
- results in death, 
- is life-threatening (an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe), 
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324], 
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
- is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
In addition, medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other 
conditions should also be considered serious, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440030]. These should also 
be considered serious. 
 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_557897] be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study site’s 
knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_440069]’s authorized 
representative at the following numbers:

[ADDRESS_557898] 
Somerset, NJ [ZIP_CODE] 
Phone: [PHONE_9227]; Cell: [PHONE_9228]; E-mail:[EMAIL_8463] 
 
The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE to enable the Sponsor 
(or an authorized representative) to file a report, which satisfies regulatory reporting requirements. 
In addition to the initial 24-hour report, a completed, separate SAE Report form is to be sent to the 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 42 of 51 
  Sponsor (or an authorized representative) via fax or mail within [ADDRESS_557899]'s last visit are to be collected 
and reported as previously described. 
 
9.6 Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to 
Regulatory Authorities and Investigators 
 
Adverse reactions will be considered as unexpected if the nature, seriousness, severity or outcome 
of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference safety information. 
 
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be subject to expedited reporting. Additionally, S[LOCATION_003]Rs that occur within [ADDRESS_557900] dose of the investigation drug qualify for expedited reporting. 
 
The Sponsor (or an authorized representative) is responsible for submitting reports of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to 
the appropriate national regulatory authorities within the required reporting period. All 
Investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the study drug will be notified by [CONTACT_429] (or an authorized representative) of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs that require prompt submission to the 
IEC/IRB. The Sponsor (or an authorized representative) or the Investigator (according to national 
provisions) is responsible for notifying the IECs/IRBs in writing of the S[LOCATION_003]Rs within the 
required reporting timelines. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_440031] (or an authorized representative) in the study documentation files. 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.[ADDRESS_557901] maintain all documentation relating to this study.  Essential documents (as 
defined in the ICH Guideline of GCP) must be retained until after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region, and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 5-years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product. These documents must be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_8146](s) or if needed by 
[CONTACT_2728]. 
 
In any case, all study records such as but not limited to CRFs, regulatory documents, the subject 
identification code list, subject files and other source data that support CRFs must be retained for 
at least 15-years after the completion or discontinuation of the study. If the investigator retires, 
relocates or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], 
custody must be transferred and Sponsor notified in writing. Sponsor will notify the investigator 
in writing when the study-related records are no longer needed. 
 
11. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING 
 
Subject will be administered each treatment according to the randomization scheme produced by 
[CONTACT_440070]. 
 
12. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
 
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the investigator and the Sponsor 
prior to its implementation. Any such amendments will be submitted for consideration to the 
approving IRB/IEC. Ethical approval will be requested for any change to this protocol which 
could affect the safety of the subjects, the scope/design of the study, any increase in dosage or 
duration of exposure to the trial medication, an increase in the number of subjects treated, the 
addition of a new test or procedure, or the droppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a test intended to monitor safety. 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.2016 Page 44 of 51 
  13. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
13.1 Monitoring 
 
During the trial, a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will have regular contact [CONTACT_36362], 
including monitoring visits. Monitoring will be undertaken as described in the monitoring manual. 
The CRA will be available between visits if the investigator or other staffs at the center need 
information and advice. 
 
13.2 Source Document Verification 
 
Source documents are original documents, data and records (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, x-rays, subject files and records kept at the pharmacy, 
recorded data from automated instruments etc.).  All information in original records and certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_92827], observations, or other activities in the study are considered Source 
Data.  
The location of source data will be registered on a form specifying where the source data can be 
located, e.g. medical record, CRF, lab reports etc.  
Unless precluded by [CONTACT_440071], the CRF may be the source document. 
The following information must be available for Source Data Verification (SDV) in source 
documents other than the CRF:  
• Date of ICF. 
• Gender and date of birth. 
• Clinical Trial Protocol number. 
• Statement that the subject is participating in the clinical trial.  
• Data for evaluation of eligibility criteria. 
• Relevant medical history and diagnosis. 
• Screening Number and Subject Number. 
• Administration of trial drug. 
• All study visit dates. 
• Adverse Events. 
• Concomitant Medication. 
• Date and reason for exclusion or withdrawal.  
Source data verification will require direct access to all original records for each subject. During 
the first monitoring visits, 100% SDV will be performed.  At later monitoring visits, SDV will be 
done for the items during the first monitoring where discrepancies was found and on few data 
randomly chosen before the monitoring visit. 
 
13.3 Audits and Inspections 
 
Authorized representatives of the sponsor, a regulatory authority or an IEC both national and 
foreign, may visit the center to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose of an audit or 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all trial related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP, guidelines of the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Protocol No:  CL-Paxerol-002 
  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version:  09.23.[ADDRESS_557902] the sponsor/Contract Research Organization (CRO) immediately if 
contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency about an inspection at their centre. The sponsor has the right to 
perform an audit of the study site and the CRO. Such audit will be conducted according to a 
specific audit plan. 
 
14. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
14.[ADDRESS_557903] 
 
The trial will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and 
the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki and applicable regulatory requirements.

14.[ADDRESS_557904] of the Trial 
 
The investigator(s) will respect and protect the confidentiality of the subject in all possible ways. 
Subject identification, other than subject number and initials, will not appear in any CRF pages or 
other documents given to the Sponsor. Only the investigator and the persons authorized to verify 
the quality and integrity of the study (inspector/auditor) will have access to subject records where 
the subject can be identified. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_557905] should be 
given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
 
The subjects’ signed and dated ICF must be obtained before conducting any trial related 
procedure. 
 
The signed and dated ICFs will be kept by [CONTACT_440072].  A copy of the signed Written ICF must be given to the subject. 
 
The written ICF will explain that the trial data will remain confidential in accordance with 
national data legislation. Initials and subject number will solely identify subjects in the database. 
The written ICF will also explain that data verification purposes, authorized representatives of the 
sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IEC, require direct access to parts of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440033], including the subject’s medical history.

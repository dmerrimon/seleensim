Brief Summary:  
In criƟcally ill pa Ɵents, nutri Ɵon is a major part of healing and recovery. In pa Ɵents unable to tolerate 
oral feeding, nasoenteric tube feeding (a tube placed from the nose to the stomach or small intes Ɵne) 
provides a safe alterna Ɵve for feeding. Some pa Ɵents require these tubes to be placed endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745262] Ɵent factors including diﬃcult anatomy, need for post -gastric feeding, among 
others). In pa Ɵents that require endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745263], there is risk of perfora Ɵon, infecƟon, 
bleeding, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_20116] Ɵon, and rarely even death. In pa Ɵents that have recurrent dislodgement of 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745263], the need for repeat endoscopy increases pa Ɵent exposure to these risks. 
TradiƟonal securing mechanism with adhesive tape to reduce dislodgment o Ōen fail in cri Ɵcally ill 
paƟents requiring pa Ɵents to have repeat endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745264]Ɵents poten Ɵally to increased cumula Ɵve risks associated with each endoscopy.  
The inves Ɵgators propose to collect data for one year, the inves Ɵgators will prospec Ɵvely follow via chart 
review endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745265] a Standard AMT Bridle securement device 
and assess if there is a reduc Ɵon in accidental tube removal requi ring replacement endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. 
 
Outcomes: 
Primary objec Ɵve is to see if nasal bridles versus standard adhesive tape to secure nasoenteric tubes 
decreases the need for repeat endoscopy to replace dislodged nasoenteric tubes. The number of 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745266]. Secondary 
objecƟves can assess if reduces tube dislodgement frequency. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that nasal 
bridles in endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745267] Ɵons. 
Detailed Descrip Ɵon:  
PaƟents to be recruited are those who are scheduled to undergo rou Ɵne upper endoscopy with 
nasoenteric tube placement. Pa Ɵents will be randomized into two groups: control arm and device arm.  
Control arm includes pa Ɵents that will have nasoenteric tubes secured with standard protocol, adhesive 
tape. Device arm includes pa Ɵents that will have nasoenteric tubes secured with Standard AMT Bridle. 
The nasal bridles will be placed by [CONTACT_66923][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Upper endoscopy will not be aﬀected. Placement of 
nasal bridle will take 1- [ADDRESS_1019420] will not be blinded as they will be placing the 
securement device and in order to reduce selec Ɵon bias. 
In the eve nt of tube dislodgment, the pa Ɵent will receive same treatment.  
Follow-up of paƟents will occur via chart review un Ɵl the Ɵme of discharge, at 6 months and at 12 
months a Ōer feeding tube placement via chart review. Data collected with include repeat EGD, length of 
endoscopy, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and mortality. The number of endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_745268]. 
 
StaƟcal Analysis 
DescripƟve staƟsƟcs (means, medians, percentage) will be used to deﬁne the pa Ɵent characteris Ɵcs. Chi-
square will be used for categorical variables. T-test will be used to analyze conƟnuous variables.

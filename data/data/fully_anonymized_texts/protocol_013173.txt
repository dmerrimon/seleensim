Title: A Phase 1, Randomized, Open -label, Two -arm, Parallel group, Single -dose Study to  Compare the 
Pharmacokinetics and Safety of the Auto -injector and Pre -filled Syringe of CT -P17 in Healthy Subjects  
Study Phase: Phase 1 
Study Center(s): Approximately [ADDRESS_222528] Investigational Drug,  Dose and Route of Administration:  
CT-P17, 40 mg/0.4  mL a single subcutaneous (SC) injection via auto-injector (AI)   
Reference Investigational Drug,  Dose and Route of Administration:  
CT-P17, 40 mg/0.4  mL a single SC injection via pre -filled syringe (PFS)  
Study Design and Rationale:  
This study is a phase 1, randomized, open-label , two-arm, parallel group, single -dose study , which is 
designed to compare the  pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of CT -P17 SC administration via AI and PFS in 
healthy subjects. Approximately  180 subjects will be enrolled  and randomly assigned to one of the two  
treatment arms  in a 1:1 ratio. In each treatment arm, all subjects will receive a single dose ( 40 mg ) of CT -P17 
via either AI or PFS on Day 1 followed by 10 weeks  during which PK, safety,  and immunogenicity 
measurements will be made. The randomization to treatment assignment will be stratified by [CONTACT_18694] 
(≥80 kg vs. <80 kg) as measured on baseline ( Day -1), gender (male vs. female)  and study center . 
 
A schematic of the study design is presented in Figure S1.

Sample Size:  
A sample size of 162 (81 subjects from each arm ) will provide at least 90% power to show similarity in PK 
of CT-P17 AI and CT -P17 PFS using 90% confidence interval (CI) approach based on 80% to 125% 
equivalence margin, expected geometric mean ratio of 1. 0, and coefficient of variation (CV) of 45%, which  is 
assumed based upon  historical PK data in healthy subjects.  Considering a 10% drop -out ra te, approximately 
180 subjects (90 subjects in each treatment arm) will be randomized.

 Page 13 Statistical Analyses:  
Pharmacokinetic analysis : All PK analyses will be conducted  on the PK population. The PK parameters of 
CT-P17 will be analyzed using non -compartmental methods based on the actual sampling times. The primary 
PK analysis will assess the bioequivalence of CT -P17 SC administration via AI versus PFS in terms of 
AUC 0-inf, AUC 0-last, and C max. The primary PK parameters will be based on an analysis of covariance  
(ANCOVA)  model with covariate(s) . Point estimates (geometric means and ratio of geometric means) will be 
calculated from back transforming the least squares means of the natural log -transformed values of AUC 0-inf, 
AUC 0-last, and C max and difference in the least squares means. The PK of CT -P17 administered via AI and 
PFS will be determined to be equivalent if the  90% CIs for the ratios of geometric means of primary 
endpoints  is within the acceptance interval of 80% t o 125%.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented in data listings and summarized in tables. The tables will 
display the following descriptive statistics: number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, geometric mean, and CV.  
For secondary endpoints, following PK parameters will be assessed: %AUC extrap, Tmax, Vz/F, λz, t1/2, and 
CL/F . 
Additional PK analyses may be performed as detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
Safety and immunogenicity analysis : All safety  and i mmunogenicity analyses will be conducted on the safety 
population, and listed and summarized by [CONTACT_22058] t arm. The number and percentage of subject experienced 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_188518]. Adverse eve nts will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_48688]. Serious adverse events will be listed separately . 
Adverse events will be recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  v5.[ADDRESS_222536]

(Harriman  et al 1999 ; Hsia  et al 2006 ). In general, TNF -α is produced mainly by 
[CONTACT_179968], but also by a broad variety of other cell types. I t has a wide spectrum of 
activities including coordinating host immune and inflammatory response to infectious, 
malignant, and autoimmune conditions. There are 2 types of TNF receptors, p55 and p75, 
part of a large family of structurally related cell -surfa ce receptors ( Bazzoni and Beutler 
1996 ). There is evidence that the p75 receptor stimulates T cells proliferation and suppresses 
TNF -α-mediated inflammatory responses, whereas the p55 receptor appears to be critical i n 
triggering host defense and inflammatory responses ( Tartaglia  et al 1993 ; Peschon et al 
1998 ). 
Large amounts of TNF -α are released in response to lipopolysaccharide, other bact erial 
products, and interleukin -1. Tumor necrosis factor -alpha induces proinflammatory cytokines 
such as interleukin -1 and interleukin -6, enhances leukocyte migration, activates neutrophil 
and eosinophil functional activity, and induces acute phase reactan ts, other liver proteins, and 
tissue -degrading enzymes. Although there is a benefit to TNF -α expression in response to 
infection or injury, there are increased concentrations associated with  a variety of 
inflammatory conditions such as  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn ’s disease, ulcerative 
colitis, uveitis , ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis.  
Greater understanding of the role of inflammatory mediators has produced effective biologic  
treatments for inflamma tory conditions, including  Humira (a dalimumab ), a fully humanized 
anti-TNF -α monoclonal antibody. Adalimumab is structurally and functionally analogous to 
naturally occurring human immunoglobulin G1  (IgG1) and demonstrates a high specificity 
and affinity f or TNF.  Adalimumab binds to TNF -α and blocks its interaction with the cell 
surface TNF receptors, p55 and p75 ( Humira  USPI  2019). It does not bind other cytokines 
such as lymphotoxin. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expr essing cells in vitro in the 
presence of complement ( Humira  USPI  2019 ).

(US) in December of 2002  and in the European Union ( EU) in September o f 2003  (FDA 
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 17 2002 , EMA  EP AR for Humira 2017 , Humira SmPC 201 8). In the EU, Humira is indicated for 
the following conditions: RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial  spondyloarthritis  (ankylosing 
spondylitis  [AS] , axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS),  psoriatic 
arthritis, psoriasis, pediatric plaque  psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn ’s disease, 
pediatric Crohn ’s disease, ulcerative colitis , uveiti s and pediatric uveitis ; in the US, Humira is 
indicated for the same conditions except axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS , and pediatric plaque psoriasis  (Humira  USPI  2019, Humira SmPC 201 8). 
The original  product , Humira, is supplied as a sterile, preservative -free solution of 
adalimumab for subcutaneous (SC) adm inistration  (Humira  USPI  2019). Humira is supplied 
in two strengths:  50 mg/mL (40 mg/0.8 mL ) and 100 mg/mL (40 mg/0.4 mL).  
CT-P17 i s manufactured using a Chinese H amster Ovary cell line by [CONTACT_14514] -batch cell culture, 
followed by [CONTACT_188519], purification, formulation, and subsequent fill -finish operations. The 
primary amino acid sequences of adalimumab in CT -P17 are identical to  those  of Humira. 
CT-P17 will be supplied in a pre-filled syringe (PFS) and auto -injector (AI)  at a conce ntration 
of 100 mg/mL  (40 mg/0.4 mL ) as a clear to opalescent, colorless to brown liquid for 
subcutaneous administration. The CT -P17 drug product will have the same pharmaceutical 
form and strength as Humira and is intended to have a highly similar quality  profile to 
Humira.  
CELLTRION, Inc. plans to seek approval for all indications for which the original product 
has been approved by [CONTACT_188520] -P17 with the original product through 
an extensive array of quality, nonclinical  and clinical comparability assessments.

1.4 Clinical Studies  
The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of adalimumab in healthy subject s were 
evaluated in a series of p hase 1 studies.  
Study DE024  was a single center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -
group, ascending single -dose study in healthy male subjects. A total of 80 subjects (6 0 active 
and 20  placebo) participated in the study. Active subjects received a single intravenous  (IV) 
dose of 1  mg/kg adalimumab over 2 to 3 minutes or 0.1, 0.3, an d 1 mg/kg adalimumab via SC 
injection . Results demonstrated that f ollowing SC administratio n of adalimumab the mean 
maximum observed serum concentration ( Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve 
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 18 (AUC) from zero to infinity ( AUC 0-inf) increased with increasing dose , with dose proportional 
increases noted at the 0.3 and 1 mg/kg SC doses o nly. The time to C max (Tmax) ranged from 48 
to 336 hours  and t he mean ha lf-lives ranged from 284 to 433  hours across  doses.  
Study DE015  was an open -label, randomized, parallel -group, single -dose study to assess the 
absolute and relative bioavailability of three injectable formulations  of human anti -TNF 
antibody D2E7 in healthy male and female subjects. Subjects received 40 mg D2E7 as three 
different formulations via IV (50 mg/mL D2E7, with Tween -80) or SC injection (25 mg/mL 
D2E7, without Tween -80; 50 mg/mL D2E7, with Tween -80; and 50 mg/mL D2E7, without 
Tween -80). The results indicated that the mean C max and T max for the three SC form ulations of 
D2E7 were comparable. The overview and results of Studies DE024 and DE015 can be found 
in Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Review(s) , FDA . 
An overview of the safety profile of Humira, in cluding undesirable effects, can be found in 
the Humira Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ), European  Public Assessment 
Report (EPAR) for Humira, and prescribing information  for US -licensed Humira  (Humira 
SmPC 201 8; EMA  EP AR for Humira 2017 ; Humira  USPI  2019).  
One study of CT -P17 has been completed. CT-P17 1.[ADDRESS_222541] -P17 and EU- 
approved Humira  were safe and well -tolerated in the healthy male subjects , and the PK 
results ( Cmax, AUC 0-inf and AUC 0-last) were comparable between the groups . In addition, there 
are three  clinical trials  with CT -P17 that are ongoing or planned. CT -P17 1.[ADDRESS_222542] -P17, US -
licensed Humira and EU -approved Humira in healthy subjects. Two Phase  3 studies are  also 
ongoing and planned; CT-P17 3.[ADDRESS_222543]-P17 AI in patients with moderate to severe active RA.  
1.5 Rationale for Study  
The i ntroduction of biosimilar (follow -on) medicinal products is desirable as they will 
enhance patient access by [CONTACT_188521]. The 
purpose of this study is to compare the PK, safety, and immunogenicity of the CT -P17 AI and 
CT-P17 PFS after a single SC injection  of [ADDRESS_222544] to healthy subjects 
following the recommendations of the guidance  for industry , “Rheumatoid Arthritis: 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_188497] ” (DHHS 2013).  
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.[ADDRESS_222545]-P17 (40 mg) selected for this study is in line with the approved labeling for 
Humira (Humira SmPC 201 8; Humira  USPI  2019).  
CT-P17 has been developed for SC in jection , considering the benefits in terms of  patient 
convenience, better compliance, reduced pharmacy preparation times, and optimization of 
medical resources.  
This study is desi gned to compare the PK of CT -P17 SC a dministration via AI versus PFS in 
healthy sub jects. Auto -injectors offer several advantages over PFS including simplif ied self-
administration, redu ced patient anxiety, improved safety by [CONTACT_188522], as well as improved compliance through controlled and 
standardized administration.  
The study will be conducted in healthy subjects to avoid potentially high variability of the 
exposure of adalimumab if administered to patients with underlying and/or concomitant 
disease and concomitant medications. Bioequivalenc e will be based on the criteria of area 
under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-inf), AUC  from 
time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0-last), and C max. 
1.6 Risk –Benefit Assessment  
Information about the risk foll owing the administration of adalimumab was taken from the 
prescribing information for US -licensed Humira (Humira  USPI  2019) and Humira SmPC  for 
EU-approved Humira ( Humira SmPC 201 8). In view of the structural, biological, and 
toxicological similarity  to Humira , CT-P17 is expected to display a similar  safety profile.  
The proposed safety screening and monitoring  assessments are  deemed to be sufficient to 
monitor potential risks of CT -P17 administration.  Since adalimumab will be administered 
only once at the approved dosage of [ADDRESS_222546] -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 20 2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
 To demonstrate the PK similarity in terms of AUC 0-inf, AUC 0-last, and C max of CT -P17 SC 
administration  via AI versus PFS  in healthy subjects

4.[ADDRESS_222558] Withdrawal /Discontinuation and Replacement  
Subjects will be discontinued  from the study prematurely for the following reasons:  
 Withdrawal of consent: Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time  for 
any reason .  
 Protocol deviation : The subject  may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_188524] : 
– If protocol  deviations  that may affect study obje ctives occur, or  
– If it is discovered that the subject has entered the study in violation of the protocol . 
 Adverse event : If subject reports symptoms  that are considered unacceptable by [CONTACT_36284]/or sponsor , he or she  will be withdrawn from the study.  
 Subject  dies. 
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.[ADDRESS_222559] withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal shall b e recorded by 
[CONTACT_093] i n both the source documents and  electronic case report form (eCRF).  
If a subject discontinues prematurely after dosing, the subject will be asked to return to the 
study center  and will undergo all EOS  (i.e., Day 71) assessments .  All subjects who withdraw 
from the study because of an AE or clinical laboratory abnormality will be followed -up at 
suitabl e intervals in order to evaluate the course of the AE or laboratory abnormality and to 
ensure resolution or stabilization of the event. The subsequent outcomes of these events will 
be recorded in the both the source documents and eCRF.  
For subjects who are  lost to follow -up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because 
they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator 
will show due diligence by [CONTACT_144956], e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. Subjects who fail to return for 
final assessments will be contact[CONTACT_188525]. The status of subjects who fail to complete final assessments will be 
documented in the both the source documents and eCRF.  
For screen failed subjects, rescreen  will b e allowed only once  after receiv ing informed 
consent form ( ICF) again with new screening  ID; however, subjects withdrawn  (after 
randomization) will not be replaced.  
4.4 Premature Termination of the Clinical Trial  
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for reasonabl e medical 
and/or administrative reasons. As far as possible, this should occur after mutual consultation.  
If the study is terminated prematurely by [CONTACT_456], all subject s will be kept fully informed 
and an appropriate follow -up examination of the subjec ts will be arranged. The investigator 
will inform the institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) of 
any premature termination or suspension of the study, where applicable.

 Page 36 6.2 Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will be performed on AEs (including serious AEs  [SAEs] ), AEs of special 
interest (AESI) (injection site reactions, hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, infections, and 
malignancies), immunogenicity, hypersensitivity /allergic reaction assessments by [CONTACT_188529] (including systolic and di astolic blood pressure , heart  rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , and body temperature), vital sign and weight  measurement , ECG, physical 
examination, IGRA, chest X -ray, pregnancy testing, clinical laboratory testing  (including 
hematology, serum chemistry , and urinalysis) , local  site pain using 100  mm V AS, signs and 
symptoms of TB , and prior and concomitant medications monitored throughout the study.  
Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV (HIV -1 and HIV -2) status and syphilis will be tested for the 
subject ’s eligibility determination.  
6.2.1 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions of Adverse Event s 
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance.   
An AE is defin ed as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans,  whether or not considered drug related . Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_188530].  
A treatment -emergent AE  (TEAE)  is defined as any event not present before exposure to 
study drug or any event already present that worsens in severity  or frequency after exposure  
to study drug. This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity o r 
frequency from the baseline condition; abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including 
laboratory test abnormalities are considered AEs if they  fulfill the following:  
 Result in discontinuation from the study  
 Require treatment or any other therapeutic  intervention  
 Require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same procedure to 
confirm the abnormality)  
 Are associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by [CONTACT_8127] a 
significant clinical impact  
Medical interventi ons such as surgery, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures are 
not AEs but the action taken to treat the medical condition. They should be recorded as 
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 37 treatment(s) of the AEs. The event term of primary cause should be recorded and reported 
instead of the term of surgery, diagnostic procedure, or therapeutic procedure . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_222573]  
The following AESIs will be reported using the same process as for AEs : 
Injection site reactions  
Injection site reactions will be observed after study drug administration and assessed based 
on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. All AEs related to 
injection site reaction including erythema, itching, hemorrhage, pain , and swell ing will be 
reported.  
Hypersensitivity /allergic reactions  
All AEs related to hypersensitivity and allergic reactions occurring within 24 hours after the 
study drug administration will be reported . 
Infection  
All AEs related to infection including TB, sepsis , and other opportunistic infections will be 
reported.  
Malignancy  
All AEs related to malignancy including but not limited to the following: hepatosplenic T -cell 
lymphoma, leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_222574] medical occurrence that  at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is immediately life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.[ADDRESS_222575]  or may require  medical or su rgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do  not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_222576] information ( e.g., IB) for an unapproved 
investigational product . Assessment of expectedness will be made with the use of the IB . 
Therefore, if a treatment -related SAE occurs and it was not mentioned in the applicable 
product information, th en it will be reported as a S[LOCATION_003]R  (Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be assessed from the time the ICF is signed and  until the end of the 
subject ’s participation in the study . All A Es will be followed until resolution or improvement 
to baseline, death, confirmed by [CONTACT_188531], no more collection of clinical or safety data, or final database closure. Adverse 
events of special interes t (e.g., injection site reactions, hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, 
infections, and malignancies) will be closely monitored.  
At each visit, s ubjects will be asked a standard question to elicit any medically related 
changes in their  well-being. They wil l also be asked if they have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any 
accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and OTC  medications).  
In addition to subject observations, AEs will be documented from any data colle cted on the 
AE page of the eCRF ( e.g., laboratory values, physical examination findings, ECG changes) 
or other documents that are relevant to subject safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded in both the source documents 
and on the AE page of the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of 
event, time of onset, action taken with study drug,  investigator -specified assessment of 
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 39 severity and relationship to study drug, time  of resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as 
any required treatme nt or evaluations, and outcome.  
Adverse events  resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease s tates will also be reported. 
Adverse events will be recorded according  CTCAE  v5.0. The Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs.   
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but d oes not 
deteriorate will not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
The investigator ’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is n ot a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event will be 
reported.  
The severity and the relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributi ng to 
the AE will be characterized as defined in Sections  [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] , respectively.  
Adverse events (and SAEs) shou ld be reported until the EOS visit regardless of the 
relationship to the study drug. After the EOS  visit, serious adverse drug reactions will be 
reported to CELLTRION, Inc. or its designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_188532] ( Section  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 ) must be reported to  PVG and the sponsor immediately (within [ADDRESS_222577] notices about the event ).  
The following contact [CONTACT_160523]:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the subject  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188501], a copy of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188502]  (or e-mailed) to  PVG as soon as it becomes available. 
Withdrawal from the study and all therapeutic measur es will be at the discretion of the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator .  

CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 40 CELLTRION, Inc. or its designee is responsible for reporting rel evant SAEs to the competent 
authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in 
accordance with European Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 200 1/20/EC), International 
Council for Harmonisation  (ICH) guidelines, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
CELLTRION, Inc. or its designee is responsible for reporting  fatal or life -threatening  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs  (expedited reports) to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities by 
[CONTACT_144530] 7  calendar days after being notified of the event. CELLTRION, Inc. 
or its designee should report other relevant SAEs associated with the use of the study drug to 
the appropriate c ompetent authorities (according to local guidelines), investigators, and 
central ethics committees by a written safety report within 15  calendar days of notification.  
Adverse events associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188503]. Any initial admission (even if less than 24  hours) to a healthcare fac ility 
meets these criteria. Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188504]/intensive 
care unit ( e.g., from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, from medical floor to a coronary 
care unit, from neuro logical floor to a TB unit) . 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188505] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_188506]. Examples include the following:  
 Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or worsen ing of the pre -existing condition ( e.g., for work -
up of persistent pre -treatment lab oratory abnormality)  
 Social admission ( e.g., subject  has no place to sleep)  
 Administrative admission ( e.g., for yearly physical examination)  
 Protocol -specified admission during a study ( e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_60658])  
 Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] ( e.g., for elective

documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subjec t 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The severity, or intensity, of an AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject ’s 
daily activities. The severity  of the AE will b e graded based on the CTCAE v5.0 , based on 
the following general guidelines (a semicolon indicates “or” within eac h description):  
Grade 1:  Mild AE (minor; no specific medical intervention; asymptomatic laboratory 
findings only; radiographic findings only; marginal clinical relevance)  
Grade 2:  Moderate AE (minimal intervention; local intervention; noninvasive 
interven tion [packing, cautery])  
Grade 3:  Severe and undesirable AE (significant symptoms requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188508]; transfusion; elective interventional radiological 
procedure; therapeutic endoscopy or operation)  
Grade 4:  Life-threateni ng or disabling AE (complicated by [CONTACT_9420], life -threatening 
metabolic or cardiovascular complications such as circulatory failure, 
hemorrhage, or sepsis; life -threatening physiological consequences; need for 
intensive care or emergent invasive procedure; em ergent interventional 
radiological procedure, therapeutic endoscopy, or operation)  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity  to be perfor med. If an AE upgrades in severity  or, 
changes from non -serious to serious, a new AE needs to be reported. If an AE downgrades in 
severity , it should not be reported as a new AE. Adverse events characterized as intermittent 
do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
As discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , the investigator ’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to study 
drug is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not 
reported in the study. If th ere is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the 
event will be reported.  
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 42 The relationship or association of study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the followi ng classification and criteria:  
Unrelated:  This relationship suggests that there is no association between the study drug 
and the reported event.  
Possible:  This relationship suggests that treatment with the study drug caused or 
contributed to the AE, i.e., the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration or follows a known response pattern to the 
study drug, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604].  
Probable:  This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with drug admini stration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological 
action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug 
or class of drugs, or judgment based on the investigator ’s clinical experience, 
the association of the event with the s tudy drug seems likely. The event 
disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the dose of study drug.  
Definite:  This relationship suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between drug 
administration and the AE, and other conditions (co ncurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do 
not appear to explain the event. The event reappears or worsens if the study 
drug is re -administered.  
6.2.2 Other Safety Assessment s 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunogenicity Assessment  
Immunogenicity of CT -P17 will be assessed at the time points indicated in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table  10-1). 
The immunogenicity of CT -P17 will be assessed at baseline  and post -treatment serum 
measures by a validated immunoassay.  
Samples will be drawn before dosing of study drug, at the same time as the clinical laboratory 
tests, where applicable. If the blood sample was unable to be analyzed  or was missing, some 
blood samples collected for PK assessment at the same time  point could be used for 
immunogenicity assessment. Analysis of the samples will be performed at the bioanalytical  
laboratory.  
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 43 [IP_ADDRESS]  Injection Site Reaction  
Injection site reactions will be assessed 30 minutes (±10 minutes) after study drug 
administration, as specified in the schedule of  assessments  (Table  10-1).  
Details will be recorded in both the source documents and the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypersensitivity/Allergic Reactions  Monitoring  
Hypersensitivity /allergic  reactions will be assessed by [CONTACT_188533] d vital sign 
monitoring (including systolic and diastolic  blood pressure  [mmHg] , heart rate  [beats per 
minute ], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  [breaths per minute] , and body temperature  [°C]), to monitor for 
possible hypersensitivity /allergic reactions, at the time points indicated in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table  10-1). 
In addition, hypersensitivity/allergic reactions will be monitored by [CONTACT_188534]. In case of hypersensitivity, emergency medication and equipment, such 
as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_188509], oxygen, and artificial ventilation will be available  and an ECG can be performed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Sign s, Weight, and Height  
Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the schedule of assessments 
(Table  10-1). The following v ital sign s will be  measured : systolic and diastolic blood pressure  
(mmHg), heart  rate (beats per minute) , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  (breaths per minute) , and  body 
temperature (°C) . Blood  pressure  and heart rate measurements will be performed  after the 
subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes.  All measurements will be documented at each 
visit. Details will be recorded in both the source documents and the eCRF.  
Vital sign measurements will also be monitored before and after study drug administration  as 
part of the hypersensitivity monitoring ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Body weight and height will be measured according to the schedule of asse ssments 
(Table  10-1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram  
Single [ADDRESS_222578] 5 minutes at the time points indicated in the schedule of assessments ( Table  10-1). 
Electrocardiograms for hypersensitivity monitoring will be performed  at 3 hours (±30 
minutes) after the administration of study drug  and additional ECGs can be performed if the 
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.[ADDRESS_222579] can be performed  depending on the investigator ’s discretion . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examinations  
A standard physical examination will be performed at the time points  indicated in the 
schedule of assessments ( Table  10-1).  
The physical examination includes an assessment of general appearance and a review of 
systems . Investigators will evaluate subjects for any indication of infections and injection site 
reactions in accordance with the investigator ’s medical judgment.  
Information about the physical examinations will be recorded by [CONTACT_188535]. Any abnormalities will be recorded in the source 
documents. Clinically significant findings and illnesses reported after the start of the study 
that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded as such in the source doc uments  and eCRF . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tuberculosis Assessments  
At Screening, s ubject s with  active TB, latent TB (defined as a positive result for IGRA with 
no active lesion in examination of chest X-ray without any sign or symptom of TB), a history 
of TB, had close contact [CONTACT_57999] h a person with active TB or traveled to areas within a high 
incidence of TB within 8 weeks prior to the administration of the study drug (Day 1) or has 
plans to travel to the area in which TB is prevalent during the study period  will not be 
enrolled in th e study.  
Subjects will be monitored for the clinical signs and symptoms of TB  throughout the study  
and until the EOS , as specified in the schedule of assessments ( Table  10-1); IGRA and chest 
X-ray can be performed at the investigator ’s discretion based on the judgment on the signs 
and symptoms of TB monitoring.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_222580] X-ray (both posterior –anterior and lateral views) will be performed at Screening as 
indicated in the schedule of assessments ( Table  10-1). The results w ill be read by a qualified 
radiologist to specifically look for evidence of current or previous  active or latent TB.  The 
findings will be recorded in both the  source documents and eCRF.  
CELLTRION, Inc.  CT-P17 
Protocol Number CT -P17 1.[ADDRESS_222581] X-ray will be available to the investigator for review and any 
abnormal findings will be discussed with  the medical monitor and sponsor before the 
administration of the study drug (Day 1).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Interfero n-γ Release A ssay 
An IGRA will be performed at Screening and at the time point indicated in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table  10-1).  
If the result o f IGRA is indeterminate at S creening, retest will be allowed only once during 
the Screening period. If the repeated IGRA result is again indeterminate or posit ive, the 
subject will be excluded from the study. If the repeated IGRA result is negative, the subject 
may be included in the study.  
If the result of the IGRA is indeterminate after administration of the study drug, one retest 
will be possible. If the repe ated IGRA test result is again indeterminate, the investigator will 
discuss and agree with the sponsor or its designee the n ext action to be taken.  
If the result of the IGRA is positive during the study, subjects will be referred to the clinicians 
immediat ely to be investigated for the presence of active TB based on medical history and 
any clinical sign s and symptoms including chest X -ray result.  
The analysis will be performed at the local laboratory.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
A serum pregnancy test ( -human chorionic gon adotropin) will be performed on women of 
childbearing potential at Screening , Day -1 and EOS  visit, as indicated in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table  10-1). Only subjects  with negative  results for both  serum pregnancy test s 
at Screening and Day -[ADDRESS_222582] be

any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, 
or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate h azard to study subjects without prior 
IRB/IEC  approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation 
or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments will be submitted to the 
IRB/IEC  for review and approval, to  the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory 
authorities, if required.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_1275] . A significant deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol by [CONTACT_160529] a significant and additional risk to the subject ’s rights, 
safety and well -being . Significant deviations can include nonadherence to inclusion or 
exclusion criteria, or nonadherence to a regulatory  agency ’s regulations or ICH Good Clinical 
Practice  guidelines, and will lead to the subject  being withdrawn from the study ( Section  4.3). 
Protocol deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_11782]. The investigator will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_11783].

1. During the screening period, retest for screening is permitted only once by [CONTACT_737]’s judgment. If the repeated test  result is again no t suitable or indeterminate for 
inclusion, the subject will be screen failed . 
2. Subjects will be confined to the study cen ter until completion of the 48 -hour assessments after the administration of the study drug (Day 1) and admission can be extended 
depending on the subject’s and study center’s availability. The consecutive study visits will be carried out on an out -patient basis.  
3. All EOS assessments will be performed on Day 71 , for all subjects including those who discontinued prematurely . 
4. Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be confirmed before Day -1. On the Day -1, recheck process will be performed . 
5. Height will be  measured  at Screening only.  
6. Serology tests will be performed at the Screening visit  for anti-HIV (HIV -1 and HIV -2) antibodie s, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) , 
hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb  [total or IgG] ), HBV DNA  (if subject has  HBsAg negative, HBsAb negative or positive, and HBcAb positive ), hepatitis C antibody ( HCAb ), 
and nontreponemal (e.g., Rapid Plasma Reagin) tests.  
7. At Screening, a chest X -ray, an IGRA , and signs and symptoms of TB clinical monitoring will be performed. If the result of IGRA is indeterminate at Screening, a retest will 
be allowed only once during the Screening period. Additional IGRA test and chest X -ray will be performed if symptoms raise a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_188511] . Only IGRA  will be performed at the EOS visit ; signs and symptoms of TB clinical  monitoring  will be performed throughout 
the study  and until the EOS . 
8. A serum pregnancy test on women of childbearing potential will be performed at Screening , Day -[ADDRESS_222609] result is positive.  
9. Urine drug screen (t etrahydrocannabinol , opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] , cocaine , methamphetamine , barbiturates  and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651])  and history check by [CONTACT_188555], alcohol , and nicotine  in Screening  and Day -1. 
10. Clinical laboratory tests will be carried out: Hematology  (hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, absolute neutrophil count, 
platelets ), Serum  chemistry  (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, t otal cholesterol, 
creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, creatine ki nase–myocardial band isoenzyme [CK -MB] , creatinine clearance [esti mated by [CONTACT_188537] -Gault formula], C -
reactive protein, gamma -glutamyl transferase, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, uric acid , direct bilirubin, 
triglycerides, inorganic phosphorus,  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Troponin I ), Urinalysis  (color, pH, specific  gravity , ketones , protein , glucose , bilirubin , nitrite , 
urobilinogen , occult  blood , and microscopic  examination ). Creatinine clearance will be calculated using serum creatinine level only at screening for inclusion . 
11. Vital sign measurement on Day 1 will be performed  before the start of the study drug administration (within 30 minutes) . Additional vital signs will be measured after the study 
drug administration.  On D ay 1 (pre -dose) and Day 2, the vital signs measurement may be considered as a part of hypersensitivity monitoring  and only either one will be recorded 
in the eCRF.   
12. The study drug will be administered on the subject’s lower abdomen except for the [ADDRESS_222610]’s navel . 
13. Samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained at the following time points:  
PK sampling time points  
Day 1 Pre -dose (within 60 minutes  prior to administration of the study drug ) 
Day 1 (6 hours after the administration of the study drug ); ±15 minutes  
Day 1 (12 hours after the administration of the study drug ); ±1 hour  
Day 2 (24 hours after the administration of the study drug ); ±2 hours  
Day 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8 , and 9 (48, 72, 96 , 108, 120, 132, 144, 168 , and 192 hours , respectively,  after the 
administration of the study drug ); ±[ADDRESS_222611] -P17 1.3  Protocol Version 2.0  
 Page 68 Day 15 and 22 (336 and 504 hours, respectively, after the administration of the study drug); ±4 hours  
Day 29, 43, 57 , and 71 ( i.e., EOS ) after the administration of the study drug; ±1 day  
14. Sample for immunogenicity  analysis on Day 1 will be performed prior to the study drug administration  within 60 minutes . 
15. For hypersensitivity monitoring, vital sign measurement s will be performed before the start of the study drug administration ( within 15 minutes) and  at 3, 6, 12, and 24  hours 
after administration  on Day 1. The tolerance window is ±30 minutes for 3 and 6 hours, and ±60 minutes for 12 and 24 hour s after the administration . Either 3 -lead or 12 -lead 
ECG  can be used at 3 hours (±30 minutes) after the administration of the study drug on Day [ADDRESS_222612] experience s cardiac symptoms . 
Emergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (inhalational therapy, oxygen and artificial ventilator) must be available.  
16. Injection site  reaction will be assessed 30 minutes (±10 minutes)  after the study drug administration.  
17. Local site pain will be observed using 100 mm VAS immediately (within 15 minutes) after the study drug administration.  
18. Use of all prior and concomitant medications, from within 30 days prior to the  administration of the study drug (Day 1) until the last assessment date or EOS visit, will be 
recorded.  
19. Adverse events  (and serious adverse events ) should be reported until the EOS visit , regardless of the relationship to the study drug.

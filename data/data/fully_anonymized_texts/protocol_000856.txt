Title:  Telemedicine to Improve Use of Therapeutic Hypothermia in Rural Settings     
Clinicaltrials.gov #: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Background: Neonatal Encephalopathy (NE) is a clinical syndrome affecting between 2-5  per 
1000 live births1. Abnormalities  in the newborn neurological exam are the hallmark of NE which 
occurs due to the combined effects of lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain around the 
time of birth. As many as 15-2 0% of infants with NE do not survive their brain injury and 25% of 
surviv ors experience subs tantial neuro-d evelopmental deficits including intellectual dis ability, 
cerebral palsy, epi[INVESTIGATOR_809885]2. Until recently, infants suspected of having 
NE were treated with s upportive care alone as there were no known therapeutic  interventions. 
Approximately ten years ago, however, treatment options dramatically changed with the 
introduction of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), a novel neuroprotective therapy which involves 
deliberately decreas ing the infant’s  body temperature to 33.5°C for 72 hours. The early safety 
studies of TH3, 4 were published in the late 1990’s and the positive results  of the first efficacy 
trials in [ZIP_CODE], 6 moved this promising therapy into mainstream c linical practice. In a meta-
analysis of 8 published clinical trials, TH was  associated with a 25% decrease in the aggregated 
outcome of all-c ause mortality and sev ere neurological abnormality and, as such, has become 
the standard of care for these critically ill infants7. 
Maine Medical Center (MMC), a tertiary c are center w ith the only Neonatal Intensiv e 
Care unit (NICU) in the southern part of the state, employ ed TH for the first time in 2008. 
Eastern Maine Medical Center (EMMC) 
is the only  tertiary care center in the 
northern part of the state and began 
using TH in 2009. In 2012, a Neonatal 
Neurology Program was started at MMC 
and this program w as extended to 
EMMC through a unique and 
unprecedented collaboration in 2013. At 
both institutions, the number of infants 
treated with TH gradually increased with 
improved recognition of the mild to 
moderate forms of NE (Figure 1). While educational outreach efforts have successfully 
increased awareness of the symptoms of NE at both tertiary care centers in the s tate, infants 
who may benefit from TH are still not always recognized in a timely  fashion. Missed

 opportunities for TH can occur when an infant’s clinical presentation is less severe compared to 
those included in the original randomized controlled trials.  
While TH must be initiated within the first [ADDRESS_1119884] demonstrated lack of neuronal rescue if TH is initiated late (8.5 hours after 
ischemic insult)[ADDRESS_1119885] clinical trials of TH, the relative risk of death or 
severe abnormal neurological outcome was decreased in those for whom TH was started before 4 hours of life
14. This combination of animal and human data suggests that mechanisms to 
improve the rapid initiation of TH, such as through a teleconsult, may lead to improved 
outcomes for infants with NE. In the proposed study, we hypothesize that use of telemedicine 
consults between a tertiary care center  and a community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809886], 
management, and short -term outcomes of infants with NE by [CONTACT_809897].  
 
 Overview of the Study Design:  
We propose to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_809887] a Maine Neonatal 
Encephalopathy Teleconsult ( Maine NET) compared 1:2 to with matched historical controls  from 
the MMC database. We will also qualitatively assess provider experience of Maine NET 
(Appendix C)  via zoom interviews  and the parent perception of the process of having a 
telemedicine consult and participating in research in the setting of a critically ill newborn  
(Appendix D) .  
 
Study Goals : 
The goals of this study are to:  
1. Utilize telehealth for Neonatal Encephalopathy consults in community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809888]  03.29.2023  
 
Page 3 of 7 
 2. Capture parent experience of telemedicine consult and remote consent process  
3. Capture delivery  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489273]’  (from community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809889])  
experience of utilizing telemedicine for neonatal neurological exams to assist in decision 
making for therapeutic hypothermia  
4. Identify themes from parent and clinician experiences to identify areas of improvement 
for future consultations  
5. Publish research findings  
6. Utilize data to improve future telehealth consultations  
 
Human Subjects:  
Recruitment sites:  Multiple c ommunity hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809890] l centers have provided letters indicating a strong desire 
for participation. Se e site list for recruiting community h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
Inclusion criteria :  Infants in need of Maine NET will be identified by [CONTACT_941] “Time is Brain” poster 
(see Appendix A ) that was created and distributed across the state to all newborn nurseries at 
community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64572] 2016. This poster is in routine clinical use and is intended to assist in the 
identification of infants with symptoms of NE. Rather than having inexperienced providers at 
community sites examine inclusion criteria for TH and make a determination of eligibility, this 
poster uses a color scheme in which the green designation denotes characteristics of low -risk 
infants who are not in need of consultation, the yellow designation denotes characteristics of 
moderate risk infants who should have consultation and who may need transfer, and the red designation denotes characteristics of high risk infants who are critically ill and will benefit from immediate consultation and transfer to a tertiary care center . Infants included in this study will 
be born at a community  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , will be in either the yellow or red category on the “Time is 
Brain” poster, will be younger than 6 hours of age at the time of the consultation. Infants in the 
historical control group will be selected from the MMC database and matched according to gender, gestational age, severity of presenting encephalopathy (mild, moderate or severe) and community site at which the infant was born. Matching will occur after the [ADDRESS_1119886] a time of TH initiation recorded in the MMC 
Therapeutic Hypothermia database.  Any parent of any neonate, whether treated with 
hypothermia or not, will be eligible to participate in an interview about their telemedicine and 
research  experience.

 Exclusion criteria : Infants older than 6 hours at the time Maine NET is requested and infants for 
whom TH is not an appropriate therapy (e.g. due to premature birth or moribund status) will be 
excluded.  
Number of subjects:  We intend to recruit a total of [ADDRESS_1119887] 4 years and, by [CONTACT_809898], it is likely that the targeted goal of 125 study subjects is 
achievable (Table 1). We have increased the number from [ADDRESS_1119888] possible.  We will recruit no 
more than 30 parents for the interviews.  
Power calculation:  With new funding from the COBRE grant, this study has expanded to recruit 
[ADDRESS_1119889] been treated with hypothermia. 30 subjects in each 
group would yield 95% power to detect a 1hour difference in time to initiate TH.  
Informed consent:  Prior to the onset of any research related activities, informed consent for the 
main study will be obtained from one of the infant’s parents through the telehealth interface.  A 
paper copy of the informed consent document (ICF) will be provided to the parent and  will be 
described in full detail by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Craig who will answer  all the parent’s questions thoroughly.  The 
parent will then sign and date and time the ICF document if they wish to have their infant 
participate.  Parents will be asked to initial the informed consent document if they wish to be 
contact[CONTACT_809899]. The physician at the 
participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809891], date and time  the ICF on 
the witness line. [CONTACT_348728] will then sign a separate copy of the ICF and date and time it as well.  
The consent form that the parent signed will be transported with the baby [CONTACT_809900][INVESTIGATOR_809892]. Craig and then uploaded into the infant’s electronic medical record.  
 If a parent chooses not to participate,  [CONTACT_348728] will thank the family for considering  and the 
standard of care consult will occur without employing telemedicine. The current standard of care 
for infants born in community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809893] 
(pediatrician or family medicine doctor) call the NICU at MMC t o describe the cord gas 
parameters, the Apgar scores and the level of NE in the infant as well as any other clinically 
relevant data. The Neonatologist at MMC may suggest that the community provider “passively 
cool” the newborn per our standard guideline (see Appendix B ) until the transport team arrives 
to make the actual determination of whether the infant will require TH treatment .

Compensation: Subjects will not be compensated for participation.  
 
Follow -up plan:  All subjects treated with TH will be offered routine neurological follow up at ages 
3, [ADDRESS_1119890] clinical care.  
 
Primary Outcome: Hour of life in which TH is started. The “zero hour” for  TH is recorded in the 
infant’s electronic medical record  and refers to the time at which the infant starts the TH 
protocol .   
 
Secondary Outcomes: Time at which passive cooling is initiated, temperatures recorded by 
[CONTACT_551808][INVESTIGATOR_809894], in –hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], presence of seizures on 
electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain injury  on MRI . The EEG is a routine part of the clinical 
care of an infant treated with TH and is applied for the [ADDRESS_1119891] who is unaware of 
the status of the infant regarding whether Maine NET was utilized.  
 Analysis:  Baseline differences in selected characteristics between infants assessed by [CONTACT_809901]’s exact tests  for categorical 
variables and t -tests, or their non- parametric equivalents for continuous variables. The primary 
analysis will compare differences in the time to achieve TH between infants assessed by [CONTACT_809902]  a t-test. For secondary outcomes of mortality, seizures on 
EEG, and brain injury on MRI, chi -square or Fisher’s exact test will be used for analysis of the 
frequency of these adverse outcomes.  
 Potential limitations and contingencies: Maine NET has been successfully locally 
implemented at MMC with [ADDRESS_1119892] of care which is a phone call 
for assistance with decision making.   
 Potential Risks and B enefits: When working with PHI identifiers, there is always a risk of loss 
of confidentiality. This risk will be minimized in this study through use of a HIPAA compliant 
RedCap system, limited password- protected access, and use of a Master List, which will 
remove all PHI identifiers from the data that is used for analysis. Interview recordings will be 
stored on encrypted flash drives and within the MaineHealth Protected file share folder, which 
only the study team has access to. All identifiers will be removed from interview transcription for 
analysis.  
Potential benefits for this study include determining if telemedicine can reduce time to initiation 
of TH treatment in community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809895].

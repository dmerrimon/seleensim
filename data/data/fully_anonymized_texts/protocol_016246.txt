DFN -15 effects on migraine with allodynia  
 
 
 
Objective s:  
 
1. To determine whether oral administration of DFN -15 (solution of a COX2 
inhibitor  celecoxib ) terminates migraine attacks when given to allodynic patients  
3 hours after attack onset . 
2. To determine whether mechanical  and heat allodynia that develop during acut e 
migraine attacks could be reversed by [CONTACT_262274] (> 3hrs after attack onset) treatment 
with DFN -15.  
 
Background : 
 
The majority of migraineurs seeking secondary or tertiary medical care develop 
cutaneous allodynia during the course of migraine  (Burstein et al., 2000 ), a sensory 
abnormality mediated by [CONTACT_330450][INVESTIGATOR_330440]  (Burstein et al., 1998 ).  Triptan therapy can render allodynic 
migraineurs pain -free within a narrow window of time (20 -120 min) that opens with the 
onset of pain and closes with the establishment of central sensitization  (Burstein et al., 
2004 ).  This calls for the development of drugs that can tackle ongoing central 
sensitization and render allodynic migraineurs pain -free after  the window for triptan 
therapy has expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697].    
 
Rational  for testing a DFN -15: 
 
Several years ago, we (the Burstein group) published a series of papers showing that 
parenteral  administration of ketorolac and indomethacin reverse central sensitization in 
animals and cutaneous allodynia in epi[INVESTIGATOR_330441], and proposed that t hese 
actions of the drugs are critical in terminat ing migraine attacks that are unrelieved by 
[CONTACT_330451]  (Jakubowski et al., 2005 ).  The premise behind these studies w as that 
there is an association between headache and inflammation.  This association is based on 
(1) demonstrated efficacy of NSAIDs in treating migraine  (Snow et al., 2002 ), (2) RCT 
trials showing that the efficacy of oral NSAIDs and oral triptans is equal in treating 
migraine  (Tfelt -Hansen, 2008 ), (3) epi[INVESTIGATOR_330442]’ transition from epi[INVESTIGATOR_330443] (Bigal et al., 2008 ; Scher et al., 2010 ), and (4) the American Academy of 
Family Physicians, American College of Physicians , and American Society of Internal 
Medicine guideline recommendation to use NSAIDs as a first -line treatment choice for 
all migraine attacks  (Schroeder, 2003 ). 
 
Rational  for testing DFN -15? In the concluding remarks of our papers on parentera l 
COX1/COX2 inhibitors we wrote: “ Parenteral administration of COX -1/COX -2 
inhibitors is impractical in routine migraine therapy as it required that patient travel to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. ” We then concluded the following: “ To allow patients to treat themselves at 
home, it will be useful to develop oral formulations of COX -1/COX -[ADDRESS_408415]. ”  DFN -15 is a COX -2 selec tive NSAID.  It 
is extensively expressed in cells involved in inflammation and is upregulated by [CONTACT_330452], cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters .  As such, it is used 
to trea t a variety of conditions associated with pain and inflammation.  
 
 
Study design : 
 
Overall strategy : This study will be a proof -of-concept study to determine the mechanism 
of action of DFN -15 on cutaneous allodynia and central sensitization. To achieve our 
objectives, we will determine the cutaneous pa in thresholds  (mechanical, heat ) and 
headache severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_330444] 3 different conditions: (a) while 
pain-free, (b) during migraine  predosing , (c) 2 hours after treatment with either DFN -15 
or a matching  placebo . 
 
Partici pant selection :  
COX -[ADDRESS_408416] severe cardiovascular 
and renal adverse events including, but not limited to: myocardial infarction, stroke, heart 
failure, and hypertension (Mathew et al., 2011). Therefore, the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria for this study will be designed to minimize adverse events.  
 
Individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_330445]. 
Primary inclusion criteria will be (1) age 18 -64 years old, (2) history of migraine with or 
without aura, based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (3rd 
edition) for at least 3 years, (3) two or more migraine attacks per month on average 
during the previous year, and (4) ability to communicate in English (in order to 
understand and follow instructions of testing). Exclusion criteria will include: (1) fifteen 
or more headache days per month; (2) aspi[INVESTIGATOR_330446] -induced asthma or allergy; (3) 
pregnancy  and/or lactating ; (4) history of coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897], heart attack, 
angina, stroke, serious gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease; or chronic kidney 
disease; (5) having medical conditi ons requiring use of diuretics or daily anticoagulants; 
(6) having s evere uncontrolled medical problems or medications that may influence 
measurements or impai r ability to participate in the testing (e.g. daily or frequent use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_330447] (> 8 days per month), or NSAIDs or other analgesics (>14 days per 
month); known crea tinine > 2.5 md/dl or GFR < 30, severe peripheral neuropathy, 
dementia, etc.); and (7) having been advised by a health professional not to use COX -[ADDRESS_408417] Healthcare Headache Program.   
 
Randomized controlled trial : After screening, which will be performed on a non -migraine 
day, participants will be randomized in a double -blinded fashion to receive either the 
active drug (DFN -15) or placebo  in a ratio of 4:1 .  They will be instructed to return to the 
clinic during a migraine.  At the ‘during -migraine’ visit, which will begin 3  hours after 
onset of headache, we will document headache intensity , associated symptoms , and 
mechanical and heat pain threshold (first) before treatment (at 180 min after onset of 
headache ) and (second) at a  120 min after treatment  (5 hours after headache  onset).  
Based on our prior experience studying migraine patients, we plan to screen 100 patients 
to achieve 50 participants completing the 2 study visits  as planned .  80/10 0 patients will 
be randomized to receive the active drug and 20/[ADDRESS_408418] appointment we will identify patients who are good 
candidate to participate in the study and measure their pain th resholds following an initial 
evaluation.  This appointment will allow us to train patients in how the quantitative 
sensory testing is performed.  
 
‘During -migraine” visit  – In the second appointment patients’ headache intensity , 
associated symptoms,  and m echanical  and heat pain thresholds will be tested [ADDRESS_408419]-treatment data.    Once pain thresholds are established, patients 
will be treated and their headache intensity , associated symptoms  and pain thresholds will 
be re -examined 120 minutes later.   
 
Quantitative Sensory testing (QST) : Testing will be done i n a quiet room  away from 
noise and distraction.  Patients will be able to cho ose their most comfortable po sition 
(sitting on a chair or l ying in bed) during the sensory testing.   In each testing s ession, pain 
thresholds to hot and mechanical stimulation wi ll be determined in the skin over the site 
to where the pain is referred to .  This site includes most commonly the periorbital and 
temporal regions . Heat skin stimuli will be delivered through a 30x30 mm2 thermode ( Q-
Sense 2016 , Medoc) attached to the skin  at a constant pressure and their pain thresholds 
will be determined by [CONTACT_330453] .   To determine pain thresholds, the skin 
will be allowed to adapt to a temperature of 32 C (89.5 oF) for 5 minutes and then 
warmed up at a slow rate (1 C/sec) until pain sensation is perceived, at which moment 
the subject stops the stimulus by [CONTACT_7326] a button on a patient response unit.  Heat 
stimuli will be repeated three times each  (with [ADDRESS_408420])  and the 
mean of recorded temperatures will be considered threshold.  Pain threshold to 
mechanical stimuli will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a set of 20 calibrated von Frey hairs  
(VFH, Stoelting).  Each VFH monofilament is assigned a scalar number in an ascending 
order (1 = 0.0045g , 2 = 0.023g , 3 = 0.027g , 4 = 0.07g , 5 = 0.16g , 6 = 0.4g, 7 = 0.7g, 8 = 
1.2g, 9 = 1.5g, 10 = 2.0g, 11 = 3.6g, 12 = 5.4g, 13 = 8.5g, 14 = 11.7g , 15 = 15.1g , 16 = 
28.8g , 17 = 75g, 18 = 125g , 19 = 281g ).  Because a linear relationship exists between the 
log force and the ranked number, mechanical pain thresholds are expressed as VFH 
numbers (#) rather then their forces (g).  Each monofilament will be applied to the skin 3 
times ( for 2 sec  and 2 sec in b etween each application ) and the smallest VFH number 
capable of inducing pain at two out of three trials will be considered  threshold.  Skin 
sensitivity will also be determined by [CONTACT_330454]’s perception of soft skin brushing, 
which is a dynamic mec hanical stimulus, as distinguished from the VFH, which is  a static 
mechanical stimulus.  The equipment used for quantitative sensory testing has an FDA 
approval.  It is routinely used by [CONTACT_330455], nurses, and pain specialists throughout the 
country.  I t imposes no risk or discomfort, and since it is controlled by [CONTACT_102], stimuli 
can be stopped at any time.  Each QST will last about 10 minutes.  
 
Patient Safety:  
 Throughout the treatment and testing the patients will be m onitored (vitals, etc.) 
to ens ure their safety. If a member of the control group is in excruciating pain and their 
migraine is intolerable they will be prescribed a rescue medication. In this case the 
participant  will drop out of the study. The participants will have the option to drop  out at 
any point in the study. At the end of the testing  (5 hours after migraine onset) , if a 
participant (from either group) is still symptomatic  and in pain , they will have the 
opportunity to have a rescue medication prescribed by [CONTACT_330456]. In the case that a patient does not respond well to the study treatment 
they will be monitored for at least 1 hour before leaving the clinic.   
 
Data analysis:  
 
Primary endpoint:   There are [ADDRESS_408421] is reduction in 
headache intensity after DFN -15 treatment, and the second is reduction in skin sensitivity 
at 2 hours after DFN -15 treatment.   
For reduction in headache intensity, l evel of pain will be documented at 1 and 2 hou rs 
after treatment using a visual analogue scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain).  
Comparisons of these ordinal (repeated) measures will be performed using Friedman 
two-way analysis of variance followed by [CONTACT_330457] -pairs signed -ranks test.  
 For reduction in skin sensitivity (allodynia), pain thresholds will be determined [ADDRESS_408422] been developed in order to minimi ze 
subjective variation, and make the results as objective as possible.  These algorithms are 
incorporated into the software program that controls the thermal and mechanical sensory 
analyzer (Q -Sense 2016).  Changes in skin sensitivity will be determined b y comparing 
corresponding pain thresholds obtained in the pain -free session (baseline) to pain 
thresholds obtained during migraine, first before (untreated migraine) and then after 
(treated migraine) treatment with DFN -15 or placebo .  In healthy subjects, pain 
thresholds for heat and mechanical skin stimuli range between 42 -47 oC (107.3 -116 oF) 
(Lindblom, 1994 ), and 75 -281 g (Strigo et al., 2000 ), respectively. Using a more stringent 
criteria, we will consider a patient to be allodynic if her/his pain threshold is below 41 oC 
(105.8 oF) for heat, and below 30 g for skin indentation with the calibrated von Frey hairs.  
Meeting the criterion for any one of modality will be sufficient to determine that the 
patient is allodynic at the ‘during untreated migraine’ testing.  For this endpoint, the 
database will consisted of pain threshold measurements in 50 patients, taken while they 
are pain -free (baseline), during untreated migraine attack (before DFN -15 or placebo  
treatment), after treatment with DFN -15 or placebo .  Only those patients who co mpleted 
all 3 testing sessions will be included in the data analysis. The resulting distributions will 
be tested for normality, and their descriptive statistics computed.  The differences 
between before  and a fter DFN -15 treatment will be computed on a pair -wise basis.  To 
increase the sensitivity of detecting changes, patients in this study will be compared to 
themselves (baseline vs. during untreated migraine vs. during treated migraine) rather 
than to control subjects because the large normative range of pain thresholds reduces the 
sensitivity of detecting allodynia in reference to the normal range.  Differences between 
pain-free vs. during untreated migraine vs. during treated migraine will be computed on a 
multiple sample pair -wise basis.  Differences in  mean pain threshold will be judged 
(significant or not significant) by [CONTACT_330458] -wise multiple sample comparison 
(Newman -Keuls, Kruskal -Wallis) tests. Alternatively, repeated measurements of pain 
thresholds (allodynia) will be analyzed using Friedman two -way analysis of variance.  
Finally, secondary analyses using the collected data may be done as a part of this study 
including, but not limited to, the duration and intensity of the headache prior to arrival at 
the clinic.  
 
The primary outcome m easure in the current study is the proportion of patients 
demonstrating a headache intensity decrease that is greater than 50% (post -treatment 
compared to pre -treatment). Secondary outcome measures are proportions of patients 
demonstrating allodynia before  and after treatment; allodynia to thermal stimuli is 
defined as a pain threshold < 41 0C, and to mechanical stimuli as pressure pain threshold 
of < [ADDRESS_408423] 
for comparison of indep endent proportions and Chi -square (x2) test to assess the 
categorical association between the group (treatment / placebo) and (i) reduction rate of 
headache intensity (below / above 50%; primary outcome measure); (ii) proportion of 
thermally allodynic part icipants (pain threshold below / above 41 0C; secondary outcome 
measure); and (iii) proportion of mechanically allodynic participants (pressure pain 
threshold below / above 30 g; secondary outcome measure).  
Power analysis was based on the Z test for compar ison of independent 
proportions. Incorporated were α of 5% (significance level), 1 -β error probability of 90% 
(power), and allocation ratio of 4:1 (treatment:placebo, respectively). Based on 
previously published data (Burstein et al., Annals of Neurology 2 004), the primary 
outcome measure is expected to be lower in the treatment group; accordingly, power 
analysis was one -tailed. The primary hypothesis was that post -intervention proportions of 
patients demonstrating a headache intensity decrease that is grea ter than 50% in the 
treatment and placebo groups would be 80% and 30%, respectively. This computation 
yielded a required number of 9 subjects in the placebo group and 36 patients in the 
treatment group (critical Z = -1.645). An additional 20% were accounte d for potential 
dropout. Thus, a total of 54 participants (11 placebo, 43 treatment) are to be enrolled in 
the entire study.

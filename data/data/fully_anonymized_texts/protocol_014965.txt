July 17, [ADDRESS_265184] -Menopausal Women with 
Advanced Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Study Design:  This is a phase II therapeutic study of adding exemestane therapy in post -menopausal women 
with advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are progressing while on treatment with 
an immune checkpoint blockade antibody (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or nivolumab) . 
 
Enrollment will use a two -stage design. Stage [ADDRESS_265185] disease re -evaluation after beginning oral exemestane, Stage 
2 will be activated. In Stage 2, an additional 19 patients will be enrolled for a total of 29 patients. If 
4 or mor e objective responses are observed in the 29 patients , exemestane  will be deemed worthy 
of further investigation in this population.  
 
Primary 
Objective:  To determine a preliminary estimate of response of daily oral exemestane for the treatment of 
previously treated, advanced non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in post -menopausal women

Secondary 
Objectives:   To determine the toxicity profile of daily exemestane in combination wit h immune checkpoint 
blockade  therapy  in this patient population . 
 To estimate the disease control rate, progression -free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) 
of exemestane in this patient population  through 1 year  from study enrollment .  
 To estimate qu ality of life  during treatment and for 1 month after  discontinuation . 
 
Correlative 
Objectives:   To conduct an exploratory biomarker correlative study of clinical outcome utilizing archived 
tumor tissue and serum collected at baseline and serially during therapy .  
 To examine biomarkers in tissue post -treatment at the time of re -biopsy, if performed .

1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to determine  a preliminary estimate of response of daily 
oral exemestane  for the treatment of previously treated, advanced non -small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC ) in post -menopausal women  receiving and progressing on 
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)  therapy . 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 To determine the toxicity profile of daily exemestane in combination with 
immune checkpoint blockade  therapy  in this patient population . 
 To estimate the disease control rate, progression -free survival  (PFS), and 
overall survival  (OS)  of exemestane for up to [ADDRESS_265188]-menopausal women  with previously  treated advanced NSCLC . 
 To estimate quality of life during study treatment and for one month following 
discontinuation of study treatment.  
 
1.3 Correlative Objectives  
 To conduct an exploratory biomarker correlative study of clinical outcome 
utilizing archival  tumor tissue and serum collected at baseline and serially 
during therapy  
 To examine biomarkers in tissue post -treatment at the time of re -biopsy, if 
performed  
 To examine serum biomarkers of the  peripheral immune response after 
aromatase inhibition  
[ADDRESS_265189] -line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer ( NSCLC) includes platinum based -doublets, such as combinations of 
cisplatin or carboplatin with either paclita xel, docetaxel, and vinorelbine or 
gemcitabine. In patients with advanced NSCLC and good performance status, 
these doublets lead to predictable response rates of approximately 30%, median 
survival of 8 -9 months and 1 -year survival of 30 -40%1. Alternatives to 
chemotherapy are also now approved for first line therapy of NSCLC based on 
molecular biomarkers. Patients whose tumors harbor genetic mutations in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), or 
ROS1 have superior response  rates, progression free survival and overall survival 
when treated with a targeted oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Moreover, patients

July 17, [ADDRESS_265190] >50% expression of programmed death ligand (PDL -1), a 
marker of immune activation within the tumor micr oenvironment, have improved 
outcomes when treated with an immune checkpoint antibody, pembrolizumab.  
FDA approved agents for the second and third line therapy of NSCLC includes 
docetaxel, pemetrexed, and erlotinib2. These include two chemotherapeutic 
agent s that are currently approved and in use for second line therapy: docetaxel 
(75 mg/m2) (response rates of 6.7% - 8.8%; Median survival of 5.7 months to 7.9 
months and 1 year survivals of about 30%); and pemetrexed (response rate of 
9.1%, median survival of  8.3 months and 1 year survival of 29.7%)3-5. In several 
randomized controlled trials, immune checkpoint antibodies, have now been 
approved in the 2nd or 3rd line setting based on improved overall survival co mpared 
to docetaxel. Thus, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab are now 
commonly used 2nd line agents for the treatment of NSCLC. The major advance 
of immune checkpoint blockade is that in patients who respond, the duration of 
response is quite long and some patients (~15%) remain in remission for several 
years after the initiation of treatment. Unfortunately, the objective response rate 
remains relatively low in the range of 20 -30%. Thus, the majority of patients will 
not respond to such therapy.  While modest improvements have been made in 
survival and quality of life in patients with advanced NSCLC there is a need to 
explore new agents  with novel mechanisms of action in this patient population. 
Moreover, novel combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220936].  
2.[ADDRESS_265191]  plays  an important  role in 
lung tumorigenesis6 Furthermore, recent data has suggested that anti -estrogen 
therapy may be an effective therapeutic strategy for advanced stage non -small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC)6,7. Several  large cohort  studies  have  implicated  the 
estrogen  receptor  pathway  in lung tumorigenesis8,[ADDRESS_265192] previously demonstrated that estrogen receptor beta (ER ) is 
expressed in the vast majority of NSCLC, including in post -menopausal 
women6,12. This is in c ontrast to the predominant expression  of ER alpha (ER ) 
protein  in breast  cancer12. Furthermore,  the aromatase  enzyme  is expressed  in 
86% of NSCLC  and high expression  of aromatase  is a poor prognostic  marker  in 
post-menopausal  women with NSCLC13. Over the last decade, increasing 
CPRC 2015LS095:  Exemestane in Post -Menopausal Women with Advanced NSCLC   
 
   
July 17, [ADDRESS_265193]  plays  an important  role in lung tumorigenesis14,15. Recent data has 
suggested that anti -estrogen therapy may be an effective therapeutic strategy for 
advanced stage non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)16-18. 
Preclinical  and early  clinical  studies  on anti-estrogen  therapy  appear  promising. 
Aromatase  inhibitors (AI) suppressed cell proliferation in vitro as well as in lung 
tumor xen ografts13. Furthermore, treatment with an AI significantly inhibited lung 
tumor formation in a carcinogen induced model of lung cancer15. In addition, we 
have previously demonstrated that significant crosstalk exists between the 
estrogen and EGFR signaling  pathways16. We have validated this preclinical 
observation in a recent phase II clinical trial, combining fulvestrant and erlotinib,  
an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which demonstrated that the combination  was 
well-tolerated  and had a  significant  clinic al benefit  rate in patients  with EGFR  
wild type tumors18. Recent data suggest that hormonal therapy can have 
significant impact upon the immune microenvironment of tumors19. Oopherectomy 
of female mice improved the survival of mice bearing lung cancer in a  syngeneic 
mouse model. Likewise, estrogen supplementation led to enhanced tumor growth. 
This effect was associated with increased myeloid derived suppressor cells 
(MDSC) in the tumor microenvironment which was reversed upon oophorectomy. 
These effects wer e tumor independent as knockout of ER on hematopoietic cells 
resulted in improved survival of tumor bearing mice and resulted in reduced 
MDSCs and enhanced CD8 and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. 
Finally, in human squamous cell NSCLC, the expre ssion of PDL -1 is highly 
correlated to ER expression providing a further link between ER signaling and 
immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment  (unpublished data) .  
Estrogen Receptors are also expressed by T cells20,21, myeloid -derived suppressor 
cells (MDSC)22 and macrophages23. E2 promotes human epi[INVESTIGATOR_220937] (HERs) ligand release, including amphiregulin (AREG), and AREG has 
been shown to suppress T cell response and promote T regulatory function24. Both 
macrophages and T cell s express EGFR receptor that promotes their tumorigenic 
phenotypes (5). A recent report suggests that E2 increases the mobilization of pro -
tumor immune cells and promotes an immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (TME)25. 
 
CPRC 2015LS095:  Exemestane in Post -Menopausal Women with Advanced NSCLC   
 
   
July 17, 2020  Page 12 of 55 Confidential  Our recent unpublished data also show that E2 at 10nM induces PD -L1 expression 
in two NSCLC cell lines (201T, A549) ( Figure 1 ), suggesting that an aromatase 
inhibitor could reverse immunosuppression mediated through PD -L1.  
These observations suggest that E2 can suppress T cells cytotoxic activity against 
lung cancer cells, stimulate M2 macrophages, increase activity of myeloid derived 
suppressor cells, and enhance activity of Treg cells (shown in Figure 2), as well as 
stimulate NSCLC cells directly. Since exe mestane will reduce E2 levels in the 
tumor microenvironment, immunosuppression should be reversed, and adding 
exemestane to an immune checkpoint blocker should be beneficial.  
Given these promising preclinical and clinical studies, it is imperative to evalu ate 
anti- estrogen therapy in NSCLC.   
Based on work in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors are very effective in blocking 
estrogen -driven pro -cancer effects by [CONTACT_220958], 
and have shown superior efficacy against breast can cer progression than agents 
such as tamoxifen or fulvestrant that block the estrogen receptor26. Aromatase

ethanol as a vehicle for 24 hr. 30 μg of each sample were analyzed by [CONTACT_220959] -PD-L1 antibody and rabbit β-actin antibody.  
 
Figure  2: Summary of the expected immunosuppressive effects of E2. E2 will enhance the activation of 
MDSC leading to more suppression of T cell cytotoxic activity. E2 will also promote the conversion of T 
cell to Treg state. Macrophages w ill be polarized toward M2 phenotype with less phagocytic activity. 
Lastly, E2 will enhance NSCLC proliferation and immune -escape through upregulation of PD -L1 
expression.

women for up to [ADDRESS_265194] -menopausal population 
with advanced lung cancer that has failed prior chemotherapy.   
2.3 Exemestane  
Exemestane ( AROMASIN ®) is an aromatase inhibitor initially approved by [CONTACT_220960] [ADDRESS_265195] approved dosing is 25 
mg PO per day continuously.  
Safety and efficacy were evaluated in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), a 
double -blind , multicenter, international clinical trial in postmenopausal women with 
early stage breast cancer who had received two to three years of adjuvant 
tamoxifen. Four thousand seven hundred and twenty four patients in the intention -
to-treat population were  randomized  to either continue tamoxifen (20 -30 mg/day) 
or switch to exemestane (25 mg/day) to complete a total of five years of adjuvant 
hormonal therapy.  In the hormone receptor -positive subpopulation rep resenting 
about 85 percent of the trial patients, disease free survival ( DFS) was significantly 
improved (HR=0.65, 95 percent CI: 0.53 -0.79, p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) in the exemestane arm 
compared to the tamoxifen arm.    
Adverse Reactions:  Early breast cancer: Adverse events occurring in ≥10% of 
patients in any  treatment group (AROMASIN vs. tamoxifen) were hot flushes 
(21.2%  vs. 19.9%), fatigue (16.1% vs. 14.7%), arthralgia (14.6% vs. 8.6%),  
headache (13.1% vs. 10.8%), insomnia (12.4% vs. 8.9%), and increased  sweating 
(11.8% vs. 10.4%). Discontinuation rates due to AEs were  similar between 
AROMASIN and tamoxifen (6.3% vs. 5.1%).  Incidences of cardiac ischemic events 
(myocardial infarction, angina,  and myocardial ischemia) were AROMASIN 1.6%, 
tamoxifen 0.6%.  Incidence of cardiac failure: AROMASIN 0.4%, tamoxifen 0.3% . 
Advanced breast cancer: Most common adverse events were mild to  moderate 
and included hot flushes (13% vs. 5%), nausea (9% vs. 5%),  fatigue (8% vs. 10%), 
increased sweating (4% vs. 8%), and increased  appetite  (3% vs. 6%) for 
AROMASIN and megestrol acetate,  respectively .

These are all based on randomized controlled trials showing an improved 
progression free survival and overall survival comparing immune checkpoint 
blockade to docetaxel chemotherapy29. Across all of the trials, the objective 
response rate to immune checkpoint blockade is approximately 20 -30% in 
unselected patients. In each of these trials the response rate was improved in 
patients whose tumors expressed a high level of PDL -1 on the cell surface. In  
previously untreated patients with PDL -1 expression on >50% of tumor cells, the 
response rate to pembrolizumab was improved to 55% and PFS and OS were 
improved compared to standard first -line chemotherapy in the Keynote -[ADDRESS_265198] been made in survival and quality of life in

explore new agents and combinations with novel mechanisms of action in an effort

If a patient is enrolled in  the study and is later found not able to begin exemestane, 
for whatever reason, the patient will be removed from study and treated at the 
physician’s discretion. The PCRC  or designee will update OnCore of the patient’s

6.1 Exemestane Dosing Plan  
Exemestane is self-administered  as a single, 25 mg tablet by [CONTACT_97621] a 
meal  once daily  at approximately the same time each day .  If the dose is missed 
by [CONTACT_726] 8 hours, the patient  will skip that dose and take the next scheduled 
dose at the usual time.   
 
Exemestane will continue once daily until disease progression, unacceptable side 
effects , patient refusal/non -compliance , or the treating physician feels 
discontinuing therapy is in the best interest of the patient.

During the first treatment cycle only, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_426] a membe r of 
the research staff 8 to 12 days after dosing was started to inquire “how things are 
going” and to see if she has any questions or concerns.  
For the purpose of this study each 3 week (21 day) dosing period will be considered 
a treatment course. A disea se re -assessment will be done after every [ADDRESS_265214] cancer  as

In general, exemestane is well tolerated at this dose when given long term to post -
menopausal women with breast cance r. It is thought that adding exemestane to 
ongoing immune checkpoint blockade the risks profile for neither drug will be 
different.   
 
Rare, but potentially serious side effects  
Bone loss.  Exemestane lowers the level of estrogen in the body and may reduce 
bone mineral density (BMD) over tim e, possibly increasing the risk of bone 
fracture. A DEXA scan will be done at baseline, if none performed in the previous

Use of estrogens (such as hormone replacement therapy or HRT) and 
phytoestrogen supplements (such as black cohosh) to relieve the menopausal like 
side effects are prohibited during exemestane treatment.  
 
Only post -menopausal women are enrolled in this study as taking exemestane 
during pregnancy is known to cause birth defects and/or miscarriages.  
Refer to the prescribing information for additional details.  
We do not expect any difference in the toxicity pr ofile of exemestane  when it is 
added to an ongoing  treatment with anti -PD1 or anti -PDL1 antibody treatment . 
There are ongoing clinical trials in breast cancer using the combination of hormone 
therapy and an immune checkpoint blockade.

If the ICB therapy is delayed, e xemestane therapy should continue  as medically 
appropriate.   
Exemestane may be continued at the discretion of the treating investigator if the 
ICB therapy is permanently discontinued.  
6.3 Supportive Care  and Prohibited Medications  
Commercially available palliative and supportive care for disease -related  
symptoms should be offered to all treated patients.   
Patients with pre -existing osteoporosis should be on treatment with 
calcium/vitamin D and/or bisphosphonates.   
Patients must be instructed not to take any additional medications (including  over-
the-counter products) during the study with out prior consultation with her study 
doctor . Use of estrogens (i.e. hormone replacement therapy) and phytoestrogen 
supplements (i.e. black cohosh ) are prohibited during exemestane treatment.  
Concomitant use  of strong CYP 3A4 inducers decreases exemestane exposure  
therefore their use will be prohibited. For a list of CYP34A inducers refer to 
Appendix I II. 
No chemotherapy, hormonal anticancer therapy, or experimental anticancer 
medications other than those stu dy related will be permitted while the patient is on 
study. Any disease progression requiring other forms of specific anti -tumor therapy 
will be cause for discontinuation from the study.  
6.4 Duration of Study Treatment

7 Exemestane  Drug Information  
Names:  exemestane, AROMASIN®, 6 -Methyleneandrosta -1,4-diene -3,17-dione  
Category:  Aromatase Inhibitors  
Indications :  1) For the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal 
women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy  and 2) adjuvant 
treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen -receptor  positive early breast 
cancer who have received two to three years of  tamoxifen and are switched to 
exemestane  for completion of a total of  five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal 
therapy .  
Pharm acology :  Arom atase is an enzyme that converts hormones to estrogen in the 
body's adrenal glands. The aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that reduce estrogen 
levels by [CONTACT_220963]. The selective AIs 
(SAIs) selectively reduce levels of estrogen without interfering with levels of other 
CPRC 2015LS095:  Exemestane in Post -Menopausal Women with Advanced NSCLC   
 
   
July 17, 2020  Page 23 of 55 Confidential  steroid hormones that are produced by [CONTACT_220964]. Drugs in this class include 
anastrozole (Arimidex ™), letrozole (Femara ™) and exemestane (Aromasin ™)  
Availability:   For the purposes of t his study a commercial formulation of Aromasin  will 
be provided by [CONTACT_220965], [COMPANY_007] .  The study specific drug reorder form is 
attached in OnCore under this study.  It is recommended that a drug inventory 
sufficient to treat study subjects for approximately four (4) weeks be maintained while 
waiting for additional ordered supplies.  
Drug Accountability:  The study drug supply will be stored and dispensed by [CONTACT_220966], Fairview Investigational Drug Services (IDS) 
Pharmacy. IDS will be responsible for drug accountability through the study.  IDS will 
provide study drug to participating MNCCTN sites.  
Dosage and Administration Schedule:  One 2 5 mg tablet once daily after a meal  
Dose Forms and Strengths:  Aromasin Tablets are round, biconvex, and off -white 
to slightly gray. Each tablet contains 25 mg of  exemestane. The tablets are printed on 
one side with the number “7663” in black.  
Storage and Stability:  Store at 25°C (77ºF); excursions permitted to 15° –30°C (59° –
86°F) . 
Drug Return/Destruction:  At the end of the study and after final reconciliation, IDS 
will destroy any remaining drug according to their current SOP.  
 
Expected Side Effects:  refer to Section 6.1.1. 
 
FDA Pregnancy Category X  
 
Contraindications  and Counseling :  
Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or to any of the  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_220939], including pregnant women  
 
Patients should be informed that they should not take estrogen -containing agents 
while they are taking exemestane  as these could interfere with its pharmacologic 
action.  
 
Patients should be informed that AROMASIN lowers the level of estrogen in the body. 
This may lead to  reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) over time.  The lower the 
BMD, the greater the risk of osteoporosis and  fracture.

9.2 Research Relate d Tests and Procedures  
The PROMIS -29 Profile ( Appendix V I) will be completed before starting 
exemestane, every 3 weeks while taking the study drug, and at the end of 
treatment visit.   
Correlative studies will examine biomarkers in the Estrogen Receptor (E R) 
pathway including circulating levels of hormones and products of ER response 
genes . DNA will be extracted from blood collected at baseline, during treatment, 
and at progression and sent for sequencing using the Guardant360 assay to 
determine if mutation s are present that are correlated with resistance to an 
aromatase inhibitor. Three hundred sixty ( 360) common mutations will be analyzed 
that have been used to monitor breast cancer patents on aromatase inhibitor 
therapy.  Additionally, since cigarette smok ing is associated with increased ER 
expression29, we will measure serum cotinine in patients at baseline as a measure 
of recent tobacco smoke exposure.  
Tumor tissue will be analyzed ER β receptor expression and aromatase at baseline 
using immunohistochemist ry (IHC). Additionally, we will analyze PDL -[ADDRESS_265229] -treatment 
tissue obtained.   
Finally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be obtained at baseline 
and prior to Cycle 2 and 3 to evaluate the peripheral immunophenotype prior to 
and after initiation of exemestane.

Initial disease response will be assessed 6 weeks after the start of exemestane 
using the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Refer to Appendix II. 
12.[ADDRESS_265239] dose, or the start of a new anti -cancer treatment, whichever is earlier. 
Toxicity severity will be graded using t he Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version [ADDRESS_265240] 1.1 
(Appendix II).  
Quality of life will b e assessed by [CONTACT_220975] -[ADDRESS_265241] a n objective  response 
after completion of stage 1, an additional 19 patients will be enrolled in stage 2 for 
a total of 29 patients. If the total number of patients responding is 4 or greater, the  
treatment will be considered worthy of further investigation.  
  
CPRC 2015LS095:  Exemestane in Post -Menopausal Women with Advanced NSCLC   
 
   
July 17, 2020  Page 34 of 55 Confidential  13.2 Sample Size  
Sample size is based on testing our primary endpoint using Simon’s optimal two 
stage design with a type I error of 5% and power of 80% .30 Our null hypothesis is 
that the response is ≤5% (as all will be progressing on anti -PD1 therapy) and our 
alternative hypothesis is that response is ≥ 20%. If the treatment is truly not 
effective, there is a 5% chance of concluding that the drug is effective while if the 
treatm ent is truly effective, there is a 20% chance of concluding that it is not 
effective.  Up to 10 patients will be enrolled per year . 
13.3 Statistical Analysis  
The primary endpoint of response will be estimated with a simple proportion and a 
95% confidence interva l. The secondary endpoints of survival and progression -
free survival will be estimated with Kaplan -Meier curves. Disease control  will be 
assessed with descriptive statistics  and plots such as medians, ranges , 
interquartile ranges  and box -plots. Toxicities will be assessed with descriptive 
statistics and plots such as simple proportions and bar  graphs. Quality of life 
scores, as measured by [CONTACT_93218], will be evaluated descriptively at baseline, every 
[ADDRESS_265242] or 
Fisher’s exact test depending  on sample size. Evaluation of biomarkers is primarily 
descriptive and will be used in  the planning of future studies both for selection 
criteria and validation. Six b iomarkers from blood will similarly  be assessed;  
however, these measurements will be assessed at individual post -treatment time -
points as well. If warranted, repeated measures  analyses may be used to look at 
measurements over time.  There is currently no plan to demonstrate that the 
biomarkers could be used as surrogate endpoints  but rather if associations exist 
for future evaluation . 
13.4 Monitoring Guidelines  
Monitoring guidelines are developed to monitor excess toxicity using a continuous 
monitoring strategy based on an adaptation of Pocock stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239].31 In 
the event that a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16510], enrollment will be halted in the affected 
Treatment Plan. The Treatment Plan will be reviewed by [CONTACT_220976] (PI, 
co-I’s and Statistician) and a decision made about the future of the study. The IRB 
would be notified in the appropriate manner (expedited or at time of annual 
continuing review).

guideline (version 1.1)  
Definitions:  
Evaluable for Response:  Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have 
received at leas t one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions 
stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progre ssion prior to the end of cycle 1 will 
also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target dise ase.  
The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the 
lesions.  
Disease Parameters:  
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_265257] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_265258] 
scan, or >[ADDRESS_265259] be recorded in millimeters  
(or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered 
measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions  under which such 
lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must 
be >[ADDRESS_265260] scan (CT scan slice thickness rec ommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph  nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -
measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple  cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in 
the same patient, these are preferred for s election as target lesions.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on oc casion, the largest 
CPRC 2015LS095:  Exemestane in Post -Menopausal Women with Advanced NSCLC   
 
   
July 17, [ADDRESS_265261] lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal le sions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is 
added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further cha racterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and 
above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare 
cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
Methods for Evaluation of Measur able Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
[CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin 
nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_265262] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable 
in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the a vailability of MRI is variable globally.  
As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should 
be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality 
used at  follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts,  and diseases.  Ideally, 
the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as 
closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.

(with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements 
and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, howeve r, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method 
of measurement .  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review 
at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same 
technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the nex t.  If new lesions are 
identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is 
concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utiliza tion of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete respo nse 
(CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 
1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gyn ecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed 
CA-[ADDRESS_265264] -
line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to d ifferentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and 
progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable 
to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new' disease).  New le sions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified 
according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a 
new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, addit ional follow -up CT  scans are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will 
be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up

July 17, [ADDRESS_265265] be acknowledged that 
both approaches may lead to false pos itive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice 
that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Response Cr iteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the bas eline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
Stable Dise ase (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete clinic al response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  
of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion status.  
It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions o nly is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progression status should be confirmed at a 
later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).

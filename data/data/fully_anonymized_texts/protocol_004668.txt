PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
RATIONALE FOR AMENDMENT  
This protocol amendment  is required due to a change in the calibration of the device employed in 
methemoglobin readings and increases the upper limit of methemoglobin for study enrollment  
from >  2.0% to >  3.0% and changes the criteri on for subject discontinuation in the study due to 
elevated methemoglobin from >  3.0% to >  5.0%.  The change in methemoglobin levels 
permissible for study enrollment and continuation reflect this change in the calibration of the 
device. The amendment also increases the screening period from [ADDRESS_397300] current section numbers.

tolerability , and safety of two concentrations of SB204 Gel and Vehicle 
Gel once or twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to 
severe acne vulgaris  on the face . 
Treatment Regimens  Eligible subjects at the Baseline visit will be randomized 2:2:2:1:1 to 
SB204 4% Gel BID, SB204 4% Gel QD, SB204 2% Gel BID, Vehicle 
Gel BID, or Vehicle Gel QD and treated for 12 weeks (84 days).  
Formulation  Investigational Drug:   SB204 4% Gel  
Investigational Drug:   SB204 2% Gel  
Comparator Drug : Vehicle Gel  
Study Period  Subjects will be dosed in the study for up to 12 weeks.  
Study Design  This is a multi -center, evaluator -blinded, randomized, vehicle -
controlled, parallel -group  study to be conducted in approximately 200 
subjects with acne vulgaris. 
Subjects who satisfy the entry criteria will be randomized to SB204 4% 
Gel BID, SB204 4% Gel QD, SB204 2% Gel BID, Vehicle Gel BID , or 
Vehicle Gel QD in a 2:2:2:1:[ADDRESS_397312] from two  chambers (NVN1000 Gel and a 
hydrogel or Vehicle Gel and a hydrogel) which will be mixed together in the palm for 5- [ADDRESS_397313] and applied to the entire 
face once or twice daily after washing.  Efficacy assessments will include investigator global assessments (IGA) and inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts.  Tolerability and safety assessments 
include cut aneous tolerability evaluation (erythema, scaling, dryness, 
pruritus, burning/stinging), adverse event collection, physical exams, blood pressure and pulse rate, laboratory assessments including chemistry, hematology, methemoglobin, PT/ PTT measurements, and 
urine pregnancy tests (UPTs).  Subjects will return for post -baseline 
evaluation at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

Sample Size  Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 
2:2:2:1:1 ratio (~50 in each  active arm and 25 in each vehicle arm).    
Efficacy Evaluation  The same blinded evaluator will perform Investigator Global 
Assessments and lesion counting at Screening, Baseline , and Weeks 2, 
4, 8, and 12.  In the event that this is not possible due to unforeseen circumstances, a different blinded evaluator  will evaluate the s ubject.  
However, the same evaluator should evaluate subjects at the Baseline and Week 12 evaluations. 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)  
The IGA score will be determined based on the Investigator evaluation of the overall signs and symptoms of acne vulg aris.  IGA evaluations  
will be performed prior to the lesion counts, approximately [ADDRESS_397322], and scored on a scale of 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) .  
Lesion Counts  
At Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, the Investigator will count the total number of non- inflammatory and inflammatory lesions 
on the subject’s face including the forehead, right and left cheeks, chin and nose.  Non- inflammatory lesion count will include the number of 
open and closed comedones , which will be recorded separately .

Inflammatory lesion count will include the number of papules and 
pustules, which will be recorded separately .  The number of nodul es 
and cysts  will be reported separately and included  with the 
inflammatory lesion counts.    
Tolerability 
Evaluation Subjects will be assessed at each visit from Baseline through Week 12 
for cutaneous tolerability.  Tolerability will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3= severe for erythema, 
scaling, dryness, pruritus, and burning/stinging.  
Safety Evaluation  Adverse events will be assessed and collected at each evaluation 
beginning at Screening.  A brief physical exam will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12/Early Termination (ET).  Blood 
pressure and pulse will be measured at Screening, Baseline, and each visit through Week 12/ET.  Any clinically significant changes noted during the physical exam as well as from the change in vital sign measurements or saf ety laboratory assessments will be recorded as 
adverse events.  Methemoglobin will be measured with a pulse co-oximeter and recorded at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2 and 12/ET.  Chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT will be assessed at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12.  Urine pregnancy tests in women of child-
bearing potential will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/ET. 
Additional Evaluations  Photographs of the face will be taken at Baseline and Week 12/ET.

Endpoints  Primary Efficacy Endpoints The co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  
a.  The absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline 
to Week 12;  
b.  The absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion count from 
Baseline to Week 12;  
c.  The proportion of success according to the dichotomized IGA.  
A subject will be considered a success if the IGA at Week [ADDRESS_397325] 2 grades less than Baseline.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  The secondary endpoints include t he 
following:  
a.  The percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline 
to Week 12;  
b.  The percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from 
Baseline to Week 12;  
c. The median time to improvement.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated.  Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed 
tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of ≤ 0.05 unless stated 
otherwise. Inferential testing will compare eac h active treatment group 
to the combined Vehicle treatment group.  Comparisons will not be 
performed between active treatments.  Efficacy analyses will be 
performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -protocol (PP) 
populations with the ITT population c onsidered as primary.  Safety 
analyses will be performed using the safety population. For the dichotomized IGA, subjects will be considered a success if their IGA score is clear or almost clear and at least two grade s less than 
Baseline. For those subjects  for whom no Week [ADDRESS_397326] (LOCF) in order to provide a value for efficacy parameters that are missing, primarily due to missed visits.   Additionally, a sensitivity analysis to estimate missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the method of

The development program for NVN1000 Gel  includes over 25 non- clinical studies to assess 
safety following topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407].  Studies performed to date with NVN1000 demonstrated  the 
safety of the inert carrier silica particles and the lack of systemic silica particle bioavailability 
when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].  Following daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_176244]1000 Gel  to rats (at doses 
of 6, 12, and 20%) for five days or to miniature pig s (at doses of 6, 12, and 20%) for 28 days 
(10% TBSA), systemic exposure (blood levels) of nitrate and silicon were not statistically different from background levels.  The in -life portion of a 13- week  dermal toxicity study in mini-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_321926];  no significant findings have been noted to date.   In a [ADDRESS_397342] led to no appreciable 
systemic bioavailability (<2%) of NVN1000 or related compounds following repeated topi[INVESTIGATOR_321927] a marker for nitric oxide exposure and silicon as a marker 
for the polysiloxane backbone of NVN1000.  S ilicon and nitrate were detected in blood only 
sporadically and at the same frequency and levels found in pre -dose blood samples.  Co-
administration of NVN1000 Gel with hydrogel did not impact the pharmacokinetics.  
NVN1000 Gel demonstrated mutagenicity in an Ames assay, but was  not mutagenic in two in 
vivo genotoxicity tests in two tissue types : bone marrow via IP administration and skin via 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086].

vehicle.  Asymptomatic , transient erythema has been observed in some subjects treated with 
higher concentrations of NVN1000. There have been no clinically significant changes in 
laboratory results including methemoglobin, or changes in physical examinations.  A cross -over 
pharm acokinetic (PK) study was conducted in 18 subjects with moderate to severe acne. Subjects 
received nine applications of SB204 8% Gel or Vehicle Gel to the face, chest, upper back, and 
shoulders (~17% TBSA) over five days, had a nine day washout, then cross ed over to the other 
treatment for nine applications over five days.  PK analysis of samples for nitrate and silicon is 
pending.  One subject withdrew during the second dosing period due to contact [CONTACT_8748].  In a

1.5 SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS  
The pathogenesis of a cne vulgaris includes several mechanisms which are potential targets for  
nitric oxide.  Nitric oxide has been demonstrated in vitro to decrease sebum production, decrease 
P. acnes , alter keratinocyte differentiation , and inhibit inflammasome activation .  In a recently 
completed Phase 2 study, SB204 4% Gel administered twice daily in subjects with acne 
decreased inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts at the end of treatment.  In the 
studies conducted to date, the AE profile was similar between subj ects treated with NVN1000 
Gel, SB204 Gel, and subjects treated with Vehicle Gel.  NVN1000 Gel at 2%, 4%, and 8% 
concentrations was well tolerated and was not associated with a safety or tolerability signal.  
Nitric oxide released from NVN1000 is anticipated  to be pharmacologically active in the skin.  
Any nitric oxide absorbed through the skin would be extremely short -lived (milliseconds) with 
rapid auto- oxidation to nitrite and nitrate.  Systemic bioavailability of NVN1000 or related 
compounds following repeated topi[INVESTIGATOR_176244]1000 Gel was  < 2% in non- clinical 
pharmacokinetic studies  conducted to date  both with and without hydrogel .   
Dermal toxicology studies have demonstrated minimal evidence of toxicity in a 28 day miniature 
pig study dosed with 20% NVN1000 Gel across 10% TBSA, low dermal irritation in rabbits, and 
no dermal sensitization in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].  A 13-week  dermal toxicology stud y in mini- pi[INVESTIGATOR_321931]1000 2%, 4%, and 8% Gel (10% TBSA) has completed the in -life period with no 
signific ant observed effects; histopathology and toxicokinetics data will be available prior to 
enrollment in the current study.  Local application site events in a 1 3 week dermal toxicology 
study in rats with NVN1000 2%, 4%, and 8% Gel (10% TBSA) led to premature discontinuation 
of all dose groups in a time -dependent manner.  These local adverse effects seen in the rat study 
are species specific and monitorable.  Tolerability will be assessed during the planned study , and 
discontinuation criteria f or intolerance by [CONTACT_321950] 6.7. 
Based on the known mechanism of action of nitric oxide, theoretical risks from systemic 
exposure following t opi[INVESTIGATOR_321932]1000 Gel or SB204 Gel include hypotension 
and headache.  Methemoglobinemia has been reported in patients trea ted with inhaled nitric 
oxide .  Methemoglobin will be monitored during the study and treatment stopped in any subject 
with a measured methemoglobin > 5.0%.  
Inadvertent administration to the eyes may result in ocular irritation and should be avoided.  Should the product be accidently instilled in the eye(s), prompt flushing with copi[INVESTIGATOR_321933] r ecommended.   
A transient (approximately 5 -10 minutes), asymptomatic erythema has been observed in some 
subjects shortly after application of NVN1000 Gel or SB204 Gel which is a physiologic response

(vasodilation) to local nitric oxide release.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_321934] -site reactions including erythema, peeling, desquamation, or burning/stinging .  These 
local application -site reactions may occur due to the active agent (NVN1000) or the vehicle.  
Local application -site events including erosions and contact [CONTACT_321951] [ADDRESS_397349] and by [CONTACT_201332].  
Based on available data, Novan anticipates that the risks to subjects enrolling in this Phase 2  
study at which the maximum strength of SB204 Gel will be 4% twice daily to  approximately [ADDRESS_397350] IVES  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Novan is conducting this study  to evaluate the efficacy, cutaneous  tolerability  and safety of      
SB 204 2% Gel, SB204 4 % Gel and Vehicle Gel  administered  once or  twice daily to the face.  
Subjects will dose once  (in the evening)  or twice daily (morning and evening ) for up to 12 weeks 
(84 days)  with SB204 4% Gel, twice daily with SB204 2% Gel, or  once or twice daily with 
Vehicle Gel .  Approximately 0.9 g of gel (three (3) pump strokes) will be applied evenly over the 
face (4% TBSA) .  Based on the previous hum an safety data with SB204 Gel at up to 8% and 
Vehicle Gel  as well as the nonclinical safety data including dosing with and without hydrogel , 
this dose is  expected to be safe and well tolerated.

4.1.7 DISCONTINUATION/ WITHDRAWAL P ROCEDURES  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time.  If the subject 
withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to determine 
the reason for discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s stu dy records  and in the 
study database.  If a subject is withdrawn because  of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the 
reason for withdrawal.  In the event of early discontinuation, (i.e., prior to Week 12 /Day 84  visit)  
and whenever possible, the subject should be asked to return to the study center to complete the 
Week 12 /ET evaluations.   Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
If at any time during the study  the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interest of  the 
subject t o continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation.  The Investigator can 
discontinue a subject at any time if medically necessary.  The Investigator may discontinue a subject’s participation if the subject has failed to follow study procedure s or to keep follow -up 
appointments.  Appropriate documentation in the subject’s study record and the study database regarding the reason for discontinuation must be completed.   
All subjects who fail to return to the study center for the Week 12/ET visit will be contact[CONTACT_176272](s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or 
elected to discontinue from the study.  If a subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_34675] a minimum 
of two documented attempts ( one attempt o n two different days), a certified letter will be sent 
requesting that the subject contact [CONTACT_737].  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397372] 2014 
Reasons for an Investigator’s with drawal of a subject may include , but are not limited to , the 
following:  
• Safety (e.g., severe adverse reactions , pregnancy ); 
• Lack of efficacy  as determined by [CONTACT_737];   
• When the requirements of the protocol are not respected (e.g., significant issues with dosing 
compliance) ;  
• When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to interfere with the results of the study is reported, or required, by [CONTACT_423] (the Investigator will decide, in consultation with 
QST , whether the subject is to be withdrawn);  
• When a subject is lost to follow -up.  The Investigator will try twice to reach the subject by 
[CONTACT_94598] a certified follow -up letter before considering that the subject is 
lost-to-follow -up.  These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record  and a copy 
of the follow -up letter maintained in the Investigator's file.  
Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_397373]’s study record  and in the study database.  In no case will a  subject 
who has been assigned a study number and randomized into the study be replaced by [CONTACT_20904].  
All Week 12 /ET evaluations should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation.  All 
data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to QST and Novan.  
Study completion  or reason(s) for discontinuation as listed in the study record  will be  entered 
into the study database as follows:  
• Completed  
• Adverse Event  
• Lack of Efficacy   
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_27720]  
• Physician Decision   
• Protocol Violation  
• Lost to Follow -Up  
• Pregnancy   
• Worsening of condition 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397374] 2014 
• Other  
Novan has the right to terminate or stop the study at any time.  Shou ld this be necessary, both 
QST  and the Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are completed.

same evaluator sh ould evaluate subjects at the Baseline and Week 12 evaluations.  
4.2.1 INVESTIGATOR GLOBAL ASSESSMENT  
The Investigator’s Global Assessment Score will be a static assessment that is independent of the 
Baseline score.  The Investigator will make the assessment without referring to the Baseline 
value  and prior to performing lesion counts .  The assessment should be made approximately 
three feet from the subject.  The same investigator will perform each study assessment for each 
study subject, for consistency in evaluations.  
Subjects are eligible to participate in the study if they have a Baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate) 
or 4 (severe).  
 
The following scores will  be used to assign IGA scores:  
Grade  Description  
0 Clear: Clear skin with no inflammatory or non -inflammatory lesions . 
[ADDRESS_397376] clear: F ew non- inflammatory lesions with  no more than rare papules  
(papules may be resolving and hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_321937], though not pi [INVESTIGATOR_8745]-red). 
2 Mild: S ome non- inflammatory lesions with no more than a few inflammatory 
lesions . 
3 Moderate:  Up to many non- inflammatory lesions and may have some inflammatory 
lesions, but no more than one nodular lesion . 
4 Severe:  Up to many non- inflammatory and inflammatory lesions , including nodular 
lesions  
 
4.2.2 LESION COUNTS  
The facial area lesion counts will be taken from the forehead, right and left cheeks, chin and 
nose.  The lesion count groups will be inflammatory and non- inflammatory.   Facial 
inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, nodul es and cyst s) will be counted and recorded 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397377] 2014 
separately.   Non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and 
recorded separately.   The following are definitions of each lesion type:  
Inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:  
 
Papule  –A small, superficial, circumscribed, palpable lesion elevated above the skin surface, less 
than 10 mm in diameter  
Pustule  –A superficial elevated lesion that contains yellow fluid (pus) within or beneath the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_321938] –A firm (indurated) lesion greater than [ADDRESS_397378]  - Spherical swelling that contains fluid or semisolid material 
 Non-inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:  
 Open comedones  (blackhead) –Plugged follicular units with brown/black central debris  
Closed comedones  (whitehead) –Plugged follicular units with white central debris

product  in addition to evaluating  at each study visit.  The cutaneous tolerability assessment for 
visits other than Baseline should be performed at least 30 minutes after study drug application.  
Cutaneous tolerability evaluations will include erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus  and 
burning/stinging .  Pruritus and burning/stinging will be based on the subject’s report for the 
previous 24 hours.  Cutaneous tolerability endpoints will not be reported as an  AE unless they 
reach severe and/or result in subject’s discontinuation from the study .  Cutaneous tolerability 
assessments will be performed according to the following scales: 
Erythema

4.4.2 PHYS ICAL EXAM  
A brief physical exam will be performed at Screening, Baseline (Day 0) and Week 12 /ET.  If 
clinically significant changes i n the physical examination from Baseline are noted at the Week 
12/ET visit, these will be recorded as adverse events.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_397382] 2014 
4.4.4 LABORATORY A SSESSMENTS  
Chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT will be collected at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12/ET.  
If clinically significant changes in lab results from Baseline are noted at the Week 12/ET visit, 
these will be recorded as adverse events.  Subjects wi th clinically significant anemia at Screening 
as determined by [CONTACT_321956].  
4.4.5 METHEMOGLOBIN  
Methemoglobin will be measured at Screening, Baseline, Week 2 and Week 12/ET using a 
Masimo Rainbow® SET® Rad-57™ pulse co- oximeter that analyzes methemoglobin levels.  The 
percent methemoglobin will be displayed on the pulse co- oximeter and recorded in the subject’s 
study record and in the study database.   
Subjects with methemoglobin values of > 3.0% at Screening or Baseline will not be eligible to 
participate in the study.   
Clinically significant changes in methemoglobin will be recorded as adverse events.  The adverse event term should reflect the underlying diagnosis or symptoms and not the pulse co- oximeter 
result itself.  
Clinical symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia in relation to the level of methemoglobin are listed in Table 3 .

6. EVALUATION OF ADVERS E EVENTS   
6.1 DEFINITIONS  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, dise ase, 
syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury  or 
accident)  whether or not considered drug related.  Any AE  that emerges or worsens following 
administration of the informed consent  and until the end of study  participation  will be collected .  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present prior to the start of the study and is to be reported 
as part of the subject’s medical history.  It should be reported as an AE only if the frequency, 
intensity, or the char acter of the condition worsens during the study.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397388] 2014 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) includes any event , if in the view of either the investigator or 
QST Medical Monitor results in any of the following outcomes:  
•  Death 
•  Life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_83781], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caus ed death if it were more severe.)  
•  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( i.e., the AE results in a substantial disruption 
of the subject’s abi lity to carry out normal life functions)  
•  Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] ( i.e., the AE required at 
least a 24 -hour in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]; h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, 
scheduled treatments, or routine check -ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134])  
•  Congenital anomaly/birth defect ( i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subj ect 
exposed to the molecule or i nvestigational product  before conception or during pr egnancy)  
•  Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above ( i.e., 
is a significant o r important medical event)   
  
6.1.1 ADVERSE  EVENT  SEVERITY GRADES  
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event.  
Severity will be categorized according to the following definitions: 
• Mild:  E vent may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does 
not require intervention 
• Moderate:  E vent may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance 
of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed  
• Severe:  E vent may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually needed  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397389]’s baseline condition or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved  or the subject 
is lost to follow -up. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_397390]  will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and the 
application of investigational product ; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product  and recurs with re -administration of investigational produc t. 
• Probable:   There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and the 
application of investigational product ; the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_78654]/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures . 
• Possible:  There may or  may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset 
of the AE and the application of investigational product  and a cause cannot be ruled out . 
• Unlikely:  There is no reasonable temporal association between the test material and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the Subject. 
• Unrelated:   This term should be reserved for those events that cannot be even remotely 
related to study participation.  
6.[ADDRESS_397391] signs the 
informed consent /assent  to the end of subject’s last visit.   
The Investigator will assess subjects at each scheduled study visit for the occurrence of AEs.  In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non- leading question:  
“How have you felt since your last visit?”  All AEs (serious and non- serious) reported by [CONTACT_321961]’s study record and entered into the study database.   
In addition, QST must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_321962].  Special attention should be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176254].  
6.3 IMMEDIATELY REPORTAB LE EVENT S 
Serious adverse events  (SAEs ) are considered immediately reportable event s.  Any SAE, 
whether deemed drug -related or not, must be reported to QST  by [CONTACT_321963].  The 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397392] 2014 
investigator/coordinator must complete a Serious Adverse Event (SA E) Form and email  it to 
QST  along with the subject’s Adverse Events Log and Concomitant Medications Log within 24 
hours of notification  of the event.  When appropriate, Novan  will notify the appropriate 
regulatory body  of drug related Serious Adverse Event s. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Safety Contact [CONTACT_7171]:  
Email: [EMAIL_6318]  
 
If a subject experiences a n SAE or pregnancy the  Investigator must :  
1. Report the SAE or pregnancy  by [CONTACT_321964]  (within 24  hours) after the 
Investigator becomes aware of the event . 
2. Complete a n SAE or Pregnancy Notification F orm and email  or overnight courier to QST  
within [ADDRESS_397393]’s treatment and follow -up and document as 
appropriate . 
4. Provide a more detailed report to both QST  and the I RB, if applicable , no later than seven 
days after the Investigator discovers the event  as further information becomes available, 
and when necessary update the information with follow -up information including 
outcomes .  This report should include a statement as to whether the event was or was not 
related to  the use of investigational product . 
5. The Investigator will notify the I RB of the SAE or pregnancy according to specific I RB 
requirements . 
The Investigator will c ollect information on  SAEs until the subject’s health has returned to 
baseline status, until all parameters have returned to normal, or remaining health issues have 
otherwise been explained.   
6.4 PREGNANCY  
Women of child- bearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use an effective method of birth control 
during the course of the study  and for [ADDRESS_397394] three months, IUD, 
condom with spermicide , diaphragm with spermicide, implant, Nuva Ring®, injection, 
transdermal patch or abstinence with a documented second acceptabl e method of birth control 
should the subject become sexually active .  Females taking hormonal contraceptives must have 
taken the same type for at least three months (90 days) prior to entering the study and must not 
change type during the study .  Those who have used birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_321942].  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397395] -menopausal (no m enses 
for 24 consecutive months) , surgically sterilized,  or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.   
 
Male subjects must agree to avoid fathering a child during the study and for [ADDRESS_397396] review guidelines about 
study participation  including the  topi[INVESTIGATOR_34631] : 
• Informed consent document  
• Pregnancy prevent ion information 
• Risks to unborn child(ren)  
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, all subjects  must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this clinical study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy.  The subject must sign an informed consent document stating that the above -
mentioned risk fa ctors and the consequences were discussed.  
During the study, WOCBP  should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_176279] (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle).  Male subjects should be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_3433] e investigator if their female partner becomes pregnant during the time the 
subject is enrolled through in the study through [ADDRESS_397397] 
periodically  during  the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information t hrough term,  as 
applicable.  Protocol -required procedures  for the Week 12 /ET evaluation must be performed for 
the subject.  
6.[ADDRESS_397398] scheduled study visit ( Week 12 /ET) 
must be recorded in the study database as  not recovered/not resolved.   
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397399] ( Week 12 /ET) must be 
recorded in the study database and reported to QST  according to the reporting procedures 
outlined in Sections 6.[ADDRESS_397400]’s condition.   
Any new S AEs reported by [CONTACT_321965] I RB.   
6.[ADDRESS_397401] supportive care  
should be utilized.  Methylene blue may be used t o treat subjects exhibiting methe moglobinemia  
(Boylston, 2002).  
6.[ADDRESS_397402] as defined by [CONTACT_171858] ‘severe’ (3) on 2 or more 
categories of tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, burning/stinging) shall be discontinued from the study.   
Subjects w ith > 5.0% methemoglobin at any post -baseline visit will be discontinued from the 
study.   
If a subject is determined to be pregnant prior to Week 12, the subject will be discontinued from the study but followed until term.  
7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
7.1 GENERAL C ONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -
values of ≤ 0.05 unless stated otherwise.  Inferential testing will compare each active treatment 
group to the combined Vehicle treatment group.  Comparisons will not be performed between 
active treatments.  Efficacy analyses will be performed for the intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -
protocol (PP) populations.  Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397403] (LOCF) in order to provide a value for efficacy parameters that are missing, 
primarily due to missed visits.  Additionally, a sensitivity analy sis to estimate missing efficacy 
data will be based on estimation using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
independently for each treatment group.  All hypotheses will be two -sided at an alpha level of 
0.05. 
A detailed description of the statistical methodology and data repor ting for this study will be 
provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  The SAP will be finalized before the database is 
locked and released to Novan.  Any deviations from the SAP will be justified in the clinical 
study  report.   
7.2 POPULATIONS  
7.2.1 INTENT TO TREAT (ITT) POPULATION  
The ITT population will include  all study subjects who were randomized and dispensed study 
medication.   
7.2.2 SAFETY POPULATION  
The safety population will include all  randomized subjects with documented use  of study 
medication (at least one  application)  and at least one post -baseline safety assessment .  
7.2.3 PER -PROTOCOL P OPULATION  
The PP population will include subjects who complete the Week 12 evaluation without 
noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have 
possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or  the precise evaluation 
of treatment efficacy).  The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria:  
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week [ADDRESS_397404];  
• Have missed more than one  interim study visit; 
• Have not been compliant  with the dosing regimen (i.e. s ubjects must apply 80- 120% of the 
expected applications of study medication during participation in the study);  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397405] 2014 
• Out of visit window at the Week 12 visit by ± 5 days;  
Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be add ed to the list to accommodate for 
unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study 
protocol violations. 
7.[ADDRESS_397406] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summari zed by [CONTACT_321966], PP and safety populations .  For continuous variables (e.g. age), mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum will be presented.  Categorical variables (e.g., ethnicity, race) 
will be summarized with frequency c ount and percentage by [CONTACT_1570].  
7.4 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTI CS 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the efficacy data at each evaluation for the ITT and PP 
populations.   Safety data will be summarized as indicated below for the safety population. 
Continuous data will be summarized with sample size (N), mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum.  Categorical data will be summarized with N, frequency counts, and 
percentages.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the active treatme nt groups, each vehicle treatment 
group, and the vehicle treatment groups combined.  
7.[ADDRESS_397407] 2014 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The analyses of percent change in inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12 
will use the same method as the analysis of the non- inflammatory lesions.  
 
The time to improvement will be compared between each of the active treatment groups and the 
combined Vehicle treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method.  An observation will be 
censored if improvement is not achieved by [CONTACT_10585] 12 (inclusive).  The log -rank test will be used 
to compare time to response between each active treatment group and the combined Vehicle 
treatment group.   
7.5.1 SENSITIVITY EFFICACY ANALYSES  
A sensitivity analysis will use the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple 
imputation to impute missing data for the non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and 
IGA at Week 12.  This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random.  
Additionally, the pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group.  
 
Lesion Counts  
Multiple imp utation and subsequent analysis will involve four  distinct phases with these 
principal tasks:  
1. Calculate the number of missing values to be estimated by [CONTACT_85222] (nmiss) for 12 week 
value.  
2. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and those 
needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing lesion count values in each data set will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets.  The resulting data sets for each treatment group will be combined  into one complete data 
set for each imputation. 
Syntax:    
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5xnmiss;  
   where trtpn=(1, 2,, 3, 4, or 5); 
   mcmc chain=multiple; 
   var lescnt2- lescnt5; 
run; 
3. For each complete data set, the absolute change in non- inflammatory lesion counts and 
absolute change in inflammatory lesion counts for baseline minus the 12 week value will 
be computed.  Each complete data set will be analyzed as specified for the particular analysis.  
The results from these anal yses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC 
MIANALYZE.  
IGA 
The sensitivity analysis for the IGA multiple imputation will involve four  principal tasks:  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397408] 2014 
1. Calculate the number of missing values, by [CONTACT_1570], for IGA (total from 
Weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12).  
2. Missing values will be filled in `5 x nmiss` times to generate `5 x nmiss` complete data sets, where nmiss is the maximum number of missing values of both treatment groups.  The resulting imputed datasets for each treatment group will be co mbined 
into one complete dataset by [CONTACT_321967].  
Syntax:    
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5 x nmiss;  
   where trtpn=(1, 2, 3, 4, or 5); 
   mcmc chain=multiple; 
   var IGA1 IGA2 IGA4 IGA8 IGA12; 
run;  
3. For each complete dataset, d ichotomous endpoints (defined as IGA = [ADDRESS_397409] a two -grade reduction from Baseline) will be computed.  The imputed IGA 
values will be rounded to the nearest integer value prior to computing the 
dichotomized endpoints.  Each complete data set wi ll be analyzed with a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS® PROC MIANALYZE.  
7.6 TOLERABILITY  
7.6.1 CUTANEOUS  TOLERABILITY  
Cutaneous tolerability assessments (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, burning/stinging) will 
be summarized from Baseline to Week 12 by [CONTACT_1570].  
7.7 SAFETY  
7.7.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug dose. Adverse events noted prior to the first study drug administration that worsen after Baseline will also be reported as AEs and included in the summaries.  
All information pertaining to an AE noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim term given by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], preferred term, system organ class (SOC), onset date, resolution date, severity, seriousness, a ction taken, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event 
onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first dose.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects 
reporting a TEAE, SOC, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397410] of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study due to an AE will be provided. 
7.7.2 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
Any clinically significant changes from Baseline will be documented as an AE.  
7.7.3  VITAL SIGNS  
Blood pressure and pulse will be summarized by [CONTACT_321968] 
12.  Additiona lly, change from Baseline in vital signs will be summarized at Week 2, 4, 8, and 
12. 
7.7.4 LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS  
Blood chemistry, hematology, and PT/PTT values will be reported individually at Screening, 
Baseline, and Week 12.  Laboratory test results will be s ummarized descriptively at Baseline and 
Week 12.  Additionally, shifts from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_397411].    
7.8 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R CONSIDERATIONS  
Approximatel y 200 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 2:2:2: 1:1 ratio  (~ 50 in each 
active arm and ~25 in each vehicle arm ) at approximately [ADDRESS_397412]  
Upon receipt from Novan , or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study 
supplies  in a temperature -controlled area.  The pumps should be refrigerated ( 2-8 °C).  Access to 
study supplies  should be strictly limited to the study staff.  Neither the Investigator nor any 
member  of the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies  to any person not participating 
in this study.  
If a study staff member  becomes aware that the study supplies  have  not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt), Novan  must  be contact[CONTACT_321969].  In such an event, study supplies  should not be administered to any subject until 
Novan provides further direction. 
The investigational product  will be dispensed at the discretion and by  [CONTACT_321970].  It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that accurate records of investigational p roduct  issuance and return are 
maintained.  
It is expected that the site staff will maintain refrigerator temperature log s in the investigational 
product  storage area, recording the temperature at least once each working day.  Excursions in 
temperature duri ng storage should be discussed with QST personnel.  Other supplies will be 
stored at room temperature.  
8.3 TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  AND B LINDING  
Subjects will be randomized to SB204 4% Gel, SB204 2%  Gel, or Vehicle Gel  on a 2:2:2: 1:[ADDRESS_397413]’s treatment.

This will include: 
• Dates and initials of person designated as responsible for the inventory of the 
investigational product  
• Amount received including date and lot number  
• Amount curren tly in refrigerat or, 2-8 °C storage  
• Pumps  dispensed to each subject, identified by [CONTACT_316934] a unique subject number   
• Amount transferred to another location within the study site or destroyed  — this should not 
occur without prior  notificatio n to Novan  
• Non-study disposition (e.g., wasted, broken)  
• Amount returned to Novan  or designee , if applicable  
• Amount destroyed, if applicable  
All investigational product  accountability forms and treatment logs must be retained in the 
Investigator’s permanent study file.  These records must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_99083], 
QST, or their  designees or by [CONTACT_197081].  
8.[ADDRESS_397415] s.  Only status of informed consent and assent signature, gender , 
date of birth, ethnicity, race, and reason for failure will be entered in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system  for screen failures.    
Novan and QST  require  that the study database  be verifiable with the subject’s source study 
record .  This requirement necessitates access to all original recordings and other record s for each 
subject.  The Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source 
data must be made available for all study data.  Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also 
allow access to the subject’s medical records.  Subjects will be informed of the importance of 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397416]’s source study record  for preliminary 
medical review.   
The Investigator must keep written or electronic source document s for every subject participating 
in the clinical study.  These records must include :  
• Name 
• Contact [CONTACT_3031]  
• Date of birth  
• Sex 
• Medical history  
• Concomitant diseases  
• Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/medication  
• Study visit dates  
• Performed examinations , evaluations, and clinical findings  
• Investigational product  admin istration  
• AEs, SAEs, or pregnancy  (as applicable)  
Additionally, any other documents with source data  must be included in the subject’s  source 
documents and must include the subject’s initials, study number  and the date of the evaluation.    
The data recorded during the course of the study will be documented in the study database.  
Subjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent 
process  in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements .  Subjects who deny permission 
to use and disclose protected health information will not be eligible to participate in the study.  
The Investigator will ensure that the study records forwarded to QST, Novan or their designees , 
and any other documents, contain no mention of subject names.  
Any amendments and corrections necessary will be undertaken in both the study records and the study database.   
Regulatory authorities,  Investigational Review Board s, QST or Novan may request access to all 
study records  and other study documentation for on- site audit or inspection.  The Investigator 
must guarantee direct access to these documents.  The original set of study records will be kept 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397417] been generated and are complete.   
9.2 FILE MANAGEMENT AT THE STUDY SITE  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study center file is maintained in 
accordance with Section 8  – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial  of the ICH 
Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance  and [ADDRESS_397418] : 
• Country -specific requirements ; or 
• A period of at least two years following the last approval of a marketing application 
approved by a Regulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region;  or, 
• A period of two years after Novan notifies the Investigator that the data will not be 
submitted for review by [CONTACT_34699] . 
The Investigator must not dispose of any records or essential documents relevant t o this study 
without either (1) wri tten permission from Novan, or (2) providing an opportunity for Novan to 
collect such records.  The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during 
this study.  Such documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_321971].  If the  Investigator withdraws from the study ( e.g., relocation, retirement),  all study -
related records should be  transferred to a mutually agreed -upon designee.  Notic e of such 
transfer will be provided to Novan in writing.   
10. MONITORING, COMPLIANCE, AND QUALITY 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_321972] G ood Clinical 
Practices (GCP)  and Standard Operating Procedure s (SOPs) for compliance with applicable 
government regulations , (i.e., informed consent r egulations , (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999) , and 
Institutional Review Board regulations , (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981) ).  Access to all records, both 
during the trial and after trial completion, should be made available to QST and Novan at any 
time for review and audit to ensure the integrity of the data.  The Investigator must notify QST  
immediately if the responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading to 
disqualification have begun.   
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   [ADDRESS_397419] the protocol in accordance with applicable  GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent regulations  (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999) , and in 
compliance with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Every attempt must be made to 
follow the protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified 
times.  If data is not recorded per protocol, the reason( s) must be clearly documented on the 
study records . 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a QST  or 
Novan representative will review the protocol and study records with the Investigator(s) and 
their staff.  During the study, the s tudy monitor will visit the site regularly to check the 
completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database , the adherence to 
the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment , to ensure that consent is being sought and 
obtained in compliance with applicable regulations , and that the investigational product  is being 
stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications.  The Investigator and key trial 
personnel must be available to assis t the monitor during these visits.  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176256].  No information in these records about the 
identity of the subjects will leave the study center.  Monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs  and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables.  Additional

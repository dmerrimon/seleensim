Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3, single- treatment arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety , efficacy , PK, and PD of 
ALXN1210 administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion in approximately 23 to 28 pediatric patients, from birth  to 
< 18 years  of age , with confirmed diagnosis of  aHUS. The study has 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 includes complement 
inhibitor treatment -naïve patients ; Cohort 2 includes eculizumab -experienced adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years 
of age). The study consists of a Screening Period (of up to 7  days for Cohort 1 or up to 28 days for Cohort 2), a 
26-week Initial Evaluation Period, and a n Extension Period  until the product is registered or approved (in 
accordance with country -specific regulations) or for up to 4.[ADDRESS_703792] . 
 
 
Abbreviations: q4w = once every 4 weeks; q8w = once every 8 weeks   
a The Screening Period is up to 7 days for complement inhibitor treatment -naïve patients (ie, Cohort 1)  and up to 
28 days for eculizumab -experienced adolescent patients (ie, Cohort 2 ).  
 
Consenting  patients in Cohort 1 will be screened for study eligibility  up to 7 days prior to Day 1 . Consenting 
patients in Cohort 2 will be screened for study eligibility up to 28 days prior to Day 1; first dose of study drug will 
be given 14 days from the eligible patient’s last dose of eculizumab. Patients who are eligible based on the 
Inclusion and Exclusion Cri teria will be enrolled into the Initial Evaluation Period  and receive a weight- based 
loading dose of ALXN1210 on Day 1, followed by [CONTACT_8497] -based maintenance treatment with ALXN1210 on Day 
15 and q8w thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or once every 4  weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg, 
for a total of 26 weeks of treatment. Weight- based dosing is based on the patient’s body weight recorded on Dose 
Regimen Decision Days  (if the Dose Regimen Day is a dosing day, body weight will be recorded predos e), as 
shown in the table below:   
Body Weight

a Body weight as recorded on Dose Regimen Decision Days . If the Dose Regimen Day is also dosing day, body 
weight will be recorded predose with dosing that day based on the previous Dose Regimen Day body weight.  
 
An initial analysis, including review of AL XN1210 PK and serum free C5 levels, will be conducted after 4 
complement inhibitor treatment- naïve (ie, Cohort 1) patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < [ADDRESS_703793] completed dosing 
through Day 71.  In addition, safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_23275] (D MC). 
Enrollment of patients will proceed without interruption while the analysis is ongoing. The primary purpose of this 
review is to assure patients are achieving adequate complement inhibition during this study with the goal of 
achieving complete terminal complement blockade. Based on this review, if dose adjustment is considered needed  
and tolerable , subsequent treatment for all patients  will continue at the adjusted dose regimen. After the Initial 
Evaluation Period, patients will roll over into a n Exten sion Period in which all patients continue their weight -based 
maintenance dose of  ALXN1210 on Day 183 and q8w thereafter  for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or q4w for patients 
weighing < [ADDRESS_703794] is registered or approved (in accordance with co untry -specific regulation) or 
for up to 4.[ADDRESS_703795] . Note, q4w visits during the Extension Period are not applicable for 
patients weighing ≥ [ADDRESS_703796] patient’s last visit 
or follow -up (whether on site or via phone call)  of the 4.5-year Extension Period , whichever is later .  
Number of Patients (planned):  Approximately 23 to 28 pediatric patients  with documented aHUS are planned . 
The minimum number of patients for each age category is as follow s: 
• Birth  to < 2 years : 4 patients  
• 2 to <  6 years : 4 patients  
• 6 to <  12 years : 4 patients  
• 12 to <  18 years : [ADDRESS_703797] be 12 to < 18 years of age.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:  
Patients must satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria , in order to have a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS and be 
eligible for the study . Patients who fail any of the eligibility criteria may be rescreened based on discussion and 
agreement between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. Patients may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times.  
For Cohort 1, s amples collected at Screening may be tested at either a local or central laboratory. If a local 
laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, 
platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested  at the central laboratory.  All analyses in this study will 
be based on results from the central laboratory  (unless the result is missing) . If Cohort  1 patients are found not  to 
satisfy  the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusion Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they 
must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 , the patient must be 
withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced.  For Cohort 1 patients, laboratory results for Exclusion Criterion 
number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number [ADDRESS_703798] dose. Later results for Exclusion Criteri on number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number [ADDRESS_703799] be tested at a central laboratory; however, historical test results 
via chart review should  be utilized for Inclusion Criterion 3 and Exclusion Criteria 1, 2, 3 , and 24 . 
 The following entry criteria are applicable for patients in both cohorts unless otherwise noted as specific for Cohort 
1 or Cohort 2:   
 Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Patients from birth up to < 18 years of age and weigh ing ≥ 5 kg  at the time of consent who:

1. Change s in serum ALXN1210 concentration over time  
2. Change s in serum free C5 concentrations over time  
3. Changes in serum free C5 and serum ALXN1210 concentration in patients who discontinue treatment  in 
the Extension Period, but remain in the study  
 
Exploratory  
The following exploratory endpoints are applicable for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2:  
Biomarkers 
Exploratory biomarkers of PD effect may include, but are not limited to, change from baseline in levels of markers 
of complement dysregulation (eg, Factor Ba), vascular inflammation (eg, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [sTNFR1]), endothelial activation/damage (eg, soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1 [sVCAM -1], 
thrombomodulin), coagulation (eg, D -dimer), and renal injury (eg, cystatin C). Additional assessments may include 
measurements of  ALXN1210 excretion in urine,  chicken red blood cell (cRBC) hemolysis, total C5, autoan tibodies 
to complement proteins (eg, anti -factor H).  
 
Genetics  
Exploratory genetics may be performed to investigate genetic variants in genes known to be associated with aHUS, as well as to identify novel genetic variants associated with aHUS, complement dysregulation, or metabolism or 
efficacy of ALXN1210. Patients ( or legal guardian ) may decline  from providing a sample for exploratory genetics 
and still participate in the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Extra -renal Signs or Symptoms of aHUS  
The Investigator will evaluate extra -renal signs or symptoms of aHUS using clinical laboratory measur ements, 
vital signs, and an organ system review.  
 
Safety  
For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, t he long- term safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65093], vital signs, physical growth (height, weight , and head circumference [the lat ter only in patients ≤ 2 
years of age] ), electrocardiograms (ECG), laboratory assessments, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs). The proportion of patients who develop antidrug antibodies (ADA) will also be 
assessed.  
Sample Size:  
The total planned sample size is approximately 23 to 28 patients . This sample size is deemed appropriate to get 
proper representation in each of the 4 planned age groups.  
Statistical methods:  
General : All data collected will be presented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. All analyses will be 
performed using SAS® release, version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) or other validated 
statistical software. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of 
observations and mean, standard deviation  (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_65129].  The analyses for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will 
be conducted and reported separately. Analyses specific to Cohort 1 are indicated as such below; all other 
endpoints will be performed for both cohorts. T abulated summaries will not include a direct comparison between 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  
An interim clinical study report (CSR) will be prepared when 12 to 14 complement inhibitor treatment- naïve (ie, 
Cohort  1) patients have completed or withdrawn from  the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period . An additional interim 
CSR will be prepared when all  study  patients have  completed or withdrawn from  the 26 -week Initial Evaluation 
Period. E ach interim CSR will include efficacy, safety, and PK/PD analyses. A final CSR to summarize long -term 
efficacy, safety, and PK/PD will be produced at study completion. Available explorato ry data will be summarized 
after study completion  but may not be included in the CSR . All data collected will be presented using summary 
tables, figures, and data listings.  Planned summaries will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_540041].  
 
Efficacy : Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The analysis of the FAS will be the 
primary analysis.  
The FAS for Cohort 1 will be based on a modified intent to treat (mITT) approach . With  this approach, 
confirmation of eligi bility in patients may occur after receiving study drug. This specifically applies to Inclusion 
Criterion number 2c (must be confirmed via a central lab oratory ), Exclusion Criterion  number  1 (may be 
confirmed via a central or local laboratory ), and Exclusi on Criterion  number 2 (may be confirmed via a central or 
local laboratory ). Based on the above, the FAS will include all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_703811] 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, and meet all of the following criteria  (these are the same criteria 
that if not satisfied will result in discontinuation of the patient and potential replacement) :  
• Patients who satisfy Inclusion Criteri on number 2 c  
• Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criteri on number 1 
• Patients who satisfy Exclusion Criterion number [ADDRESS_703812] 1 
postbaseline efficacy assessment.  
 The FAS will be determined prior to database lock and prior to the database snapshot s for the analys es performed 
at the end of the 26 -week Initial Evaluation Period.  
  Primary efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is Complete TMA Response during the [ADDRESS_703813] in estimating the p roportion of complete TMA responders among ALXN1210 treated 
patients. This will be performed by [CONTACT_540042] a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
proportion of complete TMA responders in ALXN1210 treated patients. The CI will be bas ed on exact confidence 
limits using the Clopper -Pearson method.  This analysis will only be performed for Cohort 1.

CONFIDENTIAL   
Secondary efficacy:  
For the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to Complete TMA Response, a Kaplan -Meier cumulative distribution 
curve will be generated along with a 2 -sided 95% CI. The corresponding summary table will present the 
cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimate, the number of patients at risk, the number of patients responding, 
and the number of patients censored at each postbaseline time point. The table will also present first quartile, 
median, and third quartile, along with corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI, of time to complete response.  This analysis 
will only be performed for Cohort 1.  
 Complete TMA response will also be summar ized over time by [CONTACT_540043] a 2 -sided 95% CI for each postbaseline time point. A similar approach will be used to 
summarize the number and proportion of patients with an increase from baseline in hemoglobin ≥  20 g/L, observed 
at [ADDRESS_703814] 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between . This analysis 
will only be performed for Cohort 1.  
 Kidney function  (dialysis requirement status, eGFR, CKD stage) as well as hematologic parameters (platelets, 
LDH, hemoglobin) will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point. These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables (eGFR, platelets, LDH, 
hemoglobin) will be used to summarize the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific 
test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. Dialysis 
requirement status and CKD stage will be summarized over time. Dialysis requirement status will be summarized 
amon g patients receiving dialysis within 5 days prior to ALXN1210 treatment initiation by [CONTACT_540044]. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the 
proportion receiving dialysis wil l be provided. CKD stage will be summarized over time by [CONTACT_540045] (excluding those with Stage 1 at baseline as they cannot improve), 
worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and stayed the same compared to CKD stage at baseline. Stage [ADDRESS_703815] category. 
A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion will be provided for each category.  
 Quality of life will be  assessed in patients ≥ 5 years of age by [CONTACT_540046] (patient-
reported for patients  who were  ≥ 8 years of age at the time of enrollment; caregiver -reported or caregiver assistance 
for patients who were 5 to < 8 years of age a t the time of enrollment ). This measure will be summarized at baseline 
and each postbaseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well 
as the change from baseline. A MMRM with the fixed, categorical eff ect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the 
test’s baseline value as covariates may be fit to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point.  These 
analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  Analyses will be separate for pati ents who were 5 to 
< 8 years of age  at the time of enrollment (ie, caregiver -reported or caregiver assistance ) and patients  who were  ≥ 8 
years of age  at the time of enrollment (ie, patient -reported) . 
 
Safety:  
Safety analyses will be performed on the S afety  Set defined  as all patients who received at least 1 dose of 
ALXN1210  for both Cohort 1 and Cohort  2. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 
SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_72843].  
 Observed values and changes from baseline (last assessmen t prior to ALXN1210) in ECGs, vital signs, and 
laboratory assessments, as well as presence of ADA will be summarized. Shifts from baseline in laboratory 
assessments will be summarized for all study visits.  These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2.  
 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics :  
Sparse PK and PD (serum free C5) samples will be collected over the course of the study. Individual serum 
concentration data for all patients from the FAS and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive the PK 
parameters for ALXN1210.  These analyses will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  
 
Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -312  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment 6 (Global) [ADDRESS_703816] 
evaluable PD data. The PD effects of ALXN1210 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_224656] a bsolute values and changes 
and percentage changes from baseline in serum free C5 concentrations over time, as appropriate. Descriptive 
statistics will be calculated for the PD data at each sampling time, as appropriate.  Assessments of PK/PD 
relationships may be explored using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies.  
 
Exploratory  
Biomarkers: Exploratory analyses may be conducted for both Cohort 1 and Cohort  2 to evaluate changes from baseline in 
biomarker s which may include, but are not limited to, markers of complement dysregulation (eg, Factor Ba), 
vascular inflammation (eg, sTNFR1), endothelial activation/damage (eg, sVCAM -1, thrombomodulin) coagulation 
(eg, D- dimer), and renal injury (eg, cystatin C). Additional analysis may include evaluation of ALXN1210 
excretion in urine, cRBC hemolysis, total C5, autoantibodies to complement proteins  (eg, anti -factor H) . 
 Genetics:   
Exploratory genetics may be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort  2 to investigate genetic variants in genes 
known to be associated with aHUS, as well as to identify novel genetic variants associated with aHUS, complement dysregulation, or metabolism or efficacy of ALXN1210. Patients (or legal guardian) may decline  from 
providing a sample for exploratory genetics and still participate in the study . 
 Extra- renal Signs or Symptoms of aHUS : 
Extra -renal signs or symptoms of aHUS will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline assessment by 
[CONTACT_540047] a specific symptom present.  This analysis will be performed 
for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.

CONFIDENTIAL  5. INTRODUCTION  
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_151258] (aHUS) is a complement-mediated thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA), most often caused by [CONTACT_540048] (APC) or by [CONTACT_540049] ( Noris, 2010). Patients with aHUS are at risk for life -threatening manifestations of 
disease resulting from endothelial damage, including thrombocytopenia, intravascular hemolysis, acute renal failure, and extra-renal tissue damage. Importantly, approximately 20% of patients experience extra-renal manifestations of disease, including central nervous system, cardiac, 
gastrointestinal, distal extremity, and severe systemic organ involvement ( Loirat, 2011 ; 
Brodsky, 2015). Before the availability of eculizumab, mortality rates among patients with aHUS 
were as high as 15% during the acute progressing phase of the disease ( Noris, 2010; 
Sellier -Leclerc, 2007). Up to 50% of patients progressed to end- stage kidney disease (ESKD), 
often within a year of disease onset, and required dialysis or kidney transplant to sustain life. 
Chronic, uncontrolled terminal complement activation, specifically, activation of complement 
component 5 (C5) and dysregulation of complement activity, is central to the pathogenesis of 
aHUS and the devastating manifestations of this disease. As a result, the targeted blockade of C5, with selective inhibition of generation of C5a and C5b- 9, represents an important therapeutic 
mechanism of treatment.

®) is the standard of care for aHUS patients. Eculizumab is a humanized 
monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity. 
Eculizumab has no known off- target interactions with other proteins in vitro or in vivo. In 
addition, eculizumab is predicted to be effectorless, having no detectable binding to complement 
C1q or most Fcγ receptors (FcγR I, IIb/c IIIa, IIIb) and more than 10-fold weaker binding than 
an IgG1 isotype to FcγR IIa. Upon binding to the complement protein C5, eculizumab blocks 
cleavage to C5a and C5b by C5 convertase; which prevents generation of the terminal complement complex C5b- 9. These attributes underlie the established safety and therapeutic 
efficacy profile of eculizumab as demonstrated in the 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 2 clinical studies (C10 -003, 
C10-004, and C08- 002A/B) and supported by [CONTACT_540050].  
ALXN1210 and eculizumab are both recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibodies against 
human complement protein C5 sharing over 99% amino acid sequence homology. The goal of 
treatment with these complement inhibitors is to achieve immediate, complete, and sustained blockade of terminal complement activity. ALXN1210 is produced in Chinese hamster cells and 
was designed through minimal targeted engineering to substitute 4 amino acids in the 
eculizumab heavy chain to extend antibody half- life. These changes are designed to increase the 
half-life of ALXN1210 relative to eculizumab, increasing the duration of complete terminal 
complement inhibition, while preserving both the high degree of specificity for binding to C5 
and the effectorless nature of the antibody. 
Two studies of ALXN1210 are ongoing in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
(PNH) who are naïve to t reatment with complement inhibitors. Study ALXN1210- PNH -103 is a 
Phase 1b, open-label, multiple dose study, and Study ALXN1210 -PNH-201 is a Phase 2, 
open-label, multiple dose study. ALXN1210- PNH -103 is designed to assess dose ranging over a 
2-fold range of trough exposure levels, while Study ALXN1210- PNH- 201 is designed to assess

CONFIDENTIAL  dose intervals of 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks. Each study in patients with PNH also includes a 2- year 
extension phase. In addition, Study ALXN1210- HV-104 is being conducted to assess the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ALXN1210 in healthy Japanese subjects. 
Preliminary data from ALXN1210- PNH-103, indicate ALXN1210 treatment resulted in rapid 
reductions in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in 100% of patients, which were sustained 
through 2 to 4 monthly dosing intervals, consistent with the extended half- life (t½) of 
ALXN1210 ( Lee, 2016). There was a notable decrease in the need for blood transfusions. These 
preliminary LDH data suggest that rapid, complete, and sustained complement inhibition with ALXN1210 results in highly effective blockade of intravascular hemolysis.  
More information about the PK, mechanism of action, known and expected benefits, risks, and 
reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of ALXN1210 may be found in the cur rent edition 
of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
This amendment is designed to gain experience in adolescent patients switching from 
eculizumab to ALXN1210.  
5.1. Benefits and Risks Assessment  
5.1.1. Potential Benefits  
ALXN1210 and eculizumab are recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind the same epi[INVESTIGATOR_540015] C5 and deliver rapid, sustained, and specific inhibition of 
C5 activation and the terminal complement cascade through identical mechanisms of action. Due 
to its close pharmaco logical relationship to eculizumab and specificity for C5, ALXN1210 is 
anticipated to allow longer dosing intervals while having a safety and efficacy profile similar to 
eculizumab. While eculizumab is an effective therapy for the treatment of aHUS, chronic 
administration of the eculizumab regimen may pose an important burden to patients, many of whom have to miss days of work or school to accommodate once- every -2-week treatment. In 
some cases, patients may refuse treatment or are not compliant due to the f requency of treatment. 
Practice survey research supports the assumption that less frequent once -every -8-week infusions 
associated with ALXN1210 will have a positive impact on daily life for patients and their 
caregivers.  
5.1.2. Identified and Potential Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Meni ngococcal Infection  
Increased susceptibility to infection caused by N eisseria  meningitidis , is a known risk associated 
with complement inhibition. Similar to eculizumab, the main risk associated with ALXN1210 is the risk of meningococcal infections. Specif ic risk mitigation measures are in place to address 
this risk, as described in Section  9.8. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
As a humanized mAb, administration of ALXN1210 may be associated with immunogenicity 
reactions  similarly to any therapeutic protein.  Monitoring of immunogenicity is in place for this 
study as described in Section  7.3 and Section  11.6.

7.1. Summary of Study Design 
Study ALXN1210-a HUS -312 is a Phase 3 , open-label, single -treatment  arm, multicenter study to 
evaluate the safety , efficacy , PK, and PD of ALXN1210 administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) 
infusion to approximately 23 to 28 pediatric patients, from birth  to < 18 years of age , with 
confirmed diagnosis of aHUS.  The study has 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor 
treatment-naïve patients; Cohort 2 includes eculizumab- experienced adolescent pati ents (12 to 
< 18 years of age).  The study consists of 3 periods : a Screening Period (of up to 7 days for 
Cohort 1 patients or up to 28 days for Cohort 2 patients), a 26-week Initial Evaluation Period , 
and an Extension Period until the product is registered  or approved (in accordance with 
country-specific regulations) or for up to 4.[ADDRESS_703828].

Consenting patients in Cohort 1 will be screened for study eligibility up to 7 days prior to Day 1.  
Consenting patients in Cohort 2 will be screened for study eligibility up to 28 days prior to 
Day 1; first dose of study drug will be given 14 days from the eligible patient’s last dose of 
eculizumab. Patients who are eligible based on the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria will be 
enrolled into the Initial Evaluation Period and receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 on Day 1, followed by [CONTACT_540054]1210 on Day 15 and q8w thereafter for patients 
weighing ≥  20 kg, or once every 4 weeks (q4w) for patients weighing < 20 kg. The loading dose 
and maintenance dose will be based on the patient’s body weight recorded on Dose Regimen 
Decision Days ( Table  7). If the Dose Regimen  Day is also dosing day, body weight will be 
recorded predose with dosing that day based on the previous Dose Regimen Day body weight.

conducted after 4 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, Cohort 1)  patients weighing ≥  5 kg 
to < [ADDRESS_703829] completed dosing through Day 71.  In addition, safety data will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_23275] (DMC). Enrollment of patients will proceed without interrup tion while the analysis is ongoing. The primary purpose of this review is to assure 
patients are achieving adequate complement inhibition during this study with goal of achieving complete terminal complement blockade. Based on this review, i f dose adjustme nt is considered 
needed  and tolerable, subsequent treatment for all patients  will continue at the adjusted dose 
regimen. After the Initial Evaluation Period, patients will roll over into a n Extension Period in 
which all patients continue their weight- based  maintenance dose of  ALXN1210 on Day 183 and 
q8w thereafter  for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or q4w for patients weighing  < [ADDRESS_703830] is registered or approved (in accordance with country -specific regulation) or for up to

Period, whichever is later.  
7.2. Discussion of Design  
This Phase 3, open- label, study will evaluate the PK/PD, efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
ALXN1210  in the treatment of pediatric patients with aHUS . This amendment is designed to 
gain experience in adolescent patients switching from eculizumab to ALXN1210. The study has 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients; Cohort 2 includes 
eculizumab -experienced adolescent patient s (12 to < 18 years of age). As the prevalence of 
newly diagnosed aHUS is lower in adolescents than in adults and younger ages, evaluation of 
ALXN1210 in an adolescent switch patient cohort (Cohort 2) will provide sufficient safety and 
PK data in this group to understand the safety and PK profile of ALXN1210 across the range of age groups. 
Four pediatric age groups were selected to test potential dose regimens across a series of body 
weight categories for the predicted C
max and trough serum concentrations of ALXN1210 . The 
doses and regimen are expected to result in a complete terminal complement blockade after the 
first dose for all aHUS patients within each body weight group and to maintain ALXN1210 
concentrations below the maximum ALXN1210 concentrations a chieved in Phase [ADDRESS_703833]

8.3. Discontinuation  
8.3.1. Early Termination of Patients From the Study  
The criteria for early termination of patients from the study include:  
• Withdrawal of consent: A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any 
time.  
• Patient with prior kidney transplant developi[INVESTIGATOR_540018] (C4d positive renal biopsy) and for whom rituximab is deemed the appropriate therapy: patient must be terminated 
from the study and receive standard of care therapy. 
• Intake of certain prohibited medications as described in Section  9.7. 
• Patient who is receiving ALXN1210 as a part of retreatment ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) chooses 
to discontinue ALXN1210. 
• The Sponsor Medical Monitor or the Investigator deems it is in the best interest of the 
patient.  
During the Initial  Evaluation Period, if any of the following occur, patient should be permanently 
discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment and terminated from the study: 
• Serious infusion reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring 
ventilator support, or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Appendix D ) or serum 
sickness -like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration  
• Pregnancy or planned pregnancy 
If a patient terminates from the study  early , the Sponsor and site monitor should be notified and 
an Early Termination (ET) visit (as shown in the Schedule of Assessments, Section  7.3) will be 
performed as soon as possible. In addition, a Follow-up Phone Call will be performed 8 weeks (56 days) ± 5 days following the patient’s last ALXN1210 dose to collect concomitant 
medications, nonpharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649], and AEs.  
At the time of the termination, if there is an  ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is significantly outside of the reference range and clinically significant ( Section  11.4 ), the Investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory 
clinical resolution of the laboratory result or AE  is achieved . 
The reason for early termination will be recorded on the eCRF . 
Patients who terminate early from the study will not be replaced.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2. Discontinuation of ALXN1210 Treatment in the Extension Period and 
Continuation in the Study   
In the Extension Period, patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment will be allowed to  
continue in the study for the remainder of the visits without receiving ALXN1210 dosing. 
Note: In the Initial Evaluation Period, patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment will not be 
allowed to continue in the study. 
Patients should be permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment if any of the following 
occur during the study: 
• Receiving other complement inhibitors (including eculizumab) or undergoing PE/PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_540019] (refer to Section  9.7) 
• Serious infusion reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring ventilator support, or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Appendix D ) or serum 
sickness -like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration;  
• Pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or 
• The Sponsor Medical Monitor or the Investigator deem s it is in the best interest of the 
patient.  
The Investigator should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible prior to discontinuing a patient’s study treatment and provide the rationale for discontinuing.  
If a patient is discontinued from ALXN1210 trea tment  in the Extension Period, but remains in 
the study, patient should continue attending his or her scheduled protocol visits per body weight, until Day  1863. During these visits, all assessments except for ALXN1210 administration as 
described in the Schedule of Assessments, Section  7.3, should be performed. The PK/PD (1 
sample at any time) and ADA samples will be collected as per protocol schedule until about [ADDRESS_703873] dose of ALXN1210.  
Any patient who discontinues the ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remains  in 
the study and develops abnormal TMA parameter (as specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) before 
Day 1863, will have the opportunity for retreatment ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). If the study drug is 
discontinued again (after retreatment), then the patient will be terminated from the study and ET 
procedures and follow-up will be performed as described in Section  8.3.1.  
The reason for the treatment or study  discontinuation will be recorded on the eCRF.  
If a female patient is permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment due to pregnancy, the Investigator will attempt to follow -up until the outcome of the pregnancy ( Section  11.8 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Retreatment of Patients Who Discontinue ALXN1210 Treatment in the 
Extension Period  
A patient who discontinues ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remains in the 
study, and develops abnormal TMA parameter (as i ndicated by [CONTACT_540057]. 1 below) before 
Day 1863, may be restarted on ALXN1210, if all 3 conditions below are fulfilled: 
1. Evidence of TMA, including thrombocytopenia, evidence of hemolysis, or kidney injury based on any 1 of the following laboratory findings: 
Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -312  Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Amendment 6 (Global) 16 Jul 2019  
Page 52 of 96 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Platelet count < 150,000/μL, or  
• LDH > 1.5 × ULN with hemoglobin ≤ LLN for age and gender, or  
• Serum creatinine ≥ 97.5th percentile for age ( Appendix B ). 
Note: The TMA laboratory parameter must be confirmed on at least 1 repeated measure. 
The above laboratory results can be obtained at either the central laboratory (preferable) 
or the site’s local laboratory.  
2. The Investigator believes that the patient will potentially benefit from retreatment, 
initiates a discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor, and provides a medically 
justified rationale. The Investigator and Medical Monitor mutually agree on retreatment, 
and the decision is documented. 
3. The patient agrees to the consent addendum for retreatment.  
If the decision to re-treat with ALXN1210 occurs on a scheduled study visit, then dosing may begin on that day. Note:  A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to administering any 
study drug to female patients of childbearing potential. 
• The p atient will receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 IV based on the body weight 
(Table  7). All assessments will be performed per the protocol schedule ( Section  7.3). 
If star t of the retreatment occurs on a visit which does not include PK/PD , ADA, 
exploratory serum and plasma biomarker, exploratory urine biomarker, hematology, coagulation, or chemistry sample collection, PK/PD samples will be collected predose and at EOI, and ADA, exploratory serum and plasma biomarker, exploratory urine 
biomarker, hematology, coagulation, and chemistry samples will be collected 
predose.  
• Two weeks after the loading dose, the patient will receive a supplemental 
maintenance dose of ALXN1210 IV at an unscheduled visit, based on the body 
weight ( Table  7). An abbreviated physical examination will be conducted, vital signs 
will be collected, predose hematology, coagulation, and chemistry samples will be 
collected, and the safety card will be reviewed with the patient. Pharmacokinetic/PD 
samples will be collected predose and at EOI along with a predose ADA sample.  
• The patient will return to the site for the next 2 maintenance doses of ALXN1210 IV 
at 3-week  (if on q4w regimen) or 7- week (if on q8w regimen) intervals . These visits 
will correspond to the next 2  scheduled dosing visits per the protocol schedule and 
will not be considered deviations to the visit windows . At th ese 2  visit s, the patient 
will receive maintenance doses of ALXN1210 IV and undergo all assessments per the 
protocol schedule ( Section  7.3), including hematology, coagulation, and chemistry, if 
not included as a part of this visit, and then continue to attend the visits per the 
protocol schedule. 
If the decision to re- treat with  ALXN1210 occurs between scheduled study visits, then the below 
apply. Note:  A negative pregnancy test result is required prior to administering any study drug to 
female patients of childbearing potential. 
• At an unscheduled visit, a supplemental loading dose of ALXN1210 IV  may be 
administered based on the body weight ( Table  7). An abbreviated physical 
Protocol ALXN 1210- aHUS -312  Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Amendment 6 (Global) [ADDRESS_703874] will  be reviewed with the 
patient. Pharmacokinetic/PD samples will be collected predose and at EOI along with 
a predose ADA sample.  
• The Medical Monitor and the Investigator will determine administration of maintenance dose of ALXN1210 IV  further to facilitate alignment with the Schedule 
of Assessment s (Section  7.3), as appropriate. The timing of subsequent visits may be 
modified to accommodate realignment to the Schedule of Assessment s, these will not 
be considered deviations to visit windows. 
8.3.3. Discontinuation of Study/Site Termination by [CONTACT_540058]. Conditions that 
may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to:  
• Discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the study  
• Sponsor decision to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the study drug  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the approved protocol, pertinent guidelines, 
and/or regulations  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the Investigator to the Sponsor 
and/or regulatory authorities  
Should the study be terminated early, the Sponsor will notify the national competent authority and the IRB/IEC according to local requirements. 
8.3.4. Replacements 
For Cohort 1, i f it is determined at any point that a patient’s Screening data does not satisfy 
Inclusion Criterion number 2c , Exclusion Criterion number 1, and/or E xclusion Criterion number 
2, after receiving at least [ADDRESS_703875] (eg, patient local laboratory data used 
to confirm eligibility criteria are subsequently determined by a central laboratory to no longer 
meet eligibility criteria), the patient will be discontinued from the study and may be replaced. 
Early termination procedures will be performed on patients who are terminated early  
(Section  8.3.1) and all AEs will be collected until 8 weeks ( 56 days) after the patient’s last dose 
of study drug ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
As described in Section  15.3, the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be 
based on a modified intent to treat (mITT) approach, and the patients discontinued from the 
study for the reasons described above will be excluded from the FAS . The aim of the 
replacement process is to yield a FAS that includes the planned number of patients all satisfying 
key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The dose regimen for ALXN1210 during the Initial Evaluation Period is  based on the patient’s 
body we ight recorded on Dose Regimen Decision Days ( Table  7). If the Dose Regimen Day is 
also dosing day, body weight will be recorded predose with dosing that day based on the previous Dose Regimen Day body weight. Patients will receive a loading dos e of ALXN1210 on 
Day 1 , followed by [CONTACT_540060]1210 on Day 15 and q8w thereafter for patients 
weighing ≥  20 kg, or q4w for patients weighing < 20 kg. For Cohort 2 patients, Day 1 of study 
treatment will occur 14 days from the patient’s last dose of eculizumab. Changes in dose regimen  
(dose level [ie, mg] or dose frequency [ie, q4w vs q8w]) will be based on the patient’s body 
weight on the “ Dose Regimen  Decision Day ” (Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4) as 
follows:  
• During the Initial Evaluation Period, changes to dose regimen (dose level [ie, mg] or 
dose frequency [ie, q4w vs q8w]) will be based on the patient’s body weight on the “Dose Reg imen Decision Day (patients on q4w or q8w schedules)”  preceding the day 
of administration .

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
The weight- based dosages of ALXN1210 in this study ( Table  7) are  premised  on PK/PD data 
from early development studies in healthy adult volunteers as well as the available data from 
patients with PNH in an ongoing Phase 1b dose-finding study (ALXN1210 -PNH-103) and an 
ongoing Phase 2 proof- of-concept study (ALXN1210- PNH-201). The selection of ALXN1210 
dose regimen for patients with aHUS is based on targeting immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with PN H, which is expected to correspond to 
immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with aHUS.  As 
stated  in Section  7.1, a planned initial analysis  of ALXN1210 PK and serum free C5 levels was 
conducted after 4 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, Cohort 1) patients weighing ≥ 5 kg to < 40 kg completed dosing through Day 71. Based on the results of this  analysis, the loading 
dose for patients ≥  5 to <  [ADDRESS_703885] of this amendment from 300 mg to 600 mg.   
9.5. Special Treatment Considerations  
Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_65077]. Please refer to Appendix D  for 
guidance on identifying and managing potential drug infusion reactions. 
9.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonpharmacologic 
Procedures  
Prior medications (including vitamins and herbal preparations)—including those discussed in the 
exclusion criteria (Section  8.2) and procedures (any therapeutic intervention, such as 
surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) the patient takes or undergoes within [ADDRESS_703886] dose of ALXN1210—will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF. In 
addition, history of meningococcal vaccination must be collected for the [ADDRESS_703887] 
dose of study drug, and for patients < [ADDRESS_703888] be collected from birth.   
All medication use and procedures undertaken during the study will be recorded in the patient’s 
source document/medical chart and eCRF. This record will include all prescription drugs, herbal 
products, vitamins, minerals, over- the-counter medications, and current medications. 
Concomitant medications and procedures will be recorded from the first infusion of study drug 
through 56 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any changes in concomitant 
medications also will be recorded in the patient’s source document/medical chart and eCRF. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the patient’s standard of care during the study, or 
for the treatment of any AE, along with the allowed medications described below may be given 
at the discretion of the Investigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medications are recorded in full in the patient’s source 
document/medical chart and eCRF.  
A Follow-up Phone Cal l to collect concomitant medications, procedures, and adverse events is 
required 8 weeks (56 days) ± 5 days after the patient’s last dose of ALXN1210 in the following circumstances:  
1. Patient terminates from the study early.

Amendment 6 (Global) [ADDRESS_703889] dose of study drug for all patients in the study (even those who discontinue 
ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remain in the study) until completion of the 
study or early termination of the patient from the study: 
• Eculizumab or other complement inhibitors 
• Use of any other investigational drug or device as part of a clinical trial 
• IVIg (unless for an unrelated medical need e.g. hypogammaglobinemia)  
• Rituximab  
• PE/PI  
• New dialysis with in the first [ADDRESS_703890] dose of ALXN1210 
unless there is a compelling medical need as assessed by ( 1) hypervolemia 
unresponsive to diuretics, (2) refractory electrolyte imbalance, or (3) new-onset 
uremic encephalopathy. Exceptions must be approved prior to administration of dialysis on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_1034].  
The following concomitant medications and procedures are allowed under certain circumstances and with the following restrictions: 
• Use of other immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as steroids, mTORi [eg, sirolimus, 
everolimus], CNI [eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus]) during the study are not allowed 
unless: a) part of an established post- transplant antirejection regime, or b) patient has 
confirmed anti-complement factor antibodies requiring immunosuppressive therapy, 
or c) steroids are being used for a condition other than aHUS (eg, asthma), or 
d) steroids initiated empi[INVESTIGATOR_540021].  
Any patients receiving other complement inhibitors (including eculizumab) or undergoing PE/PI [INVESTIGATOR_540022].   
9.8. Vaccination  
Due to its mechanism of action, the use of ALXN1210 increases the patient’s susceptibility to infection. To reduce the risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis , 
Hib, and Streptococcus pneumoniae .  
Patients must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis  within [ADDRESS_703891] serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, 
where available, are recommended to prevent common pathogenic meningococcal serotypes.

[ADDRESS_703893] and throughout the study as 
described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4).  
Patients must be vaccinated against Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae  according to national and 
local vaccination schedule guidelines, prior to, or at the time of, receiving the first dose of ALXN1210. 
Vaccination status for N. meningitidis , Hib , and S. pneumoniae  will be recorded on the patient’s 
eCRF.  
9.9. Treatment  Compliance 
Patients will be administered study drug in a controlled setting under the supervision of the 
Investigator or designee, thereby [CONTACT_65120]. The 
Investigator or designee  will ensure that all patients are adequately informed on the specific 
dosing regimen required for compliance with the study protocol, ensure that the patient receives 
the appropriate dose at the designated time points during the study and that adequate safety 
monitoring occurs during the infusion ( Section  9.5).

The I nvestigator or his/her designee will meet with patients/caregivers  to discuss the potential 
safety risks of ALXN1210 and to give the Investigator the opportunity to address any of the 
patient’s safety concerns regarding the study.  
The collection of AEs will be monitored from the time informed consent is obtained until study 
completion. Investigators are inst ructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion 
(resolution or stabilization) as described in Section  11.7.6. In the event of patient withdrawal 
from the study, AE monitoring should continue through the last patient’s last study visit if 
possible.  
The timing of the clinical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section  7.3). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be 
followed until resolution or stabilization. 
11.1. Demographic/Medical History 
11.1.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
A review of demographic parameters, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be 
performed. A complete medical history will be taken and documented. Weight and height will be 
recorded.   
11.1.2. Disease Characteristics 
The patient’s aHUS  medical history, including onset of first aHUS  symptom and date of 
diagnosis, will be documented at the Screening V isit.  
11.1.3. Medical History  
The patient’s medical history, including prior and concomitant conditions/disorders, will be

11.4. Laboratory Assessments 
Samples for serum pregnancy, hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be 
performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  7.3). Specific 
laboratory assessments are provided  in Appendix E . Samples for laboratory assessments will be 
collected  before each study drug administration. An alternative blood sampling schedule for 
infants, for whom less blood volume should be collected, must be used as detailed in the Study 
Operations Manual.  
For Cohort 1, samples collect ed at Screening may be tested at either a local or central laboratory. 
If a local laboratory is used to define eligibility, additional samples will be collected during the Screening Period for LDH, platelet count, hemoglobin and serum creatinine and tested at the 
central laboratory. All analyses in this study will be based on results from the central laboratory  
(unless the result is missing [see Section  15.12.1]) . If Cohort 1 patients are found not to satisfy 
the eligibility criteria for serum creatinine (Inclusion Criterion 2c) based on central laboratory results, they must not be enrolled into the study; if the subject has received the first dose of ALXN1210 , the patient must be withdrawn from the study, and may be replaced. For Cohort 1 
patients, laboratory results for Exclusion Criterion number 1 and/or Exclusion Criterion number [ADDRESS_703902] dose. Later results for Exclusion Criterion number 1 and/or 
Exclusion Criterion number 2 could lead to discontinuation and replacement of the patient 
(please refer to Section 8.3 for potential discontinuation and replacement details). 
For Cohort 2, samples collected at Screening must be tested at a central laboratory; however, 
historical test results via chart review should be utilized for Inclusion Criterion 3 and Exclusion 
Criteria 1, 2, 3, and 24.  Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for collection 
and detailed instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_65080]. Laboratory reports  will be made available to the Investigators in a timely 
manner for clinical management of patients.   
It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to the 
underlying disease. The Investigator s should use their medical judgment when assessing the 
clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory changes from baseline value are noted, the changes will 
be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to study treatment for all clinically significant out- of-range values ( Section  15.9.3). The 
Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments until 
(1) values have returned to the normal range or baseline level, or (2) in the judgment of the 
Investigator, values that are outside the normal range are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures.

Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish drug effect.  
A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error.   
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to investigational product are to be reported  within 24 hours of Investigator/site awareness . Data on fetal outcome and 
breastfeeding will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation.  
Adverse events should be recorded from the time of signed consent. An AE reported after informed consent but before study drug administration will be considered a pretreatment AE. 
Alexion has reporting standards for AEs that are to be followed as described in Section  11.7.6 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  
11.7.1. Targeted Adverse Events 
The following events are important identified risks in this study: 
• Meningococcal infections 
11.7.2. Severity Assessment  
The severity of AEs will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE ) version 4.03 or higher. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Each 
CTCAE term is a Lowest Level Term ( LLT) per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activ ities (MedDRA
®). Each LLT will be coded to a MedDRA preferred term  (PT) . 
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE assigns a grade of 1 through 5, with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE ( Table  8).

• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , may be considered a serious adverse event when,  based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above. 
The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_57747], based on the current version of the 
IB. 
Information pertaining to the collection and reporting of SAEs is provided in Section  11.7.6.  
11.7.5. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspec ted unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the Investigator identifies as related to investigational product or procedure. 
[LOCATION_002] Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and European Union Clinical 
Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory 
requirements in participating countries require the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Alexion has procedures 
that will be followed for the recording and expe dited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent 
with global regulations and the associated detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions will be reported to the national competent authority and IRBs /IECs  where 
applicable. 
11.7.6. Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. All Adverse Events 
All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF) until 8 weeks ( 56 days ) after the last dose of study drug. For patients who discontinue 
study drug, but remain in the study, AE data collection will continue at subsequent visits per the 
Schedule of Assessments, until the patient’s last visit. For patients who terminate early from the 
study, an ET visit will be conducted as soon as possible, and a Follow-up Phone C all will be 
performed 8 weeks ( 56 days) ± 5 days following the patient’s last dose of the study drug. All 
AEs must be recorded on the eCRF upon the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence.  
Investigators will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, 
seriousness, and potential relatedness to study drug) to Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance 
(GPV) within [ADDRESS_703907] .

CONFIDENTIAL  If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly 
capture the circumstances and data leading to any such dose interruption or discontinuation of 
treatment in the AE and Exposure pages of the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be recorded regardless of the Investigator ’s assessment of causality.  No time limit 
exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. Inve stigators 
are at liberty to report S AEs irrespective of causality at any time.   
For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following: 
• Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed below  
• Causality of the SAE(s)  
• Treatment of /intervention for the SAE(s)  
• Outcome of the SAE(s)  
• Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information 
All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GPV within [ADDRESS_703908] .  
In the event that either the electronic data capture ( EDC) or the Safety Gateway is unavailable at 
the site(s) , the SAE must be reported on paper. Facsimile transmission or emai l may be used in 
the event of electronic submission failure.  
Email:   
Facsimile:   (NOTE: A local facsimile number will be provided for non- US 
sites)  
When further information becomes available, the eCRF  should be updated with the new 
information and an updated SAE report should be submitted  to Alexion GPV via Safety 
Gateway .  
If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records should be submitted to Alexion GPV via the email address or fax number noted above. 
All paper forms and follow-up information submitted to the sponsor outside of the Safety 
Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appropriate section of the study file.  
11.7.7. Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
Alexion GPV or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current IB as the 
Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_540062].

It is the PI’s responsibility to notify the IRB /IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site , as 
required per IRB/IEC SOPs . Investigators will also be notified of all S[LOCATION_003]R events that occur 
during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB/IEC of these additional SAEs  as per IRB/IEC S OPs.  
11.8. Exposure During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding 
Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result 
of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal 
exposure. 
For all Alexion products, both in development or postapproval, exposure during pregnancy must 
be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, 
spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. 
If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this 
study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form 
to Alexion GPV via fax or email ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). When the outcome of the pregnancy 
becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GPV. If additional follow-up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. 
Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the 
“Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding”) and any AEs experienced by [CONTACT_540063] e mail or facsimile 
(Section  11.7.6).  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_57716] a contraceptive medication. However, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet the 
criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs.  
11.9. Safety Monitoring  
The Alexion medical monitor, G PV physician, or both will monitor safety data throughout the 
course of the study. 
Alexion will review all information pertaining to the SAEs within the time frames mandated by 
[CONTACT_10984]. The Alexion medical monitor will, as appropriate, consult with the GPV safety physician, to review trends in safety data.

CONFIDENTIAL  15. STATISTICAL METHODS  AND PLANNED ANALYSES 
The analyses for complement inhibitor treatment- naïve patients (ie, Cohort 1) and eculizumab -
experienced adolescent patients (ie, Cohort 2) will be conducted and reported separately. 
Analyses specific to Cohort 1 are indicated as such below; all other endp oints will be performed 
for both cohorts. Tabulated summaries will not include a direct comparison between Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2.  
15.1. General Considerations  
All data collected will be presented in summary tables and tabulations. All data, as well as any outcomes derived from the data, will be presented in detailed data listings. Graphical displays 
may also be provided, when appropriate. All analyses will be performed using SAS
® release, 
version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) or other validated statistical software. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of 
observations and mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, minimum, and maximum values. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_540065]. Prior 
to finalizing and locking the database, all decisions concerning the inclusion or exclusion of data from the analysis for each patient will be determined by [CONTACT_540066]. Any and all exclusions will be documented in patient listings.  
Planned summaries will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_540041]. 
Details of the statistical analyses described below will be specified in a separate Statistical 
Analysis Plan ( SAP) before database lock and analysis. Any change to the data analysis methods 
described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes the primary or key 
secondary objectives or the study conduct. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol or SAP, and the justification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study report (CSR). Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted 
as deemed appropriate.  
An interim  CSR will be prepared  when 12 to 14 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, 
Cohort 1) patients have completed or withdrawn from the end of the 26- week Initial Evaluation 
Period . An additional interim CSR will be prepared when all study patients have completed or 
withdrawn from the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period. Each interim CSR  will include efficacy, 
safety , and PK /PD analyses. A final CSR to summarize long -term efficacy, safety , and PK /PD 
will be produced  at study completion. Available exploratory data will be summarized after  study 
completion but may not be included in the CSR. 
For patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment in the Extension Period, but remain in the 
study, their data will be summarized along with data from patients remaining on treatment for 8 weeks (56  days) after their last dose of study drug. Data beyond this point will be presented in 
separate supplemental listings strictly limited to these patients. If such patients start retreatment with ALXN1210, their data from the time of study treatment restart will also be presented in separate supplemental listings limited to patients who will have the study treatment  restarted . 
However, data on AE, concomitant medications, and nonpharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_540024] 1210- aHUS -312  Alexion Pharmaceuticals , Inc.

on treatment throughout the study. 
Pharmacokinetic/PD and ADA data from patients who discontinue ALXN1210 treatment  in the 
Extension Period, but remain in the study, will be summarized along with data from patients 
remaining on treatment, until 8  weeks (56 days) after their last dose o f study drug. Data beyond 
this point will be presented in separate supplemental listings limited to these patients. If such patients start retreatment with ALXN1210, their PK/PD and ADA data from the time of study treatment restart will also be presented i n separate supplemental listings limited to patients who 
will have the study treatment restarted . 
15.2. Determination of Sample Size 
The total planned sample size is approximately 23 to 28. This  sample size is deemed appropriate 
to get proper representation in each of the 4 planned age groups and provide adequate safety 
information and precision level for the planned estimation. 
15.3. Analysis Sets 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS. The analysis of the FAS will be the primary analysis.  
The FAS for Cohort 1 will be based on a mITT approach . With this approach, confirmation of 
eligibility in patients may occur after receiving study drug. This specifically applies to Inclusion 
Criterion number 2c (must be confirmed via a central laboratory), Exclusion Criterion number 1 (may be confirmed via a central or local laboratory), and Exclusion Criterion number 2 (may be 
confirmed via a central or local laboratory).  Based on the above, the FAS will include all 
patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_703911] 1 postbaseline efficacy 
assessment, and meet all of the following criteria:  
• Patients who satisfy Inclusion Criterion number 2c   
• Patients who satisfy  Exclusion Criterion  number 1

15.11.1. Biomarker Analyses 
For exploratory biomarker analyses, summary statistics may be presented for  absolute , change 
and percentage change from baseline.  
The relationship between ALXN1210  concentration and exploratory biomarkers or the 
correlation between clinical benefit and key exploratory biomarkers may be assessed by 
[CONTACT_540073]. Exploratory analysis and potential relationships between clinical outcomes, 
PK/PD, genetic profile , and biomarker levels may also be performed. Autoantibody results will 
be summarized if evalua ted.  
This analysis may be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 
15.11.2. Genetics 
Exploratory genetic s may be performed to investigate genetic variants in genes known to be 
associated with aHUS, as well as to identify novel genetic variants associated with aHU S, 
complement dysregulation, or metabolism or efficacy of ALXN1210. This analysis may be 
performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 
15.11.3. Extra -renal Signs or Symptoms of aHUS  
Extra -renal signs or symptoms of aHUS will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline 
assessment by [CONTACT_540074] a specific symptom present. 
This analysis will be performed for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. 
15.12.  Other Statistical Issues  
15.12.1. Missing or Invalid Data 
If a Day 1 assessment is missing, the Screening assessment will be used as the baseline assessment. If the Day 1 and Screening assessments are missing, local laboratory data will be 
used as the baseline assessment.  
For evaluation of Complete TMA Response during the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period 
(primary endpoint), patients missing an efficacy assessment that is part of the definition of Complete TMA Response while still on -study, will have their last observation carried forward 
(LOCF). For patients who will have early  termination  from t he study prior to Week 26, their data 
up to the time of discontinuation will be used to assess Complete TMA Response.  
Missing data for QoL instruments will be handled as specified in the instructions for each 
instrument.  
15.13.  Interim Analyses  
An interim analys is is planned when 12 to 14 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (ie, 
Cohort 1) patients have completed or withdrawn from the 26- week Initial Evaluation Period . A 
second interim analysis is planned  after all study patients have completed or withdrawn from the

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX C. ANTIBODY MEDIATED RE JECTION CRITERIA  
The revised (Banff 2013) classification of acute/active antibody- mediated rejection in renal 
allografts will be used to assess antibody mediated rejection. All [ADDRESS_703923] be present for 
diagnosis. 
Criteriaa,b,c 
Histologic evidence of acute tissue inj ury, including one or more of the following:  
Microvascular inflammation (g score > 0d and/or ptc score > 0) 
Intimal or transmural arteritis (v score > 0)e 
Acute thrombotic microangiopathy, in the absence of any other cause  
Acute tubular injury, in the absence of any other apparent cause  
Evidence of current/recent antibody interaction with vascular endothelium, including at least one of the following:  
Linear C4d staining in peritubular capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (involving at least 10% of ptc by [CONTACT_540079], or any ptc by [CONTACT_527599])  
At least moderate microvascular inflammation (sum of g and ptc scores ≥  2)f 
Increased expression of gene transcripts in the biopsy tissue indicative of endothelial injury, if thoroughly 
validatedg 
Serologic evidence of donor -specific antibodies (HLA or other antigens)  
Source: Haas, 2014a  
a For all antibody -mediated rejection (ABMR) diagnoses, it should be specified in the report whether the lesion is 
C4d-positive [involving ≥ 10% of ptc by [CONTACT_540080] (IHC) on paraffin sections] or without evident C4d deposition (<  10% of ptc by 
[CONTACT_540081]; completely negative by [CONTACT_527599]).  
b These lesions  may be clinically acute, smoldering, or subclinical. Biopsies showing 2 of the 3 features, except 
those with donor -specific antibody ( DSA ) and C4d without histologic abnormalities potentially related to AMR or 
cell-mediated rejection (the latter seen main ly in ABO -incompatible renal allografts) may be designated as 
‘suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]’ for acute/active ABMR.  
c Modified from Haas, 2014b.  
d Recurrent/de -novo glomerulonephritis should be excluded.  
e It should be noted that these arterial lesions may be indicative of ABMR, T -cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), or 
mixed ABMR/TCMR. Arterial lesions are only scored in arteries having a continuous media with [ADDRESS_703924] be present (g score ≥  1). 
g At present, the only validated molecular marker meeting this criterion is ENDAT expression, and this has only 
been vali dated in a single center (University of Alberta). The use of ENDAT expression at other centers or other 
test(s) of gene expression within the biopsy as evidence of ABMR must first undergo independent validation as 
was done for ENDAT expression by [CONTACT_540082], 2009.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX D. MANAGEMENT OF POTENT IAL DRUG INFUSION 
REACTIONS  
Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_65077]. For this reason, patients will be carefully observed during each infusion.  
Patients who develop AEs of rash, hives, itching, or dysphagia of mild to moderate intensity 
during their infusion of ALXN1210 may continue to receive the infusion if deemed to be medically appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. Medic al intervention may include, but is not limited 
to, slowing of the infusion rate (with or without treatment) or interrupting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119].  
Any acute reaction should be treated according to standard medical practice depending upon 
clinical sign s and symptoms. If a patient requires medical intervention, the patient should remain 
at the investigational site until his or her condition stabilizes. The AE and any associated 
concomitant medications must be captured on the patient’s source document and  eCRF.  
Some patients treated with IV infusions of monoclonal antibodies have experienced concurrent reactions with signs or symptoms that can be classified as acute allergic reactions/hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release syndrome. Signs and symptoms include 
headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, 
erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, lightheadedness, hypotension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during an 
infusion; therefore, patients will be monitored closely during the infusion. In addition, the re-
administration of some monoclonal antibodies has been associated with serum sickness- like 
reactions manifesting [ADDRESS_703925] make 
certain that medication (ie, adrenaline, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids) and 
other equipment to treat anaphylaxis are readily available. The infusion must be stopped 
immediately if Grade  ≥ 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including drug fever) or Grade  ≥ 3 
cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction occurs. The sponsor must be notified within 
24 hours of any infusion reaction requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug.  
Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study drug should be treated 
according to institutional guidelines. For a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reaction, the infusion 
should be temporarily stopped and treatment with an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 
50 mg orally [PO] or equivalent) and acetaminophen (650 mg orally or equivalent) may be considered. If the patient’s signs and symptoms have resolved (with or without administration of 
the above medication), the infusion may be restarted. However, the patients should be infused at 
a slower rate and be monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during the remainder of the infusion. Patients experiencing an infusion reaction should be observed in 
the clinic until resolution of the reaction, or until the Investigator determines the patient is no 
longer at risk. Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resulting in disc ontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD 
evaluations required by [CONTACT_760].

CONFIDENTIAL  If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed below, then administration of subcutaneous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1/1000, 0.3 to 0.5 mL, or equival ent) should be considered. In the case of 
bronchospasm, treatment with an inhaled beta agonist also should be considered. Patients administered an antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of an infusion reaction should be given appropriate warnings about drowsiness and impairment of driving ability before being 
discharged from the center.  
Table  10: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula), and at least 1 of the following:  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] 
(PEF), hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rap idly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes 
to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, r educed PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline

Study Design  This is a phase II open -label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy 
of tocilizumab  in improving GRFS after allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (alloHCT) for hematologic malignancy.  
Study Agent/
Intervention 
Description  Patients enrolled on the clinical trial will rec eive tacrolimus initiating 
at Day -[ADDRESS_592906] Day +[ADDRESS_592907] -transplant. 
Methotrexate will be administered intravenously and dosed at 15 
mg/m2 Day +1 and 10 mg/m2 Days +3, +6 and +11. Tocilizumab  will 
be administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg on Day  -1 and  
at day +100 (+/ - 14 days).  
Number of Subjects  [ADDRESS_592908].  
Estimated Time to 
Complete Enrollment:  The estimated accrual period is 18 months . 
Statistical Methodology:  
 The sample size was selected to achieve 80% power to detect an 
increase in GRFS at 12 months to 40% compared to a historical 
control value of 20% at a one- sided 5% significance level. Based on 
asymptotic z -test for proportions, 29 patients with a known outcome 
are needed (i.e ., known GVHD, relapse, or death status at 12 
months).  Accounting for the drop out rate of 10%, a total of 32 
patients will be enrolled on the study.  
Analysis of primary endpoint  
The GRFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier estimator and 
plotted with a 95% confidence band. An event f or this outcome is 
defined as grade III -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  9 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /[ADDRESS_592909] follow- up. The 12- month GRFS 
will be compared to the prespecified historical control value of 20% 
using a one- sided z-test. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
Demographic and other baseline data , such as disease 
characteristics, as well as outcome measures , will be presented 
overall and separately for URD and MRD patients. Categorical  data, 
such as gender, race, etc., will be presented by [CONTACT_45970]. Descriptive summary statistics (e.g. , frequency, mean, 
median, range and standard deviation) will be used to present 
numeric data.  
Time -to-event outcomes with and without competing risks will be 
analyzed using Kaplan- Meier and Nelson- Aalen estimates, 
respectively, and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Binary outcomes will be analyzed using proportions with 95% confidence 
intervals.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), a curative therapy for hematologic 
malignancies, acts by [CONTACT_463078]-versus- tumor effects against the malignancy. 
Unfortunately, these immune responses can also be directed toward normal host tissues, resulting in acute graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) . 
1 GVHD is classified as either acute or 
chronic GVHD , based on clinical characteristics . 2 According to the clinical definitions, classic 
acute GVHD (aGVHD) develops within 100 days posttransplant with distinctive clinical features in the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or liver. However, manifestations of aGVHD can reoccur, persist, or present after Day 100 posttransplant and is then classified as recurrent, persistent or 
late onset aGVHD. Classical chronic GVHD is not limited to a specific organ system and can 
present at any time after transplantation. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD is based on consensus criteria for each organ system involved. While some clinical features are diagnostic (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans and sclerotic features of the skin), other manifestations require additional clinical and/or histological criteria to be fulfilled. Some patients may also present as 
an overlap syndrome with clinical features of both acute and chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Scoring systems have been developed to grade the severity of aGVHD , based on the involvement of 
skin, GI tract and liver: Glucksberg scale (grading aGVHD from I to IV) is most widely used 
3 
(see Appendix A). Importantly, aGVHD, although T- cell dependent, is known to be mediated, at 
least in part, by [CONTACT_15457] . [ADDRESS_592924] step is activation of the innate immune system; this results in a state of 
systemic inflammation prior to the introduction of donor T cells. The chemotherapy and/or radiation used in the conditioning therapy invoke tissue damage with release of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL- 1, TNF -α, IFN -γ and IL -6. These cytokines perpetuate GVHD through direct 
cytotoxic effects on host tissues , 
9-11 activation and/or priming of immune effector cells 12 and 
differentiation of proinflammatory and pathogenic alloantigen- specific T cell populations (i.e. , 
TH1 and TH17 cells) from naïve T cell precursors . 4,13,14 Damage to the GI barrier allows 
increased translocation of microorganisms from the gut microbiome, with subsequent increased levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide, as well as molecules with pathogen- and damage -
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMP s). 
15 Consequently, antigen- presenting cells 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  18 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  (APC) secrete proinflammatory cytokines and present host , as well as pathogen peptides on 
their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. A reduction of pretransplant 
inflammation (e.g., using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), reduction of gut microbiome levels) and the presence of genetic factors associated with reduced inflammatory responses are associated with a reduced risk of GVHD and transplant -related mortality (TRM) . 
16-[ADDRESS_592925] APC in a proinflammatory context. Stimulation of specific T helper cell subsets is thought to be important for the initiation of later cytotoxic T -cell mediated tissue damage . 
7,8 Th1 cells release IFN -γ and express the 
transcription factors STAT4 and STAT1/T -bet. 19,[ADDRESS_592926] . 11 Th2 cells characterized by 
[CONTACT_463079] -3 and secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines IL -4, 
IL-10, and IL -13 21 also may play a role in GVHD pathogenesis . 11,22,23 Th17 cells are 
characterized by [CONTACT_463080]γt and IL -17 secretion, 24 and are 
thought to be important for aGVHD severity 25 and early transplant -related severe lung injury . 26 
A majority o f early posttransplant circulating TCRαβ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells release IL -6 at 
relatively high levels together with classical proinflammatory cytokines , such as IFN -γ and

  Version Date: 09/19 /[ADDRESS_592928] a proinflammatory (M1) phenotype that further 
increases tissue damage through the release of oxidants and proinflammatory cytokines , 
including TNF- α and IL-6. 33,34 
 A combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus (Tac) or cyclosporine (CSP)) and 
methotrexate (MTX) has been an accepted standard for prevention of GVHD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_294792], the incidence of grade II –IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) is 35  to 50% 
35 and the rate of 
chronic GVHD is 40 to 60%. The occurrence of GVHD after alloHCT results in increased 
transplant -related mortality (TRM), which also affects overall survival (OS) 36. The risk increases 
with unrelated or partially HLA- matched donors due to the greater genetic disparity between 
donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Thus, new therapeutic treatment strategies are needed for prevention of 
acute, as well as chronic GVHD.  
 1.2 Interleukin-6 
IL-6, a glyco sylated protein with a molecular weight of 21 -28 kDa,
37 is a pleiotropic cytokine that 
is produced by a variety of cell types, including T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells,  
macrophages, monocytes and keratinocytes . 38 Macrophages and monocytes appear to be the 
main sources of IL- 6 during acute inflammation, while T cells seem to be a major contributor 
during chronic inflammation. 39 The systemic (serum/plasma) levels usually range from 1.8 to 14 
pg/ml in healthy individuals . 40,41 During inflammation, a more than 105- fold increase can be 
observed, often correlating with disease sev erity. 42 IL-6 is essential for maturation, proliferation, 
differentiation and maintenance of B cells/plasma cells and several proinflammatory T- cell 
subsets.  
 With respect to GVHD biology, IL -6 sits at the crossroads where the fate of naïve T cells to 
become proinflammatory T cells or Tregs is determined. In the presence of IL- 6 and 
transforming growth factor -
β (TGF -β), naïve T cells differentiate into TH17 cells, whereas in its 
absence, Tregs are induced. 43,[ADDRESS_592929], IL- 6 has important functions in GVHD target organs, and there 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  20 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  may, therefore, be a risk of combined injury during GVHD (e.g., GVHD -induced immunologic 
damage, pharmacologic toxicity and IL -6 inhibition). Finally, IL -6, together with TNF- α released 
from macrophages , has been reported to directly/independently contribute to tissue damage in 
GVHD. [ADDRESS_592930] demonstrated for hematopoiesis, liver cells, GI mucosa and muscle cells. Impaired IL- 6 
function in these organs is associated with reduced regeneration after injury, and IL -6 
dysregulation during chronic inflammation can contribute to organ dysfunction.  
 
Signaling through IL- 6 occurs by [CONTACT_463085] a low -affinity IL -6 receptor (IL- 6R). 51 IL-6R exists 
both in a membrane- bound (mIL -6R) and a soluble form (sIL- 6R). The binding of IL- 6 to IL- 6R 
induces homodimerization of gp130 cell membrane protein for intra-cellular signal transduction.
52 mIL-6R is only expressed by a limited number of cell types, including 
hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells (neutrophils, naïve T cells, macrophages) and a subset of intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. IL- 6R signaling can be initiated in these cells through the membr ane-
associated complex of IL -6, IL-6R and gp130. This is called classical signaling and is often 
associated with tissue regeneration and anti -inflammatory effects . 
2,52 IL-6R can also be shed 
from the membrane, generating a soluble form of the receptor , which can bind IL- 6 and induce 
an intracellular response in any tissue expressing gp130 through a process called trans -
signaling. 53,54 Thus, cells that do not express the IL- 6R themselves can be IL- 6 responsive and 
this seems important for many of the proinflammatory effects of IL-6. 37 sIL-6R is mainly formed 
through cleavage of mIL -6R by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) [ADDRESS_592931], which is capable of mediating GVHD . 37,55 
 
Gp130 is noncovalently associated with the Janus kinases (JAKs) JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2. 
Following receptor ligation, the JAKs are auto -phosphorylated, and they also phosphorylate 
gp130. This phosphorylation provides docking sites for phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3 and 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  21 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  the tyrosine phosphatase SHP -2. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimerizes and is translocated to the 
nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor . 56 SHP-2 activates the RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK 
pathway, whereas gp130 activation also leads to activation of the PI3K -AKT pathway together 
with the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Most of the IL -6 effects seem to be STAT3- mediated. 
STAT3 is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism; it induces expression of SOCS 
proteins and activation of the SHP- 2 phosphatase. SOCS3 then binds with high affinity to the 
same phosphorylated binding site on gp130 as JAK1/2 and thereby [CONTACT_463086]. IL- 6 signaling is also inhibited by [CONTACT_463087]130 prevents further signaling.

demonstrated that local IL- [ADDRESS_592935] has been investigated in several mouse models (i.e., STAT3- knockout mice) and in 
vitro models. Emerging evidence also suggests that activation of STATs in B cells is also 
important for GVHD .

systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and multicentric Castleman’s disease. 68,69 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] I/II

two-week basis . 70 Tocilizumab is generally well tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; 
the most commonly reported side effects being dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (21– 25%), increased liver 
transaminases (5– 6%) and transient decreases in neutrophil counts . 71-[ADDRESS_592939] cases, second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Five patients had grade 
IV GVHD (four GI and one skin), while one patient  had grade II GI and one had grade III liver 
GVHD. One of these patients died early after tocilizumab  administration and was not evaluable, 
one patient did not respond, three patients were classified as partial responders, and two patients were considered complete responders. In one of the patients with partial response, tocilizumab  was discontinued for the possibility of causing worsening of preexisting 
hyperbilirubinemia. Infections were responsible for the major adverse events associated with 
tocilizumab , with a total of [ADDRESS_592940] of 
tocilizumab  in patients with steroid- refractory aGVHD, including seven patients with grade IV 
and two with grade III. Two patients were classified as complete responders, and two patients  
had mixed response with persistence of severe aGVHD in one organ but resolution in other 
organs, and four patients did not respond. In this series, four  patients had infectious events with 
two deaths being reported, but no liver toxicity was observed.  1.4.2 Tocilizumab and GVHD prophylaxis  
A phase I/II study conducted by [CONTACT_463089]. assessed if tocilizumab  could attenuate the 
incidence of acute GVHD

  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  total body irradiation (TBI) -based myeloablative (MAC) or RIC using unrelated or sibling donors. 
One intravenous (IV) dose of tocilizumab  (8 mg/kg, capped at 800 mg, over 60 mins’ infusion) 
was given the day before alloHCT along with standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine [5 
mg/kg per day on Day s –1 to +1, then 3 mg/kg per day to maintain therapeutic levels (trough 
levels of 140–300 ng/mL) for 100 days plus methotrexate [15 mg/m²  on Day 1, then 10 mg/m² 
on Days 3, 6 and 11]). The primary endpoint was incidence of grade 2– [ADDRESS_592942], but not treated with tocilizumab . A total of 
48 patients receiving CSP+MTX as GVHD prophylaxis were enrolled into the study. The incidence of grade II –IV aGVHD in patients treated with tocilizumab  at Day 100 was 12% (95CI 
5–24), and the incidence of grade III –IV aGVHD was 4% (1 –13). Grade II –IV aGVHD involving 
the skin developed in five (10%) patients of [ADDRESS_592943] in four 
(8%) patients; there were no reported cases involving the liver. Low incidences of grade II –IV 
aGVHD were noted in patients receiving both TBI -based MAC (12% [95% CI 2–34) and 
fludarabine and melphalan RIC (12% [4– 27]). There were  no reports of graft failure and immune 
reconstitution was preserved in tocilizumab  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], but with suppression of known 
pathogenic STAT3- dependent pathways. The addition of tocilizumab  appeared generally safe 
with no increase in graft rejections, time to neutrophil engraftment, chimerism posttransplant, or early relapse compared with historical controls. Only three patients experienced severe liver 
toxicity during the first month after transplantation. This study showed that inhibition of IL -[ADDRESS_592944] patients using 
matched related/unrelated donor and receiving Tac/MTX for GVHD prophylaxis . 77 Tocilizumab 
was administered IV as a single dose of 8 mg/kg the day before alloHCT. A total of 35 patients 
were enrolled in the study and all received busulfan- based conditioning (Flu/BU4, Flu/BU2 or 
BU/CY). The majority of patients (83%) received peripheral blood grafts. The primary endpoint 
is grade II –IV GVHD during the first 180 days posttransplant. The median follow -up of surviving 
patients was 12 months (range 5– 16). The incidence of grades II –IV and III –IV aGVHD at D ay 
100 was 14 % (95CI 5– 30%) and 3% (95CI 0 –11%), respectively. In the first [ADDRESS_592945] and only one patient developed 
grade IV aGVHD of skin. Five patients died from relapse between 140  to 270 days 
posttransplant, while five patients died as a result of TRM (GVHD, n=2; infection, n=2; IPS 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  25 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  (n=1). TRM was 9% (95CI 2– 20%) and relapse was 17% (95CI 7– 31%) at six months. In 
addition, we performed a matched (1:4) case- control analysis with contemporary controls  
(n=130)  from the Center for International Blood and Marrow  Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 
from 2000  to 2014 that were identified according to the same eligibility criteria for the trial except 
for the use of Tac/MTX as GVHD prophylaxis and were matched for age, Karnofsky 
Performance Score (KPS), disease and donor type. The incidence of grades II –IV aGVHD at 
Day +180 was significantly lower in the tocilizumab /Tac/MTX cohort when compared with  the 
CIBMTR Tac/MTX control population (17 % vs. 4 5%, P=0.001 ). Corresponding probabilities of 
grade II –IV aGVHD -free survival at six months, which was the primary objective of the study, 
were 69% and 4 2% (P=0.[ADDRESS_592946]). There w ere no differences in relapse, 
TRM, DFS or OS at six  months between the two groups. These two prospective studies thus 
show that tocilizumab  has promising activity in preventing aGVHD, particularly lower GI tract 
GVHD and late onset aGVHD.  
 1.5 Success of allogeneic transplant: relapse versus non- relapse m ortality  
AlloHCT used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies is associated with two main risk 
factors for poor outcomes: transplantation- related mortality (also referred to as NRM) and 
mortality from disease relapse (relapse -related mortality). Effo rts to mitigate one cause of 
mortality have often compromised the other. For example, efforts to reduce GVHD risk by T- cell 
depletion of the allograft can lower transplantation -related morbidity/mortality, but can also 
increase relapse risk .

1.6 Studies of the Microbiome in Transplant  Patients  
The microbiome, consisting of a varied community of microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, microeukaryotes, and sometimes multicellular parasites), exists in niches across the human 
body. The  skin, lung,  nares,  vagina,  and gastrointestinal tract are among  the most  heavily  
colonized,  with the largest number of microorganisms inhabiting the colonic lumen. While the 
majority  of the over trillion  organisms  that live within a healthy human colon are nonpathogenic 
members of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, alterations in the balance of these microorganisms have been associated with adverse outcomes ranging from GVHD and infection to relapse post -HCT. 
[ADDRESS_592950] outcomes has been investigated for decades – and has informed the 
still controversial practices of infection prophylaxis, gut decontamination, the “neutropenic diet,” 
and isolation of patients in laminar air flow rooms. Single- institution studies have demonstrated 
that low microbial diversity in the stool after allogeneic HCT is associated with poor survival . 83,[ADDRESS_592951] recently, relapse . 85-87 While these findings are compelling, the  
generalizability  of these  proposed microbial  biomarkers  is unclear.  This is particularly important 
as there is known geographic variation of the intestinal microbiome and practice variability  in 
antibiotic  use for prophylaxis  and treatment  from institution  to institution,  in part due to different  
antibiograms.  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  27 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Novel methods in microbiome research are likely to facilitate translational breakthroughs – these 
methods allow (1) detailed taxonomic classification of microorganisms at the strain level, (2) 
metabolic characterization of the small molecules and proteins that a microbial community makes, (3) measurement of microbial genomic evolution in clinical time courses, and (4) culturing of previously fastidious organisms from the microbiome for in vitro investigation and 
cultivation as potential therapeutic live bacterial clinical interventions. Given recent reports 
suggesting that alterations in the microbiome can impact the efficacy of immunologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is imperative that the link between the microbiome and transplant  outcomes is 
investigated.

3.1.1 Number  of Subjects  
Thirty -two (32) patients.  
 
3.2 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint of this trial is GRFS. An event for this outcome is defined as grade III –IV 
acute GVHD, systemic therapy requiring chronic GVHD, relapse or death. Patients who are 
alive without GVHD will be censored at the last follow- up.  
 
3.3 S econdary  Endpoint(s)  
3.3.1 Acute GVHD  
Cumulative incidences of grades II –IV and III –IV acute GVHD will be determined at Day  +100

onset of grade II –IV acute GVHD and time to development of the highest grade until Day +[ADDRESS_592957]. Neutrophil recovery or engraftment is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥500/mm
[ADDRESS_592958] of 
the three days will be designated the day of neutrophil engraftment. The competing event is 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  30 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /[ADDRESS_592959] day of a sustained 
platelet count >20,000/mm3 for three  days with no platelet transfusion in the preceding seven 
days . The fir st day of sustained platelet count above these thresholds will be designated the day 
of platelet engraftment.  
 
3.3.4 Graft  Failure 
Graft failure will be assessed as a secondary endpoint, including primary and secondary graft 
failure. Primary graft failure is defined as no neutrophil recovery to > 500 cells/μL by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_592960]. Secondary graft failure will be assessed according to neutrophil count after initial 
hematologic recovery. Secondary graft failure is defined as initial neutrophil engraftment followed by [CONTACT_463091] <500 cells/μL, unresponsive to 
growth factor therapy, but cannot be explained by [CONTACT_463092].  
 3.3.5 Nonrelapse Mortality (NRM)  
NRM is defined as death after alloHCT without relapse. The cumulative incidence of NRM will be estimated at Day  +[ADDRESS_592961]. An event for this endpoint is death 
without evidence of disease progression or relapse. Disease progression or relapse will be considered a competing event.  
 3.3.6  Disease  Relapse or Progression  
Relapse is defined by [CONTACT_463093], cytogenetic or radiologic evidence of the pretransplant hematologic malignancy. Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, progressive or relapsed disease, including the withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy or donor 
lymphocyte infusion, will be considered evidence of relapse/progression. NRM will be 
considered a competing event.  
 3.3.7  Progression- Free Survival  
The event for this endpoint is relapse/progression or death. The time to this event is measured 
from transplant to death or relapse/progression, whichever comes first. Patients who are alive and disease- free will be censored at last follow -up.

 3.3.10  Donor  Cell Chimerism  
Chimerism will be evaluated using sorted whole blood in CD3+ and CD33+ fractions. Mixed chimerism is defined as the presence of donor cells, as a proportion of total cells to be >5% and <95%. Full donor chimerism is defined as ≥95% of donor cells. Donor cells of ≤5% will be considered as graft rejection. Donor cell chimerism will be assessed for all patients at Day  +28 , 
and Day +100 for both CD3+ and CD33+ fractions. The proportion of patients with each level of 
chimerism listed above will be described. CD3+ donor cell chimerism will be used to define the donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_180838].  
 3.3.11  Immune Reconstitution  
Quantitative assessments of peripheral blood CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be done through flow cytometric analysis at Day s +28, + 100, +180, and +365. 
 3.3.12 Patient -Reported  Quality of L ife (PR-QoL)  Endpoints  
The QoL endpoints of this study are depressive symptoms, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain at baseline, Day +28, Day +100, Day +180, and D ay +[ADDRESS_592965] -transplant.  
• Depression:  This will be addressed through the General Depression subscale of the 
IDAS and includes 20 questions with a scoring range of 20- 100 (mean in community 
dwelling adult of 44.[ADDRESS_592966] deviation of 14.75).18 
• Anxiety:  Anxiety will be assessed using two subscale items of the IDAS including panic 
(health population mean = 12.58, SD = 5.26) and traumatic intrusions (healthy population mean = 7.60, SD = 4.20).
18  
• Fatigue:  The FSI will be utilized to assess fatigue; a score of [ADDRESS_592967] week (average of items 1 -3; FSI Composite) indicates 
clinically mea ningful fatigue.19, 20 The FSI can also be evaluated using the average rating 
of the degree to which fatigue interfered with some general activities (0- 10; FSI 
Interference); participants’ ratings of the number of days in the past week they felt fatigued ( 0-7; FSI Days); and participants’ rating of what percent of each day in the past 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  32 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  week, on average, they felt fatigued (0 -100; FSI Percent).20 Individuals scoring at or 
above the cutoff also report significantly greater scores on these other subscales.  
• Sleep: Sleep will be assessed using the PSQI, with a score of >5 considered disturbed 
sleep as adjusted for cancer populations.21, 22 
• Pain:  The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_381275]- related interference in function.23, 
24 BPI [INVESTIGATOR_381276] 0- 40 (first four items), and the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_463056] a mean of the last 7 items (5a- 5g) with a range of 0- 10. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_592968] protocols  91. Resultant sequencing data will be 
quality  filtered,  adapter  sequences  will be trimmed, and sequences  will be analyzed using the 
QIIME pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] 92. Shannon diversity will be calculated 93. 
 
Guidelines for reporting of Depression and/or Suicidal Ideation:  
Should the patient endorse any thoughts of suicidality or self harm per the IDAS, the study co-
investigator for this portion of the ancillary testing ([CONTACT_381308]) will contact [CONTACT_463094]. Should completion of the study surveys 
prompt participants to want treatment for any of the other symptoms, participants will be offered 
a referral for appropriate care through the Quality of Life Center at the Froedtert Cancer Center.

5.1.1 Required  Preregistration Screening Tests and Procedures  
The study -specific assessments are detailed in this section and outlined in the Study Calendar . 
A written, signed informed consent form (ICF) must be obtained before any study -specific 
assessments are initiated. A signed ICF copy will be given to the subject and a copy will be filed 
in the medical record. The original will be kept on file with the study records.  
All patients who are consented will be registered in OnCore®, the MCW Cancer Center Clinical 
Trial Management System. The system is password protected and meets HIPAA requirements.  
 5.1.2 Registration Process 
Patients will be approached for this study after the decision to proceed with transplant is made 
and a suitable HLA- matched donor is identified. Transplant physicians will evaluate the patient 
eligibility onto this study. All source documents that support eligibility include a signed informed consent/HIPAA and signed eligibility checklist. These must be available for review and 
verification.   
At the point of registration, the study staff will register the patient in the electronic database (where applicable), including demographic, consent and on- study information. The patient will 
be assigned a unique sequence number for the study.

biopsy confirmation in at least one involved organ, but would be preferred. When more than one organ is involved, biopsy confirmation of all involved organs is recommended but not necessary. 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  38 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  With liver -only GVHD, biopsy confirmation is strongly recommended. Acute GVHD will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_463095] (Appendix 2) 95 and chronic GVHD diagnosis and grading will 
be according to NIH Criteria 96,97. Please see Appendix 2.  
Independent GVHD adjudication is mandated in the study. Acute and chronic GVHD will be 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_463096] (FRC) -appointed review panel. 
Protocol PIs will be blinded to the adjudication panel and will not be permitted to gr ade or modify 
GVHD assessments. GVHD case report forms (CRFs) will be completed by [CONTACT_463097]/NPs/APPs in real time , as indicated in study calendar. FRC adjudication panel will grade 
GVHD, using a calendar -driven approach ( Days +100 and +180 for aGVHD and Days +180 and 
+365 for chronic GvHD).  
 5.3.3 Clinical Grading of Chronic GVHD (Appendix)  
 
• None. 
• Mild chronic GVHD involves only one or two  organs or sites (except the lung: see 
below ), with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all 
affected organs or sites) . 
• Moderate chronic GVHD involves: (1) at least one  organ or site with clinically significant 
but no major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) three or 
more organs or sites with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.  
• Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by [CONTACT_190963] (score of 3 in any organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.  
• Presence of limited or extensive chronic GVHD will be also be recorded.  
 
5.4 Study  Withdraw al Proc edures  
5.4.1 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for or until:  
 Disease progression. 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the inv estigator’s judgment.  
 Inter-current illness that prevents further treatment administration.

7  ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS  AND REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS 
7.1 Definitions  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  43 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
An AE is defined as any abnormal laboratory value(s) or test result(s), even when they do not 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy’, as per 21 CFR 312.32(a). The investigator 
and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related to adverse event reporting. This information may be found on the 
Human Research Protection Program 
website .  
 Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Death.  Results in death.  
• Life threatening . Is life threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event . It does not refer to an event which hypothetic ally might 
have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577]. 
• Disability/incapacity. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is d efined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions).  
• Medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered ser ious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent . Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent .  
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous . The 
general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medic al significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache) . This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  44 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  criteria described above and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or ability to function. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered 
serious . For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered 
Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious . Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations . 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_592996] or Other (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961])  
The investigator and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related to unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. This information may be found 
on the Human Research Protection Program website

7.1.3 AE  Attribution and Grading  
Adver se Event Grading  
Grade  Description  
0 No AE (or within normal limits).  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention (e.g., 
packing cautery) indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48622]; disabling; limiting s elf-care ADL.  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE  
 
 Adverse Event Attribution 
Attribution is an assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical intervention.  
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  45 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to investigational 
agent/intervention  Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related  to the 
intervention  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  to the 
intervention  
Related to investigational 
agent/intervention  Possible  The AE may be related  to the 
intervention  
Probable  The AE is likely related  to the 
intervention  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to the 
intervention  
 
Relationship Assessment:  In- Depth Definitions 
For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the subject will determine the 
adverse event’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below : 
Definitely Related: There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of  a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs 
within a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Possibly Related : There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, 
other concomitant events). Although an adverse drug event may rate only as “possibly related” 
soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
Unlikely : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  46 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Unrelated : The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence 
exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].

Expedited Reporting Procedures for SAEs , SARs,  UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961] s and DLTs . 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  49 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator, also referred to as the 
sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to any 
regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s IRB.  
 
Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator, 
according to the CTCAE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event .  
 The investigator will assess all adverse events and determine reporting requirements to the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center ( MCWCC) DSMC and MCW IRB . 
 
Only grade 1 and 2 adverse events  related to the study drug and all grade 3,  4 and 5 adverse 
events  regardless of attribution  will be entered into OnCore®. 
 Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSMC)  
Regardless of the causality, all unexpected grade 3, and all grade 4, and [ADDRESS_593002] be reported to the MCWCC 
DSMC within five  calendar days of study staff’s knowledge.  
Report Method:  The investigator will use email to report SAEs  and applicable AE  to the DSMC.

  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  8  PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
8.1  Actemra® (Tocilizumab ) 
8.1.[ADDRESS_593003] Description 
Single -use vials containing tocilizumab , preservative free, sterile concentrate solutions (20 mg/ml) for IV 
infusion are available in the following sizes:  80 mg, 200  mg and 400 mg.  The solution is colorless to pale 
yellow with a pH of approximately 6.5.   
Classification:   Immunomodulatory . 
Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized interleukin- 6 receptor inhibiting monoclonal antibody. Tocilizumab  
binds to both soluble and membrane bound IL -6 receptors and results in the blockade of interleukin- 6 
signaling through these receptors.  
Pharmacokinetics :   
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that tocilizumab  undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation. In 
rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 4 and 8 mg/kg every four weeks, the central volume of distribution was 
3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L with a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L . 
Tocilizumab dosed at 8 mg/kg resulted in a mean steady state area under the curve (AUC), minimum 
concentration (Cmin) and a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 35 + 15 mg∙hr/ml, 9.74 + 10.5 mcg/ml and 183 
+ 85.6 mcg/ml respectively . Tocilizumab  AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increasing body weight with an  
86% higher exposure in patients greater than 100 kg. As a result, doses exceeding 800 mg (max dosing weight 
100 kg) per infusion are not recommended.  
 
The total clearance of tocilizumab  is concentration dependent and is represented by [CONTACT_463100] . Upon saturation of the nonlinear clearance pathway, the main 
determining factor is linear clearance. The reported linear clearance in the pharmacokinetic studies  is estimated 
to be 12.5 mL/h. The concentration dependent half -life is up to 11 days for the 4 mg/kg dose and up to 13 days 
for the 8 mg/kg dose every four weeks at steady state.  
 
Special populations. Pharmacokinetic analysis in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients did not demonstrate a 
change in kinetics based  on age, gender or race. The effects of renal and hepatic impairment have not been 
assessed.  
 Contraindications:  
Side Effects:   Complete and updated adverse event information is available in the Investigational Drug 
Brochure and/or product package insert.  
Tocilizumab side effects include:

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.0 Study Populations  
The Full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all eligible patients enrolled in the study. This population will be used 
for the efficacy analyses.  
The Safety set (SS) will consist of all eligible patients enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of 
the study medication.  
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  54 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  9.1 Study  Endpoints  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary analysis will be performed on the FAS population using the intention- to-treat principle including all 
patients enrolled in the trial. The GRFS will be estimated, using the Kaplan -Meier estimator and plotted with a 
95% confidence band . An event for this outcome is defined as grade III –IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD 
requiring systemic therapy, relapse or death. Patients who are alive without GVHD will be censored at the last 
follow- up. The 12- month GRFS will be compared to the prespecified historical control value of 20% , using a 
one-sided z -test. 
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Demographic and other baseline data, such as disease characteristics, as well as outcome measures , will be 
presented overall and separately for URD and MRD patients. Categorical data, such as gender, race, etc., will be presented by [CONTACT_22977]. Descriptive summary statistics (e.g. , frequency, mean, 
median, range and standard deviation) will be used to present numeric data.  
Time -to-event outcomes with and without competing risks will be analyzed, using Kaplan- Meier and Nelson-
Aalen estimates, respectively, and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Binary outcomes will be analyzed, using proportions with 95% confidence intervals. 
Effect of GVHD prophylaxis on microbiome diversity: Difference in the level of microbiome diversity detected at pre - and post -transplant . Microbiome diversity will be compared at each time point using Mann- Whitney 
tests. Association of pre-transplant  microbiome diversity with development of aGVHD, cGVHD, and overall 
survival (corrected for GVHD  prophylaxis): This analysis will use the pre -transplant  stool microbiome cohort; 
diversity will be grouped by [CONTACT_180899] a more appropriate classification is identified in the analysis, that may be used instead. Acute GVHD (grade 2 -4 or 3 -4) and chronic GVHD (any or moderate- severe) will be described 
in each group using cumulative incidence with death or relapse as a competing event, and compared between groups using Gray’s test. Overall survival will be described using the Kapl an-Meier estimator and compared 
between groups using the log- rank test. Multivariate models will be constructed in a similar manner as for the 
primary endpoint using Fine and Gray models for aGVHD and cGVHD, and using Cox models for OS.  
 Missing data  
Patients who are lost to follow -up will be censored at the day of the last contact [CONTACT_463102] (for example, last day known alive for overall survival, and last day known alive without relapse or GVHD for GRFS).  
 
 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  55 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  9.2 Study  Design  
The study is designed as a phase II, open- label, single- center trial to evaluate a novel GVHD prophylaxis 
regimen, Tac/MTX/ tocilizumab . The primary endpoint of the study is GRFS, GVHD/ relapse- free surviva l at 12 
months posttransplant.  
 
9.3 Accrual  Rate 
It is estimated that 18 months of accrual will be adequate to enroll the targeted sample size.  
9.4 Sample  Size Justification  
The sample size was selected to achieve 80% power to detect an increase in GRFS at 12 months to 40% 
compared with an historical control value of 20% at a one- sided 5% significance level. Based on asymptotic z -
test for proportions, 29 patients with a known outcome are needed (i .e., known GVHD, relapse or death status 
at 12 months).  We will recruit 32 subjects to allow for approximately 10% loss to follow -up by [ADDRESS_593009] for 100 -day overall mortality. Based on program 
experience, a 100 -day mortality rate <10% is expected. The monitoring boundary was selected to provide a 
10% probability of declaring excessive mortality , if the true probability is 10%. The following table shows the 
number of 100- day mortality events that would trigger a safety review depending on the number of evaluable 
patients . For the purposes of the safety monitoring patients in the safety set who are alive with at least [ADDRESS_593010] died within 100 days are considered evaluable.

Prior to obtaining approval, the protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_463106] . The initial protocol and all protocol amendments must 
be approved by [CONTACT_14226].  
 
Informed Consent Process 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the subjects and their families. Consent forms describing in detail the study 
interventions/ products, study procedures  and risks are given to the subject and written documentation of 
informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study product.  
Consent forms will be IRB approved and the subject (and Legally Authorized Representative, if necessary ) will 
be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the 
research study to the subject and answer  any questions that may arise. In accordance with [ADDRESS_593017] will sign and date the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  
A witness should only sign when required, per FH/MCW IRB policy. If a witness signs the document when not required, the study staff should document in the legal medical record (or note to file) the relationship to the patient and why a witness signed. (i.e. , “Although not required, the subject’s spouse was present during the 
consenting process and signed as the witness.” Or “Although not required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182169] a witness.”) 
The subjects will  have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to 
agreeing to participate. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial .  
A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. The rights and welfare 
of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_34693].  If there are changes to the consent form, all 
revisions will be reviewed with study subject at the next appropriate opportunity. Patients that require reconsenting will be defined in the IRB approved amendment submission. The process for obtaining informed 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  59 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  consent will again be performed. Study subjects will not be reconsented for continuing reviews.  The MCWCC 
CTO will follow the MCW/FH IRB’s policy for subjects  who demonstrate limited English proficiency or limited 
literacy .  
After the subject’s visit in which the consent is signed, it is documented in the clinic chart that the consent has 
been signed and that all questions have been answered to the subject’s satisfaction after adequate time for 
review of the consent. It is also documented that a copy of the consent is given to the subject. The original 
consent is kept with the subject’s study file, and a copy of the consent is sent to the OCRICC office, which  will 
then submit to HIM a copy of the signed consent to be scanned into EPIC, the legal medical record.  
 11.[ADDRESS_593018] Confidentiality  and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_456] -investigator, participating investigators, and any 
staff, [and the sponsor(s) and their agents]. This confidentiality includes the clinical information relating to participating subjects, as well as any genetic or biological testing.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. 
No information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior 
written approval of the principal investigator . 
The conditions for maintaining confidentiality of the subjects’ records are required for the life of the data. 
These rules apply equally to any and all MCWCC projects.  
One risk of taking part in a research study is that more people will handle the personal health information collected for this study. The study team will make every effort to protect the information and keep it confidential, but it is possible that an unauthorized person might see it. Depending on the kind of information being collected, it might be used in a way that could embarrass the subject or affect his/her ability to get insurance.  
While data are being collected and after all data have been collected but are still in the process of being 
analyzed, the subject’s data/PHI are  stored in the locked Clinical Research office in the Clinical Trials Office. 
Databases in which the study subject information is stored and accessed are password protected, allowing for limited access by [CONTACT_182201]. Data/PHI kept in the Case Report Forms contain the study 
identifiers, subject initials, date of birth and date of service.

ensure that  the consent document accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done 
and its associated risks and benefits.  
 11.6.2 Protection  of Privacy 
As noted, patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health inform ation generated from 
this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked to sign informed consent documents. The original signed document will become part of the patient’s medical records, and each 
patient will receive a copy of the signed document.

Sample Information Management for Microbiota Studies   
 
Each stool sample will be given a unique identifier.   
 
For example:  
Patient 0001 and has sample A and B. Patient 0002 has sample A.   
Sample IDs: MCW_0001- A, MCW_0001- B, MCW_0002- A  
  
As we acquire, aliquot, and store samples, we will not to try to squeeze additional information 
(metadata), such as date or day of collection or patient initials into the sample ID.  Such 
additional information becomes very difficult to deal with later and statistical software programs 
can’t deal with them well. Please don’t name [CONTACT_463115] “Pt 002 Week 3” or “Pt 002 pre-
transplant” or “Pt JFK (Day - 2)”.  If a patient has more than one transplant, day and week 
designations are problematic. Another problem with this sort of a sample- naming scheme leads 
to discrepancies between the target time point (e.g. day 30) and the actual timepoint collected 
(e.g. day 32)  
  
The following approach is recommended:   
Keep the names of samples simple and then keep a separate table of sample metadata, as below:

Stool Sample Collection, Processing, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_463072]:  
                   Inpatient: twice weekly (e.g. Mondays  and Thursdays) – once pre- transplant and 
weekly (+/ - 2 days) post -transplant until after neutrophil engraftment .  
 
Tube Preparation  
     Please aliquot into sturdy tubes that can withstand cold temperatures2. Standard urine- or 
sputum -collection cups crack at freezing temperatures and should not be used.   
     If labeling tubes by [CONTACT_35681], please use an alcohol -proof marker3. Sharpie, etc. will dissolve in 
the ethanol used during DNA extraction.   
     If using printed labels, please ensure that they will not peel, crack, or smear at freezing 
temperatures4, 5.  
  
Aliquoting  
     Aliquoting should be done as soon as possible after sample is received.  
     For solid or semi -solid samples, use a clean disposable spatula6 to transfer stool into 
cryovials2.  
o  Prepare 5 aliquots of ~0.5 mL each.  
o  For more liquid samples, can transfer up to 1 mL material.  
     For liquid samples, use transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462]7 to prepare 1.5 mL aliquots of material.  
     All aliquots should be stored at -80 until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

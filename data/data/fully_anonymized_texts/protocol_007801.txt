Protocol Body
1.0 Objectives
To determine the CR rate at 1 year  of hyper-CVAD plus liposomal vincristine (Marqibo) in newly 
diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
To determine CR duration, toxicity and overall survival of hyper CVAD with liposomal vincristine 
(Marqibo) in newly-diagnosed ALL.
2.0 Background
Marqibo has been FDA approved for patients with second or greater relapsed ALL.
2.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Hyper-CVAD 
Following the treatment patterns in childhood ALL, results of intensive chemotherapy in 
adult ALL have improved outcome.1-6 With hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotrexate and 
cytarabine), a dose-intensive regimen developed at MD Anderson, the results were 
encouraging.7,8 From 1992 until 2000, 288 patients were treated. Their median age was 40 
years; 59 patients (20%) were 60 years or older; 17% had Ph-positive ALL; 13% had T-cell 
ALL. The CR rate was 92%; induction mortality was 5%. The 5-year CR and survival rates were 38%. Patients with Ph-positive ALL have an improved outcome with hyper-CVAD + 
imatinib.[ADDRESS_741258] a better outcome with hyper-CVAD + 
rituximab.[ADDRESS_741259] included the use of the protected environment in patients aged >/= 60 years 
(mortality 16%, now reduced to < 5%), adding rituximab in CD20-positive cases (CD20 positivity associated with worse prognosis), prolonging POMP maintenance therapy to 3 years with intensifications, and reducing CNS prophylaxis to 8 intrathecals for high risk disease. 
2.2 Liposomal Vincristine (Marqibo)
Liposomal Vincristine was designed to reduce the neurotoxicity associated with regular vincristine. Dose-intensity of vincristine has been correlated with increased cure rates with MOPP in Hodgkin's disease. Liposomal Vincristine has produced impressive response 
rates of 45% in aggressive lymphoma salvage.
11 CHOP + Liposomal Vincristine in frontline 
lymphomas produced CR rates of 90%, overall response rates of 100%, and 2-year survival and EFS rates above 90%.
[ADDRESS_741260] shown encouraging response rates of 15% to 30%.13,14 The phase II dose of 
Liposomal Vincristine is 2.25 mg/m2 weekly for up to [ADDRESS_741261] 
regular vincristine with Liposomal Vincristine in the hyper-CMAD regimen to evaluate 
long-term toxicity and efficacy of the new regimen in newly diagnosed ALL.

3.[ADDRESS_741262] drop. Vincristine sulfate induced peripheral neuropathies are generally reversible. 
Other toxicities associated with vincristine sulfate include hyponatremia and the syndrome 
of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), constipation, colicky abdominal pain, and ileus. 
Cranial nerves may be affected. Extravasation of vincristine sulfate can result in painful 
local inflammation. 
3.2 Rationale for use of Liposomal Vincristine (Marqibo) in Cancer Therapy 
Due to the relatively low specificity of the interaction of cytotoxic agents with tumor tissue.  Compared to healthy tissue, severe toxicities are often experienced at doses required to achieve a substantial antitumor response. Investigations over the past two decades have demonstrated that liposomal drug carriers are capable of increasing the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs by [CONTACT_564350]'s pharmacological behavior.
Liposomes do not accumulate in many of the tissues susceptible to vincristine-related 
toxicities. Consequently, liposome-encapsulated vincristine is effectively sequestered from these sites. A murine model of drug extravasation demonstrated that vincristPh-ine-induced 
dermal toxicity was significantly reduced by [CONTACT_91861].
[ADDRESS_741263] suggested that Liposomal Vincristine may be administered safely at doses exceeding those of free vincristine. 
Pharmacokinetic studies in mice indicated that free vincristine given intravenously is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_564329] 0.5 - 2.5% remaining in the blood compartment 1 hour 
after administration. With Liposomal Vincristine, 70% of the drug remained in the circulation after the same time period. 
In murine and human tumor models (L1210 and P388 leukemia, B16/BL6 melanoma and 
human A431 solid tumor xenografts), unencapsulated vincristine had negligible antitumor activity. Liposomal Vincristine in the same tumor models had significantly greater dose-dependent, antitumor activities. The increased antitumor efficacy of Liposomal Vincristine is consistent with liposome-mediated delivery of vincristine to the tumor site and

subsequent sustained release of the drug. 
A comprehensive summary of nonclinical efficacy and safety studies is included in the 
Investigator's Brochure. 
3.3 Clinical Studies with Liposomal Vincristine 
Four clinical trials (one Phase I and three Phase II) have been conducted with Liposomal Vincristine in solid tumors (pancreas, colorectal) and in lymphoma.
The MTD and recommended dose for further Phase II development were 2.0 - 2.4 mg/m
2 
every 2 to 3 weeks. Toxicities were generally non-hematologic: myalgias, peripheral 
neuropathy, constipation, and fever. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that Liposomal Vincristine protects the drug from 
rapid elimination. 
In the Phase II relapsed/refractory lymphoma study (DM97-162), patients with lymphoma 
(intermediate grade, low grade, and transformed lymphoma) were treated with a 1-hour 
infusion of Liposomal Vincristine 2 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks.11 Liposomal Vincristine was 
well tolerated. The overall response rate was 32% (26 responses in 81 evaluable patients). 
In patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma, 46% had a complete or partial response. 
A recent study by [CONTACT_332847]12 at MD Anderson Cancer Center combined CHOP 
substituting Liposomal Vincristine 2 mg/m2 for VCR in newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma. The overall response rate was 100%; the CR rate was above 90%. The 
estimated 2-year survival rate was above 90%, which is extremely encouraging. 
In the original Phase II protocol conducted in lymphoma-leukemia (DM97-162), 16 patients 
with relapsed or refractory ALL were treated with Liposomal Vincristine 2.0 mg/m2 every 2 
weeks.13 Of 13 evaluable patients, one patient with refractory Philadelphia-positive ALL 
achieved CR. A second case with refractory Ph-positive ALL achieved PR. Both had been 
previously treated with hyper-CVAD. Significant reductions in marrow leukemia infiltrates were observed in 4 other patients. 
A Phase I-II trial of liposomal vincristine weekly and pulse dexamethasone in refractory or 
relapsed ALL (and lymphoblastic lymphoma) also showed a response rate of 30% to 40%.14 
The Liposomal Vincristine MTD was 2.25 mg/m2 IV weekly (up to 12 doses). 
3.4 Other drug information of Liposomal Vincristine 
Clinical Formulation

4.9 Patients with medical conditions that compromise their ability to complete the study or 
confound interpretation of study results.
5.0 Treatment Plan
5.1 All patients will be registered through CORE. 
5.2 General Considerations 
 
The hyper-CMAD (odd courses) will alternate with high-dose methotrexate/ara-C 
(even courses) administered on 21 day schedules or later to allow for recovery from myelosuppression or infection; or earlier if count recovery allows.
Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) 6 mg (flat dose) within 72 hours after completion of 

chemotherapy. G-CSF 10 g/kg/day (rounded) until neutrophil recovery to 1 x 109/L or 
higher can be substituted or can be added if neutrophils have not recovered to 1 x 109
/L by [CONTACT_4475] 21.Months of administering early and/or late Intensification maintenance courses may 

vary based  on physician’s clinical judgment and if discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_976].
Next course may be started when granulocytes >/= 1.0 x 109/L and platelets >/= 50 x 
109/L.  These courses (Course 2 and on) may be started  with or without dose 
reduction based on  physician’s clinical judgment  if believed to be in the best interest 
of the patient when ANC <1.0 x 109/L and/or PLTs<50 x 109/L  if discussed with and 
approved by [CONTACT_976].
Rituximab 375 mg/m2 will be given on days 1 and 8 +/- [ADDRESS_741265] 4 courses 
for a total of 8 doses in patients who are CD20-positive (>/= 20% expression by [CONTACT_564352]). Missed doses of rituximab may be given with later courses to complete 8 doses. 
Prophylactic antibiotics will vary based on tolerance and allergy status. Suggestions 

include: 
-- Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. daily (or other quinolone), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
double strength one tablet p.o. twice daily, or other appropriate antibacterial agent. Antibacterial antibiotics should be rotated with each cycle of intensive chemotherapy as feasible. 
-- Voriconazole [ADDRESS_741266] Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) disease will 

receive imatinib 600 mg daily or dasatinib 100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 +/- 5 days of induction (course 1). On all subsequent courses the tyrosine kinase inhibitor will be given daily without interruption (imatinib 600 mg or dasatinib 70 mg). Maintenance therapy will be monthly Liposomal Vincristine and dexamethasone and 
continuous daily imatinib or dasatinib (no 6-MP or MTX).  
Patients identified to have Philadelphia chromosome-like disease [evaluated by 

2008-0598

flow-cytometry and/or Fluorecent in situ hybridization (FISH)  for CRLF2] will receive 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) dasatinib 100 mg once daily or ruxolitinib 10-25 mg 
twice daily on days 1 to 14 +/- 5 days of induction (course 1). On all subsequent courses the tyrosine kinase inhibitor will be given daily without interruption. Maintenance therapy will be monthly Liposomal Vincristine and dexamethasone and continuous daily TKI.
Maintenance chemotherapy is planned for all patients as described later. Patients 

may move to the maintenance therapy prior to completion of 8 cycles if they develop 
side effects prohibiting further intensive chemotherapy. 
Patients with mediastinal lymphoblastic lymphoma and bulky mediastinal disease 
(defined as >/= 7 cm) or residual mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be considered for 
consolidative mediastinal irradiation prior to the maintenance phase of therapy.
Other dosage adjustments are allowed if they are judged to be in the best interest of the patient, don’t exceed the maximums dosages described in the protocol, and the adjustments are discussed with the study PI. 
5.3 Patients aged >/= 60 years with newly diagnosed active disease, or with poor performance 
status, (at the discretion of the treating physician) may be induced in the protective environment. Protective environment is optional. Dosing may also be adjusted. See Section 5.7 for suggested dose modifications by [CONTACT_564353].
5.4 Central Nervous System Management 
Total number of prophylactic intrathecal treatments for newly diagnosed patients (in the 
absence of CNS disease) will be 8 (2 intrathecals of methotrexate on day 2 
 3 days and 
cytarabine day 7  3 days with each course of chemotherapy until total number reached).  
Missed intrathecals (e.g., related to failed procedure attempts, scheduling issues, patient 
social situations) can be made up with subsequent courses of chemotherapy. 
High-risk disease: 8 intrathecals 
Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 1400 U/LLymphoblastic lymphoma with/without marrow involvementBurkitt or Burkitt-like (treated with 16 intrathecals on separate protocol)Patients with Philadelphia (Ph) positive ALL will receive 12 intrathecals, 2 per cycle, 

for the first 6 cycles.  Missed intrathecals may be made up at later cycles.  Low-risk disease: 8 intrathecals

LDH </=1400 U/LIndeterminate risk:  8 intrathecals

None of these parameters met (de novo LDH level unknown)If the patient has had prior intrathecal therapy or prior CNS disease, discuss 

management of CNS prophylaxis/therapy with the Principal Investigator. If active CNS disease: consider intrathecal methotrexate alternating with ara-C twice 

weekly until CSF clear twice; then once weekly for 4 weeks, then back to prophylactic schedule. Consider XRT to the base of the skull, if cranial nerve root involvement. Alternative methods and intratheral schedules of treating CNS disease are allowed if appropriate for the patient.

11.0 Statistical Considerations
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liposomal 
vincristine (Marqibo), replacing standard vincristine in the Hyper-CVAD (HCVAD) regimen, for the treatment of newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma. 
2008-[ADDRESS_741274] vincristine, we will simultaneously monitor the complete remission rate at one year.  Accrual is estimated at 1 to 2 patients per 6 months.  A maximum of 65 patients will be enrolled in this study on an intent-to-treat basis; total study duration is thus estimated as 4 to 5 years.
Sample Size and Endpoint Monitoring
The Bayesian approach of Thall et al. (1995, 1996) with the extension by [CONTACT_210872] (1998) will be 
used to simultaneously monitor CR rate at one year and 6-month grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.  264 ALL patients treated with HCVAD experienced a 95% induction CR rate.  At 1, 2, and 3 years the CR rates were 70%, 55%, and 46%. The 6-month neurotoxicity rate in this population is approximately 15%.  For the prior distribution of HCVAD with standard vincristine, we assumed a simple Dirichlet distribution and independence between 1-year CR rate and neurotoxicity in 132 patients.  The parameters for this prior distribution are presented in table 1.  
A flat Dirichlet prior distribution for HCVAD with Liposomal Vincristine was chosen reflective of information from the equivalent of 2 patients with the same marginal distributions as for HCVAD  alone 
(e.g., 1-year CR rate of 70% and neurotoxicity rate of 15%).
This regimen of HCVAD with Liposomal Vincristine will be considered worthy of further investigation if it 
elicits an increase in 1-year CR rate to 80% with acceptable toxicity.  A 25% 6-month grade [ADDRESS_741275] 40 patients.
Simulation (10,000 replicates) was used to evaluate the performance of these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564332]. The operating characteristics of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564333]. 
Analysis Plan
The primary end point is the CR rate at one year for the hyper-CVAD plus liposomal vincristine in newly 
2008-[ADDRESS_741276] HCVAD is 70%, the new regime of HCVAD with Liposomal 
Vincristine will be considered worthy of further investigation if it elicits an increase in 1-year CR rate to 80% with acceptable toxicity.  A lower than 25% 6-month grade [ADDRESS_741277] one dose of HCVAD with Liposomal Vincristine. Patients who dropped out before one year will be counted as failures. Logistic regression analysis will be conducted for the primary end point, i.e., CR at one year. More analysis details are described below.
Continuous variables (e.g., age, hematology values) will be summarized using the mean (s.d.) or median 
(range).  Frequency tables will be used to summarize categorical variables.  Logistic regression will be used to assess the impact of patient characteristics (e.g., low/high LDH) on 6-month neurotoxicity rates and CR rates.  The distribution of time-to-event endpoints (e.g., CR duration, overall survival) will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier.  Comparison of time-to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_564355].  Cox (proportional hazards) regression will be used to evaluate multivariable predictive models of time-to-event outcomes.

12.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it  results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
A life-threatening adverse drug experience - any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]

A persistent or significant disability/incapacity - a substantial disruption of a 
person's ability to conduct normal life functions.A congenital anomaly/birth defect.

Important medical events that may not result  in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious  adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may j eopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or  at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).
Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered 
serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be 
reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office.
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of 

a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and 
procedures outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Events”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).
All life-threatening or fatal events, that are  unexpected, and related  to the 

study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working 
day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.
The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used 
for reporting to the IND Office. 
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs 
consent until [ADDRESS_741279] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.
Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 30 day time 

period that are related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.

1.  
Participant’s Name [CONTACT_564375] ("MD 
Anderson"). 
 This consent and authorization form explains why this research study is being done and what your role will be if 
you choose to take part.  This form also describes the possible risks connected with being in this study.  After reviewing this 
information with the person responsible for your enrollment, you should know enough to be able to make an informed decision 
on whether you want to take part in the study.
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic 
lymphoma.
If you are reading and signing this form on behalf of a potential participant, please note:  Any time the words "you," "your," "I," or 
"me" appear, it is meant to apply to the potential participant. 
2. PURPOSE OF  STUDY
The goal of this  clinical research study is to learn if intensive chemotherapy (hyper-CVAD therapy) given in combination with 
liposomal vincristine (Marqibo), in addition to rituximab for patients who are CD20 positive and/or imatinib or dasatinib for 
patients with the Philadelphia (Ph)  chromosome, can help to control ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma.  The safety of this 
treatment will also be studied.  CD20 is a protein "marker" that is found in leukemia or lymphoma cells.
3. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY
The
 Study Drugs
Adriamycin (doxorubicin) is designed to  stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.
Cyclophosphamide  is designed to  disrupt with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growth and 
spread throughout the body.  This may cause the cancer cells to die. 
Cytarabine (Ara-C)  is designed to insert  itself into DNA (the genetic material of cells) of cancer cells and stop the DNA from 
repairing itself. 
Dexamethasone  is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by [CONTACT_39625].  
Methotrexate  is designed to  disrupt cells from making and repairing DNA and "copying" themselves.
Vincristine  is designed to  disrupt the multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growth and spread throughout 
the body.  This may cause the cancer cells to die.  
Liposomal Vincristine (Marqibo)  is designed to help vincristine stay in the bloodstream for a longer time, more specifically 
target tumor tissue, and deliver more of the drug to a tumor site over a longer period of time.  This may increase how effective 
the drug is and lower the risk of possible side effects in healthy, non-tumor tissue.
Rituximab  is a monoclonal antibody  that is designed to attach to leukemia cells and activate a series of events that may cause 
the cancer cells to die.
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI--Imatinib  or Dasatinib) 
Imatinib is a drug designed to block cancer cells from growing and dividing. Dasatinib  is  designed to block a protein that 
cancer may need to grow, survive, or spread.
Screening Tests
Signing this consent  form does not mean that you will be able to take part in this study.  You will have "screening tests” to help 
the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study.  The following tests and procedures will be performed:
Your complete medical history will be recorded.
You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, 
breathing 
rate, heart rate, and temperature).
You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test to measure the electrical activity of the heart).
An echocardiogram (ECHO)  or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan will be performed  to check the pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_564335].
Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
Blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will also be collected for a pregnancy test for women who are able to become 
pregnant. 
 To take part in this study, the pregnancy test must be negative.
If the study doctor thinks it is needed, computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest will be performed to check the 
status  
of the disease.  The study doctor will decide how many scans you will have.
A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564336].  To collect a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], an area 
of 
the hip bone is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. 
If you have lymphoblastic lymphoma, a chest X-ray will be performed to check the status of the disease.
The 
study doctor will discuss the screening test results with you.  If the screening tests show that you are not eligible to take part 
in the study, you will not  
be enrolled.  Other treatment options will be discussed with you.
Study Groups
If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to [ADDRESS_741280] for a certain protein, called CD20.
If you test positive for CD20, you will receive hyper-CVAD therapy plus rituximab. 
If you test negative for CD20, you will receive hyper-CVAD therapy only.
In 
addition, patients with the Philadelphia chromosome (considered Philadelphia-positive or Ph+) will receive imatinib or 
dasatinib 
in either group.  The study doctor will decide which drug these participants will receive.
Study Drug Administration
Hyper-CVAD therapy is a combination  of 7 chemotherapy drugs: the combination of adriamycin (doxorubicin), 
cyclophosphamide, and liposomal vincristine, alternating with the combination of cytarabine (Ara-C), dexamethasone, 
methotrexate, and liposomal vincristine.  You will receive the 2 different study drug combinations over 21-28 day "courses."  You 
will begin with Course A treatment and alternate with the Course B treatment every other course.  You will stay overnight in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_564337] 4-5 days of each course.
For Course A of treatment,  you will receive cyclophosphamide, liposomal vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone.
For Course B of treatment,  you will receive methotrexate, cytarabine, and liposomal vincristine. 
Courses of treatment on this study will continue to alternate or switch between the Course A study drug combination for all odd 
number courses (3,  
5, and 7) and the Course B study drug combination for all even number courses (4, 6, and 8) for a total of 
up to 8 courses.
While you are on study, all doses of study drug combinations will be given through a central venous catheter (CVC).  A CVC is a 
sterile  
flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia.  Your doctor will explain this 
procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.
Course 1:
On Days 1, 2, and 3 you will receive cyclophosphamide by [CONTACT_564358] 24 hours, mesna by [CONTACT_564359] 24 hours, 
and liposomal vincristine by [CONTACT_366050] 1 hour +/- 30 minutes (Day 1 only).  Mesna is given to help prevent blood in the urine, 
which is sometimes caused by [CONTACT_207135]. 
On Days 2 and 7, methotrexate then cytarabine will be given by [CONTACT_282846] (IT) infusion directly into your spi[INVESTIGATOR_564338].
On Day 4, you will receive doxorubicin by [CONTACT_366050] 24 hours.
On 
Day 5 or 6, G-CSF will be injected under the skin to help with the recovery of bone marrow cells recovery 24 hours after the 
dose of  
study drugs.

Length 
of Study
You will receive up to 8 courses of therapy.  If you are not Ph+, you will continue to receive maintenance therapy for up to 30 
months.  
 If you are Ph+, you will continue to receive maintenance therapy for up to [ADDRESS_741283].
Additional Information
If you are 60 years or older, you will receive Course 1 chemotherapy in a protective isolation room to decrease the risk of any 
infection(s)  
that you may be exposed to while receiving the Course [ADDRESS_741284] to you while you are enrolled in this study.  You and/or your insurance provider 
will be responsible for all other drugs that are given to you as part of this study.
Up to [ADDRESS_741285] shortly after treatment is stopped, but in some cases side effects may be 
serious, long-lasting or permanent, and may even result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or death.
Tell the study staff about  any side effects you may have, even if you do not think they are related to the study drug.  
Imatinib, dasatinib, doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, liposomal vincristine, and rituximab each may cause low blood 
cell counts (red blood cells, platelets, and/or white blood cells): 
A low red blood cell count (anemia) may cause difficulty breathing and/or fatigue. You may need a blood transfusion. 
A low platelet count increases your risk of bleeding (such as nosebleeds, bruising, stroke, and/or digestive system 
bleeding).  
You may need a platelet transfusion.  
A low white blood cell count increases your risk of infection (such as pneumonia and/or severe blood infection). Infections 
may occur anywhere and become
 life-threatening.  Symptoms of infection may include fever, pain, redness, and/or difficulty 
breathing.

Rituximab Side Effects
Common (occurring in  more than 20% of patients)
fever
fatigue
chillsnausea
low blood cell counts (red, white, 
platelet)
weaknessnerve damage (loss of  motor or

Rituximab may commonly  cause infusion  reactions such as difficulty breathing and/or tissue swelling.  In some cases, life-
threatening reactions such as sudden stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_17531]/or shock caused by [CONTACT_564366].  It is not known 
how often these more serious reactions may occur.
Because rituximab is a mouse antibody  that has been changed to make it similar to a human antibody, treatment with rituximab 
may commonly cause the body to make human antibodies to the mouse-based antibody.  These antibodies are called HAMA or 
HACA.  The potential response of your body to rituximab may lead to decreasing the effectiveness of mouse-based antibody 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564344].  If you receive other drugs in the future that contain mouse proteins, you could develop an 
allergic reaction to those drugs.

In people who have ever been infected with hepatitis B virus, there is a risk that the virus can flare up during treatment with 
drugs that affect 
your immune system, such as rituximab.  This could lead to liver failure.  The risk of hepatitis B virus flaring up 
may continue for several months after you stop taking rituximab.  If you become jaundiced (yellowing of the skin and eyes) or 
develop viral hepatitis while taking rituximab or after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056], you should tell your study doctor right away.  Your 
study doctor will discuss this risk with you and explain what testing is recommended to check for hepatitis.
 
Rituximab may also cause other viruses to reactivate.  This includes JC virus (PML), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, 
parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C.
Talk to the study doctor before receiving any vaccines (for example, vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, or polio).  Receiving 
a vaccine while taking
 rituximab may increase the risk of serious infection or make the vaccine less effective.
Chemotherapy injected directly  into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_564345], vomiting, headaches, and/or irritation of the lining of 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (chemical meningitis). It may lead to infection. If an Ommaya catheter is used for the intrathecal therapy, it may 
leak, bleed, and/or become infected. An Ommaya catheter may lead to a change in the flow of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. 
Using the study drugs together  may cause side effects that are not seen when each is given alone.  The study drug 
combination may also increase the frequency and/or severity of the side effects listed above.
Having bone marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_564346], bruising, bleeding, redness, low blood pressure, swelling, and/or 
infection at the site of the collection. An allergic reaction to the anesthetic may occur. A scar may form at the collection site. 
You may experience pain, bleeding,  and/or bruising from the  blood draws . You may faint and/or develop an infection with 
redness and irritation of the vein at the site where blood is drawn. Frequent blood collection may cause anemia (low red blood 
cell count), which may create a need for blood transfusions.
This study may involve  unpredictable  risks to the participants.
Pregnancy Related Risks
4a. Because taking part  in this study can result in risks to an unborn or breastfeeding baby, you should not become pregnant, 
breastfeed a baby, or father a child while on this study.  You must use birth control during the study if you are sexually 
active.
Males:  Tell the  doctor right away if your partner becomes pregnant or suspects pregnancy.
Females:  If you are pregnant, you will not be enrolled on this study. If you become pregnant or suspect that you are 
pregnant, you must tell your doctor right away.
Getting pregnant will result in your removal from  this study.

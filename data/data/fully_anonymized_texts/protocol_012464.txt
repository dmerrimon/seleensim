BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  32 
 33 
A 5–10% reduction in body weight in obese individuals improves several risk factors for 34 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) including elevated blood glucose, blood pressure, and 35 
plasma triglyceride concentrations.1 Losses of this magnitude can be induced by a high 36 
intensity program of lifestyle modification (i.e., diet, physical activity, and behavior 37 
therapy) provided in  14 or  more counseling  sessions in 6 months. This is the frequency of 38 
group or individual counseling recommended by a recent NIH expert panel.1 It also is the 39 
frequency of brief (10 -15 minute), individual counseling prescribed and reimbursed by 40 
the Centers for M edicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).2 Remarkably, the efficacy of the 41 
specific CMS model of counseling has not been evaluated.  42 
 43 
A loss of 5 -10% of initial weight also may be achieved with the use of p harmacologic 44 
agents,3 including l iraglutide 3.0,4 lorcaserin,5 combination naltrexone plus bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394],6 45 
and combination phentermine plus topi[INVESTIGATOR_545531].7 Liraglutide 3.0 (Saxenda®) belongs to a 46 
class of medications called glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) receptor agonists. 47 
Liraglutide is a once -daily self -admi nistered, subcutaneous (beneath the skin) injection 48 
that may reduce appetite and help overweight or obese adults lose weight and it off. 49 
Liraglutide is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic 50 
weight management, when combined wit h a reduced -calorie diet and increased physical 51 
activity.  52 
 53 
Weight loss medications typi[INVESTIGATOR_750105] a less intensive program of lifestyle 54 
modification (e.g., monthly visits), consistent with the limitations of busy primary care 55 
practices.3 Adding we ight loss medication to high intensity lifestyle modification 56 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_276019] a mean weight loss equal to the sum of the two separate interventions.8 57 
This finding was demonstrated with sibutramine in studies of both obese adults8,9 and 58 
adolescents.10 Wadden et al found that sibutramine alone (10 -15 mg/d) reduced initial 59 
weight by 5% at 1 year in adults, compared with 7% achieved with high intensity lifestyle 60 
modification alone, and 12% resulting from the co mbination of the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].8 61 
Berkowitz et al found that lifestyle modification alone produced a 4% reduction in initial 62 
weight in adolescents at 6 months, which increased to 8% w ith the addition of 63 
sibutramine.10 64 
 65 
Larger weight losses of 10 -15% of initial weight are associated with greater 66 
improvements in risk factors11 and are more consistent with obese individuals’ desired 67 
weight loss goals.12, 13 Portion -controlled diets that provide 1000 -1200 kcal/day (in the 68 
form of liquid shakes, meal bars, and prepared entrees) reliably induce mean we ight 69 
losses that are 3 to 5 kg (and  3 to 5 percentage points) greater than losses achieved with [ADDRESS_1026472] reported losses of 10-12% of initial weight in subject s who (for 73 
12-16 weeks) consumed a 1000 -1200 kcal/d diet in combination with intensive lifestyle 74 
modification.16, 17  75 
 76 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 6 
 The proposed  52-week  randomized controlled trial will compare  three treatment groups: 77 
1) CMS lifestyle counselling (CMS -Alone); 2) CMS lifestyle counselli ng plus liraglutide 78 
(i.e., CMS -Liraglutide), and 3) CMS -Liraglutide plus a 1000 -1200 kcal/day portion - 79 
controlled diet (i.e ., Multi-Component I ntervention).  This is the first evaluation of the 80 
CMS -recommended schedule of lifestyle counselling (14 sessions in 26 weeks , followed 81 
by [CONTACT_750120] 2 7-52) and the first assessment of the benefits of adding 82 
liraglutide 3.0 to the CMS counselling  program. The study  will also assess the benefits of 83 
adding a portion -controlled diet to the combination of CMS lifestyle counselling and 84 
liraglutide, with a goal of  achieving a mean weight loss of 14% or more of initial weight, [ADDRESS_1026473] trial to assess the 90 
efficacy of the CMS -recommended program of lifestyle modification for obesity, which 91 
includes 14 brief (15 -minute) individual counseling sessions in 26 weeks , delivered by a 92 
physician, nurse practitioner, physician a ssistant, or registered dietitian (the latter 93 
working incident to the former practitioners).2  Six additional monthly sessions are 94 
provided in weeks 2 7-52. The demonstration of the efficacy of this intervention, as 95 
indicated by [CONTACT_750121] 5%  of initial weight in 6 months , would facilitate 96 
the fuller adoption of this treatment mo del in primary care practice. Our research team 97 
also would facilitate this adoption by [CONTACT_750122] a web site the lifestyle intervention that 98 
we will use, which is base d on the Diabetes Prevention Program.18 (CMS currently 99 
provides practitioners no recommendations for a lifestyle intervention protocol .) Second,  100 
the trial will demonstrate that practitioners can increase weight loss by 5 % by [CONTACT_106814] 101 
CMS counseling with l iraglutide 3.0 (i.e., Saxenda) and increase it further with the  102 
combination of liraglutide 3.0 plus a 1000 -1200 portion -controll ed diet (i.e., Multi - 103 
Component I ntervention).  Increased weight loss will be associated with a third  benefit – [ADDRESS_1026474] s who receive adjunctive therapy also 106 
will report greater satisfaction with their weight loss compared to individuals who receive 107 
CMS lifestyle counseling alone.  Obese individuals would like to lose 25 -35% of their 108 
initial body weight but report being gen erally satisfied after achieving losses of 109 
approximately 10% of baseline  weight .12, 13 110 
 111 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:  [ADDRESS_1026475] s who los e 122 
>5%, >10%, and >15% of initial weight , as well as the % reduction in weight at week 24 123 
and the proportion of subjects who meet the categorical weight losses at this time.  124 
 125 
To compare  the three groups at week 52 on changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 126 
factors  (i.e, blood pressure, tri glyceride s, LDL and HDL cholesterol, C reactive protein, [ADDRESS_1026476] circumference ), glycemic control  (i.e., fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, insulin, and 128 
HOMA) , mood  (PHQ -9), quality of life  (i.e, SF-36 and IWQOL -Lite) , eating behavior  129 
(i.e., Eating Inventory, E ating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire , and Yale Food 130 
Addiction Scale) , appetite  (i.e., visual analogue scales) , sleep  (i.e., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206525] 131

 134 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  135 
 136 
Study Hypotheses : 137 
 138 
Primary aim 1: To compare  the 52-week  mean percentage reduction in initial weight 139 
achieved with CMS -Alone  to that achieved with  both CMS -Liraglutide and  the Multi - 140 
Component Intervention.  141 
 142 
H1: CMS lifestyle counseling combined with liraglutide will produce significantly greater 143 
mean weight loss at 52 weeks  than will CMS -Alone (with expected mean losses of 9.5% 144 
and 5.0%, respectively). The Multi -Component Intervention (i.e., CMS counseling + 145 
liraglutide + portion -controlled diet) similarly will produce significantly greater mean 146 
weight l oss at 52 weeks  than will CMS -Alone  (with expected mean losses of 14.0% and 147 
5.0%, respectively).   148 
 149 
The trial has the following secondary aims and hypotheses . 150 
 151 
Aim 2: To compare the 52-week  mean percentage reduction in initial weight achieved 152 
with the Multi -Component Intervention  to that achieved with  CMS -Liraglutide.  153 
 154 
H2: The Multi -Component Intervention will produce significantly greater mean weight 155 
loss at 52 wee ks than will CMS -Liraglutide (with expected mean losses of 14.0% and 156 
9.5%, respectively).  157 
 158 
Aim 3 : To compare the three treatment groups in the proportion of subject s who lose 159 
>5%, >10% and >15% of initial body weight at week 52 . 160 
 161 
H3: A significantly greater proportion of subject s in the Multi -Component Intervention 162 
will meet the three categorical weight loss criteria (i.e., >5%, >10% and >15% loss) than [ADDRESS_1026477] s assigned to CMS -Liraglutide  which, in turn, will be superior to CMS -Alone .  164 
 165 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 8 
 Aim 4 : To compare differences among the three treatment groups in the mean percentage 166 
reduction in initial weight at week 24 , as well as the proportion of subjects who meet the 167 
three categorical weight loss criteria.    168 
 169 
H4: Subject s assigned to the Multi -Component Intervention will lose significantly more 170 
weight at 6 months than those assigned to CMS -Liraglutide  which , in turn, will be 171 
superior to CMS -Alone . Achievement of categorical weight loss criteria will follow the 172 
same pattern.  173 
 174 
Aim 5: To compare the three treatment groups  on changes, as measured from 175 
randomization to week 52, in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e, blood [ADDRESS_1026478] 177 
circumference), glycemic cont rol (i.e., fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA), 178 
mood (PHQ -9), quality of life (i.e, SF -36 and IWQOL -Lite), eating behavior (i.e., Eating 179 
Inventory, Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire, and Yale Food Addiction Scale), 180 
appetite (i.e., visual  analogue scales), sleep (i.e., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]), and 181 
weight loss satisfaction.  182 
 183 
H5: Subject s in the Multi -Component Intervention will achieve greater improvements on 184 
these secondary outcomes than will th ose assigned to CMS -Liraglutide  which , in turn, 185 
will be superior to CMS -Alone . (We note that these latter comparisons are considered 186 
exploratory.  The study i s not powered to determine significant differences among groups 187 
on these outcomes.)  188 
 189 
Endpoints:  190 
 191 
Primary  192 
 193 
The primary endpoint  is change in body weight (i.e., % reduction in initial weight), as 194 
measured from randomization to week 52 . 195 
 196 
Secondary  197 
 198 
Secondary endpoints include mean percentage reduction in initial weight as measured 199 
from randomization to week 24; the proportion of sub jects who lose >5%, >10% and >15% 200 
of initial body weight as measured from randomization to week 52 and to week 24 ; and 201 
changes from randomization to week 52  in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e, [ADDRESS_1026479] 203 
circumference), glycemic control (i.e., fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA), 204 
mood (PHQ -9), quality of life (i.e, SF -36 and IWQOL -Lite), eating behavior (i.e., Eating 205 
Inventory, Eating Disorder Examinati on-Questionnaire, and Yale Food Addiction Scale), 206 
appetite (i.e., visual analogue scales), sleep (i.e., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]), and 207 
weight loss satisfaction.  (Please see Table 1  for study timeline and endpoint assessments .) 208 
 209 
Study type:  [ADDRESS_1026480] s with obesity, who are free of types 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as 215 
contraindications to weight loss (described later), will be randomly assigned to one of 216 
three treatment groups: 1) CMS lifestyle counseling ( CMS -Alone ; N = 50); 2) CMS 217 
lifestyle counseling plus liraglutide (i.e., CMS -Liraglutide; N = 50); or 3) CMS - 218 
Liraglutide plus a portion -controlled diet (i.e., Multi -Component Intervention; N = 50).  [ADDRESS_1026481] 14 brief (15 minute) lifestyle counseling visits the [ADDRESS_1026482] 24 week s, followed by [CONTACT_750123] 25 -52. This is the schedule and 222 
duration of counseling visits recommended by [CONTACT_286348].2 Counseling  sessions will be 223 
delivered by a  nurse practitioner or  registered dietitian (RD). (RDs are eligible to provide [ADDRESS_1026483] is likely to cover weight loss counseling as 226 
provided by [CONTACT_750124] a range of other trained interventionists.)  Subject s in all three [ADDRESS_1026484] brief physician visits at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, and 52 (total of 7 228 
visits). These visits are needed for subject s in both liraglutide groups to monitor their [ADDRESS_1026485] s in CMS -Alone to match 230 
the intensity of medical care provided the two other groups.   231 
 232 
This is an open -label trial, the rationale for which is discussed in the next section ( i.e., 233 
Rationale for Study Design).  [ADDRESS_1026486] the benefit of 236 
intensifying CMS counseling with the addition of liraglutide 3.0, as well as liraglutide 3.0 237 
combined with a 1000 -1200 kcal/day portion -controlled diet .  [ADDRESS_1026487] will be 2.5 years.  (Please see Table 2 for study timeline.)  242 
 243 
Rationale for Study Design  244 
 245 
The study design does not include the use of a  placebo in comparing CMS -Alone to 246 
CMS -Liraglutide. This decision is based on multiple prior demonstration that liraglutide 247 
is superior to placebo (i.e., the medication’s efficacy is not in question).19  We plan to use 248 
liraglutide in the manner recommended  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration 249 
(FDA), by [CONTACT_721365] a program o f diet and exercise counseling. We have conducted 250 
three previous studies in adults, which  combined lifestyle modification with an FDA - 251 
approved weight loss medication (i.e., sibutra mine). None of these studies included a 252 
placebo (i.e., they were open -label studies). Two of th e trials were published in the [ADDRESS_1026488] which 256 
to judge the efficacy of the CMS -Alone intervention (i.e., lifestyle counseling alone). We [ADDRESS_1026489] omitted a Usual Care group because of concerns that it does not meet current 258 
guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services  Task Force to “offer all obese individuals 259 
intensive lifestyle counseling.”[ADDRESS_1026490] s in the study (i.e., they would drop out because of dissatisfaction with 262 
their weight change). The present study nonetheless will provide the first estimate (from a 263 
randomized controlled trial) of the weight loss that can b e expected from CMS [ADDRESS_1026491] demonstrated that low -calorie, portion -controlled diets increase weight 269 
loss as co mpared with a diet of conventional foods.14, 15, 23 We do not think there is a need 270 
to replicate this finding in the present study. Instead, we wish to focus this trial on 271 
inducing and maintaining large weight losses ( > 10% of initial weight), as desired b y 272 
obese individuals.12, 13  We believe that the combination of CMS counseling plus 273 
liraglutide plus a 1000 -1200 kcal/d portion -controlled diet provides the best opportunity [ADDRESS_1026492]  losses.24 275 
  276

 448 
Participants who meet all eligibility criteria assessed at the screening visit will be 449 
scheduled for a randomization screening visit at the Center within 3 weeks of their 450 
screening. Approximately 2 -3 days before the randomiza tion visit, th ey will be instructed 451 
to complete the self -reported outcomes (described later), either online (using a link e - 452 
mailed to them) or using paper -and-pencil questionnaires (for those who prefer this 453 
method).  Their questionnaires will be reviewed for completeness at the outset of the [ADDRESS_1026515] ed. The participant’s weight, 455 
blood pressure, and pulse will then be measured, following the methods described later 456 
(see Assessment for Efficacy).  457 
 458 
Participants will then be randomly assigned to the three interventions in equal numbers 459 
(i.e., 1:1:1 ratio) . This will be accomplished using a computer -generated algorithm 460 
operated by [CONTACT_750127] 461

 Lifestyle Counseling Visits  – All Groups  470 
 471 
Subjects in all three treatment groups (i.e., CMS -Alone; CMS -Liraglutide; and Multi - 472 
Component Intervention) will receive the same program of diet, physical activity, and 473 
behavior therapy, as currently recommended (and reimbursed) by [CONTACT_750128].2 All study 474 
subjects will be pr ovided 14 brief ( 15 min), face -to-face visits during the first 6 months 475 
and 7 visits the second 6 months  (total of 21 visits ). Lifestyle counseling will be  delivered 476 
by a nurse practitioner (NP) or by a registered dietitian ( RD), the latter working incident [ADDRESS_1026518] 4 weeks  (weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4) and every - 480 
other week from weeks 6 -24  (weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24) and will be 481 
delivered following an abbreviated version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).18 482 
(We developed and demonstrated the efficacy of this protocol in our prior POWER -UP 483 
study.) From weeks [ADDRESS_1026519] one brief ( 15 min) visit per month, as 484 
provided by [CONTACT_286348] (weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52).  485 
 486 
Dietary intake will be prescribed following methods used in DPP18 and the Look 487 
AHEAD study .29, 30 Subjects in CMS -Alone and CMS -Liraglutide who weigh <250 lb 488 
will be prescribed a diet of 1200 -1499 kca l/d, comprised of conventional foods, with 489 
approximately 15 -20% kcal from protein, 20 -35% from fat, and the remainder from 490 
carbohydrate. (Those who weigh >250 lb will be prescribed 1500 -1800 kcal/d.) They will 491 
be instructed (for the first 24 weeks ) to reco rd their food and calorie intake daily, using 492 
paper -and-pencil diaries o r on-line trackers (including MyFitness Pal or Lose -It). Subjects 493 
will be provided meal plans (which offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner options for the 494 
week) that were provided in the D PP18 and POWER -UP studies.20 The meal plans are 495 
culturally tailored. (As described later, subjects in the Multi -Component Intervention will 496 
be prescribed a 1000 -1200  portion controlled diet for weeks 4 -16 with 2 subsequent 497 
weeks of re -feeding , but thereaft er will consume the same diet prescribed for subjects in 498 
the two other treatment groups.)  499 
 500 
The physical activity prescription will be similar to that used in Look AHEAD30 and 501 
POWER -UP.20 All individuals will be instructed to engage in low -to-moderate inten sity 502 
physical activity (principally walking or similar aerobic activity) 5 days per week, 503 
gradually building to ≥180 minutes per week by [CONTACT_5875] 24 . The goal will be increased to 504 
>225 minutes/week from weeks [ADDRESS_1026520] their activity daily and 506 
will receive a traditional pedometer (Yamax, Digi -Walker) if they do not own a smart [ADDRESS_1026521]’s 513 
food and activity records for their prior week to determine the number of days records 514 
were kept and the total number of calories consumed and minutes of activity for the 515 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 18 
 week. Problem solving will be used to address any difficulties encountered. (Records 516 
from additional weeks will be reviewed as time allows.) The provider will then review a [ADDRESS_1026522]’s [ADDRESS_1026523] 24 weeks . 525 
 526 
Subjects will be provided  print materials, including handouts and food and activity 527 
diaries, for those who wish them. However, the 21 DPP lessons20 will be posted on our 528 
Center’s web -site, and subjects will have the option of  recording their food intake using a 529 
variety of apps. Our guiding principle is to tailor the method in which the DPP is 530 
delivered to meet the subjects’ preferences.  [ADDRESS_1026524]’s weight, will 535 
be followed for phone -delivered sessions as face -to-face meetings. A growi ng body of 536 
evidence indicates that phone -delivered lifestyle counseling is as effe ctive as face -to-face 537 
meetings.33, 34  538 
 539 
Interventionists will include RDs and NPs who are experienced in delivering lifestyle 540 
modification. Before beginning the study, interve ntionists will receive a 2 -hour overview 541 
of obesity and its behavioral management, followed by [CONTACT_750129] 542 
deliver the DPP, following the detailed protocols developed for POWER -UP. 543 
Interventionists will treat equal number s of subjects in  each of the three treatment groups 544 
(to eliminate the possibility of confounding of interventionist  and treatment group).  545 
Lifestyle Counseling Visits : The Three Treatment Groups  546 
 547 
CMS -Alone . The intervention for subjects assigned to CMS -Alone is described above. 548 
There are no additions are alterations to this treatment plan.  549 
 550 
CMS -Liraglutide . Participants in this group will receive the identical program of 551 
lifestyle modification as those in th e CMS -Alone group. The former individuals, 552 
however, will be provided liraglutide 3.0 (Saxenda) beginning at week 1. Liraglutide 3.0,  [ADDRESS_1026525], is a once -daily self -administered, subcutaneous 554 
injection.19 Liraglutide 3.0 wi ll be provided as pre -filled, disposable, personal injectors. 555 
Patients will be taught (by [CONTACT_5989]) how to properly perform subcutaneous [ADDRESS_1026526] about how to administer the medication. To reduce the likelihood of 558 
gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting), the medication will be initiated at 0.6 559 
mg daily for 1 week, and then increased by 0.6 mg/day in weekly intervals until a dose of 560 
3 mg/d ay is achieved (please see below for dosing schedule). Patients will be instructed 561 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 19 
 that if they miss a dose, to resume the once -daily regimen with the next scheduled dose 562 
and not to give an extra dose or higher dose. If patients miss more than 3 days, they  will 563 
be instructed to call the study coordinator /physician  who will initiate therapy at 0.6 564 
mg/day to avoid gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients who do not tolerate an increased [ADDRESS_1026527] a delayed dose escalation by [CONTACT_8622] 7 day s. Study 566 
medical staff will help participants develop a medication sch edule, based on when and 567 
where participants  will take the medication each day and how they  will remind 568 
themselves to do so.  569 
 570 
Figure 2. Dosing Schedule for Liraglutide  571 
 572 
 573 
 574 
Lifestyle inter ventionists working with subjects in this treatment group will briefly 575 
review the individual’s medication adherence at each visit, determining the number of 576 
days liraglutide was used each week and ident ifying reasons for missed doses . The 577 
number of doses of medication taken each week will be tracked . Lifestyle i nterventionists 578 
will not query subjects about side -effects. These will be reported to the research 579 
coordinator or the study physician  (or NP)  at regularly scheduled visits.   580 
 581 
Multi -Component Interv ention . Subjects in this group will receive the same treatment 582 
as those in CMS -Liraglutide, with one exception. Beginning at week 4 ( 4th brief 583 
counseling visit ), they will be instructed to c onsume, for 12 weeks (weeks 4 -16), a 1000 - 584 
1200 kcal/d diet that pr ovides four servings daily of a liquid shake (Health Management 585 
Resou rces – HMR; 160 kcal per shake) and  an evening meal comprised of a frozen food 586 
entrée (250 -300 kcal), with a serving of fruit and a salad. Another serving of fruit will be 587 
permitted after  dinner, providing a diet of approximately 1000 -1200 kcal/day.16, 17 All 588 
HMR products will be provided free of charge; subjects will be responsible for [ADDRESS_1026528] daily the number of meal replacements they use. (Prescription of the [ADDRESS_1026529] 24 594 
weeks , as compared to consumption of the conventional 1200 -1500 kcal/d diet.)14, [ADDRESS_1026530] brief medical visits (10 -15 minutes) with a 598 
physician at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, and 52 (total of 7 visits). These visits are needed 599 
for participants in both liraglutide groups to monitor their response to the medication and 600 
to check for possible complications of early weight lo ss. These visits are i ncluded for 601 

   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 20 
 participants in CMS -Alone to match the intensity of medical care provided the two other 602 
groups.  Participants in CMS -Alone will be instructed in the relation of excess weight to 603 
health and review results of their laboratory  tests. At each medical visit, participant’s [ADDRESS_1026531]  been any change s in their 606 
health or medications. For all non-study -related medical events, participants will be 607 
referred to their own primary care provider s. Participants also will be asked about their 608 
mood or any thoughts of harming themselves, as assessed by [CONTACT_48649] -Suicide 609 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).27 In the event of reports of suicidal ideation or 610 
disturbances in mood, participants will be referred to the study’s psychologist or [ADDRESS_1026532] for further evaluation, as appropriate.   612 
 613 
Assessments for Efficacy  614 
 615 
Participants will attend 3 major outcome  assessment visits, conducted at randomization, 616 
week 24 and week 52 (see Table 1). All outcomes described below will be measured on 617 
these three occasions.  618 
Primary Efficacy  Measure  619 
 620 
The primary outcome is % reduction in initial body weight, as measured fro m 621 
randomization to week 52. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of participants 622 
who at week 52 lose >5%, >10%, and >15% of initial weight, as well as % reduction in 623 
weight at week 24 and the proportion of participants who meet the three categorical 624 
weight loss es at this time.  Body weight will be measured on a digital scale (to the nearest 625 
0.1 kg) with participants dressed in light clothing, without shoes. Two measurements will 626 
be taken on each occasion and averaged. Weight will be measured by [CONTACT_750130] 627 
to participants’ treatment condition.  (Body weight also will be measured at each lifestyle 628 
counseling visit but the assessor will not be masked to treatment condition on these 629 
occasions.)  630 
Secondary Efficacy M easures   631 
 632 
The secondary efficacy measures include changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 633 
factors (i.e, blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, C reactive protein, [ADDRESS_1026533] circumference), glycemic control (i.e., fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ins ulin, and 635 
HOMA), mood (PHQ -9), quality of life (i.e, SF -36 and IWQOL -Lite), eating behavior 636 
(i.e., Eating Inventory, Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire, and Yale Food 637 
Addiction Scale), appetite (i.e., visual analogue scales), sleep (i.e., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_750108] 638 
Quality Index), and satisfaction with weight loss.  639 
 640 
Cardiometabolic risk factors  will be assessed a t screening and weeks 24 and 52, 641 
following methods described previously.4, 20 (Screening values will be used as the 642 
randomization value, given that they will be obtained within 3  weeks of participants 643 
being randomized.)   644 
 645 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 21 
 Fasting blood samples  (i.e., following an [ADDRESS_1026534]) will be drawn by [CONTACT_3449] 646 
personnel on each occasion and assayed for comprehensive metabolic panel (including 647 
glucose), li pi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (e.g., triglycerides, total -, HDL -, and LDL -cholesterol), hemoglobin A1c, 648 
insulin, and hs -CRP. Insulin sensitivity will be calculated using HOMA. (Blood samples [ADDRESS_1026535] Diagnostics.)  650 
 651 
Blood pressure and pulse  will be measured at eac h outcome assessment using an 652 
automated monitor (Dinamap, model 9300).4, 20 Two readings will be taken on each 653 
occasion (at 1 -minute intervals), after participants have been seated for at least 5 minutes. 654 
(Blood pressure and pulse also will be measured at all medical visits, as well as at 655 
lifestyle counseling visits.)  [ADDRESS_1026536] cumference  will be measured ( following methods described previously ) to the [ADDRESS_1026537] measurements will be obtained 659 
at each assessment visit and averaged.  660 
 661 
Mood, quality of life, eating behavior,  and appetite . Mood will be assessed on the 662 
same schedule as the primary outcome using the PHQ -9.36 Quality of life will be assessed 663 
on the same schedule as the primary outcome using SF -36 37 and IWQOL -Lite.38 664 
Cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger will be evalua ted at the same time, using the 665 
Eating Inventory (EI)39 and visual analogue scales40, and binge eating will be assessed by 666 
the Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire (EDE -Q).41 Food addiction will be 667 
measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale.42 Satis faction with weight loss will be 668 
assessed following methods used by [CONTACT_750131].   669 
 670 
Assessments for Safety  671 
 672 
Safety endpoints include physical examination, adverse events (AEs), standard laboratory 673 
tests, and mental health /suicidal behavior  as assessed by [CONTACT_750132] 674 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS) . As detailed above, participants in all three groups also will have 675 
brief medical visits (10 -15 minutes) with a physician at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 40, and 52 676 
(total of 7 visits). These vi sits are needed for participants in both liraglutide groups to 677 
monitor their response to the medication and to check for possible complications of early 678 
weight loss. At each medical visit, participant’s response to the medication will be 679 
assessed.  Study su bjects will be asked whether there has been any change in their health 680 
or medications. They also will be asked about their mood or any thoughts of harming 681 
themselves, as determined by [CONTACT_941] C-SSRS . In the event of adverse mental health events, 682 
participants w ill be referred to the study’s psychologist or psychiatrist for further [ADDRESS_1026538] fasting blood draws (compr ehensive metabolic panel, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 687 
hemoglobin A1c, insulin, hs -CRP) at screening, and weeks 24 and 52. Vital signs (blood 688 
pressure and pulse) and weights will be measured at screening and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, [ADDRESS_1026539] ’s medication adherence  using injection counts from visual 694 
inspection of the dose counter taken from subjects’ injection pens. Patients will be [ADDRESS_1026540] missed doses and problem 696 
solve with patient s if they are  missing doses. Patients will be instructed to keep a 697 
medication diary, as part of their food and activity monitoring.  698 
 699 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS : [ADDRESS_1026541] s assigned to CMS -Alone  are predicted to lose 5%  (SD=5.0) of initial 703 
weight, whi le those in CMS -Liraglutide will lose 9.5% (SD=7.0), and those assigned to 704 
the Multi -Component Intervention will lose 14% (SD=8.0). The predicted effect for 705 
CMS -Alone  is based on the results of the Hopkins POWER study in which 15 brief (15 - 706 
20 min) individual telephone calls with a trained interventionist induced a mean loss of 707 
6.1 kg in 24 weeks  (equal to 5% of initial weight).  The effect for CMS -Liraglutide i s 708 
estimated at 9.5%, with the expectation that liriglutide 3.0 mg/d will increase weight loss 709 
above placebo by 4.5% (a conservative estimate based on results of the three SCALE 710 
studies summarized in the Saxenda PI).19 The 14% reduction in initial weight fo r the 711 
Multi -Component Intervention is based on our prior results with the combination of an 712 
intensive lifestyle intervention plus sibutramine plus a 1000 -1200 kcal/d diet .[ADDRESS_1026542] s in CMS -Alone , 50 in CMS -Liraglutide, and 50 in the Multi -Component 716 
Intervention provides >80% power to detect the two primary contrasts to be statistically 717 
significant at the Holm’s43 adjusted alpha levels noted above. This estimate al lows for 718 
20% attrition during the 52-week  trial, resulting in approximately 40 treatment 719 
completers per group. (The 20% attrition level is conservative; it is higher than what we [ADDRESS_1026543] of our trials conducted at Penn.) The ITT longitudinal statis tical design 721 
will further improve power by [CONTACT_750133] -completers 722 
and the adjustment of possible variance reducing baseline covariates. All secondary 723 
analyses will be considered exploratory and evaluated at the alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_1026544] be assessed by [CONTACT_750134] -of- 730 
range values with basic statistical procedures such as univariate statistics (i.e., means, [ADDRESS_1026545] deviations, ranges, frequencies, proportions, percentiles) and graphs, such as [ADDRESS_1026546] of tests of differences between the 740 
treatment conditions to see if the baseline variables are equally distributed between them. 741 
These baseline comparisons will be based on: t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for 742 
continuous variables, depending on the symmetry of the d istributions; on Chi -square, 743 
Fisher’s Exact or logistic regression for binary or ordinal variables; and on Poisson log - [ADDRESS_1026547] s randomly assigned to CMS - 748 
Liraglutide and the Multi -Component Intervention will lose a significantly greater 749 
percentage of initial weight at week 52  than will those assigned t o CMS -Alone . A linear 750 
mixed model will be fit using the mixed procedure in the statistical software package 751 
SAS, version 9.3. An intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis (including all randomized subject s) [ADDRESS_1026548] . In addition, these models will contain the following 754 
fixed effects: main effect for change from baseline to each follow -up visit ( weeks 24 and 755 
52); group (3 treatment conditions); and the in teraction between the visit and group.   756 
 757 
The study’s primary outcome will consist of two pairwise comparisons: 1) 52 week  % 758 
reduction in initial weight in CMS -Alone  compared with CMS -Liraglutide; and 2) 52- 759 
week  % reduction in initial weight in CMS -Alone  compared with the Multi -Intervention. 760 
Based on the Holm’s procedure, which adjusts for multiple comparisons, the smaller of [ADDRESS_1026549] will be evaluated at 0.05.44  763 
 764 
Comparison of CMS -Liraglutide and the Multi -Component Intervention  is considered a 765 
secondary outcome and  will be examined with alpha equal to 0.05.  766 
 767 
All randomized participants will be included in the prim ary intention -to-treat (ITT) 768 
analysis. A per protocol analysis will be conducted that includes only those participants 769 
who provide a measurement of body weight at week 52 (with a window of +4 weeks). All 770 
randomized participants will be included in the safe ty analysis.  771 
 772 
Secondary A nalyses  773 
 774 
Similar analytic strategies will be employed for all other continuous secondary efficacy 775 
endpoints, as well as for binary (dichotomous outcomes; i.e., percentage of participants 776 
who achieve diffe rent criterion weight losses). For the logistic model, differences will be 777 
presented as odds ratios with confidence intervals; for linear model, the least squares [ADDRESS_1026550] -randomization visits are missed.45 The following missing or 789 
unbalanced data scenarios can be accommodated by [CONTACT_545689]: attrition (drop out), [ADDRESS_1026551] 792 
of maximum likelihood under the proposed mixed effects models and the miss ing at 793 
random assumption (MAR).  Therefore, we will explore the potential bias of missing data 794 
by [CONTACT_545691] -completers to see if they differ systematically on 795 
values of non -missing variables. There are many ways to assess the assumption of M AR. 796 
We will consider imputing missing endpoint data using multiple imputation techniques, 797 
fitting selection models (e.g. MNAR), and fitting pattern mixture models.  798 
 799 
Weight loss data also will be analyzed using a per protocol analysis that, for liraglutide - 800 
treated participants, includes only those who were able to tolerate and adhered to the full 801 
dose of liraglutide 3.0 mg.  802

 Study Drugs and Materials:  867 
 868 
Subjects assigned to liraglutide will need 365 doses (12 pens) of study medication. 869 
Subjects will be provided with a 30 -day supply of medication (1 pen)  on 12 occasions . 870 
We will as sign 100 subjects to liraglutide  and, thus, will need a total of 120 pens  of 871 
liraglutide .  872 
Study  Medication  873 
 874 
The study medication is liraglutide (i. e., Saxenda). It will be initiated at 0.6 mg 875 
subcutaneously, daily for 1 week , and increase by 0.6 mg/day in weekly intervals until a 876 
dose of 3 mg/day is achieved . The pen delivers doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg, 877 
or 3 mg (6 mg/mL, 3mL).  [ADDRESS_1026559] box.  882 
Study drug will be shipped to the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the 883 
University of Pennsylvania (attention [CONTACT_750152] ) for labeling and packaging. The 884 
study drug supplies will be labeled appropriate to their use. The label for the study  drug 885 
will contain at a minimum:  886 
 Protocol number  887 
 Kit identification number  from the randomization scheme  888

 Study drug name  890 
  891 
Storage and Drug Accountability of Study  Medication  892 
 893 
The medication will be  refrigerated  (36-46°F) ( the temperature will be checked  daily .) [ADDRESS_1026560] may store the medication at room temperature (59 -86°F) or 895 
refrigerate (36 -46°F). The injection pen expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054] [ADDRESS_1026561] and 897 
evaluate the temperature.  No trial m edication(s)  will be  dispensed to any person not 898 
enrolled in the study . Unused  medication(s) will be stored separately from used trial 899 
medication(s).  Subjects will be instructed to inspect the medication visually for 900 
particulate matter and discoloration pr ior to administration.  901 
 902 
We will  maintain adequate drug inventory and security at all times. Upon receipt of the 903 
study drug, the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders  at Penn  will perform an inventory 904 
of the shipment, comparing the shipment inventory to actual study drug received, and 905 
complete and sign an inventory log. The  study  investigator s will immediately notify 906 
Novo Nordisk  (or its designee) or the drug distribution cont ractor of any damaged or [ADDRESS_1026562] that a dditional study drug  be shipped as 909 
needed.  910 
 911 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 27 
 The drug supplies will be kept in a secured  enclosure  with limited access  at the Center for 912 
Weight and Eating Disorders, where it will be received and dispensed to subjects . The 913 
investigator will take appropriate  precautions to prevent theft or diversion of the study 914 
drug.  915 
 916 
At the conclusion of the study, a final inventory of study drug shipped, d ispensed, and 917 
remaining at the C enter  for Weight and Eating Disorders  will be performed by [CONTACT_941] 918 
investigator . This reconciliation will be entered  on the drug accountability  log. The 919 
investigator will return a ll unused drug to Novo Nordisk  or its designee , unless 920 
alternative arrangements for drug disposal are authorized . No study drug will be retained 921 
when the study is completed; all study drugs will be returned to Novo Nordisk  or its [ADDRESS_1026563] number in the sequence; each [ADDRESS_1026564] to meet treatment criteria will be assigned t he next number in the 931 
sequence. This is an open -labelled  randomized trial .  932

Concomitant Illnesses and M edications:  937 
 938 
At trial entry (i.e., the screening visit), we will record details of any concomitant illness 939 
(i.e., any illness that is present at the start of the trial ) that is present  and concomitant 940 
medication (i.e., any medication other than the trial product(s) that is taken during the 941 
trial, including the screening and run -in periods ) in each patient’s record . The information [ADDRESS_1026565]’s eligibility to continue in the 946 
trial, the Sponsor will be informed.  947 
 948 
Adverse E vents:  [ADDRESS_1026566] s, study personnel will be responsive to reports of  adverse 951 
events with specific questioning and, as outlined in the procedures section , by [CONTACT_106625] 952 
examination. The investigator will be report  all adverse events including serious adverse 953 
events (SAE), suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), serious adverse 954 
drug reactions (SADRs)  (as defined below)  to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board 955 
established for the trial, and to the Penn IRB . Information on all adverse events will be 956 
recorded immediately in the source document  and reported immediately , and also in the 957 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 28 
 appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). Information on study 958 
name, patient identification, event (i.e., diagnosis , causality ), drug, and reporter 959 
identification (e.g., name) will be collected and  recorded in the source document  (as 960 
detailed below) . All serious adverse events w ill be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1026567].   964 
 965 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_750109] (AEs), 966 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and other untoward occurences as spelled out below.  967 
 968 
Adverse Event (AE):  [ADDRESS_1026568] 970 
administered/using a product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 971 
relationship with this treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable and 972 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease [ADDRESS_1026569].  975 
 976 
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:  977 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality rega rded as clinically 978 
significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or orga n toxicity and is of a 979 
severity  that requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial [ADDRESS_1026570], more frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigati on). 981 
 982 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  983 
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  984 
• Death  985 
• A life -threatening* experience  986 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750110]  987 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  988 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  989 
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_508454]  990 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require  [ADDRESS_1026571] and may require medical or surgical 993 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  994 
*The term life -threatening in the definition  of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of [ADDRESS_1026572] caused death if 996 
it was more severe.  997 
 998 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A S[LOCATION_003]R  is an SAE 999 
which is unexpected and regarding as possibly or probably related to the trial/study [ADDRESS_1026573] by [CONTACT_093].  1001  
 1002  
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction  (SADR) :  1003  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 29 
 An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 1004  
(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the event is [ADDRESS_1026574] (MESI):  A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. 1009  
wrong drug administration or wrong route of administration) or (2) a suspected [ADDRESS_1026575]  1011  
 1012  
Non-Serious Adverse Ev ent: 1013  
A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.  1014  
 1015  
Severity Assessment Definitions:  1016  
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  1017  
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  1018  
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  1019  
 1020  
Relationship to study medication  Assessment Definitions:  1021  
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  1022  
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  1023  
• Unlikely: The even t is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product  1024

Outcome Categories and Definitions:  1028  
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_329729] [ADDRESS_1026576] signed the 1030  
informed consent  1031  
• Recovering: The condition is i mproving and the subject is expected to recover from the [ADDRESS_1026577] has completed the trial  1033  
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     1034  
significant disability/incapaci ty (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered 1035  
with sequelae should be rated as an SAE  1036  
• Not recovered  1037  
• Fatal  1038  
• Unknown  [ADDRESS_1026578] s’ participation in the study , the investigator  and institution [ADDRESS_1026579] for any study -related adverse 1048  
events, including  clinically significant laboratory values related to the study . (Note: This 1049  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 30 
 section of the protocol will be written in consultation with Penn’s IRB, Office of 1050  
Research Services, and Office of Legal Affairs. It will be addressed pending approval of 1051  
the scientific aspects of the study.)  1052  
 1053  
Pregnancy  1054  
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become 1055  
pregnant.  The investigator  will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during 1056  
the trial  period . Reporting of pregnancy by [CONTACT_750135] 1057  
timelines described above for  reporting of Adverse Events. Pregnancy complications will 1058  
be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this 1059  
will be reported and followed up as a serious adverse event.  1060  
 1061  
Precautions/Over -dosage  [ADDRESS_1026580] I nsurance:  [ADDRESS_1026581] insurance will be discussed during the second phase of the 1067  
application, in consultation with Penn’s Office of Research Services and Legal Affairs.   1068  
 1069  
Evaluability of S ubjects:  [ADDRESS_1026582] censorship will be 1072  
considered prior to initiating recruitment.  1073  
 1074  
Premature Termination of S tudy:  1075  
We believe that it is highly unlikely that the study will be terminated prematurely, given 1076  
the safety of the intervention and i ts expected effects. Termination would be considered, 1077  
however, in view of:  1078  
 Unacceptable safety concerns of the study medication  1079  
 The benefits observed do not ethically permit the trial to continue  1080  
 1081  
Publication Plan : 1082  
We will  register the study with a publicly assessable database such as clinicaltrials.gov.  1083  
An initial report of the findings will be presented at an annual scientific meeting (e.g., 1084  
American Diabetes Association, The Obesity Society, The American Heart Association).  1085  
We plan to publish  the study results approximately 6 months after study completion.  1086  
 1087  
The report of the primary out come will be submitted to the New  Engl and Journal of  1088  
Medicine. Secondary papers likely will be submitted to Obesity, Int ernational  Journal of  1089  
Obesity, or primary care journals.  1090

 SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED PROTOCOL ADDENDUM  1322  
The above protocol describes a 52 -week, open -label, three arm trial titled "Combining 1323  
lifestyle modification and liraglutide to improve weight loss and health outcomes." The 1324  
study, with a total sample of 150 participants, compares changes in weight and oth er 1325  
health outcomes in individuals randomly assigned to: 1) brief lifestyle counseling alone, 1326  
as recommended by [CONTACT_41685] (CMS -Alone); 2) 1327  
CMS counseling plus liraglutide 3.0 mg/d (CMS -Liraglutide); or 3) the combination of 1328  
CMS counseling, liraglutide 3.0 mg/d, and the provision of a [ADDRESS_1026597] 12 weeks (i.e., Multi -Component Intervention).   1330  
 1331  
The study’s primary hypothesis is that participants assigned to the Multi -Component 1332  
Interventio n will lose significantly more weight at 1 year than those assigned to CMS - 1333  
Liraglutide (14.0%  vs 9.5%), who, in turn, will lose significantly more than those 1334  
assigned to CMS -Alone (9.5% vs 5.0%).  [ADDRESS_1026598], in a ran domized, placebo - 1341  
controlled trial, the hypothesis that the addition of phentermine 15 mg/d to liraglutide 3.0 1342  
mg/d will produce significantly greater weight loss at week 12 than will the combination 1343  
of placebo plus liraglutide 3.0 mg/d. We hypothesize that  the difference between groups 1344  
will be approximately 3.5% of initial weight, as measured from randomization. Patients [ADDRESS_1026599] an acceptable safety pro file, which we believe they will.  1347  
 1348  
At the end of week 12 (post -randomization), phentermine and placebo will be terminated, 1349  
but both groups will remain on liraglutide 3.0 mg/d until week 20. We wish to observe, 1350  
from weeks 12 to 20, the change in body weight  that occurs with the termination of 1351  
phentermine 15 mg/d. At week 20, liraglutide also will be terminated in both groups of 1352  
participants. At week 24 (post -randomization), all participants will have a final 1353  
assessment with a physician or nurse practitioner to determine participants’ health status.  1354  
 1355  
All participants from the CMS -Liraglutide and Multi -Component Intervention groups 1356  
who complete the original 1 -year randomized trial – and who have remained on 1357  
liraglutide 3.0 mg/d - will be invited to enroll in t he 20 -week extension study, 1358  
immediately upon completing the prior 1 -year trial. (Participants in the CMS -Alone 1359  
group will not be eligible to receive medication but they will be offered continued brief - 1360  
monthly lifestyle counseling sessions, similar to those  provided in the original 1 -year 1361  
trial.) Participants eligible for the 20 -week medication -extension study will sign a new, 1362  
separate consent form, apprising them of the potential risks and benefits of treatment with 1363  
liraglutide plus phentermine (or placebo) . They all will complete a brief history and [ADDRESS_1026600] acceptable blood pressure and pulse rate. (Participants in the CMS -Alone group 1366  
who wish to continue in the 6 -month ex tension study will sign a separate consent form 1367  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 38 
 and will not be required to undergo additional safety assessment/monitoring, beyond the 1368  
assessment conducted at the end of the original 1 -year trial.  1369  
 1370  
All study participants from the original CMS -Liraglutide and Multi -Component 1371  
Intervention groups will be prescribed liraglutide 3.0 mg/d for an additional [ADDRESS_1026601] >10% of 1373  
initial weight at the end of the 1 -year. They will be randomly assigned from these blocks 1374  
to liraglutide 3.0 mg/d plus phentermine 15 mg/d or liraglutide 3.0 plus placebo.  1375  
Phentermine will be purchased by [CONTACT_458] (using discretionary  funds, 1376  
not provided by [CONTACT_3454]) and will be prepared in matching drug and placebo [ADDRESS_1026602]. Ken Rockwell, director of Penn’s Investigational Drug Service. Dr. 1378  
Rockwell will be responsible for distributing phentermine and placebo and for 1379  
randomi zing participants to treatment. Phentermine will be provided as 8.0mg/d during [ADDRESS_1026603] 2 weeks of the extension study and increased to 15 mg/d at week 3. Phentermine 1381  
(or placebo) will be down -titrated (back to 8.0 mg/d) or terminated in patients who repo rt [ADDRESS_1026604]. Rockwell, in response to notification from 1384  
the principal investigator (or study co -investigators) of patients’ complai nts of symptoms. 1385  
(With [CONTACT_750153], we successfully used this titration method in a prior randomized 1386  
placebo -controlled trial of sibutramine for weight loss.46) Participants in whom 1387  
phentermine (or placebo) is terminated will continue to receive liragluti de 3.[ADDRESS_1026605] for the prior 1 -year trial.    1389  
 1390  
All participants in the randomized, 12 -week extension study will meet with a physician or 1391  
nurse practitioner at randomization (week 0) and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. On each 1392  
occasion they will review patients’ blood pressure and pulse, assess suicidal ideation, and [ADDRESS_1026606] and respond to reports of changes in physical health. As during the 1 -year prior 1394  
trial, brief lifestyle counseling (15 min) will provided at each visit (except week 2) by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1026607] providers.   1397  
 1398  
At the conclusion of the 12 -week randomized extension, all participants will stop taking 1399  
phentermine 15  mg/d (or placebo). They will continue to receive liraglutide 3.0 mg/d for 1400  
an additional 8 weeks (week 20). They will meet at weeks [ADDRESS_1026608] and respond to reports of changes in physical health. Brief lifestyle 1403  
counseling visits (15 min) will be provided at each visit as described previously. At week 1404  
20, liraglutide 3.0 mg/d will be terminated in all patients, who will have a final 1405  
assessment with a physician or nurse practitioner at week 24 to determine  1406  
 1407  
We anticipate that 35 (of 50) participants from the original CMS -Liraglutide group and 1408  
35 (of 50) from the Multi -Component Intervention will be eligible to participate in the [ADDRESS_1026609] to do so. We anticipate that 32 participants in each group 1410  
will complete the 12 -week randomized, extension trial and that those who receive 1411  
liraglutide 3.0 mg/d plus phentermine 15.0 mg/d will lose, from randomization to week 1412  
12, 3. 5±3.5% (of randomization weight), compared with 0.0±0.5% for those assigned to [ADDRESS_1026610] 80% power to [ADDRESS_1026611] this difference, using a two -tailed p value of p = 0.05. (We also will examine total 1415  
weight loss in the two groups, as measured from the original randomization weight [from 1416  
the preceding 1 -year trial], but this is not a primary outcome of the study.)  1417  
 1418  
The finding that phentermine 15.0 mg/d produces additional weight loss when added to 1419  
liragl utide after 1 year’s use of the latter medication would be welcomed news to patients 1420  
and their practitioner.  Patients wish to lose more weight than current treatments induce, 1421  
and they particularly seek methods to resume weight loss after hitting a prolong ed 1422  
plateau. The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_750113] a highly efficient method for both the 1423  
investigative team to determine whether the combination of liraglutide 3.0 mg/d plus 1424  
phentermine 15.0 mg/d provides such benefit, or at least a signal of such benefit. The  8- 1425  
week observational follow -up period, from weeks 12 -20, in which all participants will 1426  
continue to receive liraglutide 3.0 mg/d, but not phentermine (or placebo), will provide 1427  
preliminary evidence concerning the maintenance of weight loss (or possible we ight 1428  
regain) following termination of phentermine 15.0 mg/d.   1429  
 1430  
The sections that follow parallel the original sections of the protocol for the 1 -year trial 1431  
described above. Additional information is added to each section, as required, to describe 1432  
the 12 -week extension study and any modifications to the original methods needed for 1433  
the 12 -week trial (e.g., change in eligibility criteria). With each section, in the absence of 1434  
the need for additional material to explain the extension study, the reader is refer red back 1435  
to the original sections presented for the 1 -year trial.  1436  
 1437  
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  1438  
 1439  
The perils of obesity and benefits of weight loss are well documented, including in the 1440  
original Background and Significance section of this protocol. Liragluti de 3.0 mg/d, a 1441  
glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) agonist, has been shown to induce clinically significant, 1442  
long-term weight loss of approximately 8.0% of initial body weight, when combined with 1443  
a moderate -intensity program of lifestyle modification. Larger w eight losses, as desired 1444  
by [CONTACT_1962], potentially may be obtained by [CONTACT_750137] 3.0 with a low -calorie 1445  
meal replacement diet (i.e., 1000 -1200 kcal/d), delivered during a preliminary run -in 1446  
period.47 Larger weight losses also may be obtained by [CONTACT_750138] 1447  
intensive behavior therapy (IBT), providing [ADDRESS_1026612] option to increase weight lo ss with liraglutide 3.0 mg/d is to 1450  
combine it with another weight loss medication. Phentermine hydrochloride (15.0 mg/d) [ADDRESS_1026613] widely used weight loss medication in the U.S. 1454  
It was approved by [CONTACT_39261] d and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1959 for “short -term” 1455  
use, commonly interpreted as 12 or fewer weeks.48 Phentermine is a sympathomimetic 1456  
amine that is thought to reduce food intake by [CONTACT_62998][INVESTIGATOR_750114] 1457  
serotonin levels in the hypoth alamus. When provided as 8.0 or 15.0 mg/d, the medication 1458  
induces weight loss of approximately 4.0 kg (or 4.0%) greater than placebo at [ADDRESS_1026614] body weigh t. The FDA -approved combination of phentermine and 1461  
topi[INVESTIGATOR_545531], prescribed at 15.0 mg/d and 92 mg/d, respectively, produced a mean loss of 1462  
11.6% of initial weight at 28 weeks, compared with 7.4% for phentermine alone and 1463  
8.8% for topi[INVESTIGATOR_750115] (using the  same doses for monotherapy.  Placebo produced a 1464  
loss of 2.3%.49 1465  
 1466  
A recent 12 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_750116] 15 mg/d of phentermine to 1467  
lorcaserin (10 mg/BID) increased weight loss from 3.3 +3.4% to 6.7 +5.4%. The addition 1468  
of 30 mg/d of phenterm ine (to lorcaserin) increased the loss to only 7.2 +4.6%, but [ADDRESS_1026615] profile, particularly with 1471  
the 15 mg dose of  phentermine. Systolic and diastolic pressure fell by 3.3 and 1.4 mm 1472  
Hg, respectively, with lorcaserin/phentermine 15 mg/d, compared with reductions of 5.5 1473  
and 2.5, respectively, in the lorcaserin -alone group. Pusle rate increased by 1.1 beats per 1474  
minute ( BPM) in the combination group, compared with a fall of 1.9 BPM in the 1475  
lorcaserin group. Aronne et al observed similar, generally favorable changes in blood 1476  
pressure and pulse at 28 weeks with phentermine 15.0 mg.49 1477  
 1478  
OBJECTIVES  1479  
 1480  
Primary Objective  1481  
 1482  
To compar e the 12 -week mean percentage reduction in weight in participants, who 1483  
following completion of the original 1 -year trial, are randomly assigned to receive 1484  
liraglutide 3.0 mg/d combined with phentermine 15 mg/d versus liraglutide 3.0 mg/d 1485  
combined with plac ebo.   1486  
 1487  
Co-Primary Objective  1488  
 1489  
To assess the safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg/d combined with phentermine 15 mg/d, as well [ADDRESS_1026616] blood chemistries 1491  
(measured throughtout  the 1 -year trial), measurement of blood pressure and pulse, and 1492  
recording of adverse events (AEs) reported by [CONTACT_4317]. AEs of special interest, 1493  
previously reported with phentermine 15 mg/d, include dry mouth, constipation, nausea, 1494  
and insomnia.  1495  
     1496  
Secondary Objective  1497  
 1498  
To compare the two medication regimens in the proportion of participants who lose 5% 1499  
or more or 10% or more of initial weight from randomization to week 12.  1500  
 1501  
To compare differences between the two groups in 12 -week changes in secondar y 1502  
endpoints, described in the next section.  1503

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  1513  
 1514  
Study Hypotheses:  1515  
 1516  
Primary aim 1: To compare the 12 -week mean percentage reduction in weight in 1517  
participants, who following completion of the original 1 -year trial, are randomly assigned 1518  
to receive liraglutide 3.0 mg/d combined with phentermine 15 mg/d versus li raglutide 3.0 1519  
mg/d combined with placebo.   1520  
 1521  
H1: The combination of liraglutide 3.0 mg and phentermine 15 mg/d will produce [ADDRESS_1026618] -randomiization than will 1523  
liraglutide 3.0 mg combined with placebo (with expe cted mean losses of 3.5% and 0.0%, 1524  
respectively).  1525  
 1526  
Co-primary aim 1: To assess the safety of liraglutide 3.0 mg combined with 1527  
phentermine 15 mg/d, as well as that of liraglutide 3.[ADDRESS_1026619] assessments of safety will be 1529  
conducted, as described in the original protocol for the 1 -year trial.  1530  
 1531  
Endpoints:  1532  
 1533  
Primary  1534  
 1535  
The primary endpoint is change in body weight (i.e., % reduction in randomization  1536  
weight), as measured from randomization (week 0) to week 12.  1537  
 1538  
Secondary  1539  
 1540  
Secondary endpoints include  the proportion of subjects who lose > 5% or > 10% of initial 1541  
weight from randomization to week 12, as well as changes from randomization to week 1542  
12 in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i .e, blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL [ADDRESS_1026620] circumference), glycemic control (i.e., fasting blood 1544  
sugar), mood (PHQ -9), quality of life (i.e, SF -36 and IWQOL -Lite), eating behavior (i.e., 1545  
Eating Inventory, Eating Disorder Examinat ion-Questionnaire, and Yale Food Addiction 1546  
Scale), appetite (i.e., visual analogue scales), sleep (i.e., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]), 1547  
and weight loss satisfaction. (All of these measures were administered in the original 1 - 1548  
year trial.)  1549  
 1550  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 42 
 A secondary an alysis will examine differences between the two randomized groups in 1551  
changes in weight and other outcomes as measured from participants’ original 1552  
randomization values, when starting the original 1 -year trial.  1553

This is a 12 -week, single center,  randomized placebo -controlled, parallel group design 1557  
trial. Participants and investigators will be masked to participants’ assignment to 1558  
phentermine 15 mg/d versus placebo. Participants in both groups will receive liraglutide 1559  
in an open -label manner.  1560  
   1561  
We anticipate that 35 (of 50) participants from the original CMS -Liraglutide group and 1562  
35 (of 50) from the Multi -Component Intervention will be eligible to participate in the [ADDRESS_1026621] to do so. We anticipate that 32 participants in ea ch group 1564  
will complete the 12 -week extension study and that those who receive liraglutide 3.0 mg 1565  
plus phentermine 15.0 mg/d will lose, from randomization to week 12, 3.5 +3.5% of 1566  
initial weight, compared with 0.0 +0.5% for those assigned to liraglutide plus placebo.  1567  
 1568  
All participants in the extension study will meet with a physician or nurse practitioner at 1569  
randomization (week 0) and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. On each occasion they will review 1570  
patients’ blood pressure and pulse, assess suicidal ideation, and re cord and respond 1571  
appropriately to reports of changes in physical health. As during the 1 -year prior trial, 1572  
brief lifestyle counseling (15 min) will provided at monthly visits (excluding week 2) by [ADDRESS_1026622] 6 months of both the CMS -Liraglutide and Multi -Component 1576  
interventions.   1577  
 1578  
Following the 12 -week randomized tria l, phentermine (or placebo) will be terminated, 1579  
and all participants will continue to receive liraglutide 3.0 mg/d for an additional 8 weeks 1580  
(i.e., weeks 12 -20) and have lifestyle counseling and medical assessments at weeks 16 1581  
and 20. Liraglutide 3.0 mg/d will be terminated at week 20, and participants will have a 1582  
final safety assessment at week 24.  1583  
 1584  
Rationale for Study Design  1585  
 1586  
The proposed study will provide only 12 weeks of treatment with the combination of 1587  
liraglutide 3.0 mg/d and phentermine 15 mg/d. Th e limited duration is based on 1588  
phentermine’s only being approved by [CONTACT_750140] -term use, commonly interpreted 1589  
as 12 weeks. Our adherence to this duration of use should limit participants’ exposure to 1590  
any unknown (and unexpected) risks. We believe, h owever, that the [ADDRESS_1026623] a signal that the combination is effective in increasing 1592  
weight loss and that it is generally safe. The trial will provide valuable pi[INVESTIGATOR_750117] 1593  
could form the basis of larger study, capable of fully assessing the long -term safety and 1594  
efficacy of the combination 1595  
 1596  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 43 
 Our study does not include a comparison of liraglutide 3.0 mg alone to phentermine 15 1597  
mg alone, because we are using liraglutide as a background treatment for all participants  1598  
to determine whether the addition of phentermine 15 mg/d increases weight loss, as [ADDRESS_1026624], the study contains no comparative 1600  
assessments of the benefits of liraglutide 3.0 mg vs phentermine 15 mg alone, in  the same 1601  
manner that the recent lorcaserin plus phentermine study did not directly compare the 1602  
efficacy of the two medications.50 1603  
   1604  
Study Population:  1605  
 1606  
All participants from the original CMS -Liraglutide and Multi -Component Intervention 1607  
groups who complete  the 1 -year trial – and have remained on liraglutide 3.0 mg/d - will 1608  
be potentially eligible to enroll in the 12 -week extension study, immediately upon 1609  
completing the prior 1 -year trial. (Participants in the CMS -Alone group will not be 1610  
eligible to particip ate in the randomized trial. However, they will be offered 6 additional, 1611  
monthly brief lifestyle counseling visits, through week 20 of the extension study.) 1612  
Participants eligible for the extension study will sign a new consent form, apprising them 1613  
of the p otential risks and benefits of treatment with liraglutide plus phentermine (or 1614  
placebo). Prior to randomization, they all will complete a brief history and physical [ADDRESS_1026625] acceptable blood 1616  
pressure and  pulse, using the same criteria employed in the original study. (Participants in [ADDRESS_1026626] the assessment conducted at 1619  
the 1-year visit in the original study.)  1620  
 1621  
This study is open to men and women with obesity who meet the criteria described in the 1622  
original protocol (i.e., inclusion/exclusion).  1623  
 1624  
Rationale for study population  1625  
 1626  
The study population has been selected to be con sistent with those for which the US FDA 1627  
approved liraglatide 3.0 mg/d and approved phentermine 15.0 mg/d.  1628  
 1629  
Number of subjects to be randomized: 70 (from the [ADDRESS_1026627] completed)  1631  
 1632  
Planned number of subjects to b e screened: approximately 85 -90 (i.e., all participants in 1633  
the two liraglutide treated conditions who complete the 1 -year trial – and remain on 1634  
liraglutide 3.0 - will be invited to participate in the 12 -week extension study).  1635  
 1636  
Planned number of subjects t o be treated in run -in period: No run -in period  1637  
 1638  
Planned number of subjects to be randomized to study medication(s): 35 randomized to 1639  
liraglutide plus phentermine and 35 to liraglutide plus placebo.  1640  
 1641  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 44 
 Inclusion Criteria  1642  
 1643  
 Inclusion criteria are those described for the original 1 -year trial (enumerated above). [ADDRESS_1026628] a BMI > 27 kg/m2, with or without co -morbidities, to be eligible to par ticipate in the [ADDRESS_1026629] met BMI inclusion criteria when they initiated 1647  
the use of liraglutide and now will use it, potentially with phentermine 15 mg/d, to [ADDRESS_1026630] weight. (Liraglutide is ap proved for chronic weight 1649  
management, including following successful weight loss.) We do not wish to enroll 1650  
participants with a BMI < 27 kg/m2 because of the possibility that they could reduce 1651  
substantially below a BMI of 24.9 kg/m2, the upper limit of “no rmal” weight.  1652  
 1653  
Exclusion Criteria  1654  
 1655  
Exclusion criteria will include those listed in the original protocol, including those 1656  
specific to the use of liraglutide 3.0 mg/d (e.g., family history of medullary thyroid 1657  
cancer).  1658  
 1659  
Additional exclusion criteria added to the 12 -week extension study are specific to the use 1660  
of phentermine 15 mg/d. They include:  [ADDRESS_1026631] 2 weeks  1663  
2. Glaucoma  1664  
3. Presence or history of marked agitation  1665  
4. History of drug abuse  1666  
5. Known hypersensitivity to sympatho mimetic amines  1667  
6. Current use of selective serotonin re -uptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, 1668  
etc) 1669  
7. Current use of any other weight loss medications (besides liraglutide 3.0 mg/d)  1670  
8. History of coronary artery disease  1671

   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 47 
 Screening Procedures  
 
All participants in the CMS -Liraglutide and Multi -Component interventions will be 
informed of the 12 -week extension study at the time of their 48 -week visit for the original 
1-year trial (i.e., 1 month before the trial’s conclusion). They will be apprised of the study 
extension by [CONTACT_750141] (who include physicians, nurse practitioners, and 
registered dietitians). The coach will explain the extension study and answer any 
questions concerning it. Participants interested in participating in the stu dy will meet, 
immediately following their coaching visit, with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_750118]’ likely appropriateness for the study and  
obtain written informed consent from the participant. (Participant s in the CMS -Alone 
group will be informed of the extension, randomized controlled trial and told that it is 
only open to participants in the two medication groups. They also will be informed of the 
opportunity to receive 5 additional monthly counseling vis its [weeks 4 -20] and provide 
informed consent if they wish to continue to participate.)  
Screening Visit  
 
Participants who wish to participate in the extension randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
will meet at week 52 (of the original trial) with a study physi cian or nurse practitioner for 
the final medical visit of the 1 -year trial (see Table 1 from the original 1 -year protocol). 
The practitioner will further assess the participants’ eligibility for the extension study, 
and an EKG will be conducted to ensure t hat the participant has no cardiac abnormalities. 
Blood pressure and pulse will be checked to ensure that they are within the upper limit of 
normal (< 160/100 mm Hg, with a resting pulse no greater than 85 beats per minute 
(BPM), given the possible effects  of both liraglutide and phentermine in increasing heart 
rate). All participants also will have a blood draw at week 52 to examine cardiometabolic 
risk factors (described in the original protocol), as well as standard blood chemistries 
(e.g., liver functio n tests).  
 
Randomization Visit  
 
Participants who appear to meet all eligibility criteria (to be confirmed by [CONTACT_750142]) will be scheduled the following week for a randomization visit for the 
extension study. They will be instructed to con tinue to take liraglutide 3.0 mg/d for the 
week between the screening visit and the randomization visit.  
 
Participants’ eligibility status, as well as completion of all questionnaires from the week 
52 visit (from the original 1 -year trial), will be examine d a final time at the beginning of 
the randomization visit. Participants who remain fully eligible will be randomly assigned 
to the two medication interventions in equal numbers (i.e., 1:1 ratio). The randomization 
will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ken Rockwell, di rector of the Investigational Drug Service at 
Penn. The randomization will be from stratified blocks, based on whether participants 
lost >10 of initial weight during the 1 -year trial. This will control for any influence that 
prior treatment arm had on pati ents’ end -of-treatment weight loss and ensure that the two 
groups are balanced (on prior weight loss) at the outset of the extension study. 
 
   Version 3. [ADDRESS_1026632] patients in the two treatment groups in 
the continued use of liraglutide 3.0 and in the addition of the second medication, which 
will be presented in capsule form. Participants will be encouraged to take both 
medications in the morning up on awakening.  
 
Phentermine will be provided as 8.0mg/d for the first 2 weeks to facilitate its acceptance 
to participants. The dose will be increased at week 4 to 15 mg/d (or further placebo) in all 
participants. Phentermine (or placebo) will be down -titrated (back to 8.0mg/d) or 
terminated in patients who report that they cannot tolerate the medication after a 
prolonged effort to do so.  Down -titration will be managed in a blinded manner by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Rockwell, in response to notification from the principal inves tigator (or study co -
investigators) of patients’ complaints of symptoms. (With [CONTACT_750153], we successfully 
used this titration method in a prior randomized placebo -controlled trial of sibutramine 
for weight loss.46) Participants in whom phentermine (or p lacebo) is terminated will 
continue to receive liraglutide 3.0 mg/d in an open -label manner, as they have for the 
prior year.   
 
Following randomization, all participants also will have an individual lifestyle 
intervention session with their provider to review their diet and physical activity goals  
Lifestyle Counseling Visits – All Groups  
 
Participants in both medication groups in the extension study (i.e.,liragltide + 
phentermine vs liraglutide + placebo) will receive the same program of diet, physical 
activity, and behavior therapy, as provided during the last 6 months of the original 1 -year 
trial. All participants will be provided 4 brief (15 min), face -to-face visits during the 12 
weeks, with visit scheduled at weeks 0 (randomization), 4, 8, and 12. L ifestyle counseling 
will be delivered by a physician, nurse practitioner (NP) or a registered dietitian (RD) or 
behavioral psychologist, the latter working incident to an NP or physician. (Participants 
in the CMS -Alone group will be eligible for this same schedule of lifestyle counseling 
visits.)  
 
Participants who weigh <250 lb will be prescribed a diet of 1200 -1499 kcal/d, comprised 
of conventional foods, with approximately 15 -20% kcal from protein, 20 -35% from fat, 
and the remainder from carbohydrate. (Th ose who weigh >250 lb will be prescribed 
1500 -1800 kcal/d.) They will be instructed to continue to record their food and calorie 
intake daily, using paper -and-pencil diaries or on -line trackers (including MyFitnessPal 
or Lose -It).  
 
All individuals will be  instructed to continue to engage in low -to-moderate intensity 
physical activity (principally walking or similar aerobic activity) [ADDRESS_1026633] 180 minutes per week and preferably >225 minutes/week.  Subjects will be 
instructed to record t heir activity daily and will receive a traditional pedometer (Yamax, 
Digi-Walker) if they do not own a smart phone, Fitbit, or other device with which to track 
their steps.  
 
   Version 3. [ADDRESS_1026634]’s weight, will be 
followed for phone -delivered sessions as for face -to-face meetings. A  growing body of 
evidence indicates that phone -delivered lifestyle counseling is as effective as face -to-face 
meetings. 
Medical Monitoring Visits  
 
Following randomization, all participants in both medication groups will have brief 
medical assessments (5 -10 minutes) with a physician or nurse practitioner at weeks 2, 4, 
8, and 12. At each medical assessment, participant’s weight and vital signs will be 
measured and their response to the medication will be assessed.  Study subjects will be 
asked whether there h ave been any changes in their health or medications. For all non -
study -related medical events, participants will be referred to their own primary care 
providers. Participants also will be asked about their mood or any thoughts of harming 
themselves, as assessed by [CONTACT_48649] -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).27 In 
the event of reports of suicidal ideation or disturbances in mood, participants will be 
referred to the study’s psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation, as appropriate.   
 
Liraglutide 3.0 mg Continuation Study from Weeks 12 to 20  
 
At the end of week 12 (post -randomization), phentermine and placebo will be terminated, 
but both groups will remain on liraglutide 3.0 mg/d until week 20. Participants will 
continue to have both life style counseling and medical visits at weeks 16 and 20 (and 
those in CMS Alone will be offered counseling visits on the same schedule). We wish to 
observe, from weeks 12 to 20, the change in body weight that occurs with the termination 
of phentermine 15 mg /d. At week 20, liraglutide also will be terminated in all 
participants. At week 24 (post -randomization), all participants will have a final 
assessment with a physician or nurse practitioner to determine participants’ health status.  
 
Assessments for Effic acy 
 
Participants will attend 2 major outcome assessment visits, conducted at randomization 
(the week 52 visit of the 1 -year trial) and week 12.   
Primary Efficacy Measure  
 
The primary outcome is % reduction in initial body weight, as measured from 
randomi zation to week 12. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of participants 
who at week 12 lose >5% or >10% of randomization weight. Body weight will be 
measured on a digital scale (to the nearest 0.1 kg) with participants dressed in light 
clothing, witho ut shoes. Two measurements will be taken on each occasion and averaged. 
Weight will be measured by [CONTACT_750143]’ treatment conditions.  
Secondary Efficacy Measures   
 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 50 
 The secondary efficacy measures, to be assessed at week 12 of the extension study, 
include changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (i.e., blood pressure, 
triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and waist circumference), glycemic control (i.e.,  
fasting blood sugar), mood (PHQ -9), quality of life (i.e., SF -36 and IWQOL -Lite), eating 
behavior (i.e., Eating Inventory, Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire, and Yale 
Food Addiction Scale), appetite (i.e., visual analogue scales), sleep (i.e., Pit tsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index), and satisfaction with weight loss. All of these measures are described in 
the original protocol.   
 
A secondary analysis will examine differences between the two randomized groups in 
changes in weight and other outcomes as mea sured from participants’ original 
randomization values, when starting the original 1 -year trial.  
 
Changes in weight from week 12 to week 20, when participants receive liraglutide alone, 
will be examined using descriptive statistics.  
 
Assessments for Safety  
 
Safety endpoints include physical examination, adverse events (AEs), standard laboratory 
tests, and mental health/suicidal behavior as assessed by [CONTACT_750144] (C -SSRS). As detailed above, participants in all three groups al so will have 
brief medical visits (5 -10 minutes) with a physician or nurse practitioner at weeks 2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, and 20 (total of 6 visits). At each medical visit, participant’s response to the 
medication will be assessed.  Study subjects will be asked whether there has been any 
change in their health or medications. They also will be asked about their mood or any 
thoughts of harming themselves, as determined by [CONTACT_941] C -SSRS. In the event of adverse 
mental health events, partic ipants will be referred to the study’s psychologist or 
psychiatrist for further evaluation, if required. For all non -study -related medical events, 
participants will be referred to their own primary care provider.  
 
Participants will have fasting blood draw s (comprehensive metabolic panel, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], etc) at 
screening and week 12 of the extension study. Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) and 
weights will be measured at weeks 0 (randomization) and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.  
 
Subject Compliance  
 
We will measur e subject’s medication adherence to liraglutide using injection counts 
from visual inspection of the dose counter taken from subjects’ injection pens. Patients 
will be instructed to bring the pen to each session, and we will record missed doses and 
problem  solve with patients if they are missing doses. We will track adherence to 
phentermine/placebo by [CONTACT_750145]. Patients 
will be instructed to keep a medication diary, as part of their food and activity monitoring.  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
Sample Size Calculation  
 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 51 
 At week 12 of the extension study, subjects assigned to liraglutide -phentermine are 
predicted to lose 3.5% (SD=3.5) of randomization weight, while those assigned to 
liraglutide -placebo are expected to lo se 0.0% (SD=0.5). (Both values will be measured as 
change from randomization to week [ADDRESS_1026635] in the prior 1 -year 
trial.) These estimates are based on the results previously described by [CONTACT_750146] a 
study of phentermine plus topi[INVESTIGATOR_750119] a study of Smith et al in a study of phentermine 
combined with loracserin.49,50 Using a sample size equation for longitudinal clustered 
samples, a randomization sample of 35 subjects in liraglutide -phentermine and 35 
subjects in liraglutide -placebo provides >80% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference (p < 0.05, two ta iled test) between the two groups. This estimate allows for 
10% attrition during the 12 -week trial, resulting in approximately 32 treatment 
completers per group. (The 10% attrition level is conservative; all participants will have 
demonstrated that they ar e highly adherent as a result of completing the prior 1 -year trial.  
The ITT longitudinal statistical design will further improve power by [CONTACT_750147] -completers and the adjustment of possible variance 
reducing baseline  covariates. All secondary analyses will be considered exploratory and 
evaluated at the alpha = 0.05 level. The power analysis was conducted using PASS 11.  
Statistical Methods  
 
Preliminary Analyses  
 
All data analyses will proceed using the same principles and methods described in the 
Statistical Methods section of the original protocol.  
 
Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analyses are planned (in order to maintain full power for the end -of-study 
comparison s). 
 
Explorative Statistical Analysis for Pharmacogenetics and Biomarkers  
 
No explorative statistical analysis for pharmacogenetics and biomarkers will be 
performed.  
 
Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  
 
The same procedures will be used to address these issu es as used in the original trial.  
 
Ethics:  
 
The same procedures will be used to address these issues as used in the original trial.

For the randomized extension trial, participants assigned to liraglutide -phentermine, as 
well as phentermine -placebo, will need 91 doses (13 weeks  x 7 doses per week) of 
liraglutide. (This includes 1 week of liraglutide to be used between the screening vi sit [at 
week 52] and the randomization visit [at week 0]). Subjects will be provided with a 30 -
day supply of medication (5 pens) at randomization and weeks 4 and 8. Liraglutide will 
be provided in an open -label manner, as it was throughout the 1 -year prior  trial. 
 
At the randomization visit (week 0), participants in both medication groups will be 
provided 15 identical capsules containing either phentermine 8.0 mg/d or placebo 
(depending upon their treatment assignment). Upon returning at week 2, they will b e 
provided 15 additional capsules containing either phentermine 15.0 mg or placebo. At 
week 4, and again at week 8, all participants will be provided 30 capsules containing 
phentermine 15.0 mg or placebo.    
 
Following completion of the 12 -week extension trial, all participants will discontinue 
phentermine (or placebo) but will remain on liraglutide 3.0 mg/d for an additional 8 
weeks. Participants will require an additional 56 doses (8 weeks x 7 doses per week)  of 
liraglutide from weeks 12 to 20. Participants will be provided a 30 -day supply (5 pens) at 
both weeks 12 and 16.  
Study Medications  
 
The study medications are liraglutide 3.0 mg/d and phentermine 15.0 mg/d (or placebo).   
Packaging and Labelling of Study Medications  
 
Liraglutide will be packaged, labelled, and distributed to patients, as it was during the [ADDRESS_1026639] box.  
Study  drug will be shipped to the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at the 
University of Pennsylvania (attention [CONTACT_750152]) for labeling and packaging. The 
study drug supplies will be labeled appropriate to their use. The label for the study drug 
will contain at a minimum:  
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 53 
  Protocol number  
 Kit identification number from the randomization scheme  
 Instructions for use  
 Study drug name  
 
[CONTACT_750151] (and placebo) will be purchased and then packaged in blinded capsules by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ken Rockwell, director of the Inve stigational Drug Service at Penn. [CONTACT_750153] has 
prepared medications before for our Center in this manner. [CONTACT_750153] will store all 
phentermine -placebo at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], to be pi[INVESTIGATOR_545645] a weekly basis by [CONTACT_750148].   
  
Storage and Drug Accountability of Study Medication  
 
The same procedures will be used to address these issues as used in the original trial.  
 
Randomization and Blinding  
 
[CONTACT_750154] from Penn’s Investigational Drug Service will generate the 
randomization code. The first subject to meet the treatment criteria will be assigned the 
first number in the sequence; each subsequent subject to meet treatment criteria will be 
assigned the next number in the sequence. This study combines the open -label provision 
of liraglutide with blinded assignment to phentermine or placebo.  
Breaking of Blinded Codes  
 
[CONTACT_750153] will be prepared to break the blinded code in the event of pati ent 
emergency.  
 
Concomitant Illnesses and Medications:  
 
At trial entry (i.e., the screening visit), we will record details of any concomitant illness 
(i.e., any illness that is present at the start of the trial) that is present and concomitant 
medication (i.e., any medication other than the trial product(s) that is taken during the 
trial, including the screening and run -in periods) in each patient’s record. The information 
collected for each concomitant medication will include the start date, stop date or 
continuing, and indication. For each concomitant illness, we will record the date of onset, 
date of resolution or continuing. Any changes in concomitant medication use will be 
recorded at each visit. If the change influences the subject’s eligibility to co ntinue in the 
trial, the Sponsor will be informed.  
 
 
Adverse Events:  
 
At each contact [CONTACT_108804], study personnel will be responsive to reports of adverse 
events with specific questioning and, as outlined in the procedures section, by [CONTACT_750149]. The investigator will be report all adverse events including serious adverse 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 54 
 events (SAE), suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), serious adverse 
drug reactions (SADRs) (as defined below) to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
establ ished for the trial, and to the Penn IRB. Information on all adverse events will be 
recorded immediately in the source document and reported immediately, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). Information on study 
name, patient identification, event (i.e., diagnosis, causality), drug, and reporter 
identification (e.g., name) will be collected and recorded in the source document (as 
detailed below). All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1026640].  
 
The PI a nd his investigative team acknowledge the definition of adverse events (AEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and other untoward occurrences as spelled out below.  
 
Adverse Event (AE):  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investi gation subject 
administered/using a product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, o r disease 
temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the 
product.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:  
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically 
significant i.e. an abno rmality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a 
severity that requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial 
product, more frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening* experience  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57656]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenit al anomaly/birth defect  
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_508454]  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require  
  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508453], based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, th ey may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
*The term life -threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if 
it was more severe.  
 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 55 
 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A S[LOCATION_003]R is an SAE 
which is unexpected and regarding as possibly or probably related  to the trial/study 
product by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 
(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the event is 
suspected. The ADR should be classified as serious  if it meets one or more of the 
seriousness criteria.  
 
Medical Events of Special Interest (MESI):  A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. 
wrong drug administration or wrong route of administration) or (2 ) a suspected 
transmission of an infectious agent via the product  
 
Non-Serious Adverse Event:  
A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.  
 
Severity Assessment Definitions:  
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  
 
Relationship to study medication Assessment Definitions:  
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial pro duct 
 
The US PI [INVESTIGATOR_750111].  
 
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_750150]  
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the 
event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial  
• Recovered with sequelae:  As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered 
with sequelae should be rated as an SAE  
• Not recovered  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
 
 
Collection, Recording and R eporting of Adverse Events  
   Version 3. [ADDRESS_1026641] has signed the informed consent and until 
the end of the posttreatment follow -up period as stated in the protocol.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
During and following subjects’ participation in the study, the investigator and institution 
will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study -related adverse 
events, including cli nically significant laboratory values related to the study. (Note: This 
section of the protocol will be written in consultation with Penn’s IRB, Office of 
Research Services, and Office of Legal Affairs. It will be addressed pending approval of 
the scientif ic aspects of the study.)  
 
Pregnancy  
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become 
pregnant. The investigator will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during 
the trial period. Reporting of pregnancy by t he investigator will occur within the same 
timelines described above for reporting of Adverse Events. Pregnancy complications will 
be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this 
will be reported and followed up as  a serious adverse event.  
 
Precautions/Over -dosage  
In case of suspected overdose, subjects will be instructed to call their healthcare provider 
immediately, as excessive intake of Saxenda may cause severe nausea and vomiting.  
 
Liability and Subject Insurance:  
Liability and subject insurance have been addressed in the contract that governed the 
original 1 -year trial. These conditions will continue in the 12 -week extension study.  
 
Evaluability of Subjects:  
Participants will be excluded from data analysis in the event of pregnancy, amputation, 
bariatric surgery, or death.  Additional criteria associated with subject censorship will be 
considered prior to initiating recruitment.  
 
Premature Termination of Study:  
We believe that it is highly unlikely that the study will be terminated prematurely, given 
the safety of the intervention and its expected effects. Termination would be considered, 
however, in view of:  
 Unacceptable safety concerns of the study medication  
 The benefits observed do not ethically permit the trial to continue  
 
Publication Plan:  
We will register the study with a publicly assessable database such as clinicaltrials.gov.  
An initial report of the findings will be presented at an annual scientific meeting (e.g., 
American Diabetes Associa tion, The Obesity Society, The American Heart Association). 
We plan to publish the study results approximately 6 months after study completion.  
 
   Version 3. 3   September 25, 2018  Page 57 
  
The report of the primary outcome likely will be submitted to the International Journal of 
Obesity or the jou rnal Obesity. The study’s short duration and small sample size make 
these journals the most appropriate outlets for publication.

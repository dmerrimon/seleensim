Currently men with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal 
examination (DRE) undergo systematic sampling of the prostate with transrectal 
ultras ound (TRUS) -guided needle biopsies. PSA and DRE have low specificity for 
prostate cancer  (PCa), and TRUS biopsies have an approximately 30% false negative 
rate. Whether a quantitative detection specfic magnetic resonance imagi ng (MRI) 
protocol improves PCa  detection in biopsy naïve men is not adequately studied.  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_491041] a novel detection specific MRI protocol which uses image collection and  post-processing to assist the radiologist find areas of the prostate with 
increased suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491042]. Men with an MRI negative for 
cancer will undergo standard of care TRUS biopsies, and men with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491043] (as defined by [CONTACT_77886]) will undergo biopsies of these lesions in addition to systematic TRUS biopsies. We will compare the yield of significant PCa  
between systematic sampling and MRI determined areas of the prostate.

2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  
While there is concern for over -treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) it remains the 2nd 
leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men  (1). This paradox is due in part to the 
accu racy limitations of current detection methods of serum prostate specific antigen 
(PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) screening, and the inability of current clinical 
information to discriminate indolent from aggressive tumors. Clinical patient 
characteristics including age, race, family history of PCa, DRE, and prior negative 
prostate biopsy history have been combined into a predictive calculator to guid biopsy 
decisions (2). Men found to have adequate suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491044]  a tissue diagnosis. 
Standard PCa det ection relies on 12- core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy 
that samples anatomic zones of the prostate gland. Approximately 35% of men undergoing immediate radical prostatectomy (RP) for low grade PCa on standard biopsy will be found to have higher grade tum ors in the pathologic specimen( 3). 
Furthermore, between 30- 38% of men with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491045] a negative 
standard biopsy will be diagnosed with PCa on re- biopsy (4). Finally, TRUS biopsy is an 
invasive procedure with a rate of sepsis as high as 2%, and this risk is proportional to 
the number of biopsy cores sampled( 5). With a more precise method for  early detection 
of the most aggressive tumors, men with indolent PCa could be sp ared treatment with 
its associated cost and morbidities and instead be managed conservatively with active 
surveillance (AS), while those with potentially lethal  disease could be expediently 
referred for radiation or surgery with curative intent.  
Improved P Ca detection may be particularly  important for African American (AA) men, 
who are almost twice as likely to die from PCa as white men( 1). A recent study of men 
with very low risk PCa based on clinical information who underwent immediate RP 
found that AA men were more likely to have adverse RP pathology and anteriorly 
located tumors not reached with s tandard TRUS prostate biopsies (6). In addition, two 
series of men selected for AS based on standard clinical information reported that AA 
men progressed to treatment faster than white men( 7, 8). These data have quest ioned 
the safety of managing AA men with AS without more accurate risk stratification  tools 
such as imaging . At UIC, over 60% of PCa cases diagnosed are in AA men.  
Standard TRUS  imaging does not provide enough resolution to localize most PCa, 
much less pro vide information about its aggressiveness.  One promising approach to 
improve PCa detection and risk stratification is through advanced imaging such as 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  In this setting an ideal imaging study would 
differentiate aggressive PCa from indolent PCa and benign processes such as 
hyperplasia (BPH) or inflammation as well as localize the aggressive PCa to reduce 
biopsy sampling error . Currently in the US, prostate mpMRI is approved for : 1) men 
with continued suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491046] 2) for staging of known 
high risk PCa for treatment planning. The images from the mpMRI can be used for 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
[Prostate Cancer Detection Using a Quantitative Screening MRI Protocol  Version 1.0 
Page 5 of 19 1/24/201 9 
targeted biopsies using TRUS/mpMRI imaging fusion to improve PCa detection( 9). As 
such, there is interest in using mpMRI as a confirmatory test in men with elevated PSA 
and prior to the first biopsy to improve biopsy accuracy  and potentially obviate the need 
for unnecessary  “random”  biopsies. A landmark study conducted in Europe, t he 
PRECISION tria l, recently reported that TRUS/mpMRI fusion biopsies  in biopsy naive 
men with suspected PCa resulted in an increase in the absolute detection of clinically significant PCa of 12% in men randomized to mpMRI, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 28% of the men in this 
group avoiding biopsy due to a negative study (10). These data are certainly compelling, 
but have yet to be replicated in a US population, and particularly i n a high- risk group 
such as AA men.  The implications in the US are significant as approximately  1 million 
TRUS biopsies are performed annually for known or sus pected PCa (11). 
While MRI protocols are variable and evolving, the current recommended standard is 
combining T2- weighted anatomical imaging (T2WI) with two functional MRI techniques, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_491047]- weighted images (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced images 
(DCE), together to create a multi- parameter MRI (mpMRI) study . A radiologist reviews 
the imaging and assigns a semi -qualitative suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491048] a 1- 5 Likert 
scale. This score, called the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI -RADS), is 
an attempt to standardize mpMRI assessment and guide cli nical management (12). 
ThePI-RADS has several limitations including  modest inter -rater reliability (13, 14), and a 
false positive rate of as high as 88% of the PI -RADS 3 (indeter minate) scores ( figure 1).   
Currently the same prostate MRI protocols are used for PCa detection in men with prior 
negative TRUS biopsies, staging of known PCa, and for suspected PCa local 
recurrence after treatment. As such, the protocol contains several imaging sequences such as T1 
weighted imaging to detect hemorrhage related to 
biopsy and DCE which is of limited value for PCa detection which add to the study time and 
cost(15). In addition, the fields of view of pr ostate 
MRI protocols are designed to show surrounding 
structures such as the pelvic lymph nodes for staging purposes which aren’t applicable to the primary PCa detection setting. These 
larger fields of view come at the expense of longer study times, and lower imaging detail 
in the prostate.  
Finally, current prostate MRI protocols are designed for qualitative assessment and PI -
RADS scoring. A detection specific protocol can be designed so that quantitative parameters can be measured as an adjunct to PI -RADS  scoring.  We hypothesize that 
quantitative tools for image assessment could benefit radiologists to further characterize indeterminate MRI studies, and to facilitate comparisons across patients, centers, and 
populations.

Our study explores 2 ways  to improve mpMRI for 
PCa detection: 1) Developi[INVESTIGATOR_491049]ïve men with 
suspected PCa and 2) improving utility of the 
collected images with quantitative image analysis 
tools as an adjunct to PI -RADS. DWI characterizes 
the Brownian movement of water molecules in tissues. Conventional DWI fits a line to data acquired using two strengths (b- values) of the magnetic 
diffusion gradient, the slope of which is the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) which can be used as a 
quantitative parameter. When compared to RP histology, ADC has a moderate inverse correlation with PCa grade( ref ADC and grade ). With conventional DWI the calculation 
of ADC assumes a gaussian distribution of water molecule diffusion and tissue homogeneity which may oversimplify water motion in organs with complex tissue structures. A technique that more accurately determines water diffusion throug h tissues 
may better discriminate cancer grade.  As such, we have tested stretched exponential 
(SEM) and kurtosis models of DWI with high b -values to determine the grade of PCa in 
[ADDRESS_631311] PI -RADS 
scoring. We found accuracy as measured by [CONTACT_491062] 
(AUC) that is significantly improved over PI -RADS, the PBCG model, and modestly 
improved over conventional ADC (F igure 2). Therefore, we propose to prospectively use 
quantitative DWI as a biomarker to determine regions of the prostate suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491050]ïve men.  
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims 
 
This study aims to determine whether a detection specific MRI protocol with quantitative 
image analysis can improve high grade PCa detection in men with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491051] . 
 
Aim 1: Design a PCa detection specific MRI protocol which will facilitate 
quantitative image analysis and reduce study time by ~50%  
  
Current prostat e mpMRI protocols include image sequences and fields of view outside 
of the prostate gland and its immediate surrounding that are not useful for PCa 
detection. We will create a detection specific MRI protocol featuring: smaller fields of 
view zoomed to the  prostate, T2 weighted imaging at multiple echo times, chemical 
exchange saturation transfer imaging (CEST), and DWI at higher b values (up to 4000) 
that will allow for quantitative prediction of high grade PCa. The exact imaging 
acquisition parameters can be found in Appendix 3. We expect this MRI protocol to

reduce study (acquisition) time fro m approximately [ADDRESS_631312] including systemic fibrosis, and patient discomfort.  
 
Aim 2: Determine the accuracy of the novel  MRI protocol for detection of high 
grade PCa  
 
50 men with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491052] (elevated PSA and/or abnormal DRE) will be 
enrolled into a prospective protocol and will undergo detection protocol MRI described 
in Aim 1. Quantitative image analyses will be performed to generate SEM maps of DWI. 
Areas of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491053] (GS ≥7)  will be targeted for biopsy. Men with MRI

The study investigators and clinical research coordinator will screen the scheduled 
encounters at the Urology clinics at UI Health for potentially eligible subjects meeting 
the inclusion criteria. No advertising materials will be used. No data will be collected 
from men screened but not enrolled. The clinical research coordinator will discuss  the 
study risks and benefits  and obtain informed consent separate from the study 
investigators to minimize coercion.  
 
5.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 This will be a single arm prospective clinical trial. Men with clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491055]. All eligible men wil l be screened and enrolled by [CONTACT_88018]. Enrolled men 
will undergo de tection protocol MRI  at the UIC Advanced Imaging Center (AIC)  prior to 
diagnostic biopsy. The image acquisition parameters are listed in the Appendix  3.  The 
MRI w ill be processed by [CONTACT_491064][INVESTIGATOR_491056] a board certified clinical radiologist ([CONTACT_221775]). Subjects with MRI with no 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491057] [ADDRESS_631316] each 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491058]/TRUS fusion biopsies (maximum of 12 cores). All biopsies will undergo SOC histologic processing and interpretation in pathology. Biopsy results 
will be communicated to the patients by [CONTACT_491065]. This visit will signify the end of the study. See the study schema in Figure 4 .  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

The primary outcome will be the rate of detection of high grade PCa on a per -patient 
and per biopsy core basis. The detection rate will be compared between patients with 
and without evidence of high grade PCa  (GS ≥7)  based on the detection protocol MRI. 
Secondarily we will analyze the accuracy of the individual MRI parameters including: T2 
imaging, ADC, the SEM parameters (DDC and α), the FROC parameters ( µ, ∆, β), the 
Kurtosis model parameters (D, K), and PI -RADS score.  
 
 
7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits 
 
The study intervention is the detection protocol MRI and all other aspects of the study 
are standard of care. The detection protocol MRI is a minimal risk procedure as it does 
not require intravenous contrast and does not expose the subject to ionizing radiation. 
Also, in contrast to the aforementioned PRECISION study, patients not found to have 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_491059] 12 core TRUS

prostate biopsy thereby [CONTACT_491066] a missed or delayed PCa 
diagnosis.  
 The risks of the study are t herefore mild anxiety due to the MRI examination itself, and 
violation of patient privacy due mishandling of protected health information.  
Anxiety related to the MRI study, if mild, may be treated with an oral anxiolytic by [CONTACT_67441] (Dr. A bern) or the patient’s primary care physician as is SOC. 
Severe anxiety precluding MRI without intravenous sedation or general anesthesia will be a reason to exclude a patient from the study. If this severe anxiety is discovered during the MRI, the study and the patient’s involvement in the research will be terminated. Health information will be secure in REDCap, principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_491060].  
 
The benefits of the study may include: improved detection rate of high grade PCa and 
lower complication rates compared to standard TRUS [ADDRESS_631317] including: age (continuous in years), 
self reported race (white, black, Hispanic, other), family history of prostate cancer 
(positive or negative), serum PSA (continuous, in ng/mL), International Prostat e 
Symptoms Score (IPSS: continuous), Sexual Health Inventory for Men score (SHIM: 
continuous). All source MRI images from the scanner as well as post -processed images 
will be collected in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. Image  data will be stored on a password protected server and physically transported 
from the scanner to the post -processing workstation and to the radiologist workstation 
using an encrypted flash drive. Data from interpretation of the MRI images to be stored 
in REDCap will include: PI -RADS score (ordinal), number of lesions (ordinal), and the 
lesion mean, median, minimum and maximum for each quantitative MRI parameter if 
applicable. In addition, if applicable each lesion will be outlined on the T2 weighted 
image  series by [CONTACT_491067].  At the time of biopsy the 
prostate volume (continuous, cubic centimeters), type of biopsy (standard or targeted), 
and number of biopsy cores obtained (ordinal) will be entered in REDCap. Pathology data to be collected and stored in REDCap includes: presence of any carcinoma 
(Boolean), number of biopsy cores involved with carcinoma (ordinal), location of positive 
biopsy cores (ordinal lesion number), and maximum GS of biopsies (categorical:

6,7,8,9, or 10). At the biopsy results visit, biopsy complications will be recorded in 
REDCap: hematuria persisting greater than 72 hours (boolean), urinary retention 
(boolean), infectious complication (boolean), All data will be de -identified for each 
subject after study visit #4 when the biopsy results are known. We anticipate 
approximately 1 year to meet the enrollment goals. At this time, a 3 month period for  
data analysis of the primary outcome is anticipated. After this time, the de- identifed data 
will be sto red by [CONTACT_34351] ([CONTACT_491070]) for potential use for secondary 
retrospective studies under separate IRB approval.  See Appendix [ADDRESS_631318] 
([CONTACT_221775]). It is possible that a patient would need to undergo a repeat MRI if the data are not adequate for assessment for PCa. All pathologic analysis is subject to the UIC Department of Pathology clinical quality assurance procedures as is the current clinical SOC.  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_631319] a high grade PCa detection rate of approximately 30% or in 17/50 subjects ( 10). The primary outcome will be the comparison of the rate of high 
grade PCa detection based on the 2 possible MRI outcomes: men undergoing standard

12 core TRUS biopsy (detection protocol MRI negative) versus men undergoing MRI 
targeted biopsy (detection protocol MRI positive for lesions). This will be analysed for statistical difference using the chi -square test. Each MRI quantitative parameter will be 
evaluated on a per lesion basis as a predictor of high grade PCa using ROC logistic regression and will be reported as AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The Youden’s Index and 90% fixed sensitivity thresholds of each quanititative parameter will 
be reported. Combinat ions of MRI quantitative and clinical parameters will be combined 
into multinomial logistic regression models for which AUC with 95% CI will be reported. The AUC of the multi -parametric models will be compared iteratively for statistical 
differences using the likelihood ratio test.  
 13.0 Regulatory Requirements  
13.1 Informed Consent   
Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_88018], Ruben Sauer Calvo, in the Urology ambulatory clinics at UI Health. He is an experienced coordinator currently in this role for several other PCa studies at UI Health. He is a native Spanish speaker and will therefore be able to enroll Spanish speaking subjects using the translated consent form. Completed consent documents will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the coordinator’s office in the Urology administrative office in Clinical Sciences North Suite 515.  
13.[ADDRESS_631320] access to the data. The MRI and clinical data will maintain identifiers which is necessary to allow for MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy.  After the biopsy result is reported, approximately [ADDRESS_631321] until the accrual target is met and the data has all been de-identified.  
13.3 Unanticipated Problems  
Any unanticipated problems or protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and the Cancer Protocol Review Committee within 5 business days using OVCR Form 0257. The form will be prepared by [CONTACT_491068]- investigator that discovered the 
problem and will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_978].

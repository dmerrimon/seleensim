2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 FLT3-mutated AML 
 
FLT3  (FMS-like tyrosine kinase III) belongs to the Class III family of receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs; other members of this family include receptors for KIT, FMS, 
and PDGF) 1. Signaling via RTKs is frequently deregulated in hematological  
malignancies 2. FLT3  is expressed on the leukemic cells of 70 –100% of patients with 
AML 3. Additionally, activating mutations in FLT3  are observed in 30% of adult AML 
patients 4. The two FLT3 mutations found in AML include internal tandem 
duplications in the juxta-membrane domain (ITD, 17 –34%) and mutations in the 
tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) activation loop (7%) 5. FLT3  stimulates survival and 
proliferation of leukemic blasts 6. FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with adverse 
prognosis. Patients with FLT3-ITD have significantly elevated p eripheral blood white 
cell counts, increased bone marrow blasts, increased relapse risk, inferior event-free survival (EFS), and decrea sed overall survival (OS) 
7-9. The FLT3-TKD mutations 
have unknown prognostic significance in AML 9.  
 Several small-molecule FLT3  targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are 
undergoing evaluation in phase I, II, and III trials have shown  promising activity as 
single agents and in combination with hypomethylating agents or  chemotherapy. 
These include quizartinib (AC220), sorafenib, midostaurin (PKC4 12), lestaurtinib, and 
crenolanib
10-16. These TKIs act as direct inhibitors of FLT3  via competitive inhibition 
of ATP-binding sites in the FLT3 receptor KD17, 18.   
 FLT3 inhibitors demonstrate potent anti-leukemic activity and i mprove outcomes in 
patients with relapsed/refractory AML and FLT3-ITD  mutations
19. About 40-50% of 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 5 such patients achieve marrow responses to FLT3  inhibitors, with 20-30% bridged to 
allogeneic stem cell transplant. Responses to FLT3  inhibitors last 3-6 months and are 
invariably transient (except among patients who undergo transplantation) due to the 
emergence of resistance20, 21. The primary cause of resistance is the acquisition of 
point mutations in the FLT3 kinase domain (KD). Heidel et al first to identified point 
mutations in the FLT3-ITD KD as a mediator of resistance to the FLT3  inhibitor 
midostaurin. They reported a single amino acid substitution at position 676 (N676K) 
within the FLT3  KD as the sole cause of resistan ce to midostaurin in a patient  with 
AML22. Acquired point mutations in the KD may be preexisting or acqu ired after 
exposure to the FLT3  inhibitors as has been shown with midostaurin22. Homology 
modeling has identified two main types of FLT3  mutations, namely TKD1 mutations 
involving the ATP-binding (hinge regions) and the TKD2 mutation s involving the 
activation loop23.  Non-mutational mechanisms of resistance include up-regulatio n of 
compensatory pathways including the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, FOXO3A, SYK , 
and STAT5/PIM  pathways, up-regulation of the FLT3 ligand or receptor, mutations in 
other kinases (e.g. CBL), activation of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 , MCL1  and BCL-
x(L), and tumor microenvironment mediated resistance23, [ADDRESS_1137511] FLT3 
and the Raf/ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway 
26. Sorafenib is 1000-fold 
more active against ITD mutant FLT3 than wild-type FLT3 in cell  based assays 27. In 
phase I studies, sorafenib potentl y inhibited FLT3-ITD leukemic  blasts. Melzelder et 
al reported clinical activity as a single agent in relapsed FLT3-ITD AML 28. We 
performed a phase I/II study of idarubicin, high-dose cytarabin e and sorafenib in AML 
patients (median age = 53 years) 29. In this study 15 FLT3-ITD patients were enrolled. 
Fourteen patients achieved a CR and 1 patient achieved complete  remission with 
incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). Mutant FLT3 was suppressed in all 10 patients 
evaluated, with fivefold greater suppression of mutant FLT3 as compared to wild-type FLT3 on plasma inhibitory assays 
29. We recently reported the f easibility and efficacy 
of combining hypomethylator therapy (5-azacytidine) with sorafe nib in patients with 
relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD AML 11. A total of 43 patients were treated (93% were 
FLT3-ITD mutated). Patients had received a median of 2 prior th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The response 
rate was 46% including CR, CR p and CRi (complete remission with  incomplete 
recovery of counts). This response rate compares favorably with  expected response 
rates in multiply relapsed AML. 64% of the patients achieved >8 5% FLT3 inhibition 
during their first cycle of therapy. The combination was reason ably well tolerated. 
Although hepatotoxicity was seen, most instances were grade [ADDRESS_1137512] evolved in order t o prevent the 
development and progression o f neoplasia. The majority of the t umor suppressor 
(TSP) and growth regulatory (GRP) proteins mediating these path ways act in the cell 
nucleus downstream of signaling pa thways. Accumulating data sug gest that in order to 
maintain their malignant behavior, neoplastic cells must inacti vate most or all of the 
known TSP and GRP pathways
30. Active nuclear export of TSP/GRP is one very 
efficient and rapid means of overcoming the normal cell cycle a nd genomic instability 
checkpoints mediated by [CONTACT_37400]. Essentially all known T SP/GRP utilize a 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 6 single nonredundant nuclear expor t protein complex in order to exit the nucleus. 
Exportin 1 (XPO1), also called chromosomal region maintenance p rotein 1 (CRM1), is 
the primary component of this export complex, and is overexpres sed in many types of 
cancer31. 
 
 
 
Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE ™ compound  that slowly 
reversibly binds and inactivates XPO1, thereby [CONTACT_820791]/GRP. Transient retention of TSP/GRP in the nucleus at high levels via XPO1 
blockade activates their cell cycle checkpoint and genome surve ying actions. This 
leads to the death of nearly all types of malignant cells, wher eas normal cells undergo 
transient cell cycle arrest and recovery when the export block is released. Garzon et al identified a strong down-regulation of total FLT3 protein expre ssion in primary AML 
samples after XPO-[ADDRESS_1137513]-
transcriptional level
32. Based on these findings, we propose Phase I combination trial  
of FLT3-ITD inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar) and SINE ™ compound (selinexor) in 
relapsed/refractory AML patients. 
 
2.2 Selinexor, a Selective Inhib itor of Nuclear Export / SINE ™ Compound 
 
Selinexor is an oral, first in class, slowly reversible, potent and Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE
™ compound that specifically blocks exportin 1 (XPO1). To 
date, other than XPO1, no targets o f selinexor have been identi fied. Selinexor restores 
many of the tumor suppressor (TSP) and growth regulatory (GRP) proteins to the 
nucleus where they can carry out their normal functions. Seline xor is selectively 
cytotoxic for cells with genomic damage, i.e., for tumor cells,  both in vitro  and in vivo . 
The nuclear export of eIF4E, a protein that binds to the mRNAs of many oncogenic 
and growth-promoting mediators, requires XPO1 for transport to cytoplasmic 
ribosomes.  Selinexor blocks the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of eIF4E, preventing 
translation of the eIF4E-bound mRNAs on ribosomes, with a reduc tion in levels of the 
cognate oncogenic and growth-promoting proteins. All cell types  exposed to a 
SINE™ compound in vitro  undergo G1/S ± G2/M cell cycle arrest, followed by a 
‘genomic fidelity’ review, and cells with damaged genomes are induced to undergo 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-[ADDRESS_1137514] until the export block is relieved. Selinexor and other SINE ™ compounds 
are not intrinsically cytotoxic; rather, they can restore the h ighly effective tumor 
suppressing pathways that lead to selective elimination of geno mically damaged (i.e., 
neoplastic) cells.  Tumors of hematopoietic lineage are particu larly susceptible to 
induction of apoptosis by [CONTACT_67990]1 inhibition; normal hematopoietic  cells and their 
functions are largely spared. 
 
2.2.1 Preclinical Data 
 
In this section a short summary of preclinical data is provided.  More detailed information is presented in the selinexor Investigator’s Brochure  (Appendix C). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetc and Toxicology Summary:  
 Selinexor has shown potent apoptosis induction with a median IC [ADDRESS_1137515] anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as sign ificant 
myelosuppression, alopecia, mucositis and other gastrointestina l dysfunction.  
Selinexor has shown substantial efficacy, with dosing regimens that match those 
currently under investigation in humans, in a variety of mouse models of 
hematological and solid tumors and, including AML, CLL, DLBCL, MCL, 
multiple myeloma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), neuroblastoma, 
melanoma and prostate, breast, lung and ovarian cancer. 
AML cells overexpress the nuclear exporter, Exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) and higher 
XPO1 levels correlate with poor outcome (Kojima 2013).  The nov el selective 
inhibitor of nuclear transport / SINE compound,  selinexor, antagonizes XPO1 and 
shows potent cytotoxicity for AML and ALL cells in vitro , independent of 
genotype.  
Selinexor shows potent antiproliferative effect and induced apo ptosis, cell cycle 
arrest and myeloid differentiati on in AML cell lines and patien t blasts, including 
those from patients with NPM1 and FLT3 -ITD mutations (Ranganathan 2012).  
Mechanistic studies show that SINE compounds induce nuclear localization and 
activation of multiple tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs), leadin g to rapid apoptosis 
of AML cells.  In addition, a strong down-regulation of the onc ogenes FLT3 and c-
KIT were observed after SINE treatment in both FLT3 -ITD and wild-type cell 
lines (Ranganathan 2012). Selinexor treatment also restored the  localization of 
cytoplasmic mutant NPM1 into the nucleus.  
In murine AML and ALL models, selinexor showed potent antileuke mic activity 
without toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells (Etchin 2013a, b ; Ranganathan 
2012).  
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 8 In vitro  experiments with continuous (~72 hour) exposure to selinexor 
demonstrated potent proapoptotic activity across a broad panel of tumor-derived 
cell lines and patient samples in culture including multiply re sistant cancers, with 
the majority of inhibitory concentrations, 50% (IC 50s) for cytotoxicity < [ADDRESS_1137516] hematologic tumor lines having IC 50s of 20-400 nM for selinexor. 
Moreover, selinexor demonstrated cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma (MM) and 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in the absence or pres ence of bone 
marrow stroma cells (BMSC). In contrast, normal cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_820759] (or 
remained in) cell cycle arrest but were resistant to apoptosis-induction; cytotoxicity IC
50s were typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] > [ADDRESS_1137517] on normal (non-malignant) lymphocytes or other nontransformed cells, which correlated with the low incidence in animals of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_511647]-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_820760], alopecia, 
mucositis and other gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. 
Preclinical parameters were assessed in three species: mouse (C D1), rat (Sprague-
Dawley), and monkey (cynomolgus).  While pharmacokinetic (PK) s tudies were 
limited to male animals for all three species, toxicokinetic (T K) evaluations were 
conducted in both sexes for rats and monkeys as part of the sel inexor toxicology 
studies, and no consistent sex-related differences were observe d in either species. 
No accumulation was observed in any of the multi-dose toxicolog y studies with an 
every other day dosing regimen for selinexor. Overall, systemic  exposure was 
generally dose-proportional in all TK studies that involved mul tiple dose levels.  
Higher maximum concentration (C
max) and earlier time to maximum concentration 
(Tmax) values were observed in monkeys that were fasted versus fed prior to 
dosing. Systemic exposure (area under the curve from first to l ast plasma 
measurement, AUC last) to selinexor achieved with gelatin capsules was comparable 
to that achieved with oral suspension dosing, with lower C max and later T max values 
observed with capsules, and was not affected by [CONTACT_820792].  
Oral bioavailability (F%) of selinexor was remarkably consisten t among the three 
species, with average values of 66.5%, 61.2%, and 67.5% in mice, rats, and 
monkeys, respectively.   
Nonclinical toxicology studies indicated that the major side ef fects (dose limiting 
toxicities, DLTs) across all species are reduced appetite with anorexia-induced 
weight loss partially consistent with satiety induction.  High calorie foods and 
glucocorticoids can mitigate weig ht loss in animals taking SINE  XPO1 inhibitors.

• _Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) - B- or T-cell  
• _Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia (CML)  
 This study is registered on ClinTrials.gov at [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].   Preliminary, unaudited response data (as of 04 Dec 2014) and sa fety reports (as of 
01 Feb 2015) for AML patients are included in the attached IB v 4.0_03 April 2015 
(Appendix C).  
Study Design: Sixty-five heavily pretreated patients with progressive RR AML,  
most with ≥ _3 prior lines of treatment, were enrolled in the KCP -330-001 AML 
treatment arm and received selinexor 16.8-70 mg/m2 in four-week cycles.  Preliminary Response Results: Among 63 evaluable patients, the CR rate, with or 
without full hematologic recovery, was 11%, ORR was 16%, and DC R was 49%. 
(Note: 16 patients [25%] were non-evaluable but were included i n the AML 
response rate calculation, based on the ITT approach.) Best res ponse results in

 10 common Grade 1/2 TEAEs were diarrhea (82%), anorexia (78%), nau sea (74%), 
and fatigue (65%). No DLTs were reported during the dose escala tion phase, 
however due to SAEs that were seen at 85 mg/m2 in study KCP-330 -002, a 
maximum allowable dose of 70 mg/m2 twice weekly was assigned fo r this and 
future studies. The anticipated selinexor dose for patients in future AML studies 
will be 80-100 mg (35-60 mg/m2) twice weekly. For details of ov erall safety 
results in the AML patients and in all hematologic clinical studies please see the 
attached IB (Appendix C) 
Potential Risks  
 
Selinexor is currently in clinical development and has not been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for commercial use.  Human e xperience 
with selinexor is currently limited and the entire safety profi le is not known at this 
time.  Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the patients participating in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring.  Toxicity grading will be performed in accordance w ith National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) V4.03.  If more than one different type of toxicity occ urs concurrently, 
the most severe grade will determine the modification. 
If toxicities are encountered, adjustments will be made to the study treatment as 
detailed in the sections below. All AEs and serious adverse eve nts (SAEs) will be 
recorded during the trial and for up to [ADDRESS_1137519]. 
Side effects observed to date in patients are shown below. Plea se see Selinexor for 
Oral Administration Investigator’s Brochure  (Appendix C)  for most up-to-date 
information. 
Most common side effects:

 11 x worsening of pre-existing cataracts   
x elevated levels of bilirubin 
x elevated levels liver enzymes (ALT and AST)  
One patient, heavily pre- treated for recurrent pancreatic cancer, developed, ‘acute 
cerebellar syndrome’ following 4 doses of selinexor at 85 mg/m2 twice weekly. 
The patient experienced abnorm al speech, loss of coordination, and was unable to 
walk. No other patients have reported such symptoms to date. 
Reproductive risks   
Patients should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_474033] t his study because 
the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby.  Women should not breastfeed a 
baby [CONTACT_56035].  It is important patients understand the need to use birth 
control while on this study. It is not anticipated that female patients enrolling in 
this study will be able to conceive.  However, in the rare even t that this is possible, 
female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of 
contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at scree ning, and male 
patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active 
with a female of child-bearing potential. Acceptable methods of  contraception are 
condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectabl e contraceptives, 
contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermi cidal gel, or a 
sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal.  For both male and 
female patients, effective methods of contraception must be use d throughout the 
study and for three months following the last dose.

2.3 Rationale for study: 
FLT3 inhibitors demonstrate potent anti-leukemic activity and i mprove outcomes in 
patients with relapsed/refractory AML and FLT3-ITD  mutations19. About 40-50% of such 
patients achieve marrow responses to FLT3 inhibitors, with 20-30% bridged to allogeneic 
stem cell transplant. Responses to FLT3  inhibitors are usually maintained for 3-6 months 
but invariably these responses are transient (except among pati ents who undergo 
transplantation) due to the emergence of resistance20, 21. The causes of resistance include 
the acquisition of point mutations in the FLT3  KD and non-mutational mechanisms of 
resistance include up-regulation of compensatory pathways inclu ding the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR, FOXO3A , SYK , RAS and STAT5/PIM  pathways, up-regulation of the 
FLT3  ligand or receptor, mutations in other kinases (e.g. CBL), activation of ant-
apoptotic proteins BCL2 , MCL1  and BCL-x(L ), and tumor microenvironment mediated 
resistance23, [ADDRESS_1137520] in class Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Ex port / SINE ™ compound

 12 PI3K, mTOR, FOXO, STAT5, BCL2, BCL-x(L).  Nuclear retention of these known 
mediators of non-mutational resis tance may improve the efficacy and duration of 
response to FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib. Furthermore, Garzon et al  identified a direct 
inhibition of FLT3 protein expression in AML samples after XPO1  inhibition. The 
indirect and direct impact of XPO1 inhibition on the FLT3 pathw ay support combining a 
XPO1 inhibitor (selinexor) with a FLT3 inhibitor (sorafenib).  We have preclinical data 
recently generated showing activity of the KPT330+sorafenib com bination in patients 
with D835 alone, double mutant D835+ITD and D842+ITD (Zhang et al., ASH poster, 
December 2015 – attached as appendix K). Based on t his data we will evaluate i n 
addition to FLT3-ITD also double mutant ITD+D835 as well as D83 [ADDRESS_1137521] active therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53301] D835 alon e or double mutant AML 
patients and the preclinical data suggests this therapy may be active. In this initial trial, 
we propose to investigate whether selinexor in combination with sorafenib improves the 
response rates in patients with FLT3-ITD and –D835 mutated relapsed/refractory AML. 
If the combination proves to be well tolerated and results in i mproved response rates, we 
would expand the use of this app roach in the frontline setting for FLT3-ITD and –D835 
mutated AML. 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN: 
 
3.1 General 
The study will be a phase I/II, single-institution, open-label,  non-randomized, 
parallel group clinical trial. T he phase II will include two se parate cohorts to be 
enrolled simultaneously. All patients will be registered throug h CORe/PDMS.  
 
x Phase I   
o This will include FLT3-ITD and –D835 mutated patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML, including patients who may have been previously exposed to one or more FLT3-inhibitors. Relapsed/ refractory status defined by [CONTACT_820794] (including but not limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy, hypomethylator therapy, immune-based therapy, stem cell transplant or stem cell therapy, FLT3-inhibitor thera py, 
investigational therapy, and others). 
o The DLT assessment period will be performed only during Cycle 1  
of Phase I. 
 
x Phase II in two cohorts 
1. Cohort 1 (FLT3 inhibitor failure cohort)  in FLT3-ITD and –D835 
mutated relapsed/refractory AML who have failed therapy with up  to 
two prior salvage regimens (HSCT or stem cell therapy for patie nts 
who previously underwent HSCT/stem cell therapy in remission wi ll 
not be considered a salvage regimen) and have previously been 
exposed to at least one prior FLT3 inhibitor.

mutated relapsed/refractory AML who have failed therapy with up  to 
two prior salvage regimens (HSCT or stem cell therapy for patie nts 
who previously underwent HSCT/ste m cell therapy in remission wi ll 
not be considered a salvage regimen) with no prior exposure to any 
FLT3 inhibitor.

dose is dose level +1, and the starting dose will be dose level 0. The first 3 
patients on study will receive dose level 0.  
 
x Other dose levels will be used for dose adjustments for toxicit y during 
therapy (Table 3). 
 
x Prior to advancing/changing dose  levels, a cohort summary will be completed 
and submitted to the IND Office Medical Monitor for review and approval. A 
copy of the cohort summary should be placed in the Investigator’s Regulatory Binder under “sponsor correspondence”.

x If ≥2/6 patients experience DLT at dose level -2, the study will be revised 
to consider additional lower dose levels. 
 
*With up to 2 potential dose de-escalation level (-1 and -2) to  be studied and 
up to 6 patients to be treated at a given dose, the target maximum number of patients enrolled in the phase  I part of the trial will be 12.  
 
3.4  Definition of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 
DLT is defined as clinically significant non-hematologic advers e event or 
abnormal laboratory value asse ssed as unrelated to disease prog ression, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and occurring during the first 
cycle on study and at least possibly related to the study drugs  that meets any of 
the following criteria:  
 ¾ CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_1137525] (SGOT) or A LT (SGPT) for > [ADDRESS_1137526] (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) of any duration 
 ¾ Grade 3 nausea/vomiting, dehydr ation or diarrhea lasting more 
than 3 days in the setting of optimal supportive medications 
 ¾ Grade 3 fatigue lasting more than 5 days in the setting of opti mal 
supportive medications 
 ¾ Grade 3 biochemical abnormalities (e.g., lipase or bilirubin 
elevation) will only be considered DLT if accompanied by 
[CONTACT_185987]. Grade [ADDRESS_1137527] after 7 days of optimal replacement therapy  
 
¾ All Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities of any duration 
 ¾ For the purposes of DLT assessment, asymptomatic hyponatremi a will be “graded” not by [CONTACT_315360] 
4.03 but rather by [CONTACT_820795] <125mmol/L. Sodium <125mmol/L will be graded as DLT with 
the exception of asymptomatic tran slational hyponatremia due to  
hyperglycemia (see footnote below for calculation).   
*In marked hyperglycemia, ECF osmolality rises and exceeds that of 
ICF, since glucose penetrates cell membranes slowly in the absence of 
insulin, resulting in movement of water out of cells into the ECF. 
Serum Na concentration falls in proportion to the dilution of the ECF, 
declining 1.6 mEq/ L for every 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) increment in 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 15 the plasma glucose level above normal. This condition has been called 
translational hyponatremia because no net change in total body water 
(TBW) has occurred. No specific therapy is indicated, because Na 
concentration will return to normal once the plasma glucose 
concentration is lowered. Corrected Sodium (Hillier, 1999) = 
Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)33.  
 
¾ All other clinically significant non-hematological adverse even t 
that is Grade 3 according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03.   
 
¾ Myelosuppression and cytopenias are expected outcomes of leukemia treatment and per se will not constitute DLT. Only prolonged myelosuppression, as defined by [CONTACT_54889], i.e. marrow cellularity < 5% on Day 42 o r 
later (6 weeks) from start of therapy without any evidence of leukemia, will be considered in defining DLT. In case of a normocellular bone marrow with <5% blasts, 8 weeks with pancytopenia will be considered DLT. Anemia will not be considered for the definition of DLT. 
 
Any patients who stop treatment prior to completing evaluation for the DLT observation period (first 28 days) due to disease progression or refusal for further participation for reasons other than toxici ty during the 
DLT defining phase I portion of the study will be replaced at t hat dose 
level for a full evaluation of tha t dose level before a decisio n regarding 
dose escalation can be made.  
3.5 Phase II expansion 
Once MTD is defined, the RP2D w ill be selected based on efficac y and safety 
result from the phase I in discussion with the PI, the sponsor and the supporting 
company (Karyopharm). The Investigator is responsible for compl eting the 
cohort summary template prior to advancing subjects to the phas e II portion. The 
phase II portion will start in two cohorts as defined previousl y with [ADDRESS_1137528] be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee prior to enrollment of that patient. In addition, the patient must be  thoroughly informed 
about all aspects of the study, including the study visit sched ule and required 
evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consen t. The written

  5.0 TREATMENT PLAN: 
 
5.1 Schedule 
 
All patients will be registered through CORe/PDMS. 
 
5.1.1 Selinexor will be administered orally twice a week (e.g. 
Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday or Wednesday/Friday) for [ADDRESS_1137542] 
week of the cycle (week 4). After initiation of sorafenib on cy cle 1 
day 1, sorafenib will be administered orally daily twice continuously for the duration of the study with no interruption s 
unless there are adverse events as described in Section 5.2 bel ow. 
Sorafenib doses will be separated by [CONTACT_820797]  12 
hours (+/- 2 hours). Sorafenib will be administered without foo d, at 
least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. If a dose is misse d, the 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 21 next dose will not be increased to account for missing a dose. The 
patient will take the next regular dose at the scheduled time. 
Patients will receive one cycle of therapy every 28 days (+/- 7  
days).    On the day when both drugs, Selinexor and Sorafenib, will be administered: 
- Selinexor needs to be taken with food. 
- Sorafenib should not be taken with food.  Therefore, patient should take Sorafenib at least 1 hour before eating or 2 hours after 
eating. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cycles may be started early (but not earlier than day 21) for patients with active disease if judged in the best interest of 
the patient.  
*For the phase I, DLT defining period is 28 days. As such, cycle 2 should not be started before 28 days for the patients being treated on the phase I cohort to allow for adequate evaluation of DLTs. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subsequent cycles may be delayed for recovery of toxicity or other medical conditions.  Delays in start of subsequent cycles greater than 8 weeks will be acceptable only for patients who are deriving clinical benefit and after discussion with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_820764]/benefit ratio and complete documentation of the degree of clinical benefit and reason for continuation 
on this regimen.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  In instances where one drug has to be discontinued 
transiently because of safety, the administration of the other drug may continue as scheduled. If the drug that is held can resume at a later time, no doses will be made up and the administration will follow the originally defined schedule calendar according to the drug that was continued.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For patients who discontinue therapy, the reason for treatment discontinuation will be documented.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients must receive at least [ADDRESS_1137543] 28 days on trial 
(i.e. during cycle 1) to be evaluated for DLT. Patients who receive less than 4 doses of selinexor and/or less than [ADDRESS_1137544] 28 days on trial will not be evaluable for DLT. Patients not evaluable for DLT will be replaced. These patients may continue therapy on trial 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 22 after discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_820765]/risk profile for the patient must be clearly documented in the medical records.    
5.2 Dose Adjustments 
 
5.2.1  Selinexor and sorafenib dose adjustments for drug-relate d 
hematological adverse events (AEs): 
            Dose reduction/interruption/discontinuation decisio ns should be 
based on the CTCAE version 4.03 (Appendix E) of the toxicity an d 
the guidelines provided below. 
 
x Patients with acute leukemia’s usually present with abnormal 
peripheral blood counts at the time therapy is started and 
myelosuppression is an expected event during the course of therapy for acute leukemia’s. Thus, no dose adjustments or 
treatment interruptions for myelosuppression will be planned fo r 
the first 4 cycles and/or in the presence of residual leukemia.  
After that, treatment interruptions and dose adjustments may be considered according to the following guidelines only when ther e 
is no evidence of residual leukemia.  
 
¾ Patients with a response (e.g., no evidence of residual leukemia or cytopenias not considered to be related to leukemia) and pre-cycle counts of neutrophils >1.0 x 10
9/L and platelets >50 x 109/L who have sustained low 
counts of neutrophils <0.5 x 109/L or a platelet count 
<20 x 109/L for more than [ADDRESS_1137545] the treatment with selinexor and sorafenib interrupted at the discretion of the treating physician after discussing with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_525202] ≥0.5  x10
9/L and platelets to ≥3 0 
x 109/L. If prolonged myelosuppression defined as 
ANC < 0.5 x 109/L and platelets < 20 x109/L (more 
than 8 weeks) with evidence of a hypocellular marrow (marrow cellularity less than 5% without evidence of leukemia) is observed in these patients, both selinexor and sorafenib will be discontinued. Delays in start of subsequent cycles greater than 8 weeks will be 
acceptable only for patients who are deriving clinical 
benefit and after discussion with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_128870]/benefit ratio and complete documentation of the degree of clinical benefit and reason for continuation on this regimen.

 23 ¾ If there are persistent peripheral blood blasts, or the 
bone marrow shows >5% blasts or evidence of 
leukemia, treatment may be continued regardless of neutrophil and platelet count with supportive care as needed. Dose-interruptions of selinexor and sorafenib in these patients should be considered on an individual case and discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_11305].   
¾ Patients with a response (no marrow evidence of leukemia) and pre-cycle counts of neutrophils <1x10
9/L 
and platelets <50 x109/L may be continued regardless 
of neutrophil and platelet count with supportive care as needed. Dose-interruptions in these patients should be considered on an individual case and discussed with the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_11305]. 
 
¾ Investigators should, whenever possible, determine 
which medication is causing the toxicity and interrupt or dose reduce selinexor and/or sorafenib, as applicable. 
 
           5.2.2    Selinexor and sorafenib dose adjustments fo r non-hematologic    
drug-related AEs 
Investigators should, whenever po ssible, determine which 
medication is causing the toxicity and interrupt or dose reduce  
selinexor and/or interrupt sorafenib, as applicable. Thus, if d ose 
level 0 is established as the MTD, one and two dose level reductions of selinexor will be selinexor 60 mg twice weekly an d 
selinxor 40 mg twice weekly, respectively. If the MTD is below dose level 0 further dose reduction levels of selinexor will be defined before moving to the phase II portion of the study. Dos e 
reductions of sorafenib will be as follows: Starting dose = sorafenib 400 mg BID, -1 dose level = 400 mg in the AM and 200 mg in the PM, -2 dose level = 200 mg BID, -3 dose level = 200 mg Qday. The sorafenib dose will not be reduced beyond 200 mg Qday.

provided: 
 
Patient has completed ≥1 cycle at their current dose le vel  
 
Patient has not experienced any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic drug-related toxicity, and  
 Patient has not experienced hematologic DLT, and 
 At least [ADDRESS_1137554] 28 days without experiencing DLT.  
 
The dose may be escalated by [CONTACT_525288] (per table 3) provided such dose level does not exceed RP2D. 
 
Dose escalation of only one of the two agents is allowed if judged in the best interest of the patient (e.g., in patients with anorexia this would be likely secondary to selinexor, in patients with skin rash this would be likely secondary to sorafenib). However, the dose of any agent cannot be escalated beyond the established RP2D for that agent.

myelosuppression) when toxicity has resolved. The reason for this reduction will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_414791] i n the medical record. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] A patient who has had a dose reduction because of any of the re asons 
mentioned above may have their dose escalated provided the patient has remained free of toxicity requiring dose adjustments as def ined 
above for at least 1 month. Escalation will be made by 1 dose-l evel 
increment only, and not more fre quent than every month.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment interruptions and dose modifications other than the o nes 
mentioned above can be considered after discussion with the PI,  
sponsor and proper documentation of the rationale. Dose adjustment/delay of only one of the agents is permissible if th e toxicity 
is most likely judged to be related to one of the agents by [CONTACT_2924] (e.g., in patients with anorexia this would be lik ely 
secondary to selinexor, in patients with skin rash this would b e likely

During the administration of selinexor, patients may receive re d blood 
cell (RBC) or platelet transfusions, if clinically indicated, p er institutional 
guidelines.  
 Myelosuppression is expected in patients with AML due to underl ying 
disease, as well as due to ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as selinexor and sor afenib), or 
both. Most patients have neutrope nia, thrombocytopenia, or both  at study 
entry. Significant or life-threatening myelosuppression may be managed 
with growth factor support including G-CSF, GM-CSF and platelet  
growth factors and erythropoeitn/darbopoetin/blood transfusion according to institutional sta ndard of care, American Society o f Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) Practice Guidelines, and/or NCCN Practice Guidelines.  
 
5.6.4 Radiation Treatment 
If clinically indicated, palliative radiation therapy to non-ta rget lesions is 
permitted but interruption of study drug is not required based on 
preclinical data and limited clinical observations. Treatment w ith 
selinexor shall not be discontinued solely due to palliative ra diation. 
 
5.6.5 Prohibited Concomitant medications 
Erythropoietin and growth factors are not permitted to be used 
prophylactically in cycle 1 but allowed if needed in cycle 2 an d onwards. 
However, these can be used thera peutically throughout the study (see 
section 5.6.3 above).  
5.6.6 Drugs undergoing Glutathione conjugation 
The primary metabolism of selinexor in vitro and in vivo appear s to 
inactivation by [CONTACT_820803]. In vitro studies using  human 
liver microsomes confirm in vi vo findings that selinexor underg oes 
minimal CYP450 metabolism. Therefore, administration of selinex or 
with drugs that undergo substantial glutathione conjugation sho uld be 
minimized. These drugs include acetaminophen (paracetamol), whi ch 
should be avoided [ADDRESS_1137566] s 
containing ethanol should be minimized or avoided on selinexor dosing 
days. 
 
5.6.7 Strong CYP3A4 inducers Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) as they make decrease the systemic exposure 
to sorafenib.

x Other restrictions and precautions: 
o Alcohol:  Ethanol should be avoided on selinexor dosing days as  it may 
compete for glutathione -mediated metabolism. 
o Fasting:  Patients on the selinexor arm should maintain an adeq uate diet. 
o Medications:  Acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol) and products  
containing acetaminophen (paracetamol) should be avoided 2 hour s before 
and 2 hours after dosing with selinexor as it may compete with glutathione 
mediated metabolism. 
o Diet:  There are no dietary restrictions on this study.  Patien ts on the 
selinexor arm should maintain a dequate caloric and fluid intake .

 44 7.2.10 For patients that remain on study with no significant to xicity for 
more than 6 months, subsequent evaluations during study may be 
modified after discussion with t he PI. These include a decrease  in 
frequency of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_820775] 6-12 months (or a s 
clinically indicated) and other laboratory tests to once every cycle.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1137579] (urine or serum) in females of childbeari ng potential 
every 3 months (±2 weeks).  
 
7.2.12 Patients with an objective  response will be followed for  survival at 
MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA CC) every 3 to 6 months after 
the end of treatment visit for up to 5 years after completion o f 
active treatment. If the patie nt is unable to return to MDACC the 
follow-up visits may be conducted via telephone. 
 8.0 CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE 
Response criteria will be modified from the International Worki ng Group for AML
34.  
Responders are patients who obtain a Composite Complete Remissi on Rate (CRc) with or 
without cytogenetic response, hematologic improvements, and mor phologic leukemia-
free state. CRc rate is define d as the confirmed remission rate of all complete and 
incomplete CRs (i.e., CR+ CRp + CRi). 
 
8.1 Complete Remission (CR) 
For patients to be classified as being in CR, they must have bo ne marrow 
regenerating normal hematopoietic cells and achieve a morpholog ic leukemia-free 
state and must have an ANC > 1 × 109/L and platelet count ≥ 100 × 109/L, and normal 
marrow differential with < 5% b lasts, and patients will be red blood cell (RBC) and 
platelet transfusion independent (defined as 4 weeks without RBC transfusion and 1 
week without platelet transfusion). There should be no evidence  of extramedullary 
leukemia.  
8.2 Complete Remission with Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp) 
For patients to be classified as being in CRp, they must achiev e CR except for 
incomplete platelet recovery (< 100 × 10
9/L). 
 
8.3 Complete Remission with Incom plete Hematological Recovery ( CRi) 
For patients to be classified as  being in CRi, they must fulfil l the criteria for CR 
except for incomplete hematological recovery with residual neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1 × 
109/L) with or without thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 109/L). In addition, 
patients do not need to be RBC or pl atelet transfusion independent (modification to 
Cheson criteria).  
8.4 Partial Remission (PR) 
For patients to be classified as being in PR, they must have bo ne marrow regenerating 
normal hematopoietic cells with evidence of peripheral recovery  with no (or only a 
few regenerating) circulating blasts and with a decrease of at least 50% in the 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 45 percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_559798] 
5% and 25%. 
 8.5 Morphologic leukemia-free state :  
        Bone marrow: 
5% myeloblasts   
 8.6 Hematologic Improvement (HI): Hematologic response must be described by 
[CONTACT_511803].  
i Erythroid response (E) (pretreatment Hgb <11 g/dL)  
 Hgb increase by 
1.5 g/dL 
 i Platelet response (P) (pretreatment platelets <100 x10
9/L) 
 Absolute increase of 
 30 x 109/L for patients starting with > 20 x 109/L platelets 
          Increase from < 20 x 109/L to > 20 x 109/L and by [CONTACT_2669] 100% 
 i Neutrophil response (N) (pretreatment ANC <1.0 x10
9/L) 
 At least 100% increase and an absolute increase > 0.5 x 109/L 
 i Blast response (B) 
          ≥50% reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts but still >5%  
 
8.7 Recurrence of Disease 
Relapse after CR is defined as a r eappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral 
blood or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_820776]. R elapse after PR is 
similarly defined with reappearance of significant numbers of peripheral blasts and an 
increase in the percentage of blas ts in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_278581] > 25% not 
attributable to any other cause or reappearance or new appearan ce 
of extramedullary leukemia.

clearance) post-treatment up to that time. Best response will a lso be evaluated for the 
full treatment period using all assessments up to and including  treatment 
discontinuation. 
 
9.0 DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT: 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1137581] their fu ture care. Patients may 
also choose to withdraw from study treatment, but agree to remain in the study for 
follow-up procedures.   
9.1.2 Investigator Discontinuation of Patient 
The investigator may exercise medical judgment to discontinue s tudy treatment if 
clinically significant changes in clinical status or laboratory  values are noted. 
 
9.1.3 Criteria for Protocol-Defined Required Discontinuation of  Treatment 
The protocol requires discontinua tion of study treatment for th e following reasons: 
1.  Patient requests discontinuation. 2.  Unacceptable toxicity that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_820777].  
3. Clinically significant progressive disease.  4. Investigator discretion.   
9.1.4 Follow-Up at Treatment Discontinuation or Early Withdrawal 
Patients who discontinue treatme nt for any reason should comple te end-of-treatment 
procedures when possible. End of t reatment procedures will incl ude a physical 
examination, CBC with differential and platelets and a limited chemistry profile (total 
bilirubin, serum creatinine, SGPT or SGOT). A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_525228]-response or progressive disease cannot be unequivocally 
diagnosed from peripheral blood. Although treatment will be dis continued at that 
time, all patients who do not withdraw consent for follow-up, d ie, or become lost to 
follow-up, will remain on study for follow-up evaluations. Subj ect will be followed 
for toxicity for at least [ADDRESS_1137582] protocol treat ment. The 30-day (+/-7 
days) follow-up visit will be scheduled as a clinic visits for clinical evaluation and 
physical examinations. If the pa tient cannot make it to the MDA CC clinic for this 
visit, the required follow up t reatment procedures may be done with a local physician 
and the records forwarded to MDA CC. The research nurse will con tact the patient by 
[CONTACT_820807] a verbal assessment of the patient’s condition. The phone conversation will then be documented in the patient’s charts.  
 9.[ADDRESS_1137583] the right to terminate this 
clinical study at any time. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_820778] C IND office, as 
appropriate, will be involved in any decisions regarding termin ating the study, 
temporarily suspending enrollment, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820779] t with study 
treatment. 
Reasons for terminating the clinical study or a study site’s participation include, but are not limited to, the following: 
x The incidence or severity of an adverse reaction related to tre atment in this study 
or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patient s 
x Data recording is significantly inaccurate or incomplete 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-[ADDRESS_1137584] patient safety or benefit potential, or confound 
assessments of safety or clinical activity. A protocol deviation is a departure from the protocol that does not meet the above criteria. Protocol violat ions or deviations may 
be grouped into the following classes: 
x Enrollment criteria 
x Study activities (missed evaluations or visits) except for those allowed per 
protocol 
x Noncompliance with dose or schedul e, including dose calculation , administration, 
interruption, reduction, or delay; or discontinuation criteria 
x Investigational product handling, including storage and account ability 
x Informed consent and ethical issues 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1137585] a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
  Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious  and unintended 
and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis,  diagnosis, or 
therapy of disease or for the modification of physiologic function.  
  Assessing causal connections between agents and disease is fun damental to the 
understanding of adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may  be considered a 
contributory cause of an adverse event if, had the drug not bee n administered, 1) 
the event would not have happene d at all, 2) the event would have occurred later 
than it actually did, or 3) the event would have been less seve re. 
  The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for prov iding source 
documentation and assigning a ttribution for all AEs.  
 
10.2     Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated against the most cu rrent version of the 
selinexor and sorafenib Investig ator Brochure (Appendix C and D ) for 
expectedness. Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the latest 
CTCAE version 4.03 (Appendix E) a nd documented in medical recor d.  AEs will 
be recorded in the Case Report F orm (CRF) as per appendix I.  E xpected events

the event is considered a DLT as listed in section 3.4.  
 
10.4 Serious Adverse Even t Reporting (SAE) 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse event is considered “serious” if, 
in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it resul ts in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 
x Death 
x A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience 
that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, a t immediate 
risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It do es not 
include an adverse experience that might have caused death if i t had 
occurred in a more severe form,. 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187733] 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon appropriate medica l judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requi ring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not re sult in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependenc y or drug 
abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
x Important medical events as de fined above, may also be consider ed 
serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and sho uld 
be reported as an SAE if dee med appropriate by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office.     
 
x All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol that meet the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance w ith 
the timeframes and procedures outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. 
Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Dru gs 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 50 and Dev ices.” Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, 
expected or unexpected, must be r eported to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (with in 5 working days of knowledge o f the 
event). 
 
x All life-threatening or fatal events , that are unexpected, and related 
to the study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 
hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety 
Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 x Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) w ill 
be utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IR B.  
 x Serious adverse events will be c aptured from the time of the fi rst 
protocol-specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_1137586] be repo rted to 
the IND Office and Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc. This may inclu de 
the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
x All cases of selinexor or sorfenib overdose (defined as accidental or 
intentional ingestion of any dose of the product that is consid ered 
excessive and medically important ) must be reported as an SAE t o the 
Sponsor (MDACC IND office) and to the supporting company on the  
SAE Form.  
 
x Pregnancy alone is not considered an AE. However, if a patient 
becomes pregnant or causes a pregnancy during treatment or within [ADDRESS_1137587] be re ported immediately to the sponso r 
(MDACC IND office) on the MD Anderson SAE Form and to the supporting company within 1 days of the Investigato r’s knowledge of 
the pregnancy. The investigator should abide by [CONTACT_820808] a female partner of a male subject pri or to 
obtaining follow up. The investigator will follow the pregnancy  to 
term or termination, will collect data on both the maternal and  fetal 
outcome and will report all outco mes as a follow-up report to the 
initial pregnancy notification to the supporting company, Karyo pharm 
Inc.. Notwithstanding, all pregnancy outcomes that meet the regulator y 
definition of serious (i.e. spontaneous abortion, neonatal death, 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 51 congenital anomaly in an aborted fetus or neonate) will be repo rted 
on the MD Anderson SAE Form to t he sponsor (MDACC IND office) 
and the supporting companies within 24 hours of Investigator 
knowledge of the outcome.   
 
10.5 Reporting to FDA 
Serious adverse events will be f orwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] 
(Safety Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI, and the research team, to e nsure 
serious adverse events are repo rted according to the Code of Fe deral 
Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the 
sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review  Board policy. 
 
            10.6 Serious Adverse event Reporting to Karyopharm Inc. 
All SAEs, whether related or unr elated to selinexor, pregnancie s and 
reports of overdose regardless of suspected causality and expec tedness 
will be reported immediately  but not later than 24 hours of the  PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_820781]’s SAE Management team 
who will ensure data is captured in Karyopharm’s Pharmacovigilance 
system.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_820782] [EMAIL_15605].    Information not available at the time of the initial report (e. g., an end date 
for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the r eport) must 
be documented on a follow-up report. A final report to document  
resolution of the SAE is required. 
 11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate safety and efficacy of selinexor in 
combination with sorafenib in patients with FLT3-ITD and –D835 mutated AML. The 
total accrual is 52 patients (Phase I: up to 12 patients and Ph ase II: 20 patients per 
cohort). 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1137588] 3+[ADDRESS_1137589] dose level 
with </= [ADDRESS_1137590] 28 days of treatment. DLT 
is defined in section 3.4 (page 13) . The 3+3-dosing algorithm is presented in section 3.3 
and the dosing schema for the com bination treatment is shown in  Table 3. The RP2D will 
be selected at the end of the pha se I portion based on safety a nd efficacy of selinexor and 
sorafenib after discussion with the sponsor and the supporting company (Karyopahrm). 
The Investigator is responsible for completing the cohort summary template prior to advancing subjects to the phase I I part. Once RP2D has been established, any patients 
 Selinexor and sorafenib in AML - 2014-0975 
July 12, 2016 
 52 still on study at a dose lower than RP2D can be dose escalated up to RP2D in accordance 
with the dose-escalation guidelines in section 5.2.3. 
 
11.2 Phase II 
The primary objective of the phase II is to evaluate the effica cy of the combination. The 
study has two cohorts (maximum of 20 patients for each cohort):  (1) FLT3-ITD and –
D835 mutated relapsed/refractory AML previously exposed to any FLT3 inhibitor, and 
(2) FLT3-ITD and –D835 mutated relapsed/refractory AML with no prior exposure to 
any FLT3 inhibitor.  For all the cohorts, the primary endpoint is the achievement of  CRc (CRc=CR/CRp/CRi) 
at any time during the first three cycles of therapy and toxici ty assessed at the end of one 
cycle of therapy. CRc and toxicity will be monitored simultaneously using the Bayesian approach of Thall, Simon, Estey  (1995, 1996) and the extension by [CONTACT_210872] 
(1998) separately for each cohort. Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1) was used to generate 
the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820783].  
 
x Cohort #1: Patients with relapse FLT3-ITD and –D835 mutant AML 
(FLT3 inhibitor naïve cohort):  
 
The historical data suggested a CRc rate of 20% for this popula tion and 
the target CRc with selinexor and sorafenib combination is 35%.  The 
treatment will be considered wor thy of further investigation if  it elicits an 
increase in CRc to 35% with acceptable toxicity. A >30% therapy  related 
non-hematological grade 3/4 toxicity rate is considered unaccep table. 
Given this, we will stop enroll ment into this cohort if the observed 
patients’ data suggest that:  
 
1) Pr (CRc
E> CRc H +0.15|data) < 0.025 or 
2) Pr (TOX E> 0.30|data) > 0.90 
 
Here CRc E and CRc H are the CRc rate for selinexor in combination with 
sorafenib and the historical treatment, respectively. TOX E is the toxicity 
rate for selinexor in combination with sorafenib. That is, if at any time during the study we determine that there is a less than 2.5% ch ance that 
the average CRc rate improves over historical CRc rate by [CONTACT_726] 15% 
we will stop enrollment to this cohort. The second condition will stop the study early if excessive therapy-related non-hematological grad e 3/4 
toxicity (>30%) is highly probable (i.e., probability >90.0%) for the CRcE and CRcH are assumed to follow a prior of Beta (0.4, 1.6) and a  constant 
of 20%, respectively. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820784], based on  these 
assumptions and monitoring conditions are found in Table 6. We will 
apply these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820785] a cohort size of [ADDRESS_1137591] 10 patients treated.

(FLT3 inhibitor failure cohort)   
 
The historical data suggested a CRc rate of 10% for this popula tion and 
the target CRc rate with selinexor ad sorafenib combination is 20%. Given this, we will stop en rollment into this cohort if the observed patients’ data 
suggest that: 
 
1) Pr (CRc
E> CRc H +0.10|data) < 0.025 
2) Pr (TOX E> 0.30|data) > 0.875 
 
Here CRc E and CRc H are the CRc rate for selinexor in combination with 
sorafenib and historical treatment, respectively. TOX E is the toxicity rate 
for selinexor in combination with sorafenib. That is, if at any  time during 
the study we determine that there is a less than 2.5% chance that the 
average CRc rate improves over historical rate by [CONTACT_726] 10%  we will 
stop enrollment to this cohort. CRcE  and CRcH are assumed to follow a 
prior of Beta (0.2, 1.8) and constant of 10%, respectively. The  s e c o n d  
condition will stop the study early if excessive therapy-relate d non-
hematological grade 3/4 toxicity (>30%) is highly probable (i.e ., 
probability >95.0%). The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_820789], based on 
these assumptions and monitoring conditions are found in Table 9. We

11.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
All patients who received any dose of the study agent will be i ncluded in the analysis for 
efficacy and safety.  Demographic/clinical characteristics (inc luding duration of 
response) and safety data of the pa tients will be summarized us ing descriptive statistics 
such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. For the pri mary efficacy analysis, 
we will estimate the ORR for the  combination treatment, along w ith the 95% confidence 
interval.  In addition, we will e stimate composite CRc rate, pa rtial response and marrow 
clearance rate within 3 months by [CONTACT_324094]3 mutation. Patients who d rop out of the study 
before completing all the cycles wil l be treated as “failures” for the primary analysis. 
ORR during the study period will also be presented with the 95%  confidence interval. 
The association between ORR and patient’s clinic al characteristics will be examined by 
[CONTACT_195463]’s rank sum test or Fisher’s exact test , as appropriate. Toxicity type, severity 
and attribution will be summarize d for each patient using frequ ency tables.

 57 The distribution of time-to-event endpoints (DFS and OS) including overall survival and 
progression free survival will be estimated using the method of  Kaplan and Meier. 
Comparisons of time-to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_805801] w ill be made using the 
log-rank tests. Paired t-tests will be used to determine the im munological and molecular 
changes in the peripheral bl ood and bone marrow from baseline t o the time of response, 
and to the time of disease progression.

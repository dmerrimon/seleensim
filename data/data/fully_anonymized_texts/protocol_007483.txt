1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims 
 
Aim: Evaluate whether sonicating the Nucleu s Accumbens (NAc) with transcranial focused 
ultrasound modifies functional connectivity betw een the NAc and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). 
 In this single visit, open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we plan to evaluate whether transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS), deliver ed to the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) within the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner will impact resting state functional connectivity between the NAc and f unctionally connected 
brain regions like the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in up to 10 healthy individuals.   HYPOTHESIS : tFUS will reduce prefrontal 
cortex (PFC)-NAc f unctional connectivity, 
in healthy individuals. We will investigate 
this hypothesis by [CONTACT_914652]- and after the tFUS stimulation.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1285363] studied approaches are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS).  TMS, which is FDA approved for tr eating depression and OCD, can only stimulate the surface 
of the brain and can only stimulate deeper by [CONTACT_914653], and spreading the field.  It is thus not deep and 
focal but deep and broad. Unlike TMS, which is a cortical stimulation approach, deep brain stimulation (DBS), which 
is FDA approved for treating Parkinson’s Disease (PD), can s timulate deep in the brain with high spatial specificity. 
DBS has been also investigated experimentally to man age neuropathic pain; however , the surgical risk and 
implantation of the electrodes are semi-permanent 
and arguably not worth the benefit. Lastly there is 
tDCS, a low cost, low-amplitude electric current delivered to the scalp and ultimately through brain. tDCS is not powerful enough to depolarize neurons, although it has been demonstrated to influence the level of excitability and modulate the firing rate of 
individual neurons. Of all brain stimulation 
approaches, there is a need for a safe, noninvasive, 
focal, and effective approach that can reliably 
modulate neural tissue. This proposal addresses this 
gap, by [CONTACT_914654] 
(tFUS), a technological advancement on the 
forefront of neuroscience and neuromodulation (Figure 2 ). 
  
Functionally connected areas of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc).  Key emotional, 
pain, and reward systems are connected through the NAc, including the insula, dorsal 
anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), prefrontal  cortex (PFC), thalamus (Tha), amygdala 
(Amy), and periaqueductal gray (PAG). A dditionally, the NAc receives excitatory 
inputs from the ventromedial PFC, dACC, am ygdala, and hippocampal formation (not 
shown) and dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the 
midbrain.

biologically active electrical fields in broad (>4cm) cortical targets. 
Alternatively, tFUS (right) has the capability to focally deliver energy to cortical and subcortical tissue with <1cm resolution.(33)

We aim to use resting state neuroimaging to understand wh at happens to functional neural circuitry of connected 
brain structures to the site of stimulation. 
 
3.0 Intervention to be studied (if applicable) 
 
Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) 
Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a 
promising new technology that is both noninvasive and may be focally applied to deep brain targets(1-4) (Figure 3 ). tFUS utilizes transducers which contain 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_914647](5-7). tFUS 
noninvasively stimulates deep brain targets with a 
high level of spatial resolution. No other current technologies exist for noninvasive deep brain stimulation which makes tFUS a highly promising technology that may have substantial research and 
clinical potential(1, 4, 8-12). Transcranial focused 
ultrasound (tFUS) uses a single large concave transducer fi xed in a head-worn apparatus on the scalp to produce 
ultrasonic waves (650kHZ) pulsed in 30 second intervals. Un like traditional diagnostic u ltrasound, which constantly 
transmits ultrasound and ‘listens’ to the echo to form an imag e, tFUS delivers the ultrasound in trains or short bursts 
of pulses. It is still unclear whether tFUS, at the FDA-pr escribed power limits, depol arizes neurons, however is 
hypothesized that tFUS acts on neurons via a mechanical for ce mechanism of action, leading to increased conductance 
of neurons and opening of  ion channels(13).  
Due to the inherent fundamentals of the waveform of ultrasonic forces, tFUS 
maximal energy can be focused both deep  in the bran (2-12cm under the cap; 
for comparison, traditional TMS can stimulate 1-3.4cm
2 deep(14, 15)) and 
focally (as small as 0.5mm in diameter, and up to 1000mm; the facility of a 
standard, commercially-available 70mm figure-of-8 TMS coil is roughly 
50mm2 (14, 15)). Furthermore, tFUS has been demonstrated to safely 
stimulate neural tissue(12, 16-18), pr oposing cellular mechanisms for its 
efficacy(12, 18-23), and now is being used in human patients(24). Recently, tFUS administered to the thalamus of coma patients was 
demonstrated to assist in recovery  of consciousness(24). Thus, tFUS is 
an extremely promising, new form of  noninvasive deep brain stimulation 
that can be focused on deep brai n structures to elicit meaningful 
behavioral responses. This proposal pl ans to use tFUS, administered to 
deep brain structures involved in re ward and pain, to produce changes in 
brain functional connectivity. 
 
We will be using the Brainsonix Low intensity fo cused ultrasound pulsation device. (BX Pulsar 1001). 
Please see the manufacturers descri ption (Technical Summary) along wi th appendixes about the actual 
safety of the device itself.   FDA Status of the BX Pulsar [ADDRESS_1285365] attached to the IRB application. After this study was done and safety was established,

peak sonication area deep within the brain based on the fixed focal length

Version 2; March 29, [ADDRESS_1285366] like it does regular 
diagnostic ultrasound, which is non-si gnificant risk. The diagnostic ultr asound devices and this one are 
the same in terms of what they can produce.   Attached is the letter of approval from the UCLA for using this device in te sting memory, Alzheimer’s 
disease, coma, the amygdala and emotions, and the thalamus with healthy controls.  
 Additionally, the MUSC IRB1 has appr oved this system to investigate a new potential treatment for pain, 
which was shown to be safe at the proposed paramete rs and published recently(25). Additionally there is 
an ongoing trial using the same system  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_43269]) approved the IRB 1 in  generalized anxiety disorder.  
 Importantly, this device can only deli ver the power of a diagnostic ultr asound device. It is not able to 
deliver the power needed for High Intensity Ultrasound Ablation such as is used in neurosurgery. This 
would require multiple machines, precisely focused, delivering over 1000 times more energy than we are 
using.  
In this study, up to 10 participants will receive tw o, 10minute sessions of eith er active or sham tFUS 
delivered to the nucleus accumbens ( NAc) within the MRI environment.  
 
4.0 Study Endpoints (if applicable) 
 
Primary Outcome: Neuroi maging/Fronto-Striatal Resting State Functional Connectivity 
 
The main outcomes of this study ar e brain imaging related. Using a ne uroimaging technique called resting 
state functional connectivity, which is  a statistical dependence between ti me series of el ectro-physiological 
activity and (de)oxygenated blood levels in distinct regi ons of the brain.  Functional connectivity “strength 
calculation” determines whether the act ivity between a pair of  brain regions covaries  or correlates over 
time. We will investigate the strengt h of the functional connectivity betw een the stimulation target (Nucleus 
Accumbens) and connected areas, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory 
areas of the brain at ba seline, and then will determine whether tFUS increases or decreases the resting-state 
connectivity between these regions af ter the NAC has been stimulated.

copy.  
 
10.0 Study Design / Methods  
 
 Study Overview:  After determining eligibility and inte rest, written informed consent will be 
obtained from participants at th e MUSC Center for Biomedical Im aging. Enrolled participants will 
be placed into the 3T MRI outfitted with a concurrent tFUS plus fMRI acquisition system 
(Brainsonix). First, part icipants will have baseline resting state functional neur oimaging conducted 
to quantify the functionally connected areas to th e nucleus accumbens. Afterwards, while still in 
the MRI scanner, we will administer tFUS to the nucleus accumbens. Lastly, we conducted post-
tFUS neuroimaging (same as pre-tF US). This entire MRI procedure will take approximately 1 hour. 
Participants will be compen sated $100 for their time.  
 Recruitment, Screening, and Consent Procedures:  Healthy participants will be recruited from the 
MUSC community (students and sta ff) as well as gene ral population from the greater Charleston 
region. We will recruit via flyers around campus,  e-mail announcements and word of mouth. If 
interested in learning more about the study, potentia l subjects will be phone screened and educated 
regarding the study’s details. If inte rested in participating in the study, they will be  consented and 
enrolled into the study’s protocol . We then will conduct a multi-panel urine dr ug screen to confirm 
they are not using illicit drugs  and ask for their alcohol cons umption (>3 drinks per day is 
exclusionary). 
 Pregnancy Test Procedures:  If participants are individuals biologically capable of becoming 
pregnant , they will be provided with a pregnancy test  strip After completing the pregnancy test, 
participants with negative results will be aske d to continue to the remaining study procedures, 
whereas those with a positive result will be debriefed and released.  
 tFUS Procedures:  All tFUS will be administe red in similar mythology to that in our prior published 
work (25). Within the MRI scanner, participants  receive two, 10-min sessions of either active or 
sham tFUS spread 10 min apart targeting the nucleus accumbens [fundamental frequency: 650 kHz, 
Pulse repetition frequency: 10 Hz, Pulse Width: 5 ms, Duty Cycle:  5%, Sonication Duration: 30s, 
Inter-Sonication Interval: 30 s, Number of S onications: 10, ISPTA.0 995 mW/cm2, ISPTA.3 719 
mW/cm2, Peak rarefacti onal pressure 0.72 MPa].  
 Sham tFUS Procedues:  Participants will be randomized to receive either two, 10 minute active tFUS 
sessions, or two 10 minute sham tFUS sessions with in the scanner. The sham sessions will include 
a transducer that is connected in a similar fashi on to that of active tFUS, however the cable will not 
be plugged into the system, thus no ultrasound will be delivered to the particip ant. Participants will 
not know or be told whether they ar e receiving active- or sham- tFUS. 
 Neuroimaging Procedures:  All MRI imaging will be  performed using a Siemens 3.0 T Prisma 
scanner equipped with a 32-channel h ead coil. MRI data will be acquire d from all participants before 
and after tFUS administration.  All MRI scan visits will be held at the MUSC Center for Biomedical 
Imaging (CBI; see the Facilities and Resources sec tion). Each MRI scan session will include a high-
resolution T1-weighted structural  scan (whole brain sagittal acquisition, 224 slices, TR=2530ms, 
Version 2; March 29, 2023 
 Page 7 of 10   TE=3.65ms, TI=1100ms, 1mm thick slices, FOV=256, 256x176, flip angle = 7 degrees.), followed 
by 24 minutes of resting-state sca nning, then a concurrent tFUS/fMRI paradigm, and lastly, [ADDRESS_1285370]-tFUS res ting-state scanning. All functional scan s will use the high-resolution fMRI 
protocol described in the Pr eliminary Study: whole brain acquisition, 136 axial slices, 
1.5x1.5x1.5mm voxel size, TR=2000ms, TE=30ms, FOV=204mm, multi-band factor=3.  
 
 
12.0 Data Management  
 
All data will be stored in the Redcap database as  well as in paper documentation. Information about the 
participant (including their identifiab le private information) may have a ll their identifiers removed and used 
for future research studies or distributed to other res earchers for future research without additional informed 
consent. After participation, RedCAP data will be downloaded in excel fo rmat to the secure MUSC server. 
Paper documentation will be stored in locked cabinet w ithin a locked office of the study team. In terms of 
publication, data will be published in aggregate form, so individual participants will not be identifiable in 
the final manuscript. No identify ing information will be published. 
 Neuroimaging data will be collected from the 3T MRI scanner at [ADDRESS_1285371] imaging 
analysis software packages such as FSL and SPM.  
Confidentiality and Quality Control: All study pers onnel will complete Social -Behavioral-Educational 
research CITI training, and also complete in-lab trai ning regarding data security  practices. Study personnel 
will be trained in the IRB protocol. The investigator, and co-investigators will be available to monitor data 
collection to ensure qualit y, confidentiality, and adhere nce to the IRB protocol. 
 The study’s procedures will take place at the MUSC [ADDRESS_1285372] subjects from undue risk  require discussion. These 
Include: (1) procedures used to obtain informed consent,  (2) procedures used to ensure confidentiality of 
the subject data, and (3) procedures used to mini mize possible risks associat ed with the laboratory 
procedures. Regarding informed consen t, participants are fully advised on the research procedures to be 
used, the amount of time required of them, the possible ri sks and benefits of the procedures, their right to 
refuse participation in th e study without prejudice, their right to terminate participa tion at any moment 
without prejudice, and the name [CONTACT_914658]. A ll subjects will be 
required to have capacity to consent.  Regarding confidentialit y, subjects are informed that the information 
they provide will be kept strictly c onfidential, with access limited to the re search staff. Participation in the 
study will be treated as conf idential, as will al l records. The identity of subj ects will be protected with 
alphanumeric codes. All data will be kept in locked f ile cabinets file cabinets or on secure servers designed 
for use and access by [CONTACT_914656].   
Version 2; March 29, [ADDRESS_1285373] of recording a nd reporting unanticipated adverse ev ents to the IRB. We will report 
any adverse event within  48 hours to the IRB. 
  
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects 
Participants will be informed during consenting that th ey are free to withdraw fro m the study at any time. 
They will be informed that they are not obligated to participate once the study is initiated and in particular 
will be reminded prior to tFUS stimulation and neuroi maging that they may discontinue stimulation and/or 
the experiment at any point.   
 
15.0 Risks to Subjects 
 
tFUS Stimulation: When used at/below intensities deemed safe by [CONTACT_3433] e FDA, no significant and pe rsisting side-effects have 
been reported, as confirmed in healthy volunteers( 11), brain injury patients(7)as well as non-human 
primates(26).  In addition, although in the context of  a different study, the FDA has gran ted to the device we will use a 
status of Category B (that is, sa fe and effective) In vestigation Device Exem ption (G130290), on 2/12/2014. 
Indeed, this is consistent with the known physics and biophysics of our stimulation protocol in which the device is operated at (acoustic) en ergy levels that are (1) well below those of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_914649] (by [CONTACT_129743] 40%), and (2) within 
the energy limits deemed safe by [CONTACT_1622].  
Safety in case of pregnancy 
We do not know if the study drug will affect mother’s milk or an unborn fetus. Ther efore, breast-
feeding and pregnant women are not allowed to take part in t he study. If you are pregnant or 
become pregnant, there may be risks to  the embryo or fetus that are unknown at this time. 
Women who can become pregnant must take a pr egnancy test before the start of the study. 
You should not father a child while on this study as the treat ment may indirectly affect an unborn 
child. If you are sexually active and are at ri sk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female 
partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex. 
Unless you cannot have children because of surger y or other medical reasons, you must be 
using an effective form of birth control befor e you start the study. Yo u must also agree to 
continue to use an effective form of birth control for 2 month/s after taking the study drug. 
 
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI tests are non-invasive. There are no known risks or  side effects associated  with conventional MRI 
procedures except to those people who have electrically, magnetically or  mechanically activated implants 
(such as cardiac pacemakers) or to those who have clips on blood vessels in their brain. There are no known 
additional risks for combined tF US+fMRI procedures. However, an MRI may cause you to feel 
claustrophobic (uncomfortable in a small space) or anxious from the noises made by [CONTACT_101488]. 
 
Version 2; March 29, 2023 
 Page 9 of 10   Unknown Risks: 
There is always the possibility of other risks fo r a relatively new technology. The Study team will let the 
participant know if they learn anything that might make the participan t change their mind about 
participating in the study.   Loss of Confidentiality: There is a risk of a loss of confiden tiality of personal info rmation. Subjects are inform ed that the information 
they provide, as well as participatio n in the study, will be kept strictly confidential, with access limited to 
the research staff. The iden tity of subjects in databases will be pr otected with alphanumeric codes. All data 
will be kept in locked file cabinet s or on secure servers designed fo r use and access by [CONTACT_914657].

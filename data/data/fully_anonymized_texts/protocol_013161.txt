2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by [CONTACT_66761] (CFTR) protein, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -regulated anion 
channel expressed primarily at the api[INVESTIGATOR_66728].  The F508del 
mutation is the most common mutation globally, with approximately half of the CF patients in the 
[LOCATION_002] and Europe having the mutation present on both alleles, meaning that they are 
homozygous for this mutation.  The F508del mutation causes significantly reduced expression and 
function of the CFTR protein in various tissues (e.g., lung, pancreas), which leads to CF disease 
manifestations.
CFTR modulators in this study are compounds designed to increase the cell surface expression and 
restore the function of F508del CFTR.  ABBV -2222 (also known as galicaftor, or referred to as GLPG2222 
or G957389) is a CFT R corrector that improves F508del CFTR expression and ABBV -3067 (also known as 
navocaftor, or referred to as GLPG3067 or G914167) is a CFTR potentiator that restores F508del CFTR 
function.  Results from in vitro studies using cultivated human bronchial epi [INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells 
demonstrated that the combination of ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 significantly restored F508del CFTR 
expression and function to a greater degree than observed for either individual component.  ABBV -3067 
and ABBV -2222 are under development a s an oral treatment for CF.
Clinical Hypothesis
ABBV -3067 alone and in combination with ABBV -2222 given for 28 days is safe and well tolerated in 
adults with CF.
The combination of ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 administered together for 28 days will result in 
significant improvements from baseline in pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of CFTR function (lung 
function and sweat chloride [SwCl]) in individuals with CF who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation.
The decrease in SwCl and improvement of lung function as ass essed by [CONTACT_66762][INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (ppFEV 1) will be greater for the ABBV -3067/ABBV -2222 combination than 
for ABBV -3067 monotherapy.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The safety results from Phase 1 studies demonstrated that ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 were generally 
well tolerated in healthy volunteers, either as single agent or combination regimen.
ABBV -2222 treatment in vitro improved CFTR channel expression and function in HBE cells.  The 
completed Phase 2 study (Study GLPG2222 -CL-202) showed that 4 -week treatment of ABBV -2222 
significantly reduced SwCl in CF subjects homozygous for F508del mutation.  Preliminary results from 
the ongoing Phase 1 study (Study GLPG2737 -CL-105) also showed that the dual combination of

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].ABBV -2222 and GLPG 2451 (another potentiator under development with a similar mechanism of action 
as ABBV -3067) reduced SwCl and increased ppFEV 1in patients with CF who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the combination of ABBV -2222 and ABBV -3067 has 
the potential to improve F508del CFTR function in patients with CF, as well as their lung function 
measured by [CONTACT_66763] 1.
The following paragraphs describe the main risks that are potentially associated with repeated doses of 
ABBV -2222, in c ombination with potentiator/corrector compounds (GLPG2451, ABBV -3067, and 
).
Rash
Nonserious adverse events (AEs) of rash of mild to moderate severity have been observed following 
multiple -dose treatment with ABBV -2222 in combination with ABBV -3067 or GLPG2451,  
.  Rash was considered possibly 
related to study drug by [CONTACT_66764].
There were also reports of mild rash occurring among subjects who received ABBV- 2222 alone, but none 
led to study drug discontinuation.
As a result of these rash occurrences, enhanced safety monitoring and specific guidance to the 
investigator is described in the Operations Manual ( Appendix F).  Rash is considered an adverse event of 
special interest (AESI) (see Section 6.1).
Taken together, the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs support further 
development of ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 in Phase 2 studies in subjects with CF.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the ABBV -3067 
and ABBV -2222 Investigator's Brochures.1-[ADDRESS_72900] a dose of ABBV -2222 to use in Part 2 based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, and

3.3 Safety Endpoints
Safety endpoints will be AEs, AESIs, weight, vital signs, physical exams, clinical laboratory data, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_66731].
3.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Blood samples for dete rmination of ABBV- 2222 and ABBV -3067 plasma concentrations will be collected 
from subjects at the visits indicated in Appendix D.  A nonlinear mixed -effects modeling approach will be 
used to estimate the population central values and the empi[INVESTIGATOR_66732] -3067 and ABBV -2222 oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional 
parameters m ay be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.  Data from this study may be 
combined with data from other studies for the population pharmacokinetic or exposure -response 
analyses.
3.5 Biomarker Research
Optional samples (whole blood) will be coll ected at specific time points as described in the Activity 
Schedule ( Appendix D) to evaluate known and/or novel disease -related or drug -related bio markers.  
Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  The objective of this 
research is to analyze samples for biomarkers that will help to understand CF, related conditions, and 
the subject's response to ABBV -2222 and/or ABBV -3067.  Genes of interest may include those 
associated with pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), genes within 
the target pathway, or genes related to CF (e.g., CFTR).  This research is exploratory in nature and the 
results may not be included with the clinical study report.

4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, multi -country, Phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm, 2 -part study 
of ABBV -3067 given alone and in combination with ABBV -2222 for 28 days in adult subjects with CF who 
are homozygous for F508del CFTR mutation.  This study is designed to e valuate the safety and efficacy 
of ABBV -3067 alone and in combination with ABBV -2222, and in a sequential manner that will also allow 
dose selection for these compounds.
This study will enroll subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of CF who are homo zygous for the 
F508del CFTR mutation.  In both Part 1 and Part 2, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66763] 1at 
Screening (< 70% vs ≥ 70%).  See Section 5for detailed information regarding eligibility criteria.
Study drug will be administered in the morning from Day 1 to the day before the Day 29 visit.  In Part 1 
of the study, a fixed 150 mg once daily (QD) dose of ABBV- 3067 will be administered wit h ABBV -2222 in 
a dose range -finding manner to enable a dose selection for ABBV -2222 for Part 2 and future 
combination studies.  In addition, ABBV -3067 will be given alone (i.e., with placebo for ABBV- 2222) to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABBV -3067 a t 2 dose levels.  Differences in endpoint values between 
the dual therapy arms and monotherapy arms, from this study and a previous Phase 2 study 
(Study GLPG2222 -CL-202), will demonstrate the respective contributions of ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 
to the combi nation.
In Part 2 of the study, the dose of ABBV -2222 selected from Part 1 will be administered with ABBV -3067 
in a dose- ranging manner to enable selection of the ABBV- 3067 dose for future combination studies.

4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Choice of Control Group
The control group consists of subjects randomly assigned to receive placebo.
The ABBV -3067 single -agent treatment groups (i.e., Regimens A and B) also serve as control groups for 
the dual combination treat ment groups, in order to demonstrate the contribution of ABBV -2222.
Although there are dual combination products that have been approved to treat CF subjects who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation, these products are not yet considered standard of car e in all 
countries where this study will be conducted.  In countries where dual combination products are 
accessible as standard of care, this design will also allow the participation of CF subjects who are not on 
dual combination products due to concerns a bout safety or tolerability, lack of efficacy, or other 
concerns (see Eligibility Criteria #21).
Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  All efficacy 
measurements in this st udy are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with CF.  All clinical 
and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted.
Suitability of Subject Population
This study was designed to enroll subjects with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of CF who are also 
homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation because ABBV- [ADDRESS_72905] likely to 
demonstrate a significa nt change in sweat chloride and ppFEV 1when given a combination of ABBV- 2222 
and ABBV -3067.
Selection of Doses in the Study
Part 1
ABBV -2222 has been evaluated following multiple doses in healthy volunteers (Study GLPG2222 -CL-101) 
and patients with CF who are homozygous for F508del mutation in a Phase 2 study 
(Study GLPG2222 -CL-202), at dosages ranging from 50 mg QD to 600 mg QD.  ABBV -2222 was safe and 
well tolerated at all dosages tested.  In Study GLPG2222 -CL-202, patients with CF who were dosed with 
ABBV- 2222 for 29 days, there was a trend of dose -dependent decrease in SwCl was observed between 
50 mg and 200 mg doses on Day 15 and Day 29, with maximum decrease in SwCl observed in the 200 mg 
dose group.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Considering the totality of the data from the in vitro HBE studies and Phase 1 and Pha se 2 studies, a 
dose range of 10 mg to 300 mg would provide an opportunity to study and explore the dose range 
finding for ABBV- 2222 in CF subjects homozygous of F508del mutation in Part 1 of the study.
 
 
 
.
Part 2
ABBV -2222 dose will be determined based on the analysis of Part 1 data and will be kept constant across 
all treatment groups in Part 2.
 
 
 
For both Part 1 and Part 2, treatment duration of 4 weeks was selected based on efficacy endpoint 
responses observed in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.  In Phase 1 Study GLPG2737 -CL-105, the 
reduction in SwCl and increase in ppFEV 1were observ ed following 1 week of treatment with the dual 
combination of GLPG2451 and ABBV -2222, with the effects sustained following 2 weeks of treatment.  
In Phase 2 Study GLPG2222 -CL-202, reduction in SwCl was similar following 2 weeks and 4 weeks of 
treatment wit h ABBV -2222.  Therefore, it is expected that the 4 -week treatment duration of ABBV -2222 
and ABBV -3067 dual combination will be sufficient to assess the responses in efficacy endpoints in this 
study.
The maximum dose of the ABBV -2222 administrated in this s tudy will not exceed .  The 
maximum dose of ABBV- 3067 administered in this study will not exceed .
Overall, ABBV -2222 exposure (maximum observed concentration [C max] and area under the 
concentration versus time curve from 0 to τ [AUC 0-τ]) following multiple  
 the highest tolerated 
dose in the multiple ascending dose ; and ABBV -[ADDRESS_72906] tolerated dose in the multiple ascending dose

determined at Screening from the central laboratory does not confirm study eligibility, the 
subject must be discontinued from the study.   For subjects who participated in Study M19 -771, 
it is acceptable to use the CFTR genotype that the central lab provided in Study M19 -771 to 
establish eligibility.

alternative medical cause.
Postmenopausal, age ≤ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an 
alternative medical cause and a FSH level > 40 IU/L.
Permanently surgically sterile (bilater al oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or 
hysterectomy).
Females, of Childbearing Potential
Females of childbearing potential must avoid pregnancy during study participation and for 
at least [ADDRESS_72920] dose of study drug.
Females must commit to one of the following methods of birth control:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, and injectable) associated with inhibition of ovulation plus a 
barrier method* initiated at least 30 days prior to study Baseline Day 1.
Progestogen -only hormonal birth control (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with 
inhibition of ovulation plus a barrier method* initiated at least 30 days prior to study 
Baseline Day 1.
Intrauterine device (IUD).
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) plus a barrier method.*
Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation (can be via hysteroscopy, provided a 
hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_17165]).
Vasectomized partner (provided the partner has received medi cal confirmation of the 
surgical success of the vasectomy and is the sole sexual partner of the trial subject).
Practice true abstinence, defined as:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when 
this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of t he subject (periodic abstinence 
[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal are 
not acceptable).
* As there are no current clinical data available regarding potential interactions between the study drugs 
and hormonal contraceptives, female subjects who use hormonal contraception should supplement this 
with one of the effective barrier methods described below (preferably male condom):
Male or female condom with or without spermicide.
Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with sperm icide.

should be continued with min imal variation of dose or frequency for the study duration.  Subjects who 
take inhaled antibiotics for suppression of chronic airway infection must be on a stable regimen for at 
least [ADDRESS_72923] study drug administration and remain on that regimen for the study 
duration.
Examples of therapeutic regimens for pulmonary health include antibiotics; corticosteroids (inhaled or 
oral); inhalation of bronchodilators, hypertonic saline, mannitol or dornase alfa; ibuprofen, and airway 
clearance techni ques.
Inhaled antibiotics:   Subjects who are on cycling inhaled antibiotics (including "on/off" cycling) 
must continue on the same schedule.  The timing of the first dose of study drug should be 
synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of the i nhaled antibiotic in the cycle.  The 
timing of the first dose in a cycle also applies to subjects who are alternating 2 different inhaled 
antibiotics each month.
Bronchodilators and airway clearance:   Bronchodilator medications and airway clearance
techniques are frequently used in CF and may affect lung function measurements in the short 
term.  Since ppFEV 1is the primary endpoint for this study, it is very important that the timing of 
these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66740] s pi[INVESTIGATOR_66741], starting with Baseline (Day 1).  In order to minimize disruptions in therapeutic 
regimens, it is recommended that subjects who routinely use bronchodilators be counseled to 
use them consistently according to t heir usual schedule throughout the study.  Further, study 
visits should be planned so that the timing of spi[INVESTIGATOR_66742] (if 
applicable) will be similar at each visit (e.g., within 2 hours of each other).  Subjects should also 
be allowed adequate time to complete their inhaled medication/airway clearance regimen (if 
applicable) before coming to the study visits to maintain consistency throughout the study.
If subjects miss their routine bronchodilator dose the morning of the Baseline (Day 1) visit, they 
should also withhold bronchodilators until after spi[INVESTIGATOR_66743].  Subjects who use bronchodilators only on an as -needed basis will be asked to 
refrain from using them prior to spi[INVESTIGATOR_66744] y visit days.  At each study visit, subjects will 
be asked about the medication name [CONTACT_66779] (if applicable).  
There are several bronchodilators available, including salbutamol (albuterol), salmeterol, 
formoterol, arform oterol, indacaterol, vilanterol, ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], glycopyrronium, 
umaclidium, and aclidinium.  In some cases, bronchodilators are combined with a second 
bronchodilator, an inhaled corticosteroid, or both into a single inhaler.  If a subject uses a 
combination product, the information captured in the source documents should include the 
combination and not just the bronchodilator component.  On study visit Days 1 and 15,

Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or 
herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment or recei ves during the study 
must be recorded through the final post -treatment visit ([ADDRESS_72924] dose of study drug).
Any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy should be raised to the [COMPANY_013] medical contact.  
Information regarding potential drug interactions with ABBV -3067 and/or ABBV -2222 can be located in 
the ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 Investigator's Brochures.
Subjects must be able to safely discontinue any prohibited medications after at least [ADDRESS_72925] be consented for 
the study prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications for the purpose of meeting study eligibility.

A thorough investigation of potential etiologies for the elevated transaminases should be conducted 
(e.g., trauma, acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion), and the subject should be foll owed 
closely for clinical progression.
Subjects for whom treatment is discontinued for elevated hepatic function tests should have 
transaminases and bilirubin levels repeated by [CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_72931]'s final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_72932]'s source documentation.
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site.  The investigator may

reasons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly notify the investigator.
5.[ADDRESS_72933] Withdrawal from Study
To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study d rug treatment should continue to be followed at a Premature Discontinuation visit and 30 -day

5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_17186].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_66770] 26 of 75 
  
STUDY M19 -530  |  Version 3.0 / EudraCT [ADDRESS_72940]'s treatment group 
assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_66771].
In both Part 1 and Part 2, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66772] 1(< 70% versus 
≥ 70% of predicted value).
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each su bject's treatment throughout the study.  To maintain the blind, the 
active treatment and placebo formulations ( Table 1and Table 2) provided for the study will be identical 
in appearance.  The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a 
medical emergency.
In addition, to minimize the potential of unblinding, the [COMPANY_013] study team will not have access to the 
post -first-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_66746] u nblinded for Part 1 or Part 2 
analysis.  Site personnel and subjects will not be informed of the subjects' study -related post -first-dose 
sweat chloride results until the end of the corresponding study part (Part 1 or Part 2).  Subjects will not 
be informed of their study -related spi[INVESTIGATOR_66747] 
(Part 1 or Part 2).
A limited number of [COMPANY_013] personnel who are not directly involved in the conduct of the study may 
receive unblinded data prior to full enrollment of Part [ADDRESS_72941] to study subjects.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is 
identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying independent ethics c ommittee (IEC)/IRB, 
regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A produc t complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
Page 27 of 75 
  
STUDY M19 -530  |  Version 3.0 / EudraCT [ADDRESS_72943] this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during 
the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adver se Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any un favorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surg ery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
A supplemental case report form should be completed for the following:
Discontinuation or interrup tion of study drug due to a hepatic -related AE, including laboratory 
criteria defined in Section 5.5:
A hepatic -related SAE 
Clinically Significant Assessments
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs will be 
assessed, and those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE.  When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia).  In the absence of a diagnosis, the 
abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine, decreased he moglobin).
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has one or more of the 
following:
Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment
Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention
A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, 
does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria.  The investigator wil l determine whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant.  All study assessments deemed "clinically significant" 
based on the investigator's medical judgment will be managed and followed to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_72944] indicates a life -threatening AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following crit eria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or clinical research organization (CRO) (as appropriate) as 
an SAE within 24 hours after the site became made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_72945] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi [INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, inf luenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenita l anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.

the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughou t the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Rash is an AE of special interest (AESI) and will be monitored during the study.
In prior Phase 1 studies, there were isolated instances of nonserious generalized, maculopapular rash 
that occurred when ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 were administered together.  The rashes resolved after 
study drug discontinuation.  Maculopapular rash is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_66773] s 
(flat) and papules (elevated).  Also known as morbilliform rash, maculopapular rash is one of the most 
common cutaneous AEs, frequently affecting the upper trunk, spreading centripetally, and associated 
with pruritus.
Rash is to be graded according to th e CTCAE (adapted) version 5.0.[ADDRESS_72947] to be reported 
within 24 hours from the time of knowledge of the event.  Refer to the Operations Manual ( Appendix F) 
for details about management of these events.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AE according to the CTCAE version 5.0.3
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semicolon indicated "or" within the description of the grade)

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative cause s, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_72948] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  [COMPANY_013] will pro vide a 
separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject's partners will be collected from the 
date of the first dose through [ADDRESS_72949] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.

The management of specific AEs (including AE of special interest of rash) and laboratory parameters is 
described in the Operations Manual.  Specific management for elevated hepatic function tests is 
described in this protocol in Section 5.5.
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the interim database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_72950] model with repeated 
measures (MMRM) with change from Baseline in ppFEV 1as the dependent variable; treatment group, 
visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects; subject as a random effect; and baseline ppFEV 1
as a covariate.  The estimate for the within -group mean change along with the 95% confidence intervals 
and the corresponding Pvalues will be calculated as the primary analysis.  The treatment effect 
compared to placebo will be estimated using the same model. 
The secondary endpoints of sweat chloride, ppFEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25-75will be analyzed based on an 
MMRM model similarly as the primary endpoint.
Details on the efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Sample Size Estimation
The power calculations are provided for the most potentially efficacious groups with the combination 
treatment for both Part 1 and Part 2 for the primary efficacy endpoint.  Placebo groups from both Part 1 
and Part 2 will be combined in the Part 2 efficacy analysis.  A sample size of 1 8 subjects in a group will 
provide 80% power to detect a 5.3% absolute increase from baseline in ppFEV 1for that group assuming 
a standard deviation of 7.5%.  When comparing to the placebo group, a sample size of [ADDRESS_72951] bo group will provide 80% power (Part 1), or a sample size of 18 subjects in 
treated group and 27 subjects in placebo group will provide approximately 87% power (Part 2), to detect 
a 7.3% effect size in ppFEV 1change from Baseline assuming the standard dev iation of 7.5% for change in 
ppFEV 1for both groups.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set for both Part 1 and Part 2 based on the 
treatment subjects actually receive.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], AESIs, weight, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory data, 12 -lead ECGs, pulse oximetry and spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  Details on the safety analyses are

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Subjects should be instructed to not to take study drug before coming to the site on the day of the 
Day 15 and Day 29 visits.
At the Day 15 visit, a trough (predose) pharmacokinetic sample should be collected prior to the 
administration of study drug.  Additional pharmacokinetic samples will be taken 2, 4, and 6 hours 
following the dose, as outlined in Section 2.1.  Subjects should take the dose of study drug within an 
hour after eating a meal at the study site.
For all pharmacokinetic samples, the date and accurate time of the pharmacokinetic sample collection 
will be recorded on the lab requisition form. 
At the Day 15 and D ay 29 visits, the date and time of the previous 3 study drug doses before those visits 
will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample collection, processing, 
and shipment.
Measurement Method
Plasma concentrations of ABBV- 3067 and ABBV -2222 will be determined by [CONTACT_66777] a validated method.
3.6 Biomarker Sampling
Optional whole blood samples will be collected for biomarker research as specified in Section 2.  All 
biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific laboratory manual.  
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the samples and data in a secure 
storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while 
research on ABBV -3067 and ABBV -2222 (or drugs of this class) or cystic fibrosis (CF) and related 
conditions continues, but for no longer than [ADDRESS_72971] 
5minutes.
The ECGs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41596] ("local reader").  The local 
reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a 
written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –not clinically significant
Abnormal ECG –clinically significant

4.1 Methods and Timing of Safety Assessment
All serious adverse events (SAEs) as well as protocol -related nonserious AEs (e.g., bruising at 
phlebotom y site, done during Screening) will be collected from the time the subject signed the 
study -specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug 
Page [ADDRESS_72984] be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).
The investigational p roducts are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context 
of this study.  The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and 
stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed on site as 
appropriate.
6.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study.  Once assigned to a regimen, all eligible 
subjects will receive that same assigned dosage for up to 28 days ( ±2 days).
At the Screening visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the use of the IRT.  
For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must contact [CONTACT_17213] a screen failure.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the screening visit throughout the 
study.  Upon receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system.

5.3. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment 
Patients who qualify for the study will return to  the site on Day -1 (e.g., randomization will 
formally take place at the end of the placebo-co ntrolled run-in period, after compliance during 
the run-in period is assessed). Prior to randomizati on, the Investigator will ensure that the patient 
continues to meet inclusion and exclusion criteri a, and perform all pre-dose procedures. Once a 
patient is determined to be eligible for randomization by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator or the 
Investigator’s research staff will randomize the patient according to a centralized randomization 
process.   
Note all patients will be pre-randomized to their status/treatment group for the randomized 
withdrawal part of the protocol at the initial ra ndomization.   
5.4. Blinding, Packaging, and Labeling 
5.4.1. Blinding and Breaking the Blind 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-c ontrolled study. Blinding and randomization will 
be accomplished so that all study-related sta ff remain blinded to patient assignation.   
The Investigator, study site staff,  clinical research organization staff provi ding site management, 
and Medical Monitor will not have access to the randomization scheme during the study except 
in the case of an emergency.  Breaking the blind for a patient should be do ne only in the event of 
a medical emergency where the identity of study drug is necessary to appropriately treat the 
patient.  The request to break the blind shoul d be discussed with the Medical Monitor and 
Rhythm, whenever possible.  If the blind is broken, the reason, when and how the blind was 
broken will be documented.  Every attempt will be  made to maintain the blind throughout the 
study. 
5.4.2. Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug is provided in single-us e vials.  The study drug is s upplied in glass vials and is 
provided in kits according to the randomization schedule for pa tients enrolled in the study.  All 
study drugs, including placebo for practice, will be supplied by [CONTACT_525664]. 
Packaging and labeling will be prepared to meet all regulatory requirements. 
5.5. Duration of Patient Participation 
The overall study duration will be approximately 12 months, as currently planned.  Individual 
patient participation in the study (Screening Period, Run-in, Treatment Period, withdrawal 
period, open label optional extension and Follow-up Period) will be approximately [ADDRESS_746119] ed.  All used vials and syringes 
will be collected to assess compliance with the protocol. RM-493-010_PWS  |

Screening Visit and Day 1 with results known prior to initiati ng the injection, and pregnancy 
testing will be mon itored during the study. 
For females able to bear children, a hormonal (i.e ., oral, implantable, or  injectable) and single-
barrier method (i.e., sponge), or a double-barr ier method of birth cont rol (i.e., condom with 
spermicide) or abstinence must be used/ practiced throughout the study and for 90 days 
following the study. Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (s tatus post hysterectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or bilatera l tubal ligation) or post-menopa usal for at least 12 months 
(and confirmed with a screeni ng FSH level in the post-menopausal range), do not require 
contraception during the study. It is not known if this treatment will affect sp ermatogenesis.  Therefore, males with female 
partners of childbearing potential  must agree o use contraception (e.g., if they ;have not had a 
vasectomy then should either (a) abstain from  reproductive sexual intercourse or (b) use a 
condom and contraceptive foam during intercourse ) if they become sexually active during the 
study and for [ADDRESS_746130] not donate sperm for 90 days 
following their partic ipation in the study  
6.2.2. Protection from Sun 
Skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or ta ning, was observed in the cynomolgus monkey toxicology 
studies, and the human Phase 1/2 studies.  These events were reversible upon cessation of study 
drug.  However, it is still uncerta in if exposure to sunlight might exacerbate the tanning effects of 
RM-493. It is also important that patients do not participat e in any activities that will intentionally cause 
their skin to tan (e.g.; visit UV tanning salons, use spray tanners, self-tanning lotions, etc.). 
6.3. Efficacy Measurements 
6.3.1. Weight 
Weight (Kg) will be recorded as shown in the Schedule of Assessments (SOA), and generally 
will be assessed and recorded once weekly.  All m easurements will be done in triplicate at each 
timepoint.  The same scale should be used th roughout the study, including the Screening Visit, 
and should be calibrated on a regular basis.  We ight should be measured when patients are 
fasting and at approximately the same time at each  visit.  Patients should be in underwear or 
scrubs (or equivalent), with no shoes and have emptied their bladder.    RM-493-010_PWS  |

6.4.2. Demographics and Medical History 
A complete medical history along with demographic data will be obtained for all patients during 
the Screening Period.  Data to be recorded in the source document and CRF include the patient’s 
gender, race, date of birth a nd concomitant medication use. 
A recent medical history will be obtained on Day 1 prior to randomization to assess continued 
study eligibility and adherence to final inclusion/ exclusion criteria.  This recent medical history 
includes a review for changes from screening as well as a review of the patient’s recent 
medication use and to assess whether or not any ch anges have occurred sin ce the previous visit. 
6.4.3. Physical Examination, Comprehensi ve Skin Examination, and Height 
Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will include re view of peripheral lymph nodes, head, eyes 
(including conjunctiva), ears,  nose, mouth and oropharynx, n eck, heart, lungs, abdomen, 
musculoskeletal including back, extremities a nd neurologic, will be performed during the 
Screening Period (or at the discretion of the site , can be performed at Day -1), and at the Final 
Study Visit.   
Abbreviated symptom-directed physical examinations (e.g., general, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin 
(not comprehensive), and extremities) will be performed during the Treatment Period, and follow 
up period as shown in the SOA.   
All physical examinations are to be  conducted in adequate light.

interpretation of study outcomes regarding skin changes.  In such cases, the patient will be 
excluded from the study.  However, any lesions of  concern can be biopsied and if confirmed to 
be benign prior to randomization, patient s can be enrolled in the study.   
In the event a patient experiences changes to skin or skin lesions that are unresolved (or have not 
significantly improved or are clos e to resolution) at the Final Study Visit, the patient may be 
asked to return for additional follow up assessmen ts to document progress towards resolution for

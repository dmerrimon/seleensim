 A Phase Ib Study Evaluating the Safety  and Tolerability  of 
Vitamin C in Patients with Intermediate or high Risk 
Myelodysplastic Syndrome with TET2  Mutations  
 
Methodology: 
This is an open label,  Phase  Ib study  designed to evaluate the safety,  toxicity  and biological  
activity  of high dose  Vitamin  C in bone marrow  and peripheral  blood  when  administered  as 
therapy  to patients  with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic  syndrome according to the 
revised IPSS (international prognostic scoring system) criteria whose disease has a TET2  
mutation.  
 
Number of Patients:  
We propose to treat up to [ADDRESS_393096] failed 
hypomethylating agent therapy. We will evaluate the safety and toxicity of continuous infusion high 
dose Vitamin C in MDS patients, confirm that we can achieve Vitamin C plasma concentrations 
needed to target TET2  mutations, and monitor response and pharmacodynamics  markers.  
 
Diagnosis and Main Eligibility  Criteria:  
This study will enroll patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic  syndrome

Version: [ADDRESS_393108] and Dose:  
The gene that encodes L- gulonolactone oxidase ( GULO ), a key enzyme in Vitamin C 
biosynthesis, is dysfunctional in humans [2]. Consequently, we depend on constant dietary 
Vitamin C intake and digestive uptake, which occurs via two sodium -dependent Vitamin C 
Transporters (SVCTs). SVCT activity is homeostatically down- regulated in enterocytes, 
limiting the blood levels that can be achieved f ollowing oral administration of Vitamin C to a 
plasma concentration of approximately 70- 80 µM [3]. This limitation can be circumvented by 
[CONTACT_319252] (intravenous, IV) injection. Notably, the early studies of Cameron and Pauling 
suggested anti -neoplastic effects of parenteral Vitamin C on various solid tumors [4], but 
these results were not reproduced in subsequent trials, including those by [CONTACT_319253] [5, 6] . However, the latter investigators only tested oral Vitamin C at up to 10 grams/d, 
and might not have achieved levels high enough for efficacy. Specifically, peak 
ascorbate levels were ~ 220- 250 
µM and declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_37181] 30 minutes due to renal 
excretion. In addition, those studies, unlike the ones proposed here, were not 
biomarker -informed or –directed . There have been limited studies of the effects of Vitamin 
C in AML/MDS patients. In one trial, Vitamin C at 1 gram/day was given IV in combination with arsenic trioxide to AML patients, and showed no additive efficacy [7]. Another study 
combined a very low dose of parenteral Vitamin C with decitabine in MDS and AML patients , 
with limited clinical evidence of efficacy [8] . In that study, the standard decitabine dose for 
MDS (20 mg/m
2/day intravenously for  5 days) was safely added to Vitamin C 1 g IV for 5 
days in combination w ith arsenic  trioxide. Vitamin C was also continued orally weekly 
between the cycles of decitabine and was  well tolerated. Vitamin C did not add any benefit, 
but it was given at a low dose (1 gram), for a short period of time (less than 2 hours infusion), 
and to unselected MDS patients. There has been no clinical study using high- dose Vitamin 
C (50 grams or more daily) as  a hypomethylating agent to regulate levels of 5mC  and 5hmC.  
Moreover, TET2 mutations have not been previously used as a potential biomarker for 
choosing Vitamin C therapy, as suggested by [CONTACT_319254]- clinical data described 
above. We hypothesize that  high doses of  Vitamin  C are necessary  to achieve therapeutic 
levels and efficacy in MDS  patients, and that response will be restricted to, or at least 
maximized in, patients with TET2 mutations.  Based on previous pharmacokinetic analyses, 
IV administration can  produce blood levels at least 25 times  those achieved by [CONTACT_319255]. Furthermore, such doses can be administered safely [9] . For example, h igh-dose 
intravenous Vitamin C was combined with gemcitabine and Erlotinib in a phase 1 study of 
pancreatic cancer without any major side effects [10]. Patients  in that trial received different  
Vitamin  C doses, with one group receiving up to 100 g intravenously 3 times/week per cycle 
without  major  adverse events.  
 We propose a Phase 1 component with 3 dose- escalation cohorts in a 3+3 design to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Vitamin C . Vitamin C will be provided from 
McGuff based on a confidential agreement with them and McGuff provides the only FDA -
approved injectable preparation of Vitamin C in the [LOCATION_003]. For the dose - escalation cohorts, 
we suggest a starting Vitamin  C
 dose  for MDS  patients of 50 grams,  continuous  
intravenous  infusion (CIVI) over 24  hours, given daily for 5 days for a total of 250 grams, 
followed by a 50% increase in dose for the next cohort to 75 grams/ day Vitamin C CIVI for 
[ADDRESS_393109] a 100% increase in the 
original dose wit h an additional 3 patients treated with a dose of 100 grams/ day CIVI for 5 
days for total of 500 grams for 5 days (see below for schematic diagram ). Patients will be 
maintained on [ADDRESS_393110] dose level cohort is completed and all patients treated successfully for one cycle. Two additional cohorts will 
 
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol

Version: 3 .0 
 be treated similarly. If, as expected no patient experiences dose- limiting toxicity (DLT), then 
the last dose level cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects to confirm safety. After determining 
the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) from the dose- escalation cohorts, we will proceed 
to a Phase [ADDRESS_393111] in the future and not as a part of 
this trial. The Vitamin C dose will not be increased above 100 grams/ day, even if, as 
expected, no DLTs are encountered, because higher dosages require larger volumes than the CADD pump can accommodate and potentially have more toxicity  with limited to no 
additional benefit on Vitamin C pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.  Three patients in 
the first c ohort (Vitamin C 50 grams CIVI) have been enrolled before the study redesign and 
tolerated treatment well without any side effects and should account for the completion of 
the first cohort.  
 
 
 
 
We have incorporated plans to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) to  identify  the doses required 
to achieve our targeted dose.  We performed extensive tests to confirm the safety and 
stability of dilut ing Vitamin C in normal saline, and its use in [ADDRESS_393112] 
15-20 mM is achieved with a  half-life around  30-45 minutes [11]. Accordingly,  giving  50 
grams daily Vitamin  C as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) should achieve a 
concentration of at  least  1 mM continuously in the plasma o f patients, and this is the 
expected concentration (based on our pre- clinical studies) required for demethylation.  For 
further cohorts we expect to achieve at least a plasma concentration of [ADDRESS_393113] to 
achieve higher demethylation effects and a better clinical response.  Moreover, a very recent 
publication in BMC in May 2019 supported our PK assessments, and showed that the peak (Cmax) and the area under the curve (AUC) Vitamin C plasma concentrations increased 
Phase 1 Study Design   
A 3+ 3 design will be used for the Phase 1 Dose Escalation Cohorts; 3 patients will receive Vitamin C  as a continuous 
intravenous infusion (CIVI) of 50 grams (g) daily over 24 hours for 5 days for total of 250 grams over 5 days, then 
another 3 patients will receive 75 grams for total of 375 grams over 5 days, followed by a final cohort of 3 patients at 
100 grams for total of 500 grams over 5 days. Each cycle will be 28- days, and patients can receive up to 4 cycles. 
Patients will be continued between each cycle on oral Vitamin C as 1 grams daily (from day 6 till 28).

 with higher doses. In that trial they used doses up to 1.5g/kg/ day Vitamin C as  no MTD was 
seen, and they were able to achieve Vitamin C plasma concentrations up to 10- 20 mM for 4 
hours at 1.5g/kg dose with Cmax and AUC appearing to reach maximum values at this dose 
[12]. Also, Levine et al. showed earlier that patients receiving high doses of IV Vitamin C 
achieved plasma concentrations up to 14 mM, compared with a maximum plasma 
concentration of only 220 µM following high doses of oral Vitamin C [13] . Accordingly, given 
the above data we planned our study with 3 dosage escalations cohorts with Vitamin C 100 
grams being the maximum planned dose. To measure plasma Vitamin C levels, we will use 
liquid chromatography, coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC -MS) on 
samples obtained from the peripheral blood of MDS patients  [14]. The LC column is a 
Millipore TM ZIC-pHILIC (2.1 x150 mm, 5 μm), coupled to Dionex Ultimate 3000 TM system, 
and the column oven temperature will be set to 25o C for the gradient elution. MS analyses 
will be carried out by [CONTACT_319256] a Thermo Q Exactive HF TM mass 
spectrometer, operating in heated electrospray ionization mode (HESI). The method duration will be [ADDRESS_393114]. Drew Jones, the director of the PCC Metabolomics Developi[INVESTIGATOR_319223].  
  
Dose modifications, Mode of Administration and Sample Storage:  
 For patients who present with a low absolute neutrophil count, no dose modifications will be 
required for cycle 2 and subsequent cycles. Vitamin C dosage for subsequent treatment will 
be at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.  
 
Patients will require central access prior to starting the continuous infusion of vitamin C.  
Patients
 will require either  an implantable device  (e.g. Port-a-Cath)  or a PI[INVESTIGATOR_319224] 
(peripherally  inserted  central  catheter).  Both procedures  represent  safe and effective  
methods  of obtaining central  access. The patient  will sign a separate  consent  discussing 
the risks and benefits  of catheter  placement  prior to the procedure.  Peripheral  inserted 
central  catheter  (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875])  placement  has a minimal risk of thrombus formation and bleeding 
while Port -a-Cath placement has a minimal risk of thrombus formation and infection.  
 
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_319225]. Neel’s and [CONTACT_319306]’  Laboratory  and measuring  Vitamin  C will be conducted at [CONTACT_319307]  
laboratory  at NYU core facility and samples will be shipped directly for his facility. Samples 
collected at University of Miami will be kept and processed in the lab of Luisa Cimmino, PhD 
until all time points have been collected. University of Miami will send replicate samples to 
NYU. We plan for store the samples until all the studies required  for this clinical trial are 
completed. The linking key between the samples and patient will only be kept with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_319226] ; any patient can ask to withdraw his/her sample from the study in writing to the PI.   
  
Intended Duration of  Treatment:  
All patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (4 weeks). Patients with clinical benefit  
(CR, PR, or SD) then will undergo  a second 4- week  cycle of treatment.  Complete  
response (CR)  is defined  as myeloblasts  <5% in bone marrow  and peripheral blood 
showing  neutrophils  count  >1000/μL, hemoglobin >11g/dL and platelets count>100,000/μL. 
Partial response (PR) is  defined  as any decrease in myeloblasts  in the bone  marrow  or 
peripheral blood or improvement  in peripheral blood count but not meeting CR criteria 
while stable disease (SD) shows no evidence  of progression.  Patients  to receive a 
maximum  of 16 weeks  of treatment  (4 cycles). If a patient  progress after receiving a cycle 
of treatment then the patient will be withdrawn from the study.

 reported that parenteral Vitamin C increased Tregs in a sepsis model [15]. 
Vitamin C also plays an essential role in macrophage activation [16]. It is 
important to study the potential effects of high dose Vitamin C on these 
aspects of the MDS microenvironment, as they could modulate or enhance 
the cell -autonomous effects of Vitamin C on MDS blasts and might suggest 
future combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. According we will evaluate the association of 
methylation, gene expression with response  in Phase II .  
 
Statistical Methods:  
Statistical considerations:  
Phase 1:  At each dose level, safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_319258]. The proportion of patients 
with each adverse experience will be reported, along with the proportion of patients who 
achieve a response. Responses will be defined as in the IWG (International Working Group) 
response criteria in myelodysplasi a as: complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), or 
hematologic improvement (HI) after completion of cycle 4  [17]. Overall response rate (PR+ 
CR+ HI) will be provided for each dose level and across dose levels for the Phase 1 portion of the trial (with exact 95% confidence intervals). The operating characteristics and  the 
estimated probabilities of dose escalation are provided in Table 1. Table 1 lists the probability of escalating to the next dose, based on the true, but unknown DLT rate as the true DLT rate 
increases.

Initial Safety  Evaluation 
Adverse Events: In the phase I study, [ADDRESS_393117] 
experiences a DLT, probably, possibly, or definitely related to treatment. DLT is defined  as 
grade 3 or higher of any duration or as a Grade ≥ 2 adverse event (AE) that persists for ≥96 
hours with the exception of Grade ≥ 2 AEs clearly related to the underlying MDS. Based on 
prior experience with Vitamin C, however, we do not anticipate any DLTs. In the unlikely 
event that ≥ 1 patients develop grade 2 or more toxicity the cohort will be expanded to enroll 
a total of 6 subjects at its current dose escal ation cohort. If ≥ [ADDRESS_393118] 1 cycle of 28 days (the DLT period), we will perform a safety evaluation of conti nuous
 infusion high -dose 
Vitamin C. If two (2) or more grade II or greater toxicities (probably, possibly, or definitely 
related to  treatment) that persist are observed, the dose will be considered too toxic, and we 
will select the preceding dose for the phase [ADDRESS_393119] dose safely and without any toxicity, we will proceed with the dose -

Reported  toxicities were mainly central nervous system (CNS) -related, and consisted only 
of dizziness or headaches. Other non -CNS toxicities were mild (grades 1- 2), and include  
thirst, nausea, vomiting, and mildly increased urinary frequency. There have been case 
reports of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_319227] C infusion, but most of these 
individuals had other risk factors for this disorder. Accordingly, any patient with history of any

 A Phase  Ib Study Evaluating the Safety  and Tolerability  of 
Vitamin C in Patients with Intermediate or High Risk 
Myelodysplastic Syndrome with TET2  Mutations  
 
I. Background:  
 
A. Significance:  Myelodysplastic  syndromes  (MDS)  comprise a heterogeneous group of 
clonal stem cell disorders with an intrinsic tendency for transformation into acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) . The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for 
hematologic  neoplasms defines MDS as one of five major categories of malignant myeloid 
hematopoiet ic disorders [18], and includes refractory cytopenias with unilineage or multi -
lineage dysplasia and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts or excess blasts.  
Consequently, MDS is diagnosed based on peripheral blood cytopenia, peripheral blood and 
bone marrow (BM) dysplasia/blasts, and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. With an  incidence  
of 5 cases /100,000 individuals  in the United  States,  there are ~ 13,000 new cases of MDS  
per year [19]. The incidence of MDS  increases  significantly in individuals above age 60, 
with 30 -50 cases/100,000 per year in this population. In addition to age, risk factors include 
a history of exposure to chemotherapy or radiation and, to a lesser extent, tobacco use or 
occupational exposure to solvents or agricultural chemicals [20] . Up to 30% of high- risk MDS 
transforms into AML. Cytogenetic abnormalities are found at diagnosis in 20- 70% of MDS 
patients, with the highest frequency occurring in patients with the refractory  anemia with 
excessive blasts (RAEB) variant  [21]. Survival of MDS patients depends on their  R-IPSS  
(revised international  prognostic  scoring system) risk group classification. Low -risk patients  
have a  median survival  of 5.[ADDRESS_393120] a median  
survival  ranging  from 1.2-3.5 years  for high intermediate  or low intermediate  risk, 
respectively  [22]. For patients  in the high- risk group, median survival is only 5 months. 
Clearly , new treatments are needed  to improve survival for MDS patients, especially those 
at intermediate and high risk.  This need is made even more urgent by [CONTACT_319259], as disease burden will likely increase substantially in the next few decades 
owing to our aging population.   
 
MDS is part of the large spectrum of myeloid malignancies, which include AML and 
myeloproliferative neoplasms  (MPNs)  [23]. In the past, it was felt that these diseases were 
distinct biological entitie s, but we now know that they share significant genetic overlap. Over 
50 recurrently mutated genes are involved in MDS pathogenesis, including those that 
encode proteins involved in pre -mRNA splicing, epi[INVESTIGATOR_218415], and transcription. 
More recently,  exome sequencing of peripheral blood samples from over 30,000 patients 
without known hematologic malignancies demonstrated recurrent somatic myeloid 
malignancy -associated mutations in up to 10% of patients over the age of 65 and in more 
than 20% of patients over the age of 90 [24, 25] . This phenomenon is now termed clonal 
hematopoiesis of indeterminate pot ential (CHIP) [26]. The most common recurrently mutated 
genes in MDS patients are DNA methyltransferase 3A ( DNM T3A), TET2 , additional sex 
combs -like 1 ( ASXL1 ), TP53  (which encodes p53), Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) and SF3B1  [27]. 
Most of the initial mutations in MDS lead to increased HSC self -renewal, clonal expansion, 
and development of CHIP. As the mutant clone expands, it develops additional genetic or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_319228]. These 
secondary, sub- clonal events tend to cause dysplasia, leading to MDS and eventually, 
secondary AML. Therefore, there are considerable similarities between MDS and AML.

(comprising TET1-3 ) of α -ketoglutarate - and Fe2+ -dependent dioxygenases ( αKGDDs). The

substrates and Fe+2/Fe+3/Fe+4 shuttling for catalysis. TET proteins catalyze the sequential 
oxidation of 5- methyl cytosines (5mC) in DNA [28, 29]  to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5hmC), 
5-formylcytosine (5- fC) and 5- carboxylcytosine (5caC), respectively. These modified 
nucleotides are key intermediates in DNA demethylation, which can occur actively, via base-
excision repair (BER), or passively, following replication [30]. Either way, TET deficiency 
results in impaired 5mC oxidation and DNA hypermethylation [31]. Alterations in multiple 
genes that share the property of regulating DNA methylation [32]  are caus ally associated 
with MDS pathogenesis. Accordingly, hematopoietic cells from MDS patients have globally 
altered methylation profiles [33], and DNA demethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine) 
are the current mainstay of MDS therapy. Loss -of-function mutations  in TET2 are among the 
most frequent, occurring in ~ 30% of MDS patients [34] . Similar TET2 mutations are found 
in other myeloid neoplasms, including ~50% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 
and ~10% of sporadic acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TET2  mutations are also seen at a 
high allele frequency in CD34- positive hematopoietic stem cells of patients with other 
myeloid malignancies [31, 35], as well as other hematopoietic neoplasms [33] , suggesting 
that such mutations are early drivers of transformation in cells with multi -lineage potential. 
Frameshift, nonsense, or missense alternations in TET2  are reported in MDS patients [31] 
and have the same effect on methylation [36]. As noted above, TET2  mutations are also 
seen in the white blood cells (WBCs) of otherwise healthy adults with CHIP [37]. Hence, 
TET2 mutations are associated with pre -leukemic lesions that can enable disease 
progression by [CONTACT_72628][INVESTIGATOR_319229]/or by [CONTACT_319261] -renewing st em cells. Therefore, restoring 
TET2 function could provide therapeutic  benefit to patients with CHIP or MDS.   
 
C.Vitamin C and TETs:  Vitamin C (ascorbic acid/ascorbate) is an essential co- factor for 
TET family demethylases, as well as for most αKGDDs  [38]. It interacts directly with the C -
terminal catalytic domain (CD domain)  of TET proteins  [39], acting to reduce Fe+4 generated 
during the reaction cycle back to Fe+2. Intriguingly, previous studies suggested that high-
dose Vitamin C, acting via TET family members and possibly Jumonji -type histone 
demethylases, could dramatically enhance the function of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [40]  
and the generation of induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs). The use of Vitamin C in cancer has a sullied history, dating to claims by [CONTACT_319262], based largely on single arm 
studies or post -hoc analyses, that high dose Vitamin C has global anti -neoplastic and 
immune- stimulatory effects  [41, 42]. Subsequently, controlled clinical trials of high dose oral  
Vitamin C showed no anti -cancer efficacy  [5, 6]. However, oral administration of Vitamin C 
at up to 10 grams/day does not produce the millimolar blood levels seen after parenteral 
administration, and recently, there has been renewed attention to the possible anti -
neoplastic effects of high dose, intravenous (IV) Vitamin C  [9, 43]. 
 
D. Summary and Potential Impact:  Finding a treatment with high efficacy and a lower 
toxicity profile than hypomethylating agents is essential for improving the treatment of MDS patients. Recently, our group found that genetic restoration of Tet2 is sufficient to bloc k 
aberrant self -renewal of pre- leukemic stem/progenitor cells and reverse Tet2-deficient 
disease in mouse models. We also found that, by [CONTACT_319263]2 and TET3, high dose Vitamin C can act as a “pharmacologic mimic” of Tet2 restor ation, 
reversing the cellular and molecular features of TET2 deficiency in mouse and human models [1]. Our proposed clinical trial of continuous infusion Vitamin C could lead to a new 
therapeutic strategy for MDS patients with TET2  mutations, who represent ~30% of MDS 
patients overall. Our pre -clinical data also suggest salutary effects of Vitamin C on CMML 
and AML, and potential synergy with PARP inhibitors. Hence, our approach could have even 
broader impact in the future.

II. Vitamin C and its Utility as a Hypomethylating  Agent : 
 
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid/Ascorbate) first was used in the treatment of scurvy. Most animals  
have  an ability to synthesize ascorbic acid (AA); however, humans depend upon dietary 
AA intake  due to an inherited mutation in the gene that encodes L- gulonolactone oxidase 
(GULO ), a key enzyme in AA biosynthesis [8]. DNA demethylation can be initiated by [CONTACT_319264]  5- methylcytosine (5mC) and the formation of 5- hydroxymethylcytosine 
(5hmC), which are catalyzed  by [CONTACT_941] e nzymatic activity of the TET1 -3 family of 
dioxygenases. 5hmC is oxidized by [CONTACT_319265] 5- formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-
carboxylcytosine (5caC) [9]. AA is a cofactor of  TET mediated oxidation of 5mC and 
accordingly has the capacity to regulate DNA  methylation  processes at the cellular  level.  
 Studies demonstrate that AA directly interacts with the C -terminal catalytic domain (CD 
domain)
 of TET proteins  [9]. AA significantly  increases  the level of all 5mC  oxidation 
products  (5fC and 5caC) leading to global loss of 5mC. The catalytic activity of TET 
dioxygenases for 5mC oxidation requires 2  cofactors:  Iron  (Fe2+)  and  2- oxoglutarate.  
AA enhances hydroxylase activity  by [CONTACT_319266] (Fe3+) to Fe2+ required for 
the activity for dioxygenases including prolyl - 4-hydroxylase.  This strongly  supports  that 
Fe2+ and 2- oxoglutarate  acts as a co- factor  and co- substrate respectively to initiate the 
conversion of 5mC to 5hmC [10]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_319230]  5mC  is largely erased by [CONTACT_319267] [11], a critical step for  multiple biological 
processes like animal cloning, nuclear re- programing, development and highly  locus -
specific regulation of gene activities. AA  also has been identified as the KSR component  
responsible for Dazl induction that occurs  with the DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) inhibitor  
5-Azacytidine,  suggesting  that  AA   promotes DNA demethylation [12]. Finally, TET1 CD 
domain significantly represses the expression of  Cdh1  and Epcam only in the presence of 
AA suggesting that MET (mesenchymal -to-epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]) might  be a crucial step in controlling 
TET activity in the presence of AA [13]. Also as part of our  preclinical  laboratory  work  it 
was already  shown in 2 different  TET2 knock  in mutated  mice  with myeloid  diseases  
that were  created  to be more  sensitive  to vitamin  C treatment  than the wild type (WT)  
mice.  Accordingly AA can be utilized as a possible treatment for MDS patients with TET2  
mutations  instead  of the current  available hypomethylating agents  and the biggest  
advantage of AA would  be a much better toxicity  profile.  
 
Most MDS patients will have been treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), the current standard of care, prior to trial entry. We will enroll patients on our trial if they have previously received HMAs, as long as the last dose was given at least 4 weeks  before enrollment. No 
patient will be allowed to receive HMAs while on this study. In the open- label Phase 2 portion 
of the trial, two co -primary endpoints will be evaluated: the pharmacodynamic endpoint of 
demethylation and overall response rate. HMAs inhibit DNMTs to promote passive DNA 
demethylation and should not affect demethylation promoted by [CONTACT_297766] C through its active 
conversion of 5- methylcytosine (5mC) to 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by [CONTACT_319268]. 
Furthermore, earlier studies have shown that patients who fail one hypomethylating agent 
can still respond to other hypomethylating agents as second line therapy. For example, in 
one study patients who failed or had loss of response to azacitidine had a 28% overall 
response rate to decitabine in the second line, and each HMA had different effects on global 
methylation [44]. Accordingly, we expect to achieve similar or even greater response 
frequencies in our MDS patient population, given the difference in expected demethylation 
mechanism between HMAs and Vitamin C. The design of our study to give Vitamin C for 5 
consecutive days every 28- days is similar to how HMAs are given (decitabine is used for 5 
 
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 13 
Version: 3 .0 
 consecutive days and azacitidine for 7 consecutive days in every 28- day cycle). As effects 
on DNA methylation, and presumably, their biological consequences, can last for weeks, we 
will start with Vitamin C CIVI for [ADDRESS_393121] 
between cycles. Oral Vitamin C (1 gram daily) will start after the completion of Vitamin C 5 
days CIVI and continue until the beginning of the next cycle (from day 6 until day 28 of the 
28-day cycle).  
 
III. Preclinical Data:  
 
Hematopoietic stem/progenitors from mice with TET2 deficiency exhibit increased self -
renewal capacity, as manifested by [CONTACT_319269]- plating ( in vitro ) and a substantial 
advantage and myeloid bias in competitive bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) assays (Figure 1)  [1].  
 
 
 
Several groups have developed mouse models of TET2 deficiency, either by [CONTACT_319270]2 knockout mice [45]  or by [CONTACT_319271]2  shRNA  [46]. Tet2 reversible 
knockdown mice were generated by [CONTACT_27156]; these mice express a doxycycline (Dox) -
regulated, Tet2-specific miR30 -based shRNA ( shTet2 ) with linked green fluorescence 
protein (GFP) from the  Col1a1 locus  (Figure 2) [1] .  
 
Tet2- knockdown mice manifest progressive defects in hematopoiesis, characterized by 
[CONTACT_319272], and a substantial fraction develop CMML- like disease, 
characterized by [CONTACT_319273], mainly monocytes and splenomegaly (Figure 3) [1] .

Remarkably, by [CONTACT_319275]2 expression on and off using our reversible shRNA system, we 
found that Tet2 -deficient phenotypes (including CMML- like disease and even Tet2- mutant 
AML) and its biochemical effects (altered methylation) could be reversed by [CONTACT_319276]2 
expression ( Figure 4) [1] . For example, as shown in Figures 4A- G, TET2 restoration 
promotes DNA demethylation, differentiation and the death of cKit+ cells, respectively [1] .  
 
 
 These studies confirm the causal role of TET2 mutations in myeloid neoplasia and, more 
importantly, show that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_319231], and pathogenic consequences of, 
decreased TET2 levels are potentially reversible.  Consistent with this notion, although only 
a minority of
 MDS patients respond to hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), 
TET2 -mutant patients (especially those lacking additional  ASXL1  mutations) respond better 
to hypomethylating agents  [47]. Unfortunately, even in this sub- group, the effects are not 
durabl e, and ultimately, disease progression ensues. Nearly all TET2  mutations in patients 
with MDS or other hematologic neoplasms are heterozygous, leaving one normal copy of 
TET2, as well as a full complement of the other TET2 family members, TET1 and TET3. Th e 
pathogenic impact of TET2 haploinsufficiency indicates that even small decreases in TET2 
activity cause disease; conversely, the reversibility of myeloid neoplasia in Tet2-knockdown (Tet2-KD) mice argues that small increases in activity might be therapeutic.  Capi[INVESTIGATOR_319232]2, our group found that high- dose Vitamin C 
could activate the remaining TET2 protein, as well as TET3 (Figure 5A -5D), block aberrant

Furthermore, although  MDS patient -derived xenografts (PDXs) were not available, similar 
effects of high -dose Vitamin C were seen in human AML cultures (data not shown, but see 
Ref. [1]) and PDXs (Figure 6).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ability of Vitamin C to block self -renewal and myeloid disease progression in mice 
motivated us to explore its effects on TET function and 5hmC generation in the HL60 and MOLM13 cell lines, representative of acute myeloblastic and acute monocytic leuke mia, 
respectively. Consistent with our observations using mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), Vitamin C treatment for 72 hours (hr) caused increased 5hmC 
formation in both lines (Figure 7A) without altering TET1- 3 expression (Figure 7B).  We 
performed 5hmC DNA immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_332] (5hmeDIP) with genomic DNA from untreated 
HL60 cells (0  hr) and cells treated for 72  hr with Vitamin  C. Nearly all differentially

 hydroxymethylated peaks (29,492; 97%) exhibited gain of 5hmC upon Vitamin C treatment 
(Figure 7C). Increased 5hmC was enriched within gene bodies, compared with transcription 
start sites (TSS) or transcription end sites (TES) (Figure 7D)  [1]. 
  
 
 
 
 Our results comport with other published work. In a study published virtually simultaneously 
with ours, Vitamin C deficiency was found to phenocopy the effects of Tet2 deficiency in 
promoting increased self -renewal and myeloid bias of HSPCs, as well as to cooperate with 
leukemogenic fusion proteins to generate AML in mice [48]. These data support the 
hypothesis that high- dose Vitamin C might have therapeutic efficacy in TET2- mutant human 
MDS. Our exciting pre- clinical data provide the foundation for the clinical trial and correlative 
studies proposed herein . Restorin g normal TET function in TET2- mutant MDS patients might 
be more specific than using global hypomethylating agents, and thereby [CONTACT_319281].  
 
IV. Objectives of the Study : 
 
This is a phase Ib  study to help us test the utility of Vitamin C as a treatment for patients  
with MDS.  Many  genes  involved in pathways  like Ras signaling,  the p53 network  and 
apoptosis  are transcriptionally inactivated by [CONTACT_319282],  making  DNA  methylation an effective  therapy  to target  in MDS  patients  
[14]. Multiple  molecular  subtypes  of myeloid  disease have been found  to exhibit  highly  
distinct DNA  methylation profiles  [15] and hypomethylating agents like decitabine and 5-
Azacytidine have been used in the treatment  of MDS  patients,  especially  in elderly  
patients  who are unable  to tolerate  intensive  chemotherapy induction [16]. 
 
MDS patients with TET2 mutations will be enrolled in this study with the following  objectives:

V: Dosing and Patient  Selection:  
Patients will receive up to [ADDRESS_393123] any 
of the following revised international  prognostic  scoring system (R -IPSS) risk scores: 
intermediate score (>3 and ≤ 4.5), high score (>4.5 and ≤6) or very high score (>6). MDS 
patients with very low score ≤1.5 or low score (>1.5 and ≤ 3) will be excluded, as they do 
not require treatment and have a better prognosis than patients with higher R -IPSS score. 
R-IPSS score will be calculated based on Table 2 specifics.  
 We propose a Phase 1 component with 3 dose- escalation cohorts in a 3+3 design to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Vitamin C, followed by a Phase 2 dose-expansion cohort. Vitamin C will be provided from McGuff based on a confidential 
agreement with them and McGuff provides the only FDA -approved injectable prepar ation 
of Vitamin C in the [LOCATION_003]. Such a trial using Vitamin C in MDS patients could lay the 
foundation for utilizing ascorbic acid as an anticancer agent and improve outcomes in this 
challenging group of patients.

VI.  Safety  Objectives:  
Research Risks and Benefits 
Risks associated to study participation include breach of confidentiality and risks associated 
with blood draw. Privacy procedures in place and good clinical practice guidelines are 
followed in the study to minimize risks associated with research procedures and 
participation. The risks associated with blood draw include weaknesses, redness, pain, 
bruisin g, bleeding or infection at the needle site. There may be no direct potential benefits 
to subjects participating in the sturdy, but the information obtained from this research may help others with this disease in the future.  Intravenous  vitamin  C in high doses  has been  
studied earlier  with no major  adverse events
 reported. However regardless we will be 
monitoring for any adverse event as  follows.  
1. Adverse Events  
All adverse events (AEs) recorded during the study will be coded by [CONTACT_61132] (Medical  
Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities). AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9084], overall, primary 
system organ class,  preferred  terms  and severity  based on CTCAE  version 5 .0. 
Relationship to Vitamin  C, AEs leading to discontinuation of study  drug and SAEs  will 
be summarized.  No infusion -related  AEs are expected;  however  if any do occur then 
they will be summarized by [CONTACT_315297].  A list of AEs related to skin 
toxicity  using  pre-defined  MedDRA  preferred  terms  will be used to identify any AEs of 
special interest. All AEs will be  listed.  
 
2. Laboratory  Abnormalities  
Laboratory  values  will be converted  into international  system of units  (SI) units,  severity  
grades  will be calculated using CTCAE version 4.0. For those parameters where there is 
no CTCAE  grading then a defined classification into lower  limit, normal  and higher  limit 
will be used.  Shift tables for change from baseline will be presented as well as descriptive 
statistics mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  and range  for absolute values  by [CONTACT_319283]. All lab values, abnormalities will be listed. 
The safety set will be  used.  
 
3. Vital Signs and Physical  examination  
Vital signs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477],  standard deviation,  median and range for 
absolute  values by [CONTACT_82078]. The number of abnormal vital signs 
will be  summarized  by [CONTACT_765]. All values will be listed. The safety set will be  used.  
 
Physical examination should include assessments of the following body parts/systems:  
heart,  lungs, abdomen, extremities and a neurological exam.  
 
4. Other Safety  Parameters  
All other  safety  parameters  such as ECG  will be listed  for the safety  set. Twelve -
lead ECG  measurements will be conducted in triplicate at protocol specified time point 
(see Table 3)  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_319234]. Additional 
ECG  measurements  should be performed as clinically indicated. Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_319235]’s designee for central  assessment.

6. Clinical Laboratory  Tests  
The following laboratory assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_319284] (See Table 3 ) during the course of the study:  
 
• Weekly  CBC with differential  count  to include the following  tests:  white  blood cell 
count  with five part differential  (neutrophils,  lymphocytes,  monocytes,  
eosinophils,  and basophils),  platelet  count,  hemoglobin and hematocrit.  Also,  
CBC to include peripheral  myeloblast count (if  present).  
• Weekly  chemistry panel to include the following  tests:  sodium,  potassium,  
bicarbonate,  chloride, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, 
alkaline  phosphatase,  ALT, AST, blood urea, nitrogen, calcium creatinine, LDH, 
phosphorus, total bilirubin,  and uric acid 
• Weekly  urinalysis  with microscopy  to assess for hematuria since vitamin  C may 
cause  oxalate nephropathy.  
• Weekly serum anion gap as vitamin C can be associated with elevated anion gap 
acidosis.  If anion gap is elevated (>11mEq/L)  then we will hold the study  drug 
for one week  and recheck  anion gap. If still elevated (>11mEq/L), we will 
withdraw  the patient  from the study, If not elevated (≤11mEq/L) we will resume 
vitamin C treatment.  
• A serum or urine β -HCG pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential to 
be done within one week of starting the trial and before starting a new cycle.  
• Creatinine clearance -the same method of assessment should be used at each 
time point.  
• PT/PTT/INR  
 
7. ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG performance status will be evaluated at protocol specific time points (See Table  3) 
 
 
VII. Subject Identification, Recruitment and Consent  
A. Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Patients  will be recruited from physicians  at the NYU Langone’s  Ambulatory  Care  Center  
(ACC)  in [LOCATION_001],  [LOCATION_003], and at University of Miami, Health System.  Consenting,  
screening,  and treatment  will take place at the NYU ACC or at University of Miami, 
Health System under the supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]- Investigators. Prospective subjects 
will receive  detailed  information about this study: its investigational nature, required study 
procedures,  alternative  treatments,  risks and potential  benefits  of the study.  They  will 
also receive the informed  consent  document  to read. All questions are answered by [CONTACT_1600], Co investigators and qualified research  personnel.  
The patients  wh o are eligible for this research  study will come directly  from the study  
investigators’ clinical patient population. Thus, the investigators are very familiar with their 
patients’ disease status and potential eligibility given the protocol’s inclusion and exclusion  
  
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 20 
Version: [ADDRESS_393125]  on the enrollment  of these  populations.  Target  enrollment  for 
this study  is up to 12 patients .  The target accrual goal is 6 patients  per year.  Patients 
will be recruited from the outpatient clinics in the NYU ambulatory cancer center as  well 
as University of Miami Cancer Center for any patients undergoing workup or treatment  for 
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). 
The investigator will approach eligible potential subjects and explain the study in a private  
room,  including the reasons why subjects will be eligible, risks, benefits, and the regimes 
to be evaluated.  It is NYULMC  policy  that Nurses  and Fellows  cannot  obtain consent  
to greater  than minimal risk trials,  unless  Fellows  are listed  as co-investigators.  Consent  
will be obtained in a private room  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Co-investigator  at the time of the 
subject’s  visit prior to any study  assessments/procedures.  
 
The subjects will be given a chance to ask questions to the person consenting him/her 
and will  be able to take the consent  home  to discuss it with family/friends  prior to 
signing.  If the subject  agrees  s/he will sign the consent  form either  at the first contact  
(if the investigator/delegate is convinced that the subject  understands)  or at the time of 
a return  visit after having had time to study the consent in more depth. Study procedures 
will not begin until after the consent form has been properly  obtained.  The subject  is 
entitled to decide not to participate  in the trial, without  affecting their right to other 
medical care, and may discontinue participation in the trial at any  time without penalty or 
loss of benefits to which they are entitled.  
 
For non-English  speaking  patients,  institutional  translation services  will be utilized.  All 
procedures for consenting non- English speaking patients will be in accordance with 
NYULMC PCC CTO guidelines and policy.   
 
For pat
ients  who cannot  read a witness,  not related  to the research study  will be 
present.  The consent will be read to the patient. The patient will also be allowed to ask 
any questions s/he  may have. The investigator will ask the patient questions to ensure 
s/he understands the study. If  the investigator  determines  the subject  understands  the 
study,  the patient  will mark  an X where  his/her name [CONTACT_319305].  
  
 
B. Documentation of  Consent  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_319236]- investigator will be responsible for  
documentation  in the medical  record that consent  has been obtained from all participants.  
A signed copy  of the consent  form will be given  to each participant.  Original consent  
forms  will be stored in the subject’s medical  chart.

minutes  from monthly  PI [INVESTIGATOR_28666].  Each  participating  site will be responsible for 
submitting the results  and recommendations  from the DSMC’s yearly review to their IRB 
of record at the time of continuing review.  
 
 
D. Patient Informed Consent at Additional  Sites  
 
The Principal Investigator (PI) at each participating site will identify the physician members 
of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for 
therapeutic  protocols.  
 
The Investigator must ensure that each participant, or his/her legally acceptable representative,  is
 fully informed about  the nature and objectives  of the study  and 
possible risks associated with participation. All participants must be provided a consent 
form describing this study and providing  sufficient information for participants to make an 
informed decision about their participation in this study. The formal consent of a 
participant, using the IRB approved consent form, must  be obtained before the participant 
is involved in any study -related procedure. The consent form must  be signed and dated  
by [CONTACT_116537]’s  legally  authorized representative  (if applicable), 
and by [CONTACT_98902]. The participant must be given a copy of  the 
signed and dated consent document. The original signed copy of the consent document 
must  be retained in the medical record or research file. 
 
All parties  will ensure protection of participant  personal  data and will not include  
participant  names  on any sponsor  forms,  reports,  publications,  or in any other  
disclosures,  except  where  required by [CONTACT_28769]. In case of data transfer, NYULMC Perlmutter 
Cancer Center (PCC)  will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of 
participant personal  data.  
 
The informed consent form must be in compliance with ICH/GCP, local regulatory  
requirements,  and legal  requirements.  The informed consent  form used  in this study,

Version: [ADDRESS_393130] to a standardized data and  
safety  monitoring  plan,  which  includes  scientific  peer review  and IRB review  for 
therapeutic  protocols.  This investigator -initiated  study  will be monitored by [CONTACT_319286]  (DSMC) of the [LOCATION_001] University (NYU) Perlmutter 
Cancer Center (PCC). The DSMC  operates  based on the National Cancer Institute  
approved Charter. It  is an existing  and multidisciplinary  committee (consisting of clinical  
investigators/oncologists,  biostatisticians,  nurses, and research administration staff 
knowledgeable of research methodology and design  and in proper  conduct  of clinical 
trials)  that is responsible for monitoring  safety,  conduct  and compliance in accordance  
with protocol  data monitoring plans  for clinical trials  conducted  in the NYULMC 
Perlmutter Cancer Center that are not monitored by [CONTACT_28827].  The 
DSMC reports to the Director of the NYULMC  PCC.  
 
Per the NYU PCC Institutional Data Safety and Monitoring Plan, this phase Ib trial will  be 
monitored  by [CONTACT_319287]  (from  the date the first patient  is enrolled),  after the first [ADDRESS_393131] for this trial occurs at several 
levels:  
(1) Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_319241], data manager and research 
team.  
 
(2) DSMC, quarterly  
 
(3) Institutional Review Board (IRB): An annual report to the IRB is submitted by 
[CONTACT_28831] [INVESTIGATOR_319242]. It includes a summary of all AEs, total 
enrollment  with 
demographics, protocol violations, and current status of subjects as well as  
available  research data.  
 
(4) In addition, the quality assurance unit will monitor this trial extensively, 
including real -time review of all eCRFs to ensure completeness and compliance 
with the protocol, accuracy and consistency of the data;  and adherence to ICH 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines.  Also, a first  subject audit will be conducted 
within four weeks of enrollment.  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection  by 
[CONTACT_319288]. The investigator will contact [CONTACT_319289] 
a regulatory  agency about an inspection at the center.

A. Safety monitoring and reporting 
 
- Adverse Events  
All adverse events (AEs) per the description below will be captured in the Adverse Event  
Form.  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or  Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following  criteria: 
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB- approved protocol or consent form, the investigators  
brochure,  etc.) 
• Related or possibly  related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly  related  
means  there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or  outcome 
may have been  caused by [CONTACT_319290])  
• Suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at greater  risk of harm  
(including  physical, psychological, economic, or social  harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse  event  (AE) is any symptom, sign,  illness  or experience that develops  or 
worsens  in severity  during the course of the study.  Intercurrent  illnesses  or injuries  
should be regarded  as adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events  if the  abnormality:  
• results in study  withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic  tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_319291]-serious.  A serious  adverse event  is 
any AE that is: 
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly  of major  clinical significance.  They  may jeopardize the subject,  and may require  
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug 
overdose or abuse,  a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319243].  
 
All adverse events  that do not meet  any of the criteria  for serious  should be regarded  
as non-  serious adverse events . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the  
  
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 26 
Version: [ADDRESS_393132] administration  of study  treatment.  
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition  is one that is present  at the start of the study.  A preexisting  
condition  should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of  the condition worsens during the study  period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.
 At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the  definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an 
adverse event.  
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_91158], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At 
the last sche duled  visit, the investigator  should instruct  each subject  to report  any 
subsequent  event(s)  that the subject,  or the subject’s  personal  physician,  believes  
might  reasonably  be related to participation  in this study.  The investigator  should  notify  
the study  sponsor  of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject 
has discontinued or terminated study  participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study. The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware o f the 
development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly  in a subsequently conceived offspring 
of a subject that has participated in this  study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory  Values  
A clinical laboratory  abnormality  should be documented  as an adverse event  if any one 
of the following conditions is  met: 
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm  the 
abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ  toxicity  
• The abnormality  is of a degree  that requires  active  management;  e.g. change  
of dose,  discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further  
diagnostic  investigation,  etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319244] a serious  adverse event  unless  specifically  instructed  
otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented 
as an adverse event  if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse  event.  
 
Neither  the condition,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  nor surgery  are reported  
as an adverse event in the following  circumstances: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319245] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse  event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319246] m easurement 
for the study.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319247]: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 27 
Version: [ADDRESS_393133]  seek  information  on adverse 
events  by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all 
adverse events  should be recorded  immediately  in the source document,  and also in 
the appropriate  adverse  event  module of the case  report  form (CRF).  All clearly  related  
signs,  symptoms,  and abnormal  diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the 
source document, though should be  grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events  occurring  during  the study  period  must  be recorded.  The clinical 
course of each  event  should be followed until resolution,  stabilization,  or until it has been  
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse 
events that are still  ongoing  at the end of the study  period must  be followed up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious  adverse event  that occurs after the study  period  
and is considered  to be possibly  related to the study treatment or study participation 
should be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
 
2. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated  Problems  
 
Investigators and the protocol sponsor must conform to the adverse event reporting 
timelines,  formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible, 
but at a minimum  those events that must be reported are those that  are: 
 
• related to study  participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or  
others  (see definitions, Section 8.1). 
 
Serious  adverse event  reporting will begin in conjunction with the date of informed  
consent.  Any SAEs  occurring  prior to study  drug administration  that the investigator  
believes  may have been  caused by a protocol procedure must be reported immediately 
to the Sponsor or its designee  and recorded on the case report  form.  
 
A
ll fatal or life -threatening adverse events must be immediately reported to the Sponsor  
by [CONTACT_16062] e -mail. Within 24 hours of the event, the Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Form  supplied  by [CONTACT_319292],  who must  then inform  the 
NYULMC IRB, PCC CTO, and DSMC within [ADDRESS_393134]  to the 
event  should  be included with the SAE form.  Care  should be taken  to ensure that the 
patient’s  identity  is protected  and the patient’s  identifiers  (as assigned at the time of study 
enrollment) are properly mentioned on any copy of source  document provided to the 
Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal  ranges.

Other Reportable  events:  
 
• Deviations from the study  protocol  
Deviations from the protocol must receive both Sponsor and the investigator’s  IRB 
approval before they are initiated. Any protocol deviations initiated without Sponsor  and 
the investigator’s  IRB approval  that may affect  the scientific  soundness  of the study, or 
In case of accidental or intentional overdose of study drug, even if asymptomatic or not 
fulfilling  a seriousness criterion, the overdose is to be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(within 1 working  day) using the AE and SAE forms supplied by [CONTACT_28814]. Overdose of 
study drug will be defined  as at least 2 times the intended dose of study drug within the 
intended therapeutic  window.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_319293],  the Sponsor  will report  the adverse event  to all regulatory  authorities  with 
jurisdiction over ongoing trials with the study drug and to all other investigators involved in  clinical  
trials with  the study drug. The investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate  
IRB, DSMC, and FDA. For Narrative Reports of Safety  Events  
 
If the report  is supplied as a narrative,  the minimum  necessary  information to be provided at the 
time of  the initial report  includes:  
 
• Study  identifier  
• Study  Center  
• Subject  number  
• A description of the  event  
• Date of onset  • Current  status  
• Whether study treatment was  discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the  association  
between the event and study  treatment  
 
 
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE that occurs after [ADDRESS_393135] dose  of 
study  treatment,  only those SAEs  or other  AEs of concern deemed by [CONTACT_319294].  The investigator  should make every  
effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a treatment -related SAE until the event  is 
considered chronic and/or  stable.  
 
Additionally, an FDA Form 3500A (MEDWATCH Form) must be completed by [CONTACT_319295]  24 hours.  The investigator  shall maintain  a copy  of the 
MEDWATCH Form on file at the study site or can be obtained from the FDA  website:

3. Investigator reporting: notifying the  IRB 
 
Federal  regulations  require timely  reporting by [CONTACT_319296].  The IRB requirements  reflect  the current  guidance  
documents  released by [CONTACT_319297] (OHRP),  and the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and are respectively entitled “Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Eve nts” and “Guidance  
for Clinical Investigators,  Sponsors,  and IRBs: Adverse Event  Reporting- Improving  Human 
Subject Protection.” The following describes the NYUL H IRB reporting  requirements,  though 
Investigators at participating sites are responsible for meeting the specific requirements  of their IRB 
of record.  
The NYU IRB address  is: 
 
NYUL H IRB 
[ADDRESS_393137], 6th Floor  
[LOCATION_001], NY  [ZIP_CODE]  
 
Report promptly , but no later than 5 working  days:  
Researchers are required to submit reports of the following problems promptly but no later than 5  
working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events that are unexpected and related  
– Unexpected: An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are  not 
accurately reflected in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB-approved  
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current  IRB-approved  
informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as product 
labeling and package inserts.  
– Related to the research procedures : An event is related to the research procedures  if 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely  than 
not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
– Harmful : either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased  risk 
 
Other Reportable  events:  
The following  events  also require prompt  reporting to the IRB, though no later  than  5 working  
days: 
• Complaint of a research  subject  when  the complaint  indicates  unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or violations (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional  
deviations from the IRB approved protocol) for any of the following situations:  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of  harm  
– the event has the potential to occur  again  
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
  
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 22 
Version: 3 .0 
 • Breach of  confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under  
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on 
the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits of  the research,  
in terms  of severity  or frequency.  (e.g. analysis  indicates  lower -than- expected  response 
rate or a more severe or frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of  study  has no 
therapeutic value; FDA labeling change or withdrawal from  market)  
 
Reporting Process  
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the form: “Reportable Event  
Form ” or as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information  
regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow -up/resolution and need for revision to  consent  
form and/or other study  documentation).  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_319248]’s study  file. 
 
 
4. Sponsor reporting: Notifying the  FDA 
 
The study sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the  FDA.  
These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The following  
describes the safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_319298]:  
 
• Within 7 calendar days (via telephone or facsimile  report)  
Any study event that  is: 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or  life-threatening  
 
• With in 15 calendar days (via written  report)  
Any study event that  is: 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected,  and 
– serious, but not fatal or  life-threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to 
fit the criteria  for reporting  (reporting within  15 calendar  days  from when event  was 
deemed reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals  that: 
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of  mutagenicity,  
teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning similar  
adverse events  and to analyze  the significance of the current  event  in light of the previous  
reports.  
 
Reporting Process  
Adverse  events  may be submitted on FDA Form  3500A  (MEDWATCH  Form,  obtained  from the 
FDA website: http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/downloadforms/default.htm ), or in 
a narrative format. If supplied as in a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied   is 
  
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol

Version: [ADDRESS_393138]  information for submitting  IND safety  
reports is noted  below:  
 
Email:  
[EMAIL_2366]   
Tel: [PHONE_418]  
 
 
5. Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating  investigators  
 
It is the responsibility  of the study  sponsor  to notify  all participating investigators  of any adverse  
event that meets the FDA 15- day reporting requirement criteria as note above.  The same  materials 
and timeline used to report to the FDA are used for notifying part icipating  investigators.  
 
 
B. Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_319249].  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of  adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a 
site data and safety -monitoring plan.  The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will 
review the study at least annually.  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the 
number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
When necessary (due to logistical constraints), Sub -sites will be monitored remotely by a 
designated Quality Assurance Specialist.  Sites will be informed of this remote monitoring process on a s ite by [CONTACT_141832].  Sub- sites will be monitored by [CONTACT_319299] a regulatory level, as well as a clinical data/source documentation review level.  
 
C. Data Collection and  Storage.  
 
- Data Labeling.  
 
Once  a subject  is enrolled on this trial s/he will be assigned  a unique study  ID number.  
We will code the data collected from the patients with this unique study ID.  Samples will 
be labeled with a unique ID number and disease type. The link between the patients and 
the numbers will only  be kept with [CONTACT_319308], the Principal Investigator. The reason 
for such a link is to identify  specific  data and samples  to discard  if a patient  decided to 
withdraw  from the study.  Numbers  will be assigned randomly to maintain confidentiality.  
 
- Data Storage and  Access 
 
This study will store data in an electronic database capture system that will be created to 
record the data for this trial Research  coordinators  will input  clinical trial data into the 
database. This database is password protected and only the PI, assigned  research  
coordinator,  and CTO  quality  assurance specialists  will have access to the database.  
The electronic database capture system  is the primary  data collection  instrument  for the 
study.  All data required  for this study  must  be inputted into the system. All missing data 
must be explained. The quality assurance specialists will  monitor  this trial every 4 -6 weeks 
for data entry  accuracy. 
 
Information collected in the database includes patients’ information, which will constitute 
a medical records number, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, complete blood count and 
percentage  of blast.  
  
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 24 
Version: [ADDRESS_393139] protection courses. 
If applicable,  blood and tissue samples sent to collaborators outside of NYU will only be 
labeled with an identification number; no patient identifiers will be used. Systems used for 
electronic data capture  are compliant  with FDA regulations  in [ADDRESS_393140] the linking  keys. It is  
the investigator’s  responsibility  to retain  study  essential  documents  for at least  [ADDRESS_393141]”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  
If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed 
and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or 
uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
 
-Records Retention 
The CTOs Retention for records retention will be followed.  It is the investigator  was not 
asked, write alit Assurance Specialist”.   
 
-Subject Data  Withdrawal  Subjects can withdraw from the study at any time. Request for 
withdrawal should be in writing  to
 the PI, [CONTACT_319308]. Once a request is received, then 
the data collected from the subject will  be completely discarded. Any unused specimens 
will be destroyed as  well. 
 
 
Auditing and Inspecting 
 
The investigator  will permit  study -related  monitoring,  audits,  and inspections  by [CONTACT_5040], the sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and Institution compliance and quality 
assurance groups  of all study  related documents  (e.g. source  documents,  regulatory  
documents,  data collection  instruments, study data etc.). The investigator will ensure the 
capability for inspections  of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory,  etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by
 
[CONTACT_319288]. The investigator will contact [CONTACT_319289] 
a regulatory  agency about an inspection at the  center.  
 
Statistical  Evaluation:  
  
 
Study number: S17-[ZIP_CODE]   Clinical Research Protocol  
   Page 25 
Version: 3 .0 
 1. Statistical Methods  
This is a 2 center  study  with a Phase ib component.  This study  will enroll  up to 12 
patient s in Phase 1b and 34 patients in Phase IIa has been deferred for a later study . The 
patients enrolled in Phase Ib will  be evaluated for safety.  The proportion  of patients  with 
biological  responses  will be based  on the data collected from the phase 1b. There will 
be demographic and baseline characteristics documented,  biological  activity 
measurements, safety observations, efficacy observations, PK and potential  biomarker  
observations. The c linical database lock will occur after all the data are reconciled (I.E. 
“cleaned”)  for all patients.  A single  clinical study  report  will be generated  for this 
study.  The Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized and signed before the database  
lock. 
 
 
2. Sample Size and  Power  
 
Phase 1:  At each dose level, safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_319258]. The proportion of 
patients with each adverse experience will be reported, along with the proportion of patients 
who achieve a response. Responses will be defined as in the IWG (International Working 
Group) response criteria in myelodysplasi a as: complete remission (CR), partial remission 
(PR), or hematologic improvement (HI) after completion of cycle 4 [17]. Overall response 
rate (PR+ CR+ HI) will be provided for each dose level and across dose levels for the Phase 1 portion of the trial (with exact 95% confidence intervals).  
 
Once our phase 1 study is completed to establish safety and confirm we are achieving 
steady level of Vitamin C on ≥1 mM in > 75% of our patients we will aim to proceed with a 
Phase 2 study. The phase 2 study will be a separate clinical trial.  The co- primary endpoints 
of the Phase 2 study will be  the pharmacokinetics endpoint, achievement of a steady level 
of Vitamin C of ≥1 mM in 75% of patients expected to be associated with demethylation, and the overall response (PR, CR or HI) by [CONTACT_319300] [ADDRESS_393142] stage of the 2-stage Phase 2  portion of the study  (12 from 
our phase 1 study), we can estimate this feasibility rate with an exact 95% Clopper Pearson 
confidence interval of 49.4% to 92.0% if the observed rate is 75%. With the combined 24 
patients (6 from RP2D in Phase 1 and 18 from Phase 2), we can detect a difference from the null hypothesis of +/ -25% in the percentage of patients achieving Vitamin C levels of ≥1 
mM with alpha of 0.047 and power of greater than 80.4%. We expect to achieve higher pharmacodynamic effects on demethylation with higher Vitamin C doses. At the same time, 
the co- primary endpoint of response (CR+PR+HI) by [ADDRESS_393143] the null hypothesis that the rate  is ≤10%, 
versus the alternative that the rate is ≥30%, with alpha of 0.031 and power of 81.3%. The first stage will include the [ADDRESS_393144] 18 patients combined from phase 1 and 2 study, the trial would proceed to the full accrual of 
34 patients in the combined stages of the Simon design, and the Vitamin C regimen would 
be considered for further study if a total of 7 or more responses are observed in the total 
cohort. There will be no statistical adjustment for the simultaneous  testing of the two co -
primary endpoints. Because the expected response rate in this population is unknown, we 
define a response rate (CR + PR + HI) ≤10% as futile and ≥30% promising. Overall 
response rates (CR+PR+HI) will be summarized by [CONTACT_319301] [ADDRESS_393145]  95% confidence intervals.

by [CONTACT_253433]. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will be presented 
including: mean,  standard  deviation, median and range. For categorical variables 
frequency distributions with percentages  will be presented.  All patients  will have baseline  
measurements  and at the end of the study  we will compare patients  that completed the 
study  versus  those that only got partial  treatment  and didn’t complete the  study.  
 
 
5. Treatment, Compliance, Disposition and Protocol  Deviations  
As part of compliance  we will summarize  the actual  number  of weeks  of vitamin  C 
received per patient.  The reason for discontinuation of a study  treatment  including  study  
completion  as per protocol  will be presented.  Patients  with major  protocol  deviations  as 
defined by [CONTACT_319302]. The safety set will 
be used. All data will be listed.

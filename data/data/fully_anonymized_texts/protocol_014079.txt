 1 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
 
1.[ADDRESS_539793] been effective in reducing drinking 
(O’Donnell et al., 2013; Tanner -Smith &  Lipsey, 2015; Kohler & Hofmann, 2015;  Larimer 
& Cronce, 2007). These interventions are particularly useful for the large percentage 
(i.e. 87%) of problem drinkers who do not want longer -term, more intensive treatments 
(SAMHSA, 2012). However, the public h ealth impact of brief interventions has been 
severely impeded by [CONTACT_427138], such as limitations in time, training, 
and willingness among providers (e.g., Hilbink et al., 2012). Further, positive overall 
findings in meta -analyses obscure the  results of multiple rigorous efficacy trials showing 
no brief intervention effect on alcohol use (e.g., Maio et al, 2005). Both of these 
issues—the implementation challenges and the inconsistency in outcomes — 
suggest that changes are needed before brief a lcohol interventions can meet 
their full potential.  
Technology offers exciting potential in both respects. Computer -delivered brief 
interventions (CDBIs) have consistently yielded small but significant effects in meta - 
analyses (e.g., Donoghue et al., 2014 ; Rooke et al., 2010; Webb et al., 2010). Further, 
they can be presented inexpensively, with perfect fidelity, and without the need for 
training or provider time. Finally —and most relevant to the present study —their 
replicability, flexibility, and modulari ty makes them an ideal platform for isolating the 
active ingredients that are associated with positive outcomes. Leveraging this capability 
could lead to optimized and increasingly effective CDBIs. Notably, however, 
surprisingly little research has used th is approach to identify which elements of 
these multi -component interventions are most strongly associated with change. 
This R21 exploratory/developmental study therefore sought to identify active CDBI 
components, using a factorial design guided by [CONTACT_427139] 
(MOST; Collins et al, 2009; 2011), as well as by [CONTACT_427140] 
(Norcross & Wampold, 2011) and Media Equation Theory (Nass & Moon 2000).  
B. The Potential for Dramatic Improvement: Common Factors Theory  and 
Media Equat ion Theory  
Common Factors Theory suggests that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -delivered interventions vary in 
efficacy, not just as a function of their theoretical approach, but also with the 
characteristics of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_427105]. Specifically, a set of common relati onship 
factors (e.g., positive regard, empathy) has been clearly associated with therapy 
outcome (Norcross & Wampold, 2011). However, research has not examined whether 
attention to these factors in the context of a computerized intervention can similarly 
increase efficacy.

Protocol 1  Version 1 
12/5/2018  
8 Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.0 - 20140103   
 Media Equation Theory (Nass & Moon 2000) suggests that people automatically 
react to computers in social ways (e.g., they assign ‘personalities’ to computers, engage 
in impression management, respond to flattery, worry about  ‘offending’ the computer, 
etc.). These data suggest that CDBIs have the potential to be effective, not just by 
[CONTACT_427141]/or skills training, but also by [CONTACT_9851] a therapeutic 
‘relationship’ with a client based on qualities such as res pect and empathy.  
To date, the idea of using a computer to develop a meaningful therapeutic 
relationship is in its infancy. It is unclear whether (1) making a CDBI more ‘humanlike’ 
(e.g., giving it a voice, adding an interactive narrator, etc.) or (2) imbuing it with 
facsim iles of common relationship factors (e.g. empathy, positive regard) will enhance 
its efficacy. The current study experimentally examined these questions by [CONTACT_427142] (common factors, voice, narrator, and presence of motivational 
content) increased the efficacy of a CDBI. In doing so, it not only fully leveraged the 
unique flexibility and modularity of CDBIs, allowing systematic manipulation of very 
specific elements; but was also the first study to systematically and experimentall y 
examine common factors in CDBI research.  
II. Research Strategy: Innovation  
The current study includes a number of innovations, consistent with its status as an 
R21 exploratory/developmental application. Given that innovation and certainty are 
often partially  incompatible, this exploratory research was designed to seek possible 
signals in an important new area, rather than to confirm effects that were already well - 
established. Key innovations included:  
 The proposed study was the first to experimentally evaluate the role of common 
factors in computer -delivered interventions . Findings from the field of Human - 
Computer interaction suggest that individuals (1) react to computers in a social 
manner, especially when they include  a voice or other “human” characteristics; Nass 
& Moon, 2000), and (2) respond positively to relational behaviors (e.g., flattery, 
empathy) expressed by [CONTACT_427143] (Bickmore et al, 2005). The current study was the 
first to apply these findings in a therapeu tic context, or to use them to inform brief 
intervention  development.  
 The current study made use of unique technology. The software used in this study 
was highly interactive and individualized, and relied heavily on realistic interactions 
with a three -dime nsional, animated narrator that could mimic the more 
conversational nature of person -delivered brief interventions. This narrator could 
speak, move, point, provide empathic reflections, and display emotional responses 
such as pleasure, surprise, sadness, a nd thoughtfulness. The uniquely interactive, 
lifelike nature of this software provides an ideal platform for examining common 
factors in  CDBIs.  
 Following the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (e.g., Collins et al., 2011), the 
current study used a factorial design to test 16 combinations of 4 common factors 
(Collins, Dziak, & Li, 2009). Because each participant either received or did not 
receive each common factor, analyses of all factors utilized the entire sample and 
thus were fully powered with a relativel y small N. This unique factorial design 
allowed us to test not only the main effects of the four factors under study (one  of

 which is consistent with Common Factors Theory, and two of which are consistent 
with Media Equation Theory), but also  whether these factors interacted to result 
in better outcomes.  
 The current study evaluated common factors, voice, and narrator while also 
systematically varying the presence vs. absence of motivational content, by 
[CONTACT_427144]. This unique design element 
allowed us to examine the relative therapeutic contribution of specific motivational 
strategies, vs. simply providing information about the problem. These  comparisons 
are particularly important given that (1) key c omponents of brief motivational 
interventions (e.g., MI spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040], therapeutic alliance) have not been consistently 
associated with better outcomes (Bertholet et al, 2013), and (2) research -related 
consent, randomization, and/or assessment have been shown to have clear 
therapeutic effects (e.g., Ondersma et al,  2012).  
 The current study was the first to examine the role of common factors using random 
assignment to conditions involving different combinations of common factors. 
Virtually all existing common facto rs research is correlational. As a result, it is 
unclear whether certain clients elicit certain reactions from therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (e.g.,  motivated 
clients may elicit more positive, empathic responses than unmotivated clients). 
Additionally, it is unclear whether c ommon factors are the cause or the result of a 
successful therapy outcome (i.e., does empathy cause less alcohol use or does less 
alcohol use elicit more  empathy).  
 
III. Research Strategy:  Approach  
A. Investigators and Preliminary  Studies  
The current application i ncludes a team with extensive experience in all key 
elements of the proposed study: alcohol use among youth, CDBIs, and MOST factorial 
studies. The PI, [CONTACT_427169], has a long -standing research program focusing on the 
development and maintenance of risky dr inking among college students (Grekin et al, 
2005, 2006, 2012; Goudriaan et al 2011). She also has experience with brief 
motivational interventions (particularly [CONTACT_427170]’s Computerized Intervention 
Authoring System – see below). She has conducted rese arch examining (1) how state 
variables measured during a computer -delivered intervention are related to long -term 
substance use outcomes (Ondersma et al, 2011) and (2) how indirect screening can be 
used to facilitate substance use intervention without the need for self -report (Grekin et 
al, 2010).  
Co-Investigator Ondersma has over a decade of NIH -funded experience with 
computer -delivered brief interventions for substance use. A member of the Motivational 
Interviewing Network of Trainers, his e -interventions  have placed great emphasis on 
facsimiles of empathy, optimism, and positive regard. The efficacy of these interventions 
has been supported in multiple randomized trials (Ondersma et al., 2005, 2007, 2012, 
2014; Naar -King et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 201 4). 
[CONTACT_352476] McClure’s research focuses on high -reach interventions for substance 
use, primarily tobacco. Importantly, she is a leader with regard to use of the Multiphase 
Optimization Strategy (MOST) for computer -delivered interventions (e.g., see McClure  
et al., 2013), and, as such, will contribute important expertise and experience to the

The Methodology Group at Penn State where MOST was developed. [CONTACT_427171] 
is a Senior Biostatistician at Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427106] - 
funded health services and clinical trials research. He provided consultation on data 
analysis and methods of handling non -normal count data.  
 
This work also benefitted greatly from specialized software developed under Co -I 
Ondersma’s previous awards. This software, called the “Computerized Intervention 
Authoring System,” or CIAS, was designed specifically to allow easy creation and/or 
modificati on of computer -delivered content, without the need for new programming. It 
was also designed to be as lifelike and synchronous as possible; it includes a three - 
dimensional animated character capable of over [ADDRESS_539795] as a guide throughout the process, and provide 
occasional comic relief. These capabilities allow CIAS to provide empathic and emotive 
reflections, and allow developers to imbue the narrator with a lifelike personality. These 
capa bilities, however, can be easily and individually turned on or off —making CIAS 
ideal for the study of each characteristic/capability. Previous studies using CIAS - 
developed interventions have yielded extremely high ratings for acceptability and ease 
of use  (e.g., Ondersma et al., 2005, 2014).  
Using the CIAS software described above, [CONTACT_427170] has developed a standard 
brief, single session substance use intervention based on principles of motivational 
interviewing (Miller & Rollnick, 2002). This intervent ion involves three components; (a) 
decisional balance , in which participants answer questions about what they like/don’t 
like about drinking (e.g., “Right now, what would you say is the single biggest reason 
you drink?”) (b) normed feedback , in which parti cipants are shown graphs that illustrate 
where their drinking falls in relation to others their age; and (c) goal-setting , in which 
participants have the option of indicating a change goal, and —if setting a goal —are 
helped to work through a specific change  plan, including a menu of change options and 
referral to local treatment options.  
Further, since the initial submission of this application, [CONTACT_427169] has pi[INVESTIGATOR_427107] 25 Wayne 
State un dergraduates (all of whom met proposed study criteria; see below). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_427108], participants who were randomized to the high (versus low) empathy 
version scored significantly higher on 5 of 11 readiness to change items (e.g. ‘How likely 
are you to reduce your drinking in the next week?”). No other between -group 
differences were  found.

 will be assured of confidentiality as stated below. In addition, professional referrals may 
be made if students indicate that they are actively suicidal or experiencing significant 
psychological distress (though this will not be specifically assessed). Min or risks may 
include some discomfort from answering questions about alcohol use.  
 
1.2.2  Potential  Benefits  
 
Participants will benefit from increased understanding of psychological research. In 
addition, some participants may gain insight into factors which affec t their alcohol use or 
may experience increased motivation to reduce their drinking. Upon publication, 
research findings will benefit society, generally, by [CONTACT_427145], computer -delivered interventions.

 3 STUDY  DESIGN  
 
The purpose of this study was to develop a maximally effective computer -delivered brief 
intervention (CDBI) for reducing heavy alcohol use. To accomplish this we created 16 
different versions of a CDBI in which common factors, use of a voi ce, use of an 
animated narrator, and motivational content were systematically manipulated using a 
factorial design. Participants were 352 male and female undergraduate students at 
Wayne State University recruited either through the Psychology department ‘s ubject 
pool’ or through ads placed on the university’s website. Eligible students needed to 
meet NIAAA --defined binge or heavy drinking criteria. Heavy drinking criteria : More than 
3 (women)/4 (men) drinks per day, or more than 7 (women)/14 (men) drinks pe r week. 
Binge drinking criteria : more than 4 (women)/5 (men) drinks in a 2 hr.  period.  
 
The study consisted of a baseline assessment (45 minutes, in lab), a 1 -month follow -up 
assessment (10 minutes, online), and a 3 -month follow -up assessment (30 minutes, 
online). During all three assessments, participants completed questionnaires assessing 
demographics, past -month alcohol use, alcohol -related consequences, heavy epi[INVESTIGATOR_182296], and motivation to reduce drinking. During the baseline and the [ADDRESS_539799] month alcohol use. Additionally, during the baseline assessment, participants 
completed a brief (15 minute), computer -delivered intervention aimed at reducing heavy 
drinking. This intervention has been used in multiple previous studies and is based on 
the principles of motivational interviewing. At the end of each session, participants were 
fully debriefed and compensated with either course credit or an Amazon gift ca rd ($[ADDRESS_539800] for the baseline session, $[ADDRESS_539801] for the 1 -month follow -up, $[ADDRESS_539802] 
for the 3 -month follow -up). 
 
The first step in the development phase was to create, using CIAS software, 16 
alternate versions of the motivational interventi on described above. Alternate versions 
varied in the presence vs. absence of four factors (see Table 1). Two of the factors — 
use of a voice, and use of an animated narrator —involved “humanization” of the 
computer program which, according to the Media Equat ion Theory, will increase alliance 
with the software. The manipulation of common factors —operationalized as a 
combination of empathic reflection and expression of positive regard —allowed us to 
directly test the effects of common factors on CDBI outcomes. T he fourth factor we 
manipulated was use of strategic motivational techniques, including decisional balance, 
normed feedback, and optional goal -setting. Notably, experimental conditions that did 
not contain motivational techniques could still include common  factors, as the computer 
can make positive/empathic statements about the participant’s understanding  of 
educational content (e.g., “I appreciate your efforts to understand this”). See Table 1, 
below.

at high risk for heavy alcohol use (e.g., 40% of college students report past 2 -week 
binge drinking; O’Malley & Johnson, 2002); (2) they have been shown to reduce alcohol 
use in response to CDBIs (Carey et al, 2009; Larminer et al, 2007); and (3) their 
accessibility allows us to efficiently and preliminarily test the proposed hypothes es of 
this exploratory  study.

assessments and receiving information about how their alcohol use compares to others 
their age. Those who wished to participate were then signed up for a baseline session  
 
3. Baseline Laboratory Session: Participants were met in the lab by a research 
assistant. After providing consent, they completed (1) a computerized Timeline Follow - 
Back (TLFB) interview assessing past -month drinking, and (2) computerized 
questionnaires that assessed demographics, mean drinks per day in the past [ADDRESS_539808] month alcohol consequences,  and 
motivation to reduce alcohol use. After 
completing these measures, participants 
were randomized to a particular version 
of the intervention by [CONTACT_6449] (352 
participants were assi gned to 16 
conditions: see Table 2, right). Each 
condition lasted approximately [ADDRESS_539809] -intervention

or a $[ADDRESS_539810] (participant’s choice). The entire baseline session took 
approximately 45 minutes (10 minutes f or orientation and consent, 20 min. for 
questionnaires/ interviews, and 15 min. for the intervention). At the end of this session, 
participants were given instructions about their 1 and 3 -month follow -up assessments.

Measures  
Past Month Alcohol Use  was assessed with two measures: (1) The Timeline Follow - 
Back interview (Sobell & Sobell, 1966), a highly reliable interview that uses a calendar 
and multiple procedures to aid retrospective rep orting of substance use (Fals -Stewart et 
al, 2000) and (2) the 3 -item Quantity/Frequency questionnaire (U.S. Dept. of Health and 
Human Services, 1995), a survey which assesses the quantity, frequency, and 
maximum number of drinks consumed in the past month . Past Month Alcohol  
Consequences  was assessed using the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences 
Questionnaire (Read et al, 2006), a well -validated questionnaire designed to assess 
high and low level drinking consequences commonly experienced by [CONTACT_427146] s. 
Motivation to Reduce Drinking was assessed with the Readiness to Change Scale 
(Sobell, 1996), a [ADDRESS_539814]  were assessed with the The Participant 
Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ), a measure created for this study.  The PSQ 
assessed the degree to which participants perceived that the intervention was empathic 
and respectful.

[45 CFR 46.113; 38 CFR 16.113 Suspension or Termination of  Research.]  
 
To fulfill the regulatory requirements (as noted above), Wayne State University (W SU) 
has authorized the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the individual Institutional Review 
Boards (IRBs,Committees) and/or the Committee Chairs or the Assistant/Associate Vice 
President for Research (AVPR), to suspend or terminate a research project that  is not 
being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements and/or that may pose 
increased risks and/or unacceptable risks to the safety and welfare of human research 
subjects. Additionally, any of the above entities or individuals can suspend the hu man 
research activities of an investigator who has committed serious or continuing non - 
compliance in order to assess and/or remediate the problem(s). Suspension or 
termination would occur when there are issues of continuing or serious noncompliance 
with I RB and federal requirements, when the research is associated with unexpected 
serious harm to research participants, or when there are immediate serious issues 
involving participant safety.  
 
Key Definitions

 Confirmed Non -Compliance – Non-compliance (as defined below) that has been verified 
as a result of a for -cause audit or investigation.  
Continuing Non -Compliance – A repeated pattern of non -compliance with all federal 
regulations,  including  Veterans  regulations  and guidance,  by [CONTACT_427147] a single protocol or multiple  protocols.  
Non-Compliance – The failure to comply with all federal regulations, including Veterans 
Administration regulations and guidance, state and local requirements, WSU Policy and 
determ inations of the IRB.  
Serious Non -Compliance – The failure to comply with all federal regulations, including 
Veteran’s Administration regulations and guidance, state and local requirements, WSU 
Policy and determinations of the IRB that involve one or more o f the following:  
 Harm to research  participants;  
 Exposing research participants to a significant risk of substantive  harm;  
 Comprising the privacy and confidentiality of research  participants;  
 Damage  caused  to scientific  integrity  of the research  data that has been  collected;  
 Willful or knowing non -compliance on the part of the investigator;  and 
 Adversely impacting ethical  principles  
 
(See IRB Policy: “Identifying, Defining, and Managing Non -Compliance in Human 
Research” for specific examples).  
Suspension  – A suspension  occurs  when  the IRB Committee,  IRB Chair,  or AVPR  places 
a temporary hold on the research that had been previously approved so that no new 
participants can be accrued, no research interventions may occur (unless necessary for 
the safety  and well-being  of the enrolled  participants),  and no follow -up can be conducted 
unless it is in the best interest of the participant and approved by [CONTACT_36985]. 
Termination of a previously approved protocol – Termination of a previously approved 
protocol  occurs  when  the IRB Committee,  IRB Chair,  or AVPR  withdraw  approval  or stop 
all research activity permanently. No new participants may be enrolled and no additional 
research interventions can occur. However, future follow -up may be conducted with the 
approval of the IRB to monitor the well -being and any potential risk to  participants.  
Termination of activities that have never received prior review and approval – On the 
occasion when research activities have occurred that did not receive prior review and 
approval  from the IRB, the IRB shall stop all such  activities  permanently.  None  of the data 
collected in this activity can be used in any future publication or  presentation.  
Unexpected Problem – An unexpected problem is associated with any aspect of the 
research study that may involve not only risks to the participant enrolled i n a research 
study,  but to other  individuals  who may or may not be directly  associated  with the research 
study. Unexpected problems may occur in non -clinical (behavioral or social science) as 
well as clinical research studies (see IRB Policy and Procedure “Unexpected Problems 
Involving Risk to Participants” for an inclusive list of  categories).

19 Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.[ADDRESS_539819]  been  conducted  without  prior approval, 
a for-cause  audit  will be conducted.  The results  of this audit  will be provided  to the AVPR, 
the IRB Chairs and Committee Members as a part of their decision to suspend and/or 
terminate a research protocol (see IRB P olicy and Procedure “For -Cause  Audit”).  
 
When other administrative groups within the University have suspended a research 
activity  for an issue  involving  human  participants,  they are required  to notify  the IRB within 
5 business  days.  An investigation  will be done  and an audit  may be conducted  by [CONTACT_427148]/or  terminate  the research  protocol.  These  results 
of the above actions may range from corrective or educational measures for the 
researcher up to and including the te rmination of all research activities. Further, the IRB 
may suspend the approval of research projects at any time during an inquiry or 
investigation to assure the protection of human  participants.  
 
Suspension of a Research Protocol  
When reviewing an unexpec ted problem, the IRB or IRB designee may determine that 
the protocol associated with the unexpected problem should be suspended.  
 
In addition, when there is concern that research is being conducted that is not in 
compliance with an approved research protoc ol, the IRB or IRB designee may suspend 
the research protocol until an internal audit has been completed. The completed audit 
report will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1201], to determine whether or not to terminate the IRB 
approval.  
 
As an alternative to termination, the IRB may impose a suspension and/or remedial 
actions to bring the research activities into compliance with the IRB requirements and to 
reduce the risk to participants. When the IRB has determined that all remedial actio ns 
have been implemented, the IRB may withdraw the suspension and the research may 
resume.  
 
Termination of a Research Protocol  
A research protocol is terminated:  
 When a remedial action plan approved by [CONTACT_427149];  or 
 When  the IRB determines  that it is in the best interest  of the research  participants.

must be approved by [CONTACT_427150]. A plan for safe withdrawal 
of participants  from the research  is required  and should  consider  their rights  and welfare, 
and must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. If follow -up of the  participants 
for safety and effectiveness reasons is permitted or required by [CONTACT_1201], the participants 
should  be informed  after obtaining  IRB review  and approval  of the notice.  Any unexpected 
problems  or other  outcomes  identified  during  follow -up should  be reported  to the IRB, the 
research study sponsor, and the FDA, if  applicable.  
 
If the investigator  wishes  to resume  a research  protocol  that has been  terminated,  it must 
be submitted as a new  protocol.  
 
Terminating Research Activities Prior to IRB Review and Approval  
When research activities have occurred without prior review and approval, then all 
activities must cease immediately and the following process is followe d: 
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_427113]/Form regarding 
the event;  
 A for -cause audit of all research documents will be  conducted;  
 The investigator must verify in writing that none of the data will ever be used for 
research purposes  in the  future;  
 All paper  documents  and informed  consent  forms  must  be sent to the IRB office  to 
be confiscated;  
 All computer  files must  be destroyed  and a signed  verification  submitted  by [CONTACT_978]; 
 Mandatory education of the investigator and research team will be  conducted;  
 Appropriate University, IRB, Agency, and Sponsor entities will be  notified.  
 
Reporting of All IRB Suspensions and/or Terminations  
The suspension  and/or  termination  of IRB approval  of a research  protocol  will be promptly 
reported  to the investigator  by [CONTACT_427151]  24 hours  and will include  a written  statement 
of the reasons for the IRB’s  actions.

 4 STUDY  INTERVENTION  
 
4.1 Study Behavioral or Social Intervention(s)  Description  
 
Sixteen versions of the intervention were created by [CONTACT_427152] 4 factors (voice, 
narrator, common factors and MI content) in a full factorial design. In conditions with a 
voice, all content was read aloud to participants through headphones; in non -voice 
conditions, content was presented exclusively as text on scree n. 
In conditions with a narrator, participants interacted with an animated, three -dimensional 
parrot who is capable of multiple specific actions (e.g., pointing, waving, yawning, etc.). 
The animated parrot was selected for his high likeability ratings in p revious research 
(Ondersma, Chase, Svikis, Schuster, 2005) and the fact that (as a non -human 
character) he has no race or ethnicity.  
In high empathy conditions, participants were exposed to a series of non -judgmental 
reflections and statements of affirmati on that were tailored to their individual responses 
(e.g., “You’ve felt really stuck” or “It sounds like you feel two ways about this”). In low 
empathy conditions, these reflections/affirmations were absent, but all other content 
was identical. We chose to  focus on empathy, rather than other relationship factors, 
because the provision of empathy has consistently been associated with better therapy 
outcomes in meta -analyses (e.g. Elliot et al, 2011), and because it was relatively easy 
to operationalize with our software.  
In motivational strategy conditions, participants were presented with three specific 
strategies: (1) personalized normed feedback showing how the participant’s drinking 
compared to that of same -age peers; (2) decisional balance (i.e. weighing  the pros and 
cons of drinking); and (3) an optional goal -setting component in which participants were 
given the choice to set a drinking reduction goal. Non -motivational strategy conditions 
provided straightforward, non -tailored didactic information about  alcohol use.  
Research Design  
As noted above, the current study used a 2X2X2X2 factorial design to test 16 
combinations of the 4 CDBI factors described above (Collins et al, 2016). Factorial 
designs differ from 2 -arm, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in several ways. First, 
factoria l designs randomly assign the entire sample to all levels of each independent 
variable. This allows each main effect to be powered based on the entire sample rather 
than a fraction of the sample (as with RCTs). This efficiency makes factorial designs 
ideal  for optimization. Further, when it comes time for analysis, use of effect coding ( -1, 
1) rather than dummy coding (0, 1) renders orthogonal all main and interaction effects, 
thereby [CONTACT_427153] (Collins et al, 201 6).

 5.1 Screening and  Recruitment  
 
Participants were 352 male and female undergraduate students at Wayne State 
University in Detroit (50.9% male; 50.9% Caucasian).  
 
Participants were recruited in [ADDRESS_539826] pool, which serves between 2400 and 
2500 undergraduates each year. These students were asked to complete a prescreen 
questionnai re which assessed NIAAA -defined binge and heavy drinking criteria. Heavy  
drinking criteria : More than 3 (women)/4 (men) drinks per day, or more than 7 
(women)/14 (men) drinks per week. Binge drinking criteria : more than 4 (women)/5 
(men) drinks in a [ADDRESS_539827] pool students who met either binge or heavy 
drinking criteria were e -mailed and invited to participate in the study.  
 
A second group of students was recruited through advertisements posted on the 
Wayne State online portal “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189].” Advert isements placed on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427116] a study on 
“Undergraduate Alcohol Use.” Students who responded to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427117] a 3 -minute phone screener to determine e ligibility.  
 
All eligible students (recruited from either the subject pool or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]) were told that 
participation involved completing three brief alcohol use assessments and receiving 
information about how their alcohol use compares to others their age.  Those who 
wished to participate were then signed up for a baseline session.  
 
5.2 Enrollment/Baseline  
 
Participants meeting all eligibility criteria were given the opportunity to set up a baseline 
session. Upon arriving in the laboratory, participants completed a written consent form. 
The PI’s research assistants reviewed the consent form with participants and were 
available to answer any questions related to consent. A copy of the signed consent form 
was provided to participants. Names and phone numbers of both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_427118]. The o riginal 
consent forms were kept in a locked file cabinet in the PI’s office, separate from all other

5.3 Follow -ups (1 -month and  3-month)  
 
This study was designed to maximize the follow -up rate and therefore both follow -ups 
were administered online. One month post -intervention, participants were e -mailed a 
link to a brief (10 minute), secure online survey (using Qualtrics) which assessed mean  
drinks per day in the past [ADDRESS_539828] month alcohol consequences, and motivation  to 
reduce alcohol use. Participants who completed the survey received either course 
credit or a $[ADDRESS_539829] (participant’s  choice).  
 
The 3 -Month Follow -Up online survey (using Qualtrics) included all [ADDRESS_539830] -month drinking. At 
the end of the session, Participants were given either course credit or a $[ADDRESS_539831] 
(participant’s choice).  
 
The gift cards were sent to participants’ email address after the project coordinator 
confirmed completion of the online survey. At the very end of the study, all participants 
were emailed a debriefing letter describing the study in more detail.

 An Ex planation of the College Alcohol Study  
 
Thank you for participating in the College Alcohol Study. We really appreciate your time and 
effort. Since you’ve just completed your last session, we want to explain to you what our study 
is about.  
 
As you know, drinking alcohol can be associated with both good things, like relaxation, and bad 
things, like health problems. As a result, many people have mixed feelings about whether they 
want to reduce their alcohol use.  
 
A number of different programs have been developed to help people better understand the pros 
and cons of drinking and decide whether it’s worth it to them to reduce their alcohol use.  
However, these programs can be very different from one another. Some programs are 
computerized (like th e one you interacted with during your first visit), whereas others use an 
actual person. Programs can also differ in their content and presentation. Currently, it’s not 
clear which types of programs are most effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_427120] t they 
want to change their drinking patterns.  
 
Participants in this study are exposed to [ADDRESS_539832] on people’s 
decision to reduce - or not to reduce - their alcohol use 1 and 3 months later.  
 
We realize that many people are not interested in reducing their alcohol use. We also realize 
that some people want to reduce their alcohol use, but not right now. We’ve tried to design 
computer programs that take those facts into consideration and help participants clarify their 
own, individual goals.  
 
Again, we want to thank you for being in our study. Your participation will help us learn more 
about alcohol use among college students. If you have any questions, please feel free to 
contact [CONTACT_427156] [EMAIL_8141] or 313 -577-9305.

decline participation or withdrawal at any time. Participants are also explained the 
potential risk of distress due to the sensitive nature of the questions. The participant is 
explained their rights and what the study is clearly.  
 
6.1 Specification of Saf ety Parameters  
 
6.1.1  Unanticipated  Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following crit eria: 
 
 unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of th e subject population being  studied;  
 related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or  outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  and 
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was  previously 
known or  recogniz ed. 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_539834], including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’ s 
participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research.  
 
6.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
 
 Results in  death  
 Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the  event 
as it occurred)  
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427121] e -interventions for Alcohol Use: Do Common Factors Apply? 
Protocol 1  Version 1 
12/5/2018  
31 Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.0 - 20140103   
  Results in a persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
 
6.2 Characteristics of an Adverse  Event  
 
6.2.1  Relationship to Study Intervention  
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are 
used:  
 
1. Related (Possible, Probable,  Definite)  
 
a. The event is known to occur with the study  interven tion. 
 
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event  onset.  
 
c. The event abates when the intervention is  discontinued.  
 
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not  Related)  
 
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and  event 
onset.  
 
b. An alternate etiology has been  established.  
 
6.2.2  Expectedness of  SAEs  
The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_427122]. An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event i s not consistent with the risk information previously described for 
the intervention.  
 
6.2.3  Severity of  Event  
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  
 
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living  (ADL)  
 
2. Moderate: min imal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact 
on ADL  
 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks 
medical attention, needs major assistance with  ADL

 6.3.1  Unanticipated Problem Reporting to IRB and  NIAAA  
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the 
creation and completion of an unanticipated problem report form. OHRP recommends 
that investigators include the following  information when reporting an adverse event, or 
any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB:  
 
 appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the  title, 
investigator’s name, and the IRB project  number;  
 a detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or  outcome;  
 an explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event,  incident, 
experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated  problem;  
 a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have 
been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated  problem.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported 
using the following timeline:  
 
 Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the 
IRB and to NIAAA within 1 week of the investigator becomi ng aware of the  event.  
 Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and to NIAAA within 
2 weeks of the investigator becoming aware of the  problem.  
 All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional  officials 
(as requi red by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting 
agency head (or designee), and OHRP within one month of the IRB’s receipt of 
the report of the problem from the  investigator.  
 
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_539835] once per year as a part of the annual 
progress report. These reports will describe the event, when it occurred, the study arm 
of the participant, and the outcome/resolution.  If there are no AEs in a given year, the 
report will include a statement to this effect.  
 
Procedures and timeline for reporting SAEs to NIAAA.  
 
SAEs, whether or not anticipated, will be reported to the NIAAA PO within 24 hours of 
the event by [CONTACT_6968]. This 24 hour notification will include a brief explanation of the SAE

affected participant, whether the event appears to be related to the intervention, and 
whether participant will continue in the study.  
 
Reporting of IRB actions to NIAAA.  
 
Follow -up reports to the NIAAA program official —made within 48 hours of IRB actions — 
will specify IRB actions related to study shut -down or changes. We will follow Wayne 
State University policy in the handling of all AEs and SAEs; see Appendix [ADDRESS_539837] to

 7 STUDY  OVERSIGHT  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_427123], executing the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSM), and 
complying with all reporting requirements. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a DSM report to NIAAA 
on an annu al basis, as part of the progress report. The DSM report will include the 
participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment 
rates, treatment retention rates, any quality assurance or regulatory issues that 
occurred during t he past year, summary of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse 
events (SAEs), and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol. The report will 
also include, when available, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted.  
 
a. Data Monitoring Pl an. Data was collected by [CONTACT_427157] (interviews)  or 
by [CONTACT_427158] (self -report) using secure technology (CIAS and Qualtrics; 
both of which use strong encryption and other data safety protocols). The codes that 
link participant names wi th study ID# were secured by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked cabinet. All 
data was kept in the PI’s  lab. 
The primary outcome was mean drinks per day over the past 30 days (as measured 
at both 1 and 3 -month follow ups). Secondary outcome measures included past month 
heavy drinking days, alcohol -related consequences, and intention to reduce alcohol 
use. Outcome data was analyzed using ANCOVAs, factorial ordinal regression, or 
binary logistic regression, depending on each outcome’s distribution. The alpha level 
will be set  at 5%.  
Data quality was facilitated by [CONTACT_427159], and use of double -entry for all data not entered 
directly by [CONTACT_4317]. Data quality was monitored regularly by [CONTACT_15957] -Invest igator Beatty 
(at Wayne State), in concert with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigator.  
 
b.  Safety Monitoring Plan.  For this study, we used the FDA definition of serious 
adverse events (SAEs). Any SAE, whether or not related to study intervention, will be 
reported to th e IRB and NIAAA. The initial SAE report will be followed by [CONTACT_63664] 
a completed SAE report to both institutions. In the event that a participant either 
withdraws from the study or the investigator decides to discontinue a participant due to 
a SAE, th e participant will be monitored by [CONTACT_427160] (1) a resolution is reached (i.e., the problem requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427124]); (2) the SAE is  determined 
to be c learly unrelated to the study intervention; or (3) the SAE results in death. 
Outcomes of SAEs will be periodically reported to NIAAA. A summary of the SAEs that 
occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report to 
NIAAA.

Protocol 1  Version 1 
12/5/2018  
36 Based on NIDCR Clinical Trial (Interventional) Protocol Template v4.[ADDRESS_539838] to be powered based on the entire 
sample rather than a fraction of the sample (as with randomized clinical trials). This 
efficienc y makes factorial designs ideal for pre -trial optimization. Further, use of effect 
coding ( -1, 1) rather than dummy coding (0, 1) renders orthogonal all main and 
interaction effects, increasing power for detection of interaction effects (Collins, 2009). 
Although R21 studies are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_427125], the current N of 352, presuming 
use of intent to treat analysis, provides 80% power to detect main/interaction effects of  d 
≥ .3. 
Analyses will follow standard procedures for evaluating distributional assumptions, 
disproportionate or biased follow -up, and randomization success, and will utilize 
transformations and replacement of missing data using multiple imputation as 
appropriate. Primary analyses will evaluate main and interaction effects on mean 
drinks/day in the past 30 days, as measured by [CONTACT_427161]/Frequency Questionnaire. (Secondary analyses will similarly examine main 
and interaction effects on binge drin king days, drinking consequences, and pre -post 
changes in intention to reduce drinking.) A single 2X2X2X2X2 ANCOVA (or factorial 
ordinal/binary logistic regression, depending outcome distribution) will test the following 
hypotheses:  
 
 Hypothesis 1. There wi ll be significant main effects on mean drinks/day for  the 
two factors consistent with Common Factors Theory (empathy and positive 
regard).  
 Hypothesis 2 . There will be significant main effects on mean drinks/day for  the 
two factors consistent with the Media  Equation Theory (voice and  narrator).  
 Hypothesis 3. There will be significant main effects on mean drinks/day for 
motivational  content.  
 Hypothesis 4 . Mean drinks/day will be lower when one or more of the common 
factors (empathy, positive regard) is combin ed with a voice and/or a  narrator.  
 Hypothesis 5 . Mean drinks/day will be lower when motivational content is 
combined with one or more common factors and/or with  voice/narrator.  
 
Following MOST guidelines (Collins et al, 2009), if intervention components (o r 
combinations of components) are clearly effective, we will proceed to developi[INVESTIGATOR_427126]. If intervention components show some effectiveness, we will 
conduct refining experiments to explore what form/dose of the components will 
maximize  effects. If there are no significant main or interaction effects, we will conduct 
additional exploratory/developmental studies using new factors.

V. Research Strategy: Limitations and Design Considerations  
Given its status as an R21 application, this research aims to be innovative and to 
seek evidence of preliminary effects in an important area of research. Additionally, we 
note the following design considerations.  
1. Should we use college student participants?  CDBIs for undergraduates generally 
contain the same content as those administered to clinical and community samples 
(e.g., normed feedback, change plan, etc; Larimer et al, 2007). Moreover, effect 
sizes for CDBIs in college vs. non -college samples do not differ (Portnoy et al, 
2008). This initial, exploratory study will allow us to recruit participants in high 
numbers and over a short time period. We will test for generalizability —which we 
expect to be present —in future  studies.  
2. Are we under -powered? Our p roposed sample (N=352) will give us marginally 
sufficient power (80% power to detect effects up to d=.3). However, R21 exploratory 
studies typi[INVESTIGATOR_427127]; we see this as a large 
exploratory study rather than as an underpowe red confirmatory study, with its size 
made possible by [CONTACT_427162] a readily available  sample.

 9 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE  DATA/DOCUMENTS  
 
Study staff will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study, in 
compliance with ICH E6, Section 4.9 and regulatory and institutional requirements for 
the protection of confidentiality of subjects. Study staff will permit authorized 
representatives of NIAAA and regulatory agencies to examine (and when required by 
[CONTACT_1289], to copy) research records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, 
audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress and data validity.

 10 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
 
The accuracy with which data input matches data output using the software was 
exhaustively checked prior to beginning the trial (using sample protocols).We have 
never found data coding errors on the part of the software in all previous trials.  Although 
no problems are expected given past experiences with this technology, any evidence of 
errors in data recording by [CONTACT_272712][INVESTIGATOR_427128]. Data will be checked once per month for out of range values and 
other quality issues. Data from participants will be accessible only with appropriate 
passwords known only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_427129].  
 
The PI, the project manager, and the RA will meet regularly and review all data 
collection procedures, as well as  recent data, to ensure that study procedures are being 
followed appropriately and all data are present.

 11 ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
11.[ADDRESS_539839]  
 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the 
principles set forth in The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the 
Protection of Human Subjects of Research, as drafted by [CONTACT_87614] (April 1 8, 
1979) and codified in 45 CFR Part 46 and/or the ICH E6.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_539840] (IRB) oversees research to ensure 
the safe and ethical conduct of human participant research by [CONTACT_427163], staff, and  
students of WSU. This includes reviews of proposed research, oversight committees, 
continuing oversight for compliance with regulations and policy, quality assurance, and 
education and training for investigators, staff, and committee members. The IRB is 
initially notified of proposed research prior to securement of funding and works with 
investigators to optimize study design, data collection, and associated consents and 
information sheets. After approval of study protocols, any changes must be submitted t o 
the IRB via amendments. A yearly continuation is necessary so long as research is 
active; at this time, staff update the IRB of currently approved forms, enrollment figures, 
participant demographics, preliminary results (if applicable), and other pertine nt 
information that allows the Board to determine study execution success and participant 
safety and protections. Upon discovering any adverse events, the Coordinator and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_427130] a report with the IRB and perform any suggested response acti ons. 
Finally, the IRB assists staff in closing the study once data collection has been finalized.  
 
11.3 Informed Consent  Process  
 
We will utilize written informed consent for those who meet all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. This consent form will be summarized by [CONTACT_427164], 
if the participant wishes. The consent form will describe the nature of the possibl e 
interventions, the kinds of questions that will be asked, follow -up procedures, the 
participant’s right to decline or quit at any time, and the possibility of distress as a result 
of some of the questions or material. Participants will also be told that their data will be 
identified by a code number only, with the only link between that code and their data 
being a single form kept locked in the PI’s office. Finally, although we will not ask any 
questions that might elicit reportable information in these a reas, the consent form will 
clearly note the possible need to breach confidentiality should the investigators become 
aware of reportable information regarding child abuse, neglect, suicide risk, or  infectious 
disease.

11.[ADDRESS_539842] by [CONTACT_473], study staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of 
biological samples and any study information relating to subjects.  
 
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be 
released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
The authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all study documents and 
records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, 
medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for the study subjects. The clinical study site 
will permit access to such records.  
 
Breaches of confidentiality will be prevented in a number of ways. First, we will strictly 
separate identifying information and data, connecting them only via a linking table (with 
a hard copy kept in a locked file  cabinet in the PI’s lab, and a password -protected 
electronic version kept on a secure WSU server). Old versions of the paper linking table 
will be shredded; the table will only be accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_427131].  
Second, breaches will also be  prevented by [CONTACT_427165]-256 encryption (the highest level possible). Third, breaches will be prevented by 
[CONTACT_427166] (combining capi[INVESTIGATOR_427132], lowercase letters, an d numbers, using at least 12 characters, and changing 
them monthly). Fourth, all study computers will be protected with a very strong 
passphrase.  
 
Should a breach be discovered, it will be reported within [ADDRESS_539843] be notified of the breach.

12.3 Data  Entry  
Data entry for all self -report measures will be completed directly by [CONTACT_427167] 
a tablet computer using the ACASI software.  
 
Regarding the ACASI: the accuracy with which data input matches data output will be 
exhaustively checked prior to beginning the trial, using sample protocols. (Note: we 
have never found data coding errors on the part of the software in all previous trials. ) 
Further, we will test a randomly chosen sample protocol monthly following trial initiation. 
Although no problems are expected given past experiences with this technology, any 
evidence of errors in data recording by [CONTACT_272712][INVESTIGATOR_17528] p articipants

5  1. OBJECTIVES  Study Hypothesis #1: Perampanel treatment reduces peritumoral hyperexcitability in newly diagnosed high grade glioma (HGG).  Study Hypothesis #2: Perampanel treatment in newly diagnosed HGG is associated with improvement in seizure control.  1 Study Design  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Cohort 1) in participants with newly discovered radiologic lesions consistent with HGG evaluates the effect of perampanel on peritumoral hyperexcitability, measured by [CONTACT_159938]-operative electrocorticography (ECoG), compared to a contemporary observational control group (Cohort 2) of participants undergoing ECoG and standard peri-operative seizure management. To estimate the effect size of early perampanel treatment on ongoing seizure control, participants in Cohort [ADDRESS_185688]-operatively on perampanel, adjusted on a clinical basis until evidence of disease progression (or maximum of 12 months), and compared to participants in Cohort [ADDRESS_185689]-operative seizure management.   1.1 Primary Objectives  Primary Objective: Measure the effect of perampanel on peritumoral hyperexcitability using intraoperative ECoG at the time of initial glioma resection. We will analyze high frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz) as a biomarker of peritumoral hyperexcitability and epi[INVESTIGATOR_159908]. The rate of high frequency oscillations over 10 minutes of recording in the tumor margins will be compared between perampanel treated participants (Cohort 1) and control participants (Cohort 2).  1.2 Secondary Objectives  Secondary Objective: Estimate the clinical effect of perampanel maintenance therapy on seizure control. We will measure seizure-free rates between the time of initial glioma resection and radiographic tumor progression (up to a maximum of 12 months), in participants continued on perampanel post-operatively (Cohort 1) compared to control participants (Cohort 2).    2. BACKGROUND  2.1 Study Disease(s)  This study evaluates peritumoral hyperexcitability and tumor-associated seizures in HGG, including WHO Grade III anaplastic astrocytoma and WHO Grade IV glioblastoma. Seizures are seen in up to 60% of patients with HGG,1 and contribute to decreased quality of life.2 While seizures generally occur earlier in the disease course, up to half of patients with HGG and 
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/[ADDRESS_185690] the potential to inhibit neuronal activity-dependent glioma progression and improve seizure control through reduction of peritumoral hyperexcitability.  2.2 IND Agent(s)  N/A  2.3 Other Agent(s)  Perampanel is a non-competitive AMPA-receptor antagonist, which obtained initial FDA approval in 2012 for the adjunctive treatment of focal and generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and gained FDA approval in 2017 for use as monotherapy for the treatment of focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. In three placebo-controlled trials of perampanel in drug-resistant focal epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], a combined response rate (≥50% seizure reduction) was observed in 19%, 29%, 35%, and 35% of patients treated with placebo, 4mg, 8mg, and 12mg, respectively.16   With high bioavailability (~100%) and blood-brain barrier penetration,17 and long half-life (average 105 hours), effective levels in the brain can be achieved after a single loading dose. 
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/[ADDRESS_185691] been used safely in humans, and a median dose of 6mg has been found to terminate status epi[INVESTIGATOR_146610] a median of 24 hours.18 The minimum therapeutic dose is 4mg daily. In placebo-controlled trials, the rate of perampanel discontinuation due to adverse effects in subjects receiving doses of 4mg was 3%, compared to 5% receiving placebo.[ADDRESS_185692] the objectives of this study.  Perampanel is extensively metabolized via primary oxidation (primarily mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP2B6) and sequential glucuronidation. Perampanel is eliminated mostly in the feces (48%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (22%). Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease plasma levels of perampanel by [CONTACT_3450] 50-67%.16  2.4 Rationale  Preclinical studies of glioma-associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_159909], including activation of the system xc- cystine-glutamate transporter,9,19 and AMPA-receptor mediated neuron-glioma synaptic activity.10,12 Through its anti-glutamatergic actions, perampanel has demonstrated both anti-tumor and anti-seizure effects in vitro and in vivo.13,14 In one series of patients with glioma-associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], perampanel was associated with a reduction in tumor volume in half of cases, correlated with plasma drug levels.14 Additionally, objective seizure responses of 75-100% have been reported in small series of patients with drug-resistant glioma-associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_159910]-seizure medications.14,[ADDRESS_185693] of maintenance therapy on seizure control up to the time of progressive disease.   2.5 Correlative Studies Background  Interictal high frequency oscillations (HFOs) measured using intracranial EEG have been previously associated with the seizure onset zone,21–23 and resection of regions generating HFOs associated with improved seizure outcomes in retrospective analyses of surgical epi[INVESTIGATOR_159911].24 High frequency activity has also been demonstrated in peritumoral regions in intra-operative ECoG recordings,10,25 representing a promising biomarker of peritumoral epi[INVESTIGATOR_159908]. As described in Section 1, the primary objective is a correlative study testing the hypothesis that perampanel will reduce peritumoral HFOs through a mechanism of targeting excessive peritumoral glutamatergic activity.  Glioma-related excitotoxicity is primarily attributed to excessive glutamate release and impaired re-uptake in the peritumoral environment.26 In-vivo microdialysis in the tumor margins of high 
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/[ADDRESS_185694] demonstrated a metabolic profile involving decreases in glucose, and increases in lactate/pyruvate ratios, glutamate, and glycerol concentrations.[ADDRESS_185695] these local metabolic tissue changes remains uncertain. This protocol involves a correlative tissue analysis of peritumoral metabolites and principal excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters to define excitotoxic changes in relation to electrophysiologic excitability. Molecular analysis will be performed using a mass spectrometry method that by[CONTACT_159939].  Mass spectrometry is a well-established analytical technique used to identify and characterize molecules based upon their accurate mass. More specifically here, we will use Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to directly map the distribution of metabolites and neurotransmitters in tissue sections with correlation to histopathology evaluation of the tissue.   3. PARTICIPANT SELECTION  3.[ADDRESS_185696] one dimension as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT or MRI.  See Section 11 (Measurement of Effect) for the evaluation of measurable disease.  3.1.3 Age ≥18 years.    3.1.4 ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).  3.1.[ADDRESS_185697] adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:  - leukocytes   ≥3,000/mcL - absolute neutrophil count  ≥1,500/mcL - platelets   ≥100,000/mcL - total bilirubin  ≤ institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) - AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤3 × institutional ULN - glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see Appendix B)  3.1.6 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.  3.1.7 For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.  3.1.8 Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated 
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/[ADDRESS_185698] agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  3.1.12 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.  3.2 Exclusion Criteria  3.2.1 Participants with brain metastases due to confounding effects on the study objectives.  3.2.2 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to perampanel.  3.2.3 Participants receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.  3.2.4 Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.  3.2.5 Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/2020  
10 3.2.6 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because perampanel is an anti-seizure agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with perampanel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with perampanel.  3.2.7 Participants with a history of suicide attempt or current active suicidal ideation with intent as defined by [CONTACT_159940] (C-SSRS) type 4-5, due to the potential for suicidal ideation with the use of all anti-seizure medications.  3.2.8 Participants who are unable to swallow pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  3.2.9 Participants with tumor associated seizures greater than one month before planned surgery.  3.2.10 Participants currently receiving treatment with more than one anti-seizure medication.  3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.   4 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  In order to maximize enrollment into the pi[INVESTIGATOR_159912] a short time, and given the difficulty in recruiting participants within a narrow pre-operative time window, we will perform concurrent recruitment into the single arm pi[CONTACT_158793] (Cohort 1) and a contemporary observational control group (Cohort 2). Eligible participants will be informed and provided the consent forms for both study groups, and those who have no preference will be enrolled in the cohort with the smaller current enrollment, while those who express a preference will be enrolled into the cohort of their preference (up to a maximum enrollment of 10 per cohort). This will enable eligible participants to be enrolled who decline to be randomized. We do not anticipate a systemic bias in endpoints using this method of enrollment, as potentially confounding factors (described in Section 13) are not expected to influence enrollment preferences, although we cannot completely exclude it.  4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions  Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of any protocol-specific therapy or intervention. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol-specific therapy or intervention begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the protocol-specific eligibility checklist.  Following registration, participants may begin protocol-specific therapy and/or intervention.

Other Agent(s)  Perampanel: Each perampanel dose will be a single tablet taken by [CONTACT_31943] a day. A loading dose of 6mg will be administered 12-36 hours prior to planned surgery start time. Maintenance dosing of 4mg will start 24 hours after the loading dose, and continued daily. Perampanel may be administered with or without food. It should not be crushed, chewed, or dissolved. Doses should be retaken if missed or vomited. There is no specific observation period required. There are no specific caregiver precautions.  5.3.3. Other Modality(ies) or Procedures  Electrocorticography (ECoG): Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) will be performed for 10 minutes using an Xltek machine (Natus Medical Inc, Pleasanton, CA), sampled at [ADDRESS_185701]-operatively (see Section 9.1).  5.3.4. Investigational Imaging Agent Administration  N/A  5.4. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  Because there is a potential for interaction of perampanel with other concomitantly administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/2020  
13 Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 12 months or until one of the following criteria applies:  • Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  • Unacceptable adverse event(s)  • Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the oral medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  • Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol therapy  • General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  Participants will be removed from the study protocol when any of these criteria apply.  The reason for removal from protocol, and the date the participant was removed, must be documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant. Perampanel may be continued on a clinical basis by [CONTACT_140882]. If the participant is taken off protocol for active suicidal ideation with intent (defined by [CONTACT_159941] 4-5), the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_159914].  When a participant is removed from protocol therapy and/or is off of the study, the participant’s status must be updated in OnCore in accordance with REGIST-OP-1.  5.6. Duration of Follow Up  Participants will be followed as clinically indicated after removal from protocol or until death, whichever occurs first. Participants removed from protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. After completion of the study, if the treating neurologist cannot be contact[CONTACT_159942], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_159915] a different treating neurologist and will follow them clinically until then.  5.7. Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply: • Disease progression • Lost to follow-up • Withdrawal of consent for data submission • Death  
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/[ADDRESS_185702] be documented in the case report form (CRF). In addition, the study team will ensure the participant’s status is updated in OnCore in accordance with REGIST-OP-1.   6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  Perampanel dose modifications are permitted as clinically indicated to optimize seizure control and minimize adverse effects. Dose adjustment may be performed by [CONTACT_159943]/or study investigators. For any adjustment, the Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_6321], will be notified. A maximum daily maintenance dose for this study will be 8mg.   At the completion of the study, if perampanel is not clinically indicated and/or planned to be withdrawn, the daily dose will be tapered down by 2mg per week to the minimum therapeutic dose of 4mg, then stopped. If perampanel is being discontinued for lack of seizure efficacy, an alternative anti-seizure medication chosen at the discretion of the primary treating neurologist will be started and titrated to a therapeutic dose, after which perampanel will be tapered off as above. If the participant experiences a serious adverse event attributed to perampanel, the drug may be stopped immediately if, at discretion of the Principal Investigator, the benefits outweigh the risks.   7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in addition to routine reporting.  7.1. Adverse Event List  7.1.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the agent administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  8.1. Perampanel  8.1.1. Description  The chemical name [CONTACT_159962] 2-(1′,6′-dihydro-6′-oxo-1′-phenyl[2,3′-bipyridin]-5′-yl)-benzonitrile, hydrate (4:3). The molecular formula is C23H15N3O • 3⁄4H2O and the molecular weight is 362.90 (349.39 for anhydrous perampanel).  Perampanel is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_159920]-pass metabolism. Median time to reach peak concentration (tmax) ranged from 0.[ADDRESS_185706] on the total exposure (AUC0-inf) of perampanel and reduced the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of perampanel by 11%-40%. The tmax was delayed by [CONTACT_3450] 1-3 hours in fed state compared to that under fasted conditions.  Data from in vitro studies indicate that, in the concentration range of 20 to 2000 ng/mL, perampanel is approximately 95- 96% bound to plasma proteins, mainly bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Blood to plasma ratio of perampanel is 0.55-0.59.  Perampanel is extensively metabolized via primary oxidation and sequential glucuronidation. Oxidative metabolism is primarily mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP2B6, based on results of in vitro studies using recombinant human CYPs and human liver microsomes. Other CYP enzymes may also

17 be involved.  Following administration of radiolabeled perampanel, unchanged perampanel accounted for 74-80% of total radioactivity in systemic circulation, whereas only trace amounts of individual perampanel metabolites were detected in plasma.  Following administration of a radiolabeled perampanel tablet dose to 8 healthy elderly subjects, 22% of administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 48% in the feces. In urine and feces, recovered radioactivity was primarily composed of a mixture of oxidative and conjugated metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data from 19 Phase 1 studies reported that t1/2 of perampanel was 105 hours on average. Apparent clearance of perampanel in healthy subjects and patients was approximately 12 mL/min.  The concomitant use of known moderate and strong CYP3A4 inducers including carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, or oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_159921] 50-67%.  Perampanel Cmax and AUC0-72h were not altered when a single 6-mg dose of perampanel tablet was administered to healthy female subjects following a 21-day course of oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol 30 μg and levonorgestrel 150 μg. Co-administration of perampanel 4 mg tablet once daily with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 30 μg and levonorgestrel 150 μg for 21 days did not alter Cmax or AUC0-24h of either ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel in healthy female subjects. In another study, a single dose of the oral contraceptive was administered following 21-day once daily dosing of perampanel 12 mg or 8 mg tablets in healthy females. Perampanel at 12 mg did not alter AUC0-24h of ethinylestradiol but decreased its Cmax by 18%, and also decreased Cmax and AUC0-24h of levonorgestrel by 42% and 40%, respectively. Perampanel at [ADDRESS_185707] on Cmax or AUC0-24h of either ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel, with a decrease in AUC0-24h of levonorgestrel (9% on average).  8.1.2.

HFOs will be visually identified after filtering (FIR, order 500, bandpass 80-500 Hz) using Persyst Insight (Persyst Development Corp, Solana Beach, CA). The rate of HFOs per channel per subject will measured for analysis.  ECoG is a standard clinical procedure utilized for epi[INVESTIGATOR_159922]. There will be no deviations from standard institutional protocols for this study. The investigators are experienced in the performance of this procedure and analysis of ECoG data. The use of ECoG is expected to increase the length of surgery by 15-20 minutes.  There is a low chance (3-4%) that ECoG may reveal subclinical electrographic seizures or highly epi[INVESTIGATOR_159923],31 and would allow for immediate treatment to decrease the risk of intra-operative brain injury.   9.2. Laboratory Correlative Studies  9.2.1. Intraoperative Stereotactic Molecular Imaging  This protocol involves an optional ancillary/exploratory tissue study involving mass spectrometry analysis and histopathology evaluation. The aim of this correlative analysis is to measure the metabolic profile, neurotransmitter profile, and study drug tissue distribution in resected tissue specimens. Although glutamatergic excitotoxicity is thought to contribute to tissue necrosis,[ADDRESS_185709]. Agar and collaborators for detection of tumor metabolites,32 tumor subtype classification,33 and therapeutic drug distribution.34 Given that multiple samples will be analyzed per participant, this study enrolling up to 20 participants across cohorts will be sufficient to demonstrate interpretable and meaningful results.

In addition to the bulk tumor specimen as routinely sent, numerous small specimens will be collected during the resection using tumor forceps at sampling positions registered to pre-operative MRI images using a navigation system (General Electric Instatrak or BrainLab Vector Vision). All specimens will be sent to the BWH Tissue Biorepository. When the Tissue Biorepository has confirmed that enough tissue has been collected to make a diagnosis, specimens will be made available MALDI MSI.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Handling of Specimens Specimens for correlative analysis will be banked by [CONTACT_159945] (Directors: David Louis MD, Keith Ligon MD, PhD). A dedicated pathology banking assistant will track and collect tissue for fresh, frozen, and culture analysis. The tissue will be quality control screened by a banking Neuropathologist Staff and scored for percentage tumor composition, necrosis, inflammation, and normal brain tissue content. Specimens will be analyzed by [CONTACT_159946] (Bruker Daltonics), and associated with histopathology for tumor cell prevalence and select histological features. Microscopy images of standard histopathology staining will be co-registered with mass spectrometry images of a given tissue section to resolve the molecular signature [CONTACT_159963], necrosis, and vascularization. The histopathological validation will be correlated to radiology and clinical information via Mirax Digital Slide Desktop (MDSD) database (Zeiss). As part of this study, we will study the differences in the molecules that occur within different regions of the tumor (e.g. at the boundaries between tumor and normal tissues). Metabolic profiling will involve analysis of tissue pH, lactate, pyruvate, and lipid composition. Neurotransmitter profiling will involve analysis of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA composition. Drug distribution will be performed for perampanel and levetiracetam.    [IP_ADDRESS]. Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_159924].  [IP_ADDRESS].

Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not clearly defined, lesions with maximal diameter < 1cm.  11.1.3. Methods for Evaluation of Disease  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 2 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.

23 11.1.4. Response Criteria  Complete response (CR). All of the following criteria must be met:  a) Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks. In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this scan will be considered only stable disease.  b) No new lesions.  c) All measurable and non-measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  d) Participants must be on no steroids or on physiologic replacement doses only.  e) Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions.  f) Stable or improved clinically, for clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline and recorded to be disease related. Participants with non-measurable disease cannot have a complete response. The best response possible is stable disease.   Partial response (PR). All of the following criteria must be met:  a) Greater than or equal to 50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks. In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this scan will be considered only stable disease.  b) No progression of non-measurable disease.  c) No new lesions.  d) All measurable and non-measurable lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  e) The steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of baseline scan.  f) Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan.  g) Stable or improved, for clinical signs and symptoms present at baseline and recorded to be disease related clinically.  Participants with non-measurable disease cannot have a partial response. The best response possible is stable disease.   Progressive disease (PD). The following criterion must be met:  a) 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (over best response or baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids  and/or one or more of the of the following:  b) Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids steroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, not due to co-morbid events (radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, post-operative changes, or other treatment effects).  c) Any new lesion.  
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/2020  
24 d) Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor (e.g. seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infection, etc.). The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the investigator, but it is recommended that a decline in the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) from [ADDRESS_185715] 7 days, be considered neurologic deterioration, unless attributable to co-morbid events or changes in corticosteroid dose.  e) Failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition.  Stable disease (SD). All of the following criteria must be met:  a) Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.  b) All measurable and non-measurable sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  c) Stable non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose has been increased, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  d) Stable clinically. Unknown response status. Progressive disease has not been documented and one or more measurable or non-measurable lesions have not been assessed.  11.1.5. Duration of Response  Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation).  Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.   Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.   11.1.6. Progression-Free Survival  Overall Survival: Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/2020  
25 Progression-Free Survival: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a primary electrophysiologic outcome and a secondary exploratory clinical outcome of seizure response. The protocol is statistically powered to detect a meaningful reduction in peritumoral hyperexcitability as measured by [CONTACT_159953]. For the secondary outcome, this protocol is intended to estimate the seizure response effect size of early perampanel treatment on tumor-associated seizures in HGG.  13.1. Study Design/Endpoints  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]: Preliminary Study • Primary objective: Compare rates of peritumoral HFOs (mean number of HFOs per minute) between participants treated with perampanel versus standard of care. • Secondary objective: Compare time to seizure recurrence between participants treated with perampanel versus standard of care up to the time of HGG progression. • Maximum total accrual: 10 participants in Cohort 1, 10 participants in Cohort 2. • Sample size justification: Using the mean HFO rate across participants receiving standard of care (Cohort 2) as the normalized ineffective rate (P1=1.0), we define a target effective rate for the treatment arm (Cohort 1) of P2=0.60. Using a two sample power calculation, the intended sample size of 10 participants in each cohort will provide 82.5% power to detect a true 40% or greater reduction in the normalized mean HFO rate with perampanel compared to standard of care (a=0.05, two-sided). • Statistical methods for primary objective: The primary endpoint is the mean number of HFOs per minute. This will be averaged across participants in each cohort, and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (two-sided, α=0.05). In sensitivity analyses, we will compare HFO rates between cohorts stratified by [CONTACT_159954], including temporal lobe tumor location, IDH1/2 mutation, and pre-operative seizures. • Statistical methods for secondary objective: The secondary endpoint is the time to first post-operative seizure. Time to first post-operative seizure will be estimated in time-to-event analysis from the date of surgery using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison 
NCI Protocol #: N/A Version Date: 07/27/[ADDRESS_185717] (a=0.05). In sensitivity analyses, we will compare time to first post-operative seizure between cohorts stratified by [CONTACT_159954], including temporal lobe tumor location, extent of resection (gross total vs subtotal resection), presence of IDH1/2 mutation, and presence of pre-operative seizures. • Data processing and statistical analysis will be performed using R 3.5.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). • These results will be used to support or refute the hypothesis that perampanel has targeted anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_159925]-associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], and may inform the design and feasibility of future clinical studies of targeting the glutamatergic pathway in this patient population.  Correlative Analysis: Intraoperative Stereotactic Molecular Imaging • Aim 1: Correlate lactate/pyruvate ratio by [CONTACT_159955]. • Aim 2: Correlate glutamate and GABA signal intensities by [CONTACT_159956]. • Aim 3: Correlate anti-seizure drug signal intensity by [CONTACT_159956]. • Statistical analysis: correlations will be measured using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.  13.2. Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration  A total of 20 evaluable participants will be accrued within one year (up to 10 participants per cohort). Up to an additional [ADDRESS_185718] participant accrued to observe the participant’s response to protocol therapy, for a total study duration of 2 years. There are no defined ethnic or racial accrual targets.  13.3. Stratification Factors  N/A  13.4. Interim Monitoring Plan  All participants will undergo continuous safety monitoring.  13.5.

34  APPENDIX C INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers and Non-Study Healthcare Team  Perampanel interacts with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.   Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet.  These are the things that you and they need to know:   Perampanel interacts with a certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver.  • The enzyme in question is/are CYP3A4, and perampanel is broken down by [CONTACT_159961]. • Perampanel must be used very carefully with other medicines that need these liver enzymes to be effective or to be cleared from your system.   • Other medicines may also affect the activity of the enzyme.   o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce the effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s activity (“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the chance of harmful side effects. • You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or removing any drug in this category.  • Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4.” • Your prescribers should look at this web site http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx or consult a medical reference to see if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.   • Please be very careful!  Over-the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s usually big and catches your eye.  They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an adverse interaction.   • Be careful:  o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age.  Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for pain, flu, and cold.

o If you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit:  Avoid these until the study is over.  o If you take herbal medicine regularly:  You should not take St. John’s wort while you are taking perampanel.  Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.   • You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.   • Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.    Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_159966], MD, PhD, and he or she can be contact[CONTACT_6811] [PHONE_3546].

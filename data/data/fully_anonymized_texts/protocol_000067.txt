Study Rationale  • Sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is a major 
contributor to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.  
• To reduce SSB consumption, state and local legislators have 
proposed requiring SSB containers to bear front -of-package 
(FOP) labels with health warnings  – explicit messages about the 
health harms of consuming SSBs. To date, there are few studies 
assessing whether such warnings influence consumer behaviors.  
• This study aims to evaluate the effect of SSB health warnings on 
sugar -sweetened beverage  purchases and secondary outcomes 
using a randomized controlled trial in a naturalistic setting.  
Study Objective( s) Primary  
• To evaluate the effect of sugar -sweetened beverage  health 
warnings on total calories of sugar -sweetened beverages  
purchased . 
 
Secondary  
• To evaluate the effect of sugar -sweetened beverage  health 
warnings on:  
o Number of calories purchased from all foods and 
beverages  
o Proporti on of participants who purchased  a sugar -
sweetened beverage  
o Number of sugar -sweetened beverages purchased  
o Mean intentions to limit consumption of beverages with 
added sugar  
o Mean intentions to limit consumption of specific sugar -
sweetened beverages  
o Proportion of participants who noticed trial labels  
o Mean attention to trial labels

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
Obesity , diabetes , and cardiovascular  disease  are among  the leading  causes  of death  in 
the United  States .1 Consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as sodas, fruit 
drinks, and sports drinks, is a significant contributor to these preventable conditions .2–6 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_829758], the average American adult drinks a remarkable 40 to 50 
gallons of SSBs every year, accounting for seven percent of daily caloric intake.7–[ADDRESS_1151428] proposed requiring SSB containers to bear 
front -of-package (FOP) labels with health warnings  – explicit messages about the hea lth harms 
of consuming SSBs.10–15 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_829759]’ interest in SSB health warnings, there remain 
critical gaps in our knowledge of whether and how such warnings change behavior.  
Theoretical and empi[INVESTIGATOR_829760] a promising 
strategy for reduc ing consumption. Studies of similar textual health warnings on cigarette packs 
find that warnings reduce smoking in adolescents.[ADDRESS_1151429] behaviors,20 and survey research has shown that 
intentions to consume SSBs are associated with actual SSB consumption.21–[ADDRESS_1151430] examined whether SSB health warnings change 
actual behaviors. Answering this question is essential: if effective, SSB health warnings are a 
highly scalable, low -cost intervention that could reduce SSB intake and chronic disease.  
This s tudy aims to evaluate the effect s of SSB health warnings on SSB purchases and 
secondary outcomes using a randomized controlled trial in a naturalistic setting .  This Protocol 
and Statistical Analysis Plan is being submitted as an attachment to the study’s trial registration 
(NCT #03511937)  prior to analysis . The protocol describes the trial objectives, design, and 
population. The analysis plan pre -specifies planned analyses of the primary, secondary and other 
outcomes, prior to examining the data. In writing the protocol and statistical analysis plan, we 
have adhered to the guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_829789].,[ADDRESS_1151431]

1.1 Introduction  
This is a single -center, single -blind, two -arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the 
effects of SSB health warnings.  
Setting . The trial is conducted in a “mock store” at the Fuqua  Behavioral Lab (“B -Lab”), 
located at the Duke Fuqua School of Business in Durham, North Carolina, [LOCATION_002]. The B -
Lab mock store was developed for researchers to examine the influence of store and product 
characteristics on consumer behavior in a rea listic but controlled environment. The mock store 
resembles a convenience store.  
Products for sale.  Beverages for sale in  the mock store include a variety of SSBs and 
non-SSBS. To select specific beverages to sell, we examined electronic purchase data25 from 
households in North Carolina to identify popular products by [CONTACT_829790]: sodas; fruit d rinks; sports drinks; energy drinks; ready -to-drink 
coffees; ready -to-drink teas; and flavored waters ( Table 1 ). We then identified non -SSBs that 
most closely matched the selected SSBs (e.g., if a particular flavor and brand of soda was 
selected for sale in the store, we also selected the diet version of this soda to sell). For fruit 
drinks, we selected the 100% f ruit juices that most closely matched the fruit drink selected (e.g. 
we selected 100% cranberry juice to match the cranberry juice cocktail fruit drink). To more 
fully reflect the beverage retail environment, we also elected to sell plain bottled water and  non-
calorically flavored sparkling water, despi[INVESTIGATOR_829761].   
In each beverage category, the store sells at least one variety (i.e., one brand/flavor) of 
the SSB (and therefore at least one variety of the matched non-SSB). We elected to sell five 
varieties of sodas and two varieties of fruit drinks to reflect that more calories of SSBs come 
from these categories than from other SSB categories.26 Beverages are 8.0 to  20.0 fluid ounces 
per container. Non-SSBs are matched to their corresponding SSB in container size .  
Non-beverage items for sale include  foods (e.g., chips, crackers, cookies, pre -packaged 
fruits, nuts , canned soups, pasta, cereal, candy) and household products (e.g., shampoo, soap, 
toothpaste, paper towels, notebooks, garbage bags). These products were  selected by [CONTACT_941] B -Lab 
to interest participants and mimic a typi[INVESTIGATOR_829762].

Pricing.  To control for the potential inf luence of price on participants’  purchases, prices 
are held constant across trial arms. Following others,[ADDRESS_1151432] 
retail prices per ounce in grocery and convenience stores surrounding the laboratory. Prices are 
$1.46 U SD for all beverages except for coffees and energy drinks, which are $2.26 USD, 
reflecting their higher retail price. All SSBs and their matching non -SSB were priced identically 
(e.g., regular and diet sodas were the same price; regular and diet energy dri nks were the same 
price). Prices for non -beverage items remained at the levels set previously by [CONTACT_941] B -Lab, which 
had been selected to mimic real -world prices.  
 
1.2 Description of Trial Arms (Intervention)  
Participants are randomly assigned to one of two arms: a “health warnings” arm 
(intervention) or a control arm. In the health warnings arm, all SSB s are labeled with a health 
warning label. The health warning label is a 1.5” octagon with red background, a white border, 
and white text ( Figure 1 ).  The text reads: “WARNING Beverages with added sugar contribute 
to tooth decay, diabetes, and obesity.” All text is in Arial font. The word “WARNING” is in 12 -
point font and the remaining text is in 9.25 -point font.  The words “WARNING,” “tooth decay,” 
“diabetes,” and “obesity” are bolded.  In the control arm, all SSBs are labeled with a control 
label. The control label is a 1” x 2.625” rectangle label with white background and a black 
barcode image (Figure 1). In bot h arms, labels are adhered directly on the front -of-package

Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  10 
(FOP) of SSB containers. The location of the label on the containers’ packaging is held constant 
across trial arms (i.e., both the health warning label and the control label are placed on the same  
location on the product’s FOP). However, this location on the FOP varies slightly across 
beverage types based on the shape and size of the container.  
 
1.3 Study Findings  (Risk and Benefits)  
Health warnings on SSB  are a promising strategy for reducing SSB consumption and the 
associated health risks.  S tudies of similar textual health warnings on cigarette packs find that 
warnin gs reduce smoking in adolescents ,[ADDRESS_1151433] behaviors,20 and survey res earch has shown that 
intentions to consume SSBs are associated with actual SSB consumption.21–[ADDRESS_1151434] examined whether SSB health warnings change 
actual behaviors. Answering this question is essential: if ef fective, SSB health warnings are a 
highly scalable, low -cost intervention that could reduce SSB intake and chronic disease. This 
research will provide timely information on this important gap  in our understanding of the effects 
of SSB health warnings.  
Risks of participati ng in this study are minimal. One risk is that participants may find that 
some questions on the survey make them bored or uncomfortable. To minimize this risk,  the 
study duration is short (~30 minutes)  and questionnaire items do not query sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] . 
There is  also a small risk of loss of privacy resulting from accidental disclosure of study data .

1.4 Relevant Literature and Data  
SSB consumption is a public health p roblem. On any given day, half of American 
adults con sume a sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB),26 and one in seven are considered ‘heavy 
SSB consumers’ (intake > 500 calories/day).[ADDRESS_1151436] contributor to total caloric  intake.33  
These statistics are concerning because SSB consumption has been linked to several 
negative health outcomes including excess body weight , type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 
cardiovascular disease  (CVD) .2–5,34–38 Among unhealthy foods and beverages, SSBs are often 
singled out as parti cularly problematic because they are high in calories but offer little or no 
nutritional value,39–[ADDRESS_1151437] even identified SSBs as perhaps “the single largest driver of the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].”40(p1805) 
Indeed, a meta -analysis  of prospective cohort studies estimate d that consumin g an additional one 
serving (12 ounces) of SSBs per day is associated with a 0.[ADDRESS_1151438] the relationship between SSB 
consumption and weight gain may be even stronger (as high as 2.70 kg/year for an additional 
serving of SSBs/day).38,44  
SSB consumption also increases risk of T2D and CVD , both indirectly via its influence 
on obesity (a known risk factor for poor cardiometabolic outcomes) and directly v ia its effects on 
metabolic and inflammatory processes.3,[ADDRESS_1151439]   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, [ADDRESS_1151440] quantile of SSB consumption (1 -2 
servings/day) had 26% greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] T2D than those in the lowest quantile (no 
consumption or <1 serving/month).35 In a separate meta -analysis of 17 cohort studies 
representing more than 10 million person -years, Imamura et al. estimated that 8.5% of T2D cases 
in the [LOCATION_002] could be attributed to SSB consumption.[ADDRESS_1151441] that SSB consumption increases risk of cardiovascular problems including hypertension, 
inflammation, adverse lipid profiles, and coronary heart disease.3,45–[ADDRESS_1151442] proposed requiring SSB containers 
to bear labels with health warnings .10–[ADDRESS_1151443] demonstrated that health 
warnings significantly reduce purchase intentions.17–19 In turn, several theories of health 
behavior, including the Theory of Planned Behavior, posit that intentions are a key determinant 
of behaviors.20,48 –[ADDRESS_1151444] plausible mediators, including knowledge,51,52 
attitudes,20 and outcome expectations.53–[ADDRESS_1151445] of warn ings on smoking behavior 
are warning reactions, including attention to the warnings, cognitive elaboration (thinking about 
the warnings), and affective message reactions (fear, worry).56,[ADDRESS_1151446]

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a single -center, single -blind, two -arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the 
effects of SSB health warnings. The study include s two phases:  
(1) Screening: screening for eligibility and obtaining consent and  
(2) Intervention: study intervention.

Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  14 
3.2 Allocation to  Treatment Groups and Blinding  
Participants are randomly assigned to one of two arms: a health warnings  arm or  a control 
arm. Participants have  an equal chance of being randomized to either trial arm (i.e., treatment 
allocation was a 1:1 ratio). An independent biostatistician conducted the randomization prior to 
data collection . Randomization  was carried out by [CONTACT_57148] a random number for each 
participant identification code (ID). Participant IDs were ordered on this random number from 
smallest to largest. The bottom half of the IDs were assigned to the control arm and the top half 
to the t reatment arm. This procedure ensures equal group sizes. When participants arrive for their 
study visit, they are assigned the next consecutive participant ID and are allocated to the trial arm 
previously assigned to that ID.   
Participants are blinded to t heir assigned trial arm. Specifically, they are not told the 
trial’s purpose nor are they told information about the trial arms. The experimenter is aware of 
the trial arm to which the pa rticipant has been assigned .   
 
3.3 Number of Subjects  
This trial aims to enroll 400 participants (200 per arm). See Section 6.[ADDRESS_1151448] one serving (12 ounces) of SSBs per week. Participants must be willing and able to consent 
and comply with study procedures. This study does not  employ any exclusi ons based on race, 
ethnicity, or gender.  To determine eligibility, interested participants are asked to complete a brief 
online survey. The survey queries the prospective participant ’s age, usual SSB  consumption 
(using an adapted version of the BEV -Q 15, a  validated questionnaire58), and own and parental 
educational attainment. Participants aged [ADDRESS_1151449] 12 ounces of 
SSBs per week are invited to schedule a time to participate. Ineligible participants are thanked 
for their time.  
We will track and summar ize participant enrollment, allocation, and analysis using a 
CONSORT diagram. The diagram will report the number of participants who were:

4.[ADDRESS_1151450] in the Duke Fuqua Behavioral Lab ( B-Lab, see 
above description). Participants arrive to the B -Lab at their scheduled appointment time and are 
greeted by [CONTACT_194071]. After providing informed consent  (see Section 11 below) , 
participants are escorted to the mock store. When they arrive in the mock store, they are provided 
with a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_829763] ($10 USD) in cash. SSBs in the mock 
store are pre -labeled with the appropriate  label based on the participant’s  assigned trial arm 
(health warning vs. control). Particip ants are instructed to pretend they are on a usual shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_829764]. They are not told the trial’s 
purpose nor are they told information about the trial arms.   
Participants are asked to complet e a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989]. They are given a list of three product 
categories (household items, foods, and beverages, listed in this order) and are asked to select 
two items in each of these categories, for a total of six items. They indicate their selections by 
[CONTACT_829792][INVESTIGATOR_829765]. Participants are instructed that, within each category, they 
can select the same item twice, or can select two different items (e.g., can select the same food 
item twice, or select two different food items). Participan ts are then instructed that they will be 
required to purchase one of the items they select, and that this item will be chosen for them at 
random by [CONTACT_194071]. This procedure incentivizes participants to only select products 
they are actually interes ted in purchasing. The experimenter ensures the participa nt understands 
the instructions  then leaves the mock store while the participant completes the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989].  
After participants have completed the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989], the experimenter records what  
Impact of Sugar -Sweetened Beverage Health Warnings, NCT #03511937   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  16 
products are in the participant’s basket, then randomly selects one of the products for the 
participant to purchase with his or her incentive cash. The participant pays for the product and 
receives change as necessary. After paying for their item, the part icipant  complete s a computer -
based survey in another room.  
 
4.3 Withdrawal Procedures  
Individual participants will be withdrawn from the study if they indicate they do not wish 
to participate ( i.e., refuse or withdraw their consent), or if they cannot comply with the study 
procedures, such as not arriving at the laboratory to complete the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_829766].  
 
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AN D MEASUREMENTS  
Outcome variables, organized by [CONTACT_24975] (i.e., primary, secondary, other), are described in 
Table 2 . Purchase variables ( i.e., number of calories purchased from SSBs, number of calories 
purchased from all foods and beverages, proporti on of participants who pu rchased an SSB, and 
number of SSBs purchased) are assessed by [CONTACT_194071], who records all of the 
participant ’s selections at the end of the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989]. All other outcomes are assessed via 
participant self -report on a computer -based survey that is completed within ~3 0 minutes of 
completing the ~10 -minute shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989].

Analyses of the primary, secondary, and other outcomes will include all randomized participants 
according to the trial arm they were randomized to receive. We will use complete case anal ysis 
to handle any missing data in analyses of the primary, secondary, and other outcomes.      
 
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary outcome variable is the total number of calories from sugar -sweetened 
beverages the participant purchased during the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989] (see also Table 2) .  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1151461]   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, [ADDRESS_1151462] examine all 
scales to ensure adequate internal consistency (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha > 0.70), droppi[INVESTIGATOR_829779]. If we are unable to achieve adequate interna l consistency by 
[CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_98474], we may exclude the unreliable scales from analyses (e.g., not analyze treatment 
effects on these outcomes).  
Next, we will conduct  balance tests. Specifically, we will report participants’ age, gender, 
sexual orientation, H ispanic ethnicity, race, educational attainment, health literacy, household 
income,  usual sugar -sweetened beverage consumption, and overweight status (body mass index 
[BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m2) by [CONTACT_159344]. We will summarize categorical variables as counts and 
percentages and continuous variables as means and standard deviations. The denominator for 
each percentage will be the number of participants within each treatment group, less any 
participants with missing data on the variable of interest. We will use t-tests and χ2 tests to 
examine whether participants assigned to the trial arms differ on any continuous or categorical 
characteristics, respectively. We will report p values from these balance tests. Subsequent 
analyses will control for any unbalanced characteri stics.  
 Analysis of the primary outcome (Efficacy analysis). We will use ordinary least 
squares regression (OLS) to examine whether the primary outcome differs by [CONTACT_159344]. 
Specifically, we will fit the following:  
𝑆𝑆𝐵  𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠  𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 = 𝛽0+  𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 + 𝑋𝛽   (Eq. 1)  
Here, SSB calories purchased  is the total calories from SSBs the participant had in her basket 
when she completed her shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_91989], calculated as described in Table 2. WARNING is an 
indicator variable for whether the participant was in the health warning arm (WARNING = 1) or 
the con trol arm (WARNING = 0). We denote 𝑋 as a vector of any participant characteristics 
(e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity) found to be unbalanced across trial arm s in balance tests.  
The coefficient on WARNING ( 𝛽1) is the primary effect estimate, and gives t he average 
difference in (adjusted) means between the treatment arm and the control arm. It is interpreted as 
the impact of SSB health warnings on total calories of SSBs purchased.  
Planned exploratory analyses of the primary outcome.  We will examine wheth er the 
following participant characteristics moderate (modify) the effect of SSB health warnings on 
SSB purchases:  
Impact of Sugar -Sweetened Beverage Health Warnings, NCT #03511937   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  22 
a) Age category (18-29, 30 -39, 40 -54, and 55 years or older);  
b) Sex (male vs. female);  
c) Sexual orientation (gay, lesbian, or bisexual vs. not);  
d) Race/ethnicity (white vs. non -white);  
e) Low educational attainment (some college or less vs. college or more),  
f) Limited health literacy (possibility or high likelihood of limited literacy vs. adequate 
literacy, based on score on the Newest Vital Sign63,64);  
g) Household income ($50,000 or more vs. less than $50,000);  
h) Usual SSB consumption (above vs. at or below the sample median);  
i) Overweight status (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 vs. BMI < 25 kg/m2); 
 
To test whether these characteristics moderate the effect of SSB health warnings on SSB 
purchases, we will fit a series of regressions (one for each potential moderator) taking the 
following general form:  
𝑆𝑆𝐵  𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠  𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 = 𝛽0+  𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 +𝛽2𝐶𝐻𝐴𝑅𝐴𝐶𝑇𝐸𝑅𝐼𝑆𝑇𝐼𝐶  +
 𝛽3(𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 ∗𝐶𝐻𝐴𝑅𝐴𝐶𝑇𝐸𝑅𝐼𝑆𝑇𝐼𝐶 )+ 𝑋𝛽         (Eq. 2)  
Here, SSB calories purchased , WARNING, and 𝑋 are as defined previously and 
CHARACTERISTIC is the moderator variable (e.g., an indicator for low educational 
attainment). Moderation is present if 𝛽3 is statistically significant . We will probe significant 
interactions by [CONTACT_829794] t of health warnings on SSB calories purchased at 
different levels of the moderating variable.   
Analysis of the secondary outcomes. We will use different analytic approaches to assess 
whether secondary outcomes differ by [CONTACT_159344], depending on the level of measurement of the 
secondary outcome (i.e., continuous, count, or dichotomous).  
The following secondary outcomes are continuous will be assessed using OLS 
regression:  
• Number of calories purchased from all foods and beverages  
• Mean intentions to limit co nsumption of beverages with added sugar  
• Mean intentions to limit consumption of specific sugar -sweetened beverages  
• Mean attention to trial labels  
Impact of Sugar -Sweetened Beverage Health Warnings, NCT #03511937   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  23 
• Mean emotional reactions to trial labels  
• Mean cognitive elaboration  
• Social interactions about the labels  
• Mean perceptions of added sugar content in specific sugar -sweetened beverages  
• Mean attitudes toward consuming specific sugar -sweetened beverages  
• Mean product attitudes toward specific sugar -sweetened beverages  
• Mean outcome expectations regarding consumption of beverages with added sugar  
These regressions will take the general form of:  
𝑌= 𝛽0+  𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 + 𝑋𝛽       (Eq. 3)  
Here, WARNING and 𝑋 are as defined previously and Y is the continuous secondary outcome. 
As above, the effect estimates are given  by [CONTACT_829795] ( 𝛽1). This coefficient 
gives the average difference in (adjusted) means between the treatment arm and the control arm; 
it is interpreted as the impact of SSB health warnings on the secondary outcome being examined.  
One of the secondary outcomes, number of SSBs purchased, is a count variable (i.e., 
takes on only nonnegative integer values) and is thus better evaluated with a count data model. 
To examine number of SSBs purchased, w e will begin by [CONTACT_6486] a Poisson regr ession:  
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 (𝑦|𝜆)= 𝑒−𝜆𝜆𝑦
𝑦!   for y=0,1,2      (Eq. 4)  
where  
𝜆=𝑒(𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 + 𝑋𝛽 )     (Eq. 5)  
WARNING is an indicator for treatment arm, 𝑋 is a vector of any unbalanced participant 
characteristics and 𝑦 is the observed number of SSBs pu rchased. Following the advice of 
Kennedy,[ADDRESS_1151463];[ADDRESS_1151464] of being in the health 
warning arm (vs. bei ng in the control arm) on the predicted number of SSBs purchased.  
Finally, the following secondary outcomes are dichotomous and will be assessed using 
logistic regression:  
Impact of Sugar -Sweetened Beverage Health Warnings, NCT #03511937   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  24 
• Purchase of a sugar -sweetened beverage  
• Noticing of the trial labels  
These regressio ns will take the general form of:  
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏 (𝑌=1|𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 ,𝑋)= 𝑒(𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 +𝑋𝛽)
1+𝑒(𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 +𝑋𝛽)    (Eq. 6)  
WARNING and 𝑋 are as defined previously, and Y is the dichotomous secondary outcome. For 
logistic regression results, we wi ll report the average differential effect of being in the health 
warning arm (vs. being in the control arm)  on the probability of the outcome occurring (i.e., 
probability the participant purchased  a sugar -sweetened beverage) , calculated using the method 
of recycled predictions.66 
Analysis of other o utcomes. We will use OLS regression to examine differences by [CONTACT_829796] (all of which are continuously measured):  
• Mean injunctive norms regarding consumption of beverages with added sugar  
• Perceived message effectiveness of trial label  
• Support for sugar -sweetened beverage health warning labels  
• Mean self -efficacy to limit consumption of beverages with added sugar  
• Mean response efficacy of limiting consumption of beverages with added sugar  
To examine these outc omes, we will fit linear regressions of the general form:  
𝑌= 𝛽0+  𝛽1𝑊𝐴𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺 + 𝑋𝛽       (Eq. 7)  
WARNING and 𝑋 are as defined previously and Y is the continuous other outcome. As above, 
the effect estimates are given by [CONTACT_829795] ( 𝛽1). This coefficient gives the 
average differ ence in (adjusted) means between the treatment arm and the control arm; it is 
interpreted as the impact of SSB health warnings on the outcome being examined.

9 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGMENT   
 Participant confidentiality will be protected throughout all phases of the research, 
including data collection, analysis, and publication of results. Other than to schedule participants 
for their study visit (for which contact [CONTACT_829797]), this study  does not  collect 
any identifying information .  All data (responses to survey questions, product selections made 
during the experiment) will be de -identified (i.e., will only be  attached to identification codes, 
and not to any identifiable information). The key linking identification codes and respondent 
information will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office  and on a secure, password -
protected computer/server.  The k ey will be destroyed after data collection is complete.  
 
[ADDRESS_1151469] pools 
at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill  (UNC)  and Duke University, printed flyers 
posted in campus and community venues and distributed in-person on UNC and  Duke campus es, 
and online advertisements on  sites such as  Craigslist and Facebook. Individuals who are 
interested in learning more about the study are invited to complete an online screening 
questionnaire . The screening questionnaire assesses the prospective participant ’s age, usua l SSB  
consumption (using the BEV -Q 15, a validated questionnaire57), and own and parental 
educational attainment. Eligible participants are  English -speaking adults at least  [ADDRESS_1151470] 12 ounces of SSBs per wee k.57 Eligible potential participants  will be 
invited to schedul e a time to participate. Ineligible participants will be thanked for their time.   
 
11 CONSENT PROCESS  
This study obtains informed consent separately for the pre -enrollment screening 
questionnaire (screening phase) and for the in -person study visit  (intervention phase) .  
For screening questionnaire, this study obtains informed consent via an online consent 
form with electronic agreement. The online consent form is presented to participants before they 
begin the online screening questionnaire . Partic ipants  are asked to  read the form and  indicate 
whether they agree to participate in the research. If they agree to participate, they select a button 
Impact of Sugar -Sweetened Beverage Health Warnings, NCT #03511937   
 
Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan Version 1.0, April 30, 2018  27 
labeled “I consent” and proceed with the survey. If they do not agree, the survey is ended and no 
informati on is collected.   
For the in -person study visit, this study obtains written informed consent. When 
participants arrive for their study visit, the experimenter (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained research assistant) 
escorts them to a private study room  in the lab suite . The participant is provided with a copy of 
the consent document. The experimenter reviews the consent document  with the participant and 
answers any questions the participant has . The document the general nature of the study, the 
risks and benefits of the study,  and the general procedures used.  After reviewing the document 
with the experimenter and asking any questions she may have, the participant indicates whether 
she agrees to participate. If the  participant agrees to participate, both she and the experimenter 
sign and date  a copy of the consent document . If the participant declines to participate, she is 
thanked and the study  visit is ended.  
The consent form for the in -person study visit uses incomplete disclosure. Specifically, 
the consent document gives  general information about the study purpose (i.e., “a study about 
how consumers make choices in a naturalistic store setting") but does not provide enough detail 
to reveal the main study objecti ve. Participants are given truthful information about the study 
procedures in general terms (i.e., that they will be asked to select items in a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_829783] a survey about their experience the store, attitudes and beliefs, and personal 
characteristics), including truthful information about the risks and benefits of participating in the 
study, but are not be fully informed about the study’s expected findings . After completing the 
study  visit, participants are provided with a “Debriefing” for m that provides details about the  
nature and purpose of the study. They are also given the opportunity to ask any questions they 
have about the study.

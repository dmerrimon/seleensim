Confidential and Proprietary 7 Methodology:   
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study in 
post-menopausal women in which  the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ACER-801 at different doses is 
evaluated and  the efficacy of ACER -801 ( 50 mg twice daily [BID], 100 mg BID, and 200 mg BID ) 
will be compared  to placebo in approximately 40 to 56 subjects ( 10  to  14 subjects per treatment arm).  
Subjects will enter a Screening P eriod to determine eligibility. Subjects will be required to complete 
hot flash diaries for 2 weeks prior to randomization. Eligible subjects will be admitted to a Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU) on Day - 1 and remain in the clinic from Day -1 until discharge on Day 16 after 
completion of treatment and  all study assessments or upon withdrawal from the study. The study 
includes a 14- day safety follow -up assessment  (Day 28 ).  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to ACER -801 per one of the following dosing schedules 
prior to dosing: 
• 50 mg BID,  
• 100 mg BID,  
• 200 mg BID , or  
• Placebo administered orally for 14 consecutive days (28 doses).   
Blood samples for PK (plasma)  assessment will be collected for concentrations of ACER -801 and its 
metabolite at predose, 0.5 , 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 , 2.5, 3.0 , 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0 (prior to evening dose), and 
15.[ADDRESS_160619] morning dose on Day 1 and Day 14, as well as predose (prior to morning dose) on Day 2 
and Day 7. Plasma samples will also be collected 24 hrs  (Day 15 ) and 48 hrs (Day 16) after the 
morning dose on Day 14 . 
Throughout the duration of the study (Day 1 through Day 16), subjects will be required to record the 
frequency and severity of hot flashes in a subject diary (continuous hot flash  diary) . 
Electrocardiographs using the Mortara Surveyor will be collected on Day -1, Day 1, and Day 14.  
During the study, subjects will be closely monitored for safety including assessments of AEs, 12- lead 
ECGs, atrial oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry, vital signs (sitting and standing blood pr essure 
(BP), heart rate, oral body temperature, and respir atory  rate), clinical labs , and physical examinations.

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics: 
All blood samples for PK analysis will be anal yzed by a central bioanalytical laboratory. Instructions for 
collection, processing, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_141502]. 
Safety:  
Subjects will be monitored throughout confinement and during the 2-week follow-up period for adverse 
reactions to the study treatments and/or procedures. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902] (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs); vital signs; concomitant medications; physical examinations; ECGs; and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis). Ongoing AEs will 
be monitored (telephone call) until resolution or for [ADDRESS_160630]. Abnormal lab findings will 
be closely monitored by [CONTACT_141518]. All safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_141519].  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations:  
• The PK Population includes all randomized subjects who have evaluable PK samples.  
• The Safety Population includes all randomized subjects receiving at least 1  dose of study treatment. 
• The Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) Population includes all randomized subjects who receive 
study treatment with baseline and at least one post- baseline efficacy measurements.  
• The Per -Protocol population includes all randomized subjects with baseline and efficacy 
measurement endpoint visits without any major protocol deviations that would have an impact on 
the efficacy measurements.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: 
Noncompartmental analysis (NCA) will be performed for the plasma concentrations of ACER-801 and its 
metabolite. Summary statistics for the PK parameters ( Cmax, tmax, AUC last, AUC inf, AUC τ, Accumulation 
Ratio for C max [AR Cmax ], Accumulation Ratio for AUC [AR AUC ], Metabolite Ratio of C max [MR Cmax ], 
Metabolite Ratio of AUC [MR AUC ], t1/2 of ACER -801 and its metabolite) will be determined for ACER -801 
and its metabolite for the different dosing groups. 
Safety Analyses:  
All AEs /SAEs  will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities to 
assign system organ class and preferred term classification, based on the original terms entered on the electronic case report form. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term, relationship to stu dy treatment, and severity for each study treatment. All AEs, including AEs that lead 
to premature discontinuation from the study and from study treatment SAEs, will be recorded. 
All other safety measures including laboratory tests, vital signs, concomitant medication, medical history, 
physical examination, and ECG data will also be summarized descriptively (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Laboratory tests will also be summarized by [CONTACT_141520] e and listed by [CONTACT_141521].  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most recent version of World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
The secondary endpoints are the change in frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms and hot flash 
severity score at Week 1 and Week 2 relative to baseline.

Confidential and Proprietary 20 2 INTRODUCTION 
Acer acquired the rights to osanetant (SR142801) , a selective non -peptide neurokinin 3 receptor 
(NK3R)  antagonist, from [COMPANY_011] on December 2018 and has since renamed the compound 
ACER -801. ACER-801 is being investigated for the prevention/treatment of 
moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in patients with medically or surgically induced 
VMS  (iVMS).  
The efficacy and safety of AC ER-801 in subjects with i VMS has not been evaluated  to date. 
Osanetant  (SR142801) has been studied in a total of 23 completed clinical studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_141522] 5 mg to 1000 mg in healthy subjects and 50 mg  to 
200 mg onc e daily ( QD) in patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, Parkinson’s 
disease, panic disorder, and asthma. In these studies, osanetant was found to be well tolerated, with minimal safety issues.  
2.1 Background 
Neurokinin B (NKB) belongs to a group of neuropeptides, called tachykinins or neurokinins (NKs), that includes substance-P (SP), and neurokinin A (NKA). The biological effects of tachykinins are mediated through specific receptors denoted NK1, NK2, and NK3. NKB is the preferred endogenous ligand of tachykinin NK3 receptors. The tachykinin NK3 receptors (NK3R) are located primarily in the brain, while a few receptors are also present in the peripheral nervous system. The NK receptor pathway in the hypothalamus, including NK3, has been  shown to play a role in the etiology of VMS ( Prague 2017; Skorupskaite, 2018).  
VMS are generally defined as hot  flashes, flushing and night sweats that most often occur in 
women entering or in menopause. VMS are causally related to decreased estradiol concentrations mainly in the systemic circulation and subsequently also in the hypothalamic temperature regulating center. The lack of estrogens alters neurotransmitter activity, especially in the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways. Because sex steroids act as potent neuromodulators, the substitution of ovarian steroids by [CONTACT_141523] (HRT) is curr ently the most 
effective treatment option for VMS.  
Clinical stud ies with a dual NK1/NK3 antagonist (NT -814) and selective NK3 antagonists 
(fezolinet ant and MLE4901  [pavinetant]) in  menopausal women  significantly 
reduced  VMS  (Trower, 2020; Fraser , 2020; Santoro, 2020, Prague, 2017) . Based on the 
demonstrated role of the NK pathway in the etiology of VMS, it is hypothesized that administration of the NK3 receptor antagonist, ACER‑801, will result in similar findings by [CONTACT_141524].  
While VMS associated with menopause can often be treated with HRT, there are subjects  who 
experience VMS who are not in menopause and in whom HRT  is not the preferred or acceptable 
treatment.  VMS  can be induced (iVMS)  with the use of hormonal cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_141504]. Under these situations, VMS can appear immediately and be severe and,  in 
many instances, HRT therapy is not the preferred treatment.   
ACER -[ADDRESS_160637] been conducted with ACER-801 in subjects with iVMS.  
Safety data are summarized for completed clinical studies conducted with osanetant by [CONTACT_13225]. 
These studies were conducted in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, Parkinson’s disease, panic disorder, and asthma.  
Osanetant was  evaluated in 23 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. In single- and repeat -dose 
Phase 1 studies, approximately 400 subjects were exposed to doses ranging from 5 mg  to 
1000 mg in single dose studies and from 5 mg to 1000 mg (500 mg twice daily [ BID]) in 
repeat -dose studies in which subjects received osanetant for up to 21 days.  
In the 7 completed Phase 2 studies, a total of 821 patients were exposed to  osanetant, including 
patients with depression (up to 200 mg QD for 6 weeks), patients with panic disorder (200 mg 
QD for 4 weeks),  patients with schizophrenia (200 mg QD for 16 weeks), patients with asthma 
(200 mg QD for 6 weeks), and patients with Parkinson’s disease (100 or 200 mg QD for 9 days).  
Data from these studies demonstrated no major safety conce rns after single -dose and repeat -dose 
administration up to [ADDRESS_160638] abnormalities or weight loss, as noted in the toxicology studies. 
The incidence of adverse events ( AEs) was similar in the  osanetant  and placebo groups in 
completed Phase 1 and  2 trials. In patients, the serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported in 
the osanetant  group were mainly related to the condition being treated. Adverse events most 
frequently reported in osanetant -treated patients were headache, nausea, dyspepsia, insomnia, 
dizziness , and abdominal pain. These incidences were comparable in the osanetant  and placebo 
groups.  Additional details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.[ADDRESS_160639] 
A 200 mg BID dose was chosen as the maximum dose based on previous studies in healthy 
subjects where a 400 mg QD dose up to 21 days was shown to be safe. The subjects in this study 
will be healthy with no outstanding medical issues who present with moderate to severe VMS.

Day 15 and Day 16: 24 hrs and 48 hrs  after the morning dose on Day 14   
Plasma samples will be stored at approximately - 80°C for PK analyses for up to [ADDRESS_160684] VMS , including NTA, in a continuous hot flash diary  during the S creening 
Period  (2 weeks prior to Day - 1) to assess eligibility . During confinement subjects will record 
VMS using a continuous hot flash diary. A description of the methods for VMS assessments is 
described in Sections 10.1 and 10.2.  
10.1 Continuous Hot Flash Diary 
During the 2 weeks prior to randomization, subjects will be asked  to complete the continuous hot 
flash diary  (during the day and at night). Subjects also will be required to record daily bedtime 
and morning wake up time . This will require recording the occurrence and severity of the hot 
flash ( on a scale from 1 to 3).

 Confidential and Proprietary  42 11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Subjects will be monitored throughout confinement for adverse reaction s to the study treatments 
and/or procedures. Safety will be assessed by  [CONTACT_141537]/serious Aes (SAEs); vital signs; 
concomitant medications; physical examinations;  ECGs ; and clinical  laboratory tests . 
All A es, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by [CONTACT_423], noted from laboratory 
findings, or identified by [CONTACT_11174], will be recorded from the time of check -in until the 
subject completes the EOS  assessments. Recording Ae s/SAEs in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system is the method for reporting Ae s/SAEs. All  Aes/SAEs will be  recorded in the EDC.  
11.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.1.1 Definitions of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medi cal occurrence associated with the use of the 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered related to investigational product. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with any use of the investigational product, without any judgment about causality and irrespective of route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Adverse event s include but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or 
frequency of condition(s) present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary 
illness; (3)  intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction. 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without leading the subject or asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. The diagnosis and not the individual signs/symptoms should be documented as the AE. For example, if the underlying disease process is a stroke, it would not be appropriate to record the AE by [CONTACT_141538] “sudden numbness, dizziness, and difficulty speaking” . The AE medical term of 
“stroke or cerebrovascular accident” should be recorded as it more accurately describes the AE.  
All Aes must be graded for severity (i.e., intensity) using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 5.0. The i nvestigator will determine the severity of each AE 
and will record it on the AE eCRF, using the categories defined in Table 3 . It should be noted 
that the term “severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious”. The assessment of severity is made regardless of investigational product relationship or of the seriousness of the AE. When reporting Aes, reference should be made to the CTCAE manual for guidance on appropriate grading.

Grade  Clinical Description of Severity  
1 = Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, or intervention not 
indicated.  
2 = Moderate Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; or limiting age -appropriate instrumental 
activities of daily livinga 
3 = Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599], disabling, or limiting self -care activities of daily livingb 
4 = Life threatening  Life-threatening consequences. Urgent intervention indicated.  
5 = Death  Death related to AE.  
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Self-care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications , and not 
bedridden.  
The investigator will document their  opi[INVESTIGATOR_141506] 4 . An AE for which there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that the investigational product caused the AE i s otherwise referred to as 
suspected adverse reaction. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the investigational product and the AE. 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“definite ”, “probable ”, or “possible”, the event will be considered to be related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
Table [ADDRESS_160685] level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_141507], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposur e. 
Probable  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_141507]; and that could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.  
Possible  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational 
product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; but 
that could readily be produced by a number of other factors.  
Unlikely  An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that does not follow a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; and that could reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that  does not meet the above criteria.  
11.1.2 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
A TEAE is any event not present before administration of study drug or any event that was 
already present but worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Event  An AE  is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Acer , it results in any 
of the following outcomes:

Reporting of SAEs to the i nstitutional r eview board ( IRB) will be conducted in accordance with 
the SOPs  and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation must be provided to Acer or the Acer 
designee showing that the IRB was properly notified. 
All SAEs must be reported to Acer . SAEs are reported by [CONTACT_141540]. Entering the SAE data into the EDC system will automatically notify Acer 
of the event. If an SAE occurs in a subject during the study, in the event the EDC system is

should be provided at the time of the initial report:  
• Subject number 
• Even t term  
• At least 1 criterion classifying the event as serious 
• Name [CONTACT_22168] 
• Causal relationship to the investigational product 
The i nvestigator will assess whether the event is causally related to the investigational product. 
Acer  will also assess whether the event is causally related to the investigational product, in 
addition to assessing the overall safety profile of the investigational product. Acer  will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agencies of expedited s afety reports that occur during the study within the 
time frames required by [CONTACT_22105].  
An SAE assessed with  a possible, probable, or definite causal relationship to the investigational 
product and unexpected according to the IB, is known as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  and will be expeditiously reported to regulatory authorities and investigators, 
as appropriate.  
Following the initial report, any additional information obtained by [CONTACT_141541]. Any supporting source documentation should be emailed to [EMAIL_2909] as soon as possible. 
The investigator is responsible for submitting information on expedited s afety r eports received 
from Acer to their local  IRB, as directed by [CONTACT_126259] -country requirements. 
Documentation of the submissions to IRBs must be retained in the appropriate study files. As

Open Label MNS  version  20220304  p. 2 of 11 OBJECTIVES  
Chronic tic disorders (CTD), including Tourette syndrome (TS), are associated with a substantially 
reduced quality of life [1]. Medication treatments are no more than 50 -60% effective in RCTs, and are 
often d iscontinued due to unacceptable side effects [2]. Behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_378383]  a specially trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] [3], but  weekly visits to psychologists are 
impractical for many Americans , especially in rural areas [4]. Patients strongly desire new treatment 
options [5]. 
In June, 2020, Stephen Jackson’s group at the University of Nottingham published a fascinating report 
in Current Biology  on a potential novel treatment for tics [6]. The radical new idea arose from 
observations associating movement inhibition with [ADDRESS_473904] 
showed that rhythmic 12 Hz peripheral stimulation of the m edian nerve evoked synchronous 
contralateral EEG activity over primary sensorimotor cortex, whereas arrhythmic stimulation at the 
same mean rate did not. As hypothesized, median nerve stimulation (MNS) at [ADDRESS_473905] 10  Hz MNS in 19 TS  patients, 
and demonstrated using blinded video ratings a significant reduction in tic number and severity 
during 1 -minute stimulation epochs vs 1 -minute no -stimulation epochs. They noted that in some 
participants, benefit lasted beyond the end of the stim ulation epoch [ personal correspondence ]. Videos 
accompanying the publication showed dramatic benefit during MNS in some subjects. Although t he 
authors appropriately noted the steps needed to generalize these results to clinical practice, news 
reports alrea dy have led a number of TS patients to contact [CONTACT_378387]. The 
Nottingham group has referred such inquiries from the U.S. to me as leader of our Wash.U. Tourette 
Association of America (TAA) Center of Excellence.   
Among the various questions  still to be answered is the question of whether such a device would be 
practical for use in the real world. In this study, we will supply  participants with a commercially 
available transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units to use for median  nerve 
stimulation as described in the Nottingham study. Participants will be told to use the device as much 
or as little as desired to see how such stimulation might be utilized in the real world.   
Here we propose  (a) to determine the real -world usage and  apparent utility of stimulation in people 
with chronic tics , and (b)  to determine momentary self -rated efficacy and side effects of stimulation. 
In addition, we will compare results from this study to those from the “Peripheral induction of 
inhibitory bra in circuits to treat Tourette’s: pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] ” study, from which participants will be drawn, in 
order to compare laboratory and real -world efficacy.  
Aim 1. Determine the real -world usage and apparent utility of stimulation in people with chronic 
tics.  Participan ts will be allowed to choose when and for how long to use the stimulation, thus 
reflecting how patients would use the stimulation in their daily lives outside of a research study .  
Aim 2. Determine momentary self -rated efficacy and side effects of stimulat ion, using surveys 
taken at the beginning and end of  stimulation  periods , as well as twice daily  when prompted .  
Aim 3. Compare results of this trial with those from “Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain 
 
Open Label MNS  version  20220304  p. 3 of 11 circuits to treat Tourette’s: pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] .” Participan ts in this study are drawn from completers of the 
“peripheral induction” blinded RCT , allowing for clear comparisons between the laboratory 
conditions of the first study and the real-world conditions of the second.  
Completion of these Aims  will provide practical information  that can inform a future , controlled  
clinical  trial of chronic MNS delivered by a portable device .  
STUDY DESIGN  
Overall study timeline  
The study will complete enrollment within [ADDRESS_473906]’s participation  
First we screen potential participants to ensure they meet criteria for study enrollment . All 
participants will be drawn from completers of the study “Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain 
circuits to treat Tourette’s: pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] ,” and we will draw much of the demographic and clinical 
information from the RCT. Participants will attend one session  (whenever possible, in person at the 
same visit as the final study visit for the RCT) , in which they will l earn how to use the device and 
have it set to appropriate settings. They will then take the device home to use for four weeks, during 
which time they will fill out brief surveys when ever they turn  the device on and off, as well as at two 
other points throu ghout the day. These surveys record tic intensity and frequency, as well as 
discomfort due to the device. Participants will also complete a more extensive survey at the 
conclusion of the study.  
Recruitment  
Participants will be recruited from completers of the study “Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain 
circuits to treat Tourette’s: pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].”  
First  visit 
1. We present an informed  consent document  to participants (to parents of potential child 
participants ) explaining the study, risks and benefits of participation and that participation is 
voluntary. The ICD will be provided online prior to the initial  visit.  Potential subjects will 
review the informed consent document with the investigator or designee and will have 
opportunity to resolve questions or concerns.  Adult participants will provide their own 
informed consent. For child participants, consent from one parent or guardian is sufficient, as 
the study is minimal risk. Children must assent to participate.  
2. All data from the “Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain circuits to treat Tourette’s: pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]”  
study will be imported for comparison with information collected during this study.  
3. If more than [ADDRESS_473907] recent administration of the  Adult Tic 
Questionnaire (ATQ)  [8,9] , participants will be asked to repeat it.  
 
4. Explain use of the TENS unit, including which settings may be changed by [CONTACT_378388].  
 
Open Label MNS  version  20220304  p. 4 of 11 5. Attach electrodes.  
6. Determine stimulation threshold (12 Hz, pulse width 200µs), starting at  0 and increasing  
slowly  until a twitch of the thumb is seen . 
7. Verify that the participant is able to set up an d turn on the device on their own.

SAMPLE SIZE  
N = 38 (study completers  of the “Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain circuits to treat Tourette’s: 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]” study , which was powered to have 32 study completers with up to 38 participants screened ) 
Power considerations  
As this study is an exploratory study to determine the viability of this type of therapy in the real 
world setting, the sample size was chosen for convenience to include only completers of the MNS 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  However, a sample size of 32 provides 75% power to detect improvement of −25% in tic 
severity or frequency ratings (one tailed). A change of −25% in YGTSS total tic scores is considered 
clinically meaningful [17]. 
INCLUSION CRITERIA  
Inclusion criteria for all participants :

Open Label MNS  version  20220304  p. 7 of 11 TREATMENTS AND DOSAGE  
TENS stimulation  
 The device (TENS -7000) was judged by [CONTACT_378395] “ Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator for pain relief ” category, 
501(k) premarket notification number K080661 .  
 [ADDRESS_473909] at the 
threshold for thumb movement to surface electrodes (conductive gel, 30 mm apart center -to-
center, anode distal) .  
 The participant will determine the current delivered, using an analog k nob on the TENS unit.  
We instruct them that we believe the s timulation has to cause thumb movement  in order to be 
effective  (based on the Nottin gham EEG results), so they will  likely  need to adjust the current 
delivered each time they turn it on , given exp ected fluctuations in actual current delivery with 
changes in electrode position or electrode -skin resistance throughout the day.   
 Participant can choose right or left median nerve (we will suggest their nondominant hand to 
minimize interference with daily  activities).  
 Participant will determine d uration and timing  of stimulation . 
ANALYSIS PLAN/APPROACH /METHODOLOGY  
Outcome measures  
The primary outcome measures are derived from the surveys administered online throughout the 
study period. Surveys completed when  the stimulator is turned on  will assess  the tic frequency and 
intensity  prior to stimulation . For surveys where the stimulator is currently on or was recently turned 
off, the tic frequency and intensity will be reported  in addition to discomfort and o verall symptom 
relief. The time of each survey will be recorded in order to determine how long the device was on and 
the relative timing of each survey. Analysis can begin for each participant after their final survey has 
been completed.  
Primary Outcome Me asures:  
1. Time spent using the device  (minutes per day and number of days  per week  used over four -week 
period)  
2. Do you expect to continue to use the stimulator ? (yes/no/maybe , at study conclusion ) 
3. Comparison of tic frequency  between “turning ON” and “turning OFF” survey s (scale of 0 -5) 
4. Comparison of tic intensity between “turning ON” and “turning OFF” survey s (scale of 0 -5) 
5. Mean  discomfort while using stimulator  (scale of 0 -3 adapted from the CGI -I Efficacy Index ) 
6. Relationship  to blind ed study results  (correlation of change in tic frequency  and intensity  during this 
study as in outcome measures [ADDRESS_473910] ).  
  
Secondary Outcome Measures:  
1. What was the overall impact of the stimulation on symptoms  throughout the study period ? (CGI -
Efficacy index)  
2. How much discomfort  did the stimulation cause  throughout the study period ? (CGI -Efficacy index)  
3. Average therapeutic effect while using stimulator  
4. Comparison of tic severity  prior to and at the end of the  study  
 
Open Label MNS  version  20220304  p. 8 of 11 5. Check whether reported symptom improvement across different stimulation sessions was influenced 
by [CONTACT_378396]  
6. Comparison of ti c frequency  between “more than 60 minutes after turning off stimulator” and “less 
than 60 minutes after turning off stimulator”  
7. Comparison of tic intensity between “more than 60 minutes after turning off stimulator” and “less than 
60 minutes after turning off stimulator”  
8. “How long do you think the improvement in your tics lasted after you turned off the device? ” 
9. Compare participants ’ perception of tic improvement from post -study survey to their results collected 
during the study  
10. Compare participants’ percep tion of length of tic improvement after turning off the stimulator from 
post -study survey to their results collected during the study  
11. Do certain participant characteristics predict who will be “responders”?  
12. Qualitative analysis of open -ended questions  
Data  analysis  
Data storage, sharing and management.  Survey  data , which will not contain PHI , will be collected 
and stored on Google Forms . This data will be shared on the Open Science Framework .  
Overall statistical approach.  To prevent “HARKing” (hypothesizing after results are known) [20], we 
have registered our hypotheses  and analysis strategy on OSF.io  prior to initiating enrollment . For 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], all statistical tests will be reported independently , with a warning about multiplicity 
of tests . However, we  limit the number of primary outcome measures.  
Aim 1  (determining real -world utility of stimulation ). Descriptive data regarding the duration of use 
of the device will be reported as the mean and standard deviation of minutes per day, as well as the 
mean number of days used per participant. Answers to the question, “if you had a free stimulator, 
would you continue to use it after the study finishes?” will be reported as percentages answering 
“yes,” “no,” and “maybe.” Additionally, a summary of common themes to the open -ended questions 
about the device will be reported.  
Aim 2  (determining momentary self -rated efficacy and side effects of stimulation ). Comparisons of tic 
frequency and intensity ratings immediately prior to and following use of the simulator will be 
reported as paired t -tests. A similar analysis will be completed for ratings of frequency and in tensity 
made less than 60 minutes after turning off the stimulator vs. more than 60 minutes after turning off 
the stimulator  (unpaired t tests) . Average discomfort and average therapeutic effect while using the 
stimulator will be reported descriptively as percentage of participants choosing each rating.  A similar 
analysis will be conducted on average discomfort and average therapeutic effect over the entire study 
period as reported  in the final survey. Additionally, the discomfort and therapeutic ratings co llected 
throughout the study will be compared with those taken at the end of the study. Participants ’ scores 
on the ATQ ( adult tic questionnaire ) and PUTS scale ( premonitory urge for tic scale ) before and after 
the study will be compared using the paired t -test. Participants’ responses to the question “ How long 
do you think the improvement in your tics lasted after you turned off the device? ” will be reported as 
percent of participants choosing each option , and these perceptions will be compared with their 
numerical ratings throughout the study. Finally, we will determine if certain factors have a significant 
impact on who is a “responder” to the device, as measured by [CONTACT_378397] a greater than 
25% reduction in tic frequency or intensity during stimulat ion. The factors to be examined include  
 
Open Label MNS  version  20220304  p. 9 of 11 age, sex, baseline YGTSS, complex tics  ever , phonic tics  ever , baseline ADHD  severity , and baseline 
OCD  severity . 
Aim 3 (Compare results of trial with those from “Peripheral induction of inhibitory brain circuits to 
treat Tourette’s: pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]” ). Both changes in tic frequency and tic intensity will be compared between the 
RCT and the open -label study using correlation analysis . The change observed in the RCT will be 
plotted on the x -axis, and the change observ ed in the open -label study will be plotted on the y -axis. A 
line of best fit will be generated to determine if there is a significant relationship between the two, 
and if so, in what direction it occurs.  
Additional analysis details . Outliers will be determ ined at the level of the individual variables before 
the main analyses . If the distribution clearly deviates from a normal distribution on visual inspection 
because of outlying values, after transformation if appropriate, we will use a nonparametric analys is. 
SAFETY MONITORING  
We anticipate no a dverse events other than possible mild, transient discomfort related to  the 
stimulation .  However, we will report any adverse events to the Institutional Review Board according 
to its regulations, including an annual  summary .   
No serious adverse events (SAEs) are expected. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_378385], life -
threatening events or deaths. If contrary to expectations any SAE occurs that the investigator 
considers possibly, probably or definitely relate d to participation in the study, we will confer with the 
IRB before continuing enrollment.

1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Multi -center, Double -blinded, Placebo -controlled Phase 3 Study 
of Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], Nivolumab Monotherapy, or Placebo in Combination with  
Trans -arterial ChemoEmbolization (TACE) in Patients with Intermediate -stage Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma (HCC)  
Short  Title:  Nivolumab  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143663] -stage Liver Cancer  
Study Phase:  3 
Rationale:  
Nivolumab is currently in development and has been registered in a variety of tumors. 
Development of nivolumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was initiated in 2012 with 
CA209040, which is a Phase 1/2 clinical trial  evaluating the safety and efficacy  of nivolumab in 
advanced HCC. Data from the dose -escalation and expansion cohorts of this study led to the 
approval  of nivolumab  for the second -line (2L) therapy  of advanced  HCC  patients  who progressed 
on or were intolerant to sorafenib.  
Combining immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action offers the possibility 
of an additive  to synergistic  response,  and therefore  represents  an attractive  therapeutic  option  that 
has proven  to be effective in  several  cancer  types.  In advanced  HCC,  data from  CA209040  shows 
promising results of the combination nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_188] 2L therapy, with durable 
antitumor activity  and an acceptable and manageable  safety  profile and led to the Food and Drug 
Administration accelerated approval of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143689]. These data provide 
support  for evaluation  of nivolumab  and nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143690]  (ie, 
intermediate -stage HCC).  
Chemoembolization  is recommended  and widely  used for the treatment  of intermediate -stage  HCC 
(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] Stage B), with conventional trans -arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) being  the most widely  practiced embolotherapy for HCC. However, 
TACE is considered a palliative treatment and variable degrees of liver function impairment are 
observed post -TACE. The most common adverse effects of TACE include signs of liver injury 
and hepatic  insufficiency.  Elevated  aminotransferases  and negative  changes  in liver function  tests 
are seen in almost  all patients.  The impact  of treatment  on liver function  is problematic,  particularly 
for patients who undergo repeated TACE sessions. The majority of patients with HCCs have 
underlying cirrhosis and preserving liver function is important. Physicians have to consider the 
risks of TACE and avoid adverse effects that will outweigh survival benefit. These have led to 
efforts to define when continuing TACE will be an ineffective therapeutic option.  
The palliative nature of TACE and the need for a safer alternative for better liver function 
preservation  has driven  efforts  to improve  outcomes  with TACE  in patients  with 
intermediate -stage  HCC.  Over  the past decade,  significant  effort  has been  focused  on clinical  trials

of loco -regional therapy with immunotherapy. The preliminary data from tremelimumab in 
combination with ablation and from nivolumab in combination with TACE indicate that the 
combinations are feasible and tolerable. The combination of TACE with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164]/or 
nivolumab  has the potential  to address  the need  for better  therapeutic  options  for 
intermediate -stage HCC, and support the further investigation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143691].  
 
 
Therefore,  a 
decision was made by [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb in September [ADDRESS_163503]-2021. Per Protocol Amendment 01, there are no formal 
hypotheses  or efficacy  objectives  for CA20974W.  Only  safety  assessments  will be conducted. 
Following  unblinding,  study  participants  who are currently  receiving  nivolumab  ± ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143692];  however,  placebo  infusions  will no 
longer be administered.  
Study Population:  
Male or female adults ( ≥ 18 years or age of majority) with histologically confirmed HCC who 
have intermediate -stage  HCC by  [CONTACT_143868],  have not previously received  TACE, and  whose 
tumor characteristics exceed the Beyond Milan and Up -to-7 (BMU7) criteria. Participants must 
not have extrahepatic spread (EHS), and disease characteristics must include no regional lymph 
node involvement, no portal vein thrombosis, and no macrovascular invasion (MVI).

 Objectives and Endpoints:  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, no analyses of efficacy, quality of life/patient -reported 
outcomes, healthcare resource utilization, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics, or 
immunogenicity  are planned.  Only  safety  assessments  will be conducted.  Previously  collected 
biomarker samples may be analyzed, but no further biomarker collections are planned with this 
amended protocol.  
 
Objective  Endpoint  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Arm A, 
Arm B, and Arm C in all treated participants.  • Incidence  of AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  AEs leading  to 
treatment discontinuation, and laboratory 
abnormalities in all treated participants.  
Abbreviations:  AE = adverse  event;  SAE  = serious  adverse  event.  
 
 
Overall  Design:  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, [ADDRESS_163504]-2021. Per Protocol Amendment 01, there are no formal hypotheses or efficacy 
objectives for CA20974W. Only safety assessments will be conducted. Following unblinding, 
study participants who are currently receiving nivolumab ± ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143693]; however, placebo infusions will no longer be 
administered.  
The study  will consist  of 3 periods:  Screening,  Treatment,  and Follow -up. A complete  list of study 
required procedures are provided within the Schedule of Activities section in the main protocol.  
After  signing  an informed  consent  form,  participants  who have  not previously  received  TACE  will 
be evaluated for eligibility. If participants are eligible for receiving TACE and meet other 
eligibility criteria, they  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio  to receive nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143694] (Arm A), nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143695] (Arm B), or nivolumab 
placebo and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143695] (Arm  C). Since TACE is the only recommended 
standard  of care in clinical  practice  guidelines  for the intended  population,  TACE  plus nivolumab 
placebo  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143696] a control.  Both  conventional  TACE  and 
TACE with drug -eluding beads (DEB -TACE) are acceptable treatment modalities in this study 
(see the TACE  Procedure  section  within  the main  protocol  for restrictions  on TACE  use) and first 
TACE will be administered 7 days (+ 3 days) after study drug administration. Stratification will 
occur by  [CONTACT_5078] -bilirubin  (ALBI) grade  (Grade  1 vs Grade  2), baseline alpha -fetoprotein (AFP)

 3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study  Rationale  
Nivolumab is currently in development and has been registered in a variety of 
tumors.1Development of nivolumab for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was initiated in 2012 
with CA209040,  which  is a Phase  1/2 clinical  trial evaluating  the safety  and efficacy  of nivolumab 
in advanced2Data  from  the dose-escalation  and expansion  cohorts  of this study  led to the approval 
of nivolumab for the second -line (2L) therapy of advanced HCC patients who progressed on or 
were intolerant to sorafenib.  
Combining immunotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action offers the possibility 
of an additive  to synergistic  response,  and therefore  represents  an attractive  therapeutic  option  that 
has proven  to be effective in several  cancer  types1In advanced  HCC,  data from  CA209040  shows 
promising results of the combination nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_188] 2L therapy, with durable 
antitumor activity  and an acceptable and manageable  safety  profile and led to the Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA)  accelerated  approval  of nivolumab  in combination  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143709].3 These data provide 
support  for evaluation  of nivolumab  and nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143690]  (ie, 
intermediate -stage HCC).  
3.1.1  Research Hypothesis  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
Treatment with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143710] -arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) will improve time to TACE progression (TTTP) and/or overall 
survival (OS) compared to TACE in participants with intermediate stage HCC.  
3.1.2  Changes Per Protocol Amendment 01 
 
 
Therefore,  a 
decision was made by [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb (BMS) in September [ADDRESS_163525]:  
• Enrollment  of new participants  was closed.  
• Participants  who signed  study  consent  prior  to this notification  and were  undergoing 
screening were permitted to be randomized to study treatment.  
• Participants  currently  on treatment  were  allowed  to continue  study  treatment.

 • For participants currently in survival follow -up, it is at the discretion of the investigator 
and participant whether to continue follow -up until Protocol Amendment 01 is approved 
by [CONTACT_143876] (IRBs)/Independent 
Ethics Committees (IECs) at the site.  
 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_163526] 
all participants and should be implemented when Protocol  Amendment 01 is implemented at  the 
site. 
Key changes  in Protocol  Amendment  01 include:  
• Details  of closure of  the study, with  provision for participants  currently  on treatment  or in 
the follow -up period to continue in the study  per the current protocol amendment.  
• The study  will be unblinded.  
• Removal  of placebo  infusions  for participants  in Arms  B and C. 
• Removal of pha rmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity (IMG), biomarker, and patient - 
reported outcome (PRO) assessments. Only safety assessments will be conducted . 
• Removal  of on-study  imaging  assessments.  Sites  should  continue  imaging  assessments  per 
local standard of care.  
• Removal  of study -related  efficacy  assessments.  Sites  should  continue  efficacy  assessments 
per local standard of care.  
• Align  dose modification  criteria  and immuno -oncology  agent  management  algorithms  with 
the current National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  
• Add the collection of severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) 
infection -related adverse events (AEs) and serious  adverse events (SAEs) to evaluate the 
impact  of SARS -CoV -2 on participant safety  and add coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID - 
19) vaccine information for study participants.  
• Incorporate country -specific information for [LOCATION_009], Czech Republic, and China; 
incorporate  additional  updates  to improve  alignment  across  protocol  sections  and/or  clarify 
expectations for assessments, sample collections, and treatment administration.  
 
Changes  instituted  in Protocol  Amendment  01 should  override  any existing  protocol  requirements 
in the event of any apparent discrepancies.  
Clinical  Protocol

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: [ADDRESS_163527] common cause of 
cancer -related death. There are more than 800,000 new cases a year and HCC causes 
approximately  700,000  to 800,000  deaths  annually.  Furthermore,  its incidence  and prevalence  are 
increasing  worldwide.  The disease  shows  wide  regional  variations  in incidence  rates  and etiology. 
HCC  is particularly  prevalent  in Asian  countries  relative  to Western  countries.  Over  80% of HCC 
cases occur in Africa and Asia. China alone accounts for more than 50% of cases worldwide.4,5 
Age-standardized  (world)  incidence  rates  in South -Eastern  to Eastern  Asia range  from  21.0 to 26.8 
per 100,000, distinctly higher than the rates in Northern Europe (EU) and North America, which 
range from 6.6  to 10.1 per 100,000. Age -standardized (world) mortality  rates are similarly much 
higher  in South  and North  Eastern  Asia (17.2  to 34.0 per 100,000)  than in Northern  EU and North 
America (3.1 to 4.4 per 100,000).6 
Virtually any cause of liver damage that leads to cirrhosis can predispose an individual to HCC. 
The main  risk factors  for primary  liver cancer  (PLC)  are chronic  infection  with hepatitis  B 
virus  (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), aflatoxin B1 -contaminated foodstuffs, heavy alcohol 
intake, obesity, and type  2 diabetes mellitus.7 Once cirrhosis is established, the annual incidence 
of HCC is 3% to 5% and one -third of these individuals will develop HCC over their lifetime.[ADDRESS_163528], in North America, 
EU, and Japan, HCV infection is the main risk factor, together with alcohol use.10 
Intermediate -stage HCC patients belong to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage B. 
The stage consists of patients with preserved liver function and performance status who are not 
eligible for curative treatments, such as surgery and liver transplantation. It includes a 
heterogeneous patient population that presents with a wide range of tumor extension and liver 
function (Child -Pugh compensated A5 cirrhosis to decompensated B9).11 
Chemoembolization  is recommended  for the treatment  of intermediate -stage  HCC  (BCLC 
Stage B).  Transcatheter  arterial  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143711] 1970s12 and include 
a variety of techniques (eg, TACE, bland embolization, trans -arterial embolization [TAE]). The 
use of TACE was adopted into practice guidelines based on 2 meta -analyses13,14 and 2 seminal 
placebo -controlled  randomized  clinical  trials  (RCTs)15,[ADDRESS_163529] global HCC observational study (GIDEON) suggests that nearly half of all HCC 
patients receive TACE at some timepoint in the course of the disease.17 Real-world data and 
clinical experience demonstrate TACE to be the method of choice for the treatment of 
intermediate -stage HCC, applied in about 50% to 60% of patients.18,19 
However, TACE is considered a palliative treatment. Significant tumor response is achieved in 
17-61.9%  in individuals  administered  TACE,  but TACE  often  fails to induce  complete  necrosis  of 
the lesion.  Even  in cases  where  complete  ablation  is achieved,  tumors  commonly  recur  post-TACE

environment  is exacerbated  by [CONTACT_143877]. This chronic inflammation, characterized by [CONTACT_143878],  may contribute  to HCC  carcinogenesis  and 
disease progression by [CONTACT_143879], which results in an 
inability to escalate a meaningful antitumor response.36,39 Indeed, immune changes reported in 
HCC, such  as tumor -associated  antigen -specific  CD8+  T-cell immune responses, T -cell infiltration 
after loco-regional  therapy,  T regulatory  cell (Treg)  intratumoral  accumulation,  and 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulation have been correlated with disease 
progression and poor survival.40,41,[ADDRESS_163531]  by [CONTACT_143880] -mediated signaling.38,43,44 
The administration  of CTLA -4 inhibitor  has been  demonstrated  to increase  antitumor  immunity  in 
a murine  HCC  model, with  a tumor rejection  rate of 90% and a curative  rate of 50% in metastatic 
HCC.45 Additionally,  the clinical  benefit  of anti-CTLA -4 as a single -agent  has been  demonstrated 
in a Phase 2, non -controlled, open -label, multicenter trial.46 In this trial, tremelimumab, a 
monoclonal  antibody  that blocks CTLA -4, was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously  
(IV) every  90 days in 20 participants  with HCV -associated  HCC  with Child -Pugh  Stage  A (57%) 
and Stage  B (43%)  who failed  traditional  HCC  therapy.  In terms  of antitumor  responses,  this study 
reported a partial response (PR) rate of 17.6%, a disease control rate (DCR) of 76.4%, a time to 
progression (TTP) of 6.48 months, and a median OS of 8.2 months. Regarding safety, 
tremelimumab  was generally  well tolerated,  with few participants  experiencing  Grade  3 disabling 
adverse events (AEs), being the most common side effects observed fatigue and anorexia, which 
occurred in almost one -half of participants. A remarkable rise in serum transaminases was 
observed after the first dose in more than half of the participants (Grade 3 or higher in 45% of 
cases), but with no other signs of liver dysfunction.  
Similar to the role of CTLA -[ADDRESS_163532] inhibition, the role of PD -1/PD -L1 pathway in HCC has 
been  investigated.  PD-1 expression  on effector  phase  cluster  of differentiation  (CD)  8-positive  (+) 
T cells is increased in patients with HCC compared to cirrhotic patients or healthy controls.47 
Indeed,  patients  with HCC  and higher  numbers  of tumor  infiltrating  and circulating  PD-1+, CD8+ 
T cells showed  earlier  and more  frequent  disease  progression  after hepatic  resection.  PD-L1 is also 
highly  expressed  on peritumoral  stromal  cells (Kupffer  cells,  liver sinusoidal  endothelial  
cells [LSECs],  and monocytes) as well as  cancer  cells, promoting a PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_163533] trial  evaluating the safety and efficacy of  an anti -PD-1 agent in 
advanced  HCC.  This Phase  1/2 study included  262 participants with unselected  PD-L1 tumors,

 including both treatment -naive and pretreated participants. Following confirmation of  safety and 
tolerability in the dose -escalation phase, all participants in the dose -expansion phase received IV 
nivolumab  3 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  (Q2W) until  disease  progression  or limiting toxicity. This trial 
showed  convincing  signs  of efficacy,  with objective  tumor  responses  ranging  from  15-20% in the 
escalation and expansion cohorts. Notably, responses were observed regardless of PD -L1 
expression and were similar across different etiologies, and both in sorafenib -naive and  
sorafenib -exposed participants. Remarkably,  responses were meaningful and durable (lasting for 
a median  of 17 months)  and the median  OS in the sorafenib -treated  group  was 15.6 months  in the 
expansion cohort, which compares favorably with sorafenib historical data (10.7 months)49 and 
with results  of the recently  approved  2L molecular -targeted  agents  (median  OS ranging  from  8.5 to 
10.6 months).50,51,52 Overall, nivolumab was generally well tolerated with a manageable safety 
profile.  Hepatic  toxicity,  consisting  primarily  of transaminase  elevations,  was generally  mild,  with 
Grade 3 or 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations 
observed in 7 (9%) and 7 (4%) of sorafenib -naive and pretreated participants, respectively; 
bilirubin  elevations were infrequent (7 participants overall)  and mostly mild, with  only 1 Grade 3 
or 4 elevation reported. In addition to nivolumab, other immune checkpoint inhibitors as single 
agents are being evaluated in HCC. Durvalumab (an anti -PD-L1 antibody) has shown clinical 
activity  in a small  Phase  1/2 study  (N = 40), with response  rates  of 10% and a median  OS of 
13.[ADDRESS_163534] recently, pembrolizumab (an anti -PD-1 antibody) has also

 Preclinical  data indicate  that the combination  of PD-1 and CTLA -4 receptor  blockade is  synergistic

together  rather  than sequentially.53 In some  instances,  combined  treatment  resulted  in 
tumor -free mice that exhibited long -lived tumor immunity when re -challenged with tumor 
cells.53 
• In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA -4 or PD -1 antibodies 
increased  the proportion  of CTLA -4 and PD-1-expressing  CD4/CD8  tumor -infiltrating 
T effector  cells,  and dual blockade  increased  tumor  infiltration  of T effector  cells and decreased 
intratumoral Tregs, as compared to either agent alone, suggesting a synergistic effect.[ADDRESS_163538] resulted in higher response rates and improved outcomes over monotherapy in a 
number of solid tumors.1 In HCC, both durvalumab and tremelimumab57 and nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]3 combinations were evaluated in Phase 1/2 clinical trials as 2L therapy in advanced 
HCC.  While  data are still limited,  preliminary  results  demonstrate  the antitumoral  activity  of these 
combinations, and show an acceptable safety profile, providing scientific rationale to further 
evaluate the role of dual checkpoint blockade in the treatment of advanced HCC.

3.2.4  Nivolumab  Mechanism  of Action  
Cancer immunotherapy  rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized  as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by [CONTACT_20397]. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immunosurveillance of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. 
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses.58,59,60 
Current immunotherapy  efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the immune system  to 
tumor cells and antigens by [CONTACT_143882].  T-cell stimulation  is a complex  process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negative co -stimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by  [CONTACT_941] T -cell receptor (TCR).61 Collectively, these signals govern 
the balance between T -cell activation and tolerance.  
PD-1 is a member  of the CD28  family  of T-cell co-stimulatory  receptors  that also includes  CD28, 
CTLA -4, inducible  T cell co-stimulator  (ICOS),  and B- and T-lymphocyte  attenuator  (BTLA).62

factors.  Thus,  PD-1 deficiency  or inhibition  is not accompanied  by a universal  loss of tolerance  to 
self-antigens.  
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558) is a human monoclonal antibody (HuMab; 
immunoglobulin  G4 [IgG4] -S228P)  that targets  the PD-1 CD279  cell surface  membrane  receptor. 
Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, PD -L1 and programmed death -ligand 2 (PD -L2), results in the 
downregulation of lymphocyte activation.  
In vitro,  nivolumab  binds  to PD-1 with high affinity  (half -maximal  effective  concentration  [EC50] 
0.39-2.62 nM) and inhibits the binding of PD -1 to its ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2 (half -maximal 
inhibitory  concentration  [IC50] ±  1 nM).  Nivolumab  binds  specifically  to PD-[ADDRESS_163540] by [CONTACT_102428] a reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and IFN -γ 
release  in the MLR.  Using  a cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  re-stimulation  assay  with human  peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs), the effect of nivolumab on antigen -specific recall response 
indicates  that nivolumab  augmented  IFN-γ secretion  from  CMV  specific  memory  T cells in a dose- 
dependent manner vs isotype -matched control. In vivo blockade of PD -1 by a murine analog of 
nivolumab  enhances  the anti-tumor  immune  response  and results  in tumor  rejection  in several  
immunocompetent  mouse  tumor  models  (MC38,  SA1/N,  and PAN02).64 
3.2.5  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143714] -4, an activation -induced T -cell surface molecule, is a member of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin  (Ig) superfamily  that competes  with CD28  for B7. CTLA -4 mediated  signals  are 
inhibitory  and turn off T cell-dependent  immune  responses.65 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (BMS -734016)  is a fully 
human  monoclonal  IgG1 κ that binds  to the CTLA -4 antigen  expressed  on a subset  of T cells from 
human  and nonhuman  primates.  The proposed  mechanism  of action  for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143715] -4 with B7 molecules  on antigen -presenting  cells,  with subsequent

3.2.6  Nivolumab  Monotherapy  for Hepatocellular  Carcinoma  
Nivolumab  is currently  being  evaluated  in 3 settings  for HCC  in BMS -sponsored  studies  for HCC 
(refer  to the nivolumab  Investigator’s  Brochure  [IB]1 for additional  details).  CA209040  is a Phase 
1/2 non -comparative study of nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143716])  in participants  with advanced  HCC  with or without  chronic  viral hepatitis.  For first- 
line (1L) advanced  HCC,  CA209459  is a Phase  3 randomized study  of nivolumab  vs sorafenib  as

 randomized,  double -blind  study  of adjuvant  nivolumab  vs placebo  for participants  with HCC  who 
are at high risk of recurrence after curative hepatic resection or ablation.  
CA209040 showed that monotherapy with nivolumab in participants with advanced HCC 
produced  durable  responses  and disease  stabilization,  irrespective  of HCC  etiology  and regardless 
of prior therapy with sorafenib. Updated data from a 16 -Nov-2017 database lock (minimum 
follow -up of 24 months) revealed a blinded independent central review (BICR) -confirmed 
objective response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_16622] (RECIST) v1.1 
of 14.3%  (95% confidence interval  [CI]: 9.2, 20.8) in the 154 sorafenib -treated (2L) participants 
who received  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  IV Q2W.  Responses  were  observed  across  participants  with both 
viral and non-viral HCC.  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_143717] -up, a median DOR was not yet reached (95% CI: 9.69 months, not 
applicable [NA]) with 9 of 22 (41%) participants having an ongoing response. OS in 2L 
participants is promising, with  a median OS of  15.15 months (95% CI: 13.04, 18.23). In addition 
to the clinical  benefit  observed  in 2L participants,  efficacy  data in sorafenib -naive  (1L) participants 
(n = 80) are even more compelling: ORR, 20% (95% CI: 11.9, 30.4) by [CONTACT_19377] -confirmed 
RECIST v1.1;  median  DOR,  not yet reached  (95%  CI: 11.1 months,  NA);  and median  OS, 
26.68 months (95% CI: 16.56, 35.48). Safety data support an acceptable and manageable safety 
profile (data on file).  
These data indicate that nivolumab monotherapy has clinically meaningful antitumor activity in 
patients with advanced HCC with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. The observed

Cohort  1 (0.1 mg/kg  nivolumab  + 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]),  3 out of 14 evaluable  participants  had an 
objective  response  by [CONTACT_143884]  (21%),  including  1 complete  response  (CR)  and 2 PRs. In Cohort  2 
(1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), 9  out of 17 (53%) evaluable participants had an

respectively, and at 24 months was 67.3% and 69.6%, respectively.  
The safety of nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143723]209016. 
Treatment -related  AEs were  seen in 88  of 94  participants  (94%),  including  43 of 47  (92%)  in 
N3 + I1 and 45 of 47 (96%)  in N1 + I3. The most  frequently  reported  drug-related  AEs in N3 + I1 
included fatigue  (66%), cough (53.2%), and arthralgia (51.1%), the majority of which were 
Grade  1-2. The most frequently reported drug -related AEs in N1 + I3 included fatigue (74.5%), 
nausea (55.3%), and diarrhea (53.2%). The majority were Grade 1 -2. 
Treatment -related  AEs leading  to discontinuation  (31.9%  vs 10.6%),  and treatment -related  serious 
adverse  events  (SAEs;  34% vs 23.4%)  occurred  more  commonly  in participants  in the N1 + I3 arm 
than in the N3 + I1 arm, respectively.3 
CA209012 was a multi -arm Phase 1b trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in 
participants with chemotherapy -naive advanced non -small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as either a 
monotherapy or in combination with other agents including ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], at different doses and 
schedules. The primary endpoint of the study was safety with secondary endpoints of ORR per 
RECIST  v1.1 and 24-week  progression -free survival  (PFS).  Participants  were  assigned  to receive 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q12W (n  = 38), nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W; n = 39) and nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (n  = 52). The 
confirmed  ORR  was 47% (N3 Q2W  + I1 Q12W),  39% (N3 Q2W  + I1 Q6W),  and 23% (N3 Q2W).  
The median DOR  was not  reached in any  of these  groups.  
The rate of treatment -related  AEs in the Q12W (82%) and Q6W (72%) arms were comparable to 
monotherapy  (72%).  In the study,  Grade  3 to 4 AEs 37%,  33%,  and 19% for the Q12W,  Q6W,  and 
nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment -related Grade 3 to 4 AEs led to 
discontinuation in 5% and 8% of participants in the Q12W and Q6W cohorts, respectively, and 
were  similar  to nivolumab  monotherapy.  There  were  no treatment -related  deaths.  The 
treatment -related  select  AEs in participants  administered  the optimized  dosing  schedule  (3 mg/kg 
of nivolumab Q2W plus 1 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] Q6W) were skin related (36%), gastrointestinal 
(23%),  endocrine  (20%),  and pulmonary  (5%)  and there  were  ≤ 5% treatment  related  Grade  3 and

3.2.8  Nivolumab Combined with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143725] 2L therapy for advanced 
HCC in CA209040, a Phase 1/2 non -comparative, multi -cohort study of nivolumab (alone or in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143726]) as 1L/2L treatment in participants with advanced 
HCC with or without chronic viral hepatitis and in CA2099DW, a Phase 3 randomized study of 
nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143727] 1L treatment in 
participants with advanced HCC.  
CA209040 was initially designed as a Phase 1 dose -escalation study to investigate the safety, 
immuno -regulatory activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of 
nivolumab monotherapy in advanced HCC. Dose escalation occurred in 3 parallel cohorts by 
[CONTACT_143885]  (uninfected, HBV -infected, and HCV -infected). Participants (n = 48) with histologically 
confirmed advanced HCC and Child -Pugh score ≤ 7, who previously failed or were intolerant  of 
sorafenib,  received  nivolumab  at doses  ranging  from  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  for up to 2 years. Following 
preliminary data showing responders in all cohorts, the study  was expanded to confirm  the safety 
and efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy in a diverse group of participants with advanced HCC.  
In this phase (EXP Cohort), 214 participants were enrolled in 4 parallel cohorts (uninfected 
sorafenib -naive/intolerant, uninfected sorafenib progressors, HCV -infected, and HBV -infected),  
and received  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  IV Q2W.3 Please  refer  to Section  3.2.6  (Nivolumab  Monotherapy 
for Hepatocellular Carcinoma) for information on the clinical activity and safety of nivolumab 
monotherapy in HCC.  
Once the safety  and efficacy  of nivolumab monotherapy  was established, the study  was amended 
to add a cohort aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143728] 2L therapy.  A total of 148 participants  with histologically  confirmed  advanced  HCC 
(87.8%  had vascular  invasion  [VI] or extrahepatic  spread  [EHS];  and 43.9%  had alpha -fetoprotein 
[AFP] ≥ 400 ng/mL) and Child -Pugh score ≤ 6, who had previously failed or were intolerant of 
sorafenib, were randomized to 1 of the following 3 dose arms:  
• Arm A (N1+I3  Q3W):  nivolumab  1 mg/kg  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3 mg/kg  Q3W  for 4 doses,  followed 
by [CONTACT_20382] 240 mg Q2W (n = 50)  
• Arm B (N3+I1  Q3W):  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg  Q3W  for 4 doses,  followed 
by [CONTACT_20382] 240 mg Q2W (n = 49)  
• Arm C (N3 QW2+I1  Q6W):  nivolumab  3 mg/kg  Q2W  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg  Q6W  (n = 49) 
 
Results  from  CA209040  (interim  analysis;  database  lock,  22-Mar-2019)3 show  that treatment  with 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143729], irrespective of HCC etiology. Overall, the confirmed ORR by [CONTACT_143886] (using RECIST v1.1 criteria) was 31.0%, with response rates fairly comparable, 
regardless  of dose arm (32%  for Arm A, 31% for Arm B, and 31% for Arm C). However,  a higher

 rate of CR was observed  with N1+I3  QW3 (4 [8%] CR  for Arm A, 3 [6%] CR  for Arm B, and no 
CR for Arm C). An additional 26.4% of participants had PR (24%, 24%, and 31% in Arm A, 
Arm B, and Arm C, respectively).  
Responses  were  meaningful  and durable  with a median  DOR  of 17.5 months  (range: 4.6, 30.5)  in 
Arm A, 22.2 months (range: 4.2, 29.9) in Arm B, and 16.6 months (range: 4.1, 32.0) in Arm  C. 
Of note, responses were observed across all HCC etiologies (overall ORR of 15.2%, 30.7%, and 
39.4% for uninfected [n = 33], HBV -infected [n = 75], and HCV -infected [n = 33], respectively) 
and regardless of dosing arm. Participants who received treatment with N1+I3 Q3W (Arm A) 
showed a more consistent response rate across etiological subgroups (30.8%, 32.1%, and 28.6% 
for uninfected [n = 13], HBV -infected [n = 28], and HCV -infected [n = 7]) but the small size of 
some subgroups in other treatment arms precludes drawing any definitive conclusion.  
With regards to OS, with a minimum follow -up of 28.0 months, participants treated with N1+I3 
Q3W  had longer  OS (22.80  months  [95%  CI: 9.4, N.A])  compared  to those  randomized  to Arm B 
(12.48 months [95% CI: 7.6, 16.4]) or Arm C (12.75 months [95% CI: 7.43, 33.0]), with 2 -year 
survival  rates  of 48.2%,  30.2%, and 42.3%,  respectively.  
The preliminary safety data from CA209040 (n = 146) indicate that nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143730], with a safety  profile similar to  the observed in other tumor types in 
terms of type of reported events; no new safety concerns were identified for nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. One death (reported in Arm A) was attributed to study drug by [CONTACT_10670] 
(pneumonitis, which occurred [ADDRESS_163547] dose of study drug). Overall, as previously 
reported in other tumor types, the frequency of treatment -related AEs for the combination 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143731]. By [CONTACT_143887], a 
higher  frequency  of treatment -related  AEs (any grade  or high grade)  were  reported  in 
Arm A (93.9%;  53.1%)  compared  to Arm B (69.4%;  28.6%)  and Arm C (79.2%;  31.0%).  
Similarly,  the frequency  of AEs leading  to discontinuation  was slightly  higher  in 
Arm A (n = 11;  22.0%)  relative  to Arm B (n = 3; 6.1%)  and Arm C (n = 1; 2.1%),  with 
diarrhea  (n = 2) and liver test abnormalities (n = 2) being the most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation.  Across  the [ADDRESS_163548]  (20.4%  of participants 
in the N1+I3 Q3W and N3+I1 Q3W arms, and 13.0% in the N3+I1 Q6W arm) and increased 
ALT (16.3%,  14.3%,  and 8.3%  of participants  in the N1+I3  Q3W,  N3+I1  Q3W,  and N3+I1  Q6W 
arms,  respectively)  were  observed.  These  AEs were  infrequently  associated  with treatment -related 
increased bilirubin (11.6% of participants across all arms; 6.1%, 0%, and 4.2%  of participants in 
Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C, respectively),  and infrequently  led to treatment 
discontinuation (n = 2), being most of them manageable with established algorithms.  
Therefore, data from CA209040 demonstrate that nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143732] a manageable safety profile.

 development of HCC. An increased quantity of circulating Tregs in patients with HCC is 
associated with  a high mortality  rate and reduced  survival.40 Spontaneous  regression  of untreated 
lesions has been reported after loco -regional treatment of liver tumors (“abscopal effect”). The 
latter  is attributed  to the induction  of antitumor  immunity  by [CONTACT_143888]-regional  therapy.71,72,[ADDRESS_163549] of TACE on immune function in 47  participants, 
significant increases in CD4+ T cells  and decreases in CD8+ T cells  were  seen post-TACE, with 
a significant  change  in the ratio of CD4+/CD8+  T cells from  1.03 ± 0.14 vs 1.29 ± 0.14 (p < 0.05). 
The percentage  of CD4+,  CD25+  Tregs  in CD4+  T cells and CD4+,  CD25 -high T cells post-TACE 
was reduced  from  11.12 ±  3.58%  prior  to TACE  to 7.58 ±  2.65%  following  TACE  (p < 0.05)  and 
from  3.34 ± 0.79%  prior  to TACE  to 2.11 ± 0.67%  following  TACE  (p < 0.05),  respectively.  This 
indicates  that the proportion  of Tregs  following  TACE  treatment  decreased  with a reduction  in its 
immunosuppressive function,[ADDRESS_163550]-TACE. In another study in 51 participants, CD4+ cells and CD4/CD8 ratio decreased but 
CD8+  cells increased  post-TACE  in the subset  of participants  treated  only with TACE  (p < 0.05). 
This, in turn, suggested that TACE lowered immunologic function to a certain extent.[ADDRESS_163551] the 
potential  to differentially alter and enhance tumor -specific antigen presentation. Therefore, there 
exists  a synergistic  potential  for immunotherapy  and TACE  and it will be of critical  importance  to

augmented by [CONTACT_143889].76 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data  on the Combination  of Loco -regional  Therapy  with Checkpoint 
Inhibitors  
Preliminary clinical data for loco -regional therapy in combination with checkpoint inhibitors 
demonstrates a good safety profile and promising efficacy. In a study to evaluate whether 
tremelimumab  could  be combined  safely  and feasibly  with TACE,  radiofrequency  ablation  (RFA), 
or chemoablation  in participants  with advanced  HCC,  no DLTs  were  encountered.  Of the 
19 evaluable  participants,  5 (26.3%  [95%  CI: 9.1, 51.2])  achieved  a confirmed  PR. Six- and 
12-month probabilities of  tumor PFS for this refractory  HCC population were 57.1% and 33.1%, 
respectively,   with  median  TTP of 7.4  months  (95%   CI: 4.7, 19.4).  Median  OS was 
12.3 months (95% CI: 9.3, 15.4). The authors concluded that tremelimumab in combination with 
tumor ablation is a potential new treatment for patients with advanced HCC and leads to the 
accumulation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells.77

3.3 Benefit/Risk  Assessment  
The current  standard  of care (SOC)  for intermediate -stage  HCC  patients,  unsuitable  for potentially 
curative therapy, is  loco-regional therapy with TACE.79,80,[ADDRESS_163558] -TACE. Thus,  TACE is considered a

Overall,  the safety  profile  of nivolumab monotherapy  as well as in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143737] 10 mg/kg.  Most  AEs were  low-grade  (Grade  1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high -grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.1 
The recently reported clinical trial CA209040 Cohort 4 characterized the safety and efficacy of 
different  doses  of nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143738].  The overall  frequency  of AEs (any Grade,  Grade  3-4) were  similar  in all 3 treatment 
arms. Frequencies of drug -related AEs (any Grade, Grade 3 -4) were numerically higher in the 
N1+I3 Q3W arm relative to the N3+I1 Q3W, and N3+I1 Q6W arms. The overall frequencies of 
SAEs were consistent between the N1+I3 Q3W, N3+I1 Q3W, and  N3+I1 Q6W arms, but a trend 
for higher  drug-related  SAEs  was seen in the N1+I3  Q3W  arm. The overall  frequencies  of 
all-causality  AEs leading  to discontinuation  and drug-related  AEs leading  to discontinuation  were 
also numerically  higher  in the N1+I3  Q3W  arm relative  to the N3+I1  Q3W  and N3+I1  Q6W  arms. 
The most frequent drug -related AEs across the 3 dose arms were in the skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (48 -61%), investigations (31 -49%), and GI disorders (35 -37%) system organ 
classes;  however,  these  infrequently  led to discontinuations  due to drug-related  AEs.  Drug -related 
AST/ALT increases were observed in 20.4%/16.3%, 20.4%/14.3%, and 12.5%/8.3%, in the 
N1+I3 Q3W, N3+I1 Q3W, and N3+I1 Q6W arms, respectively. However, drug -related  increases 
in bilirubin were typi[INVESTIGATOR_143739] 
6.1%/0%/4.2%,  respectively,  and were  all low-grade.  Drug -related  hepatic  discontinuations  within

Of particular interest in the context of HCC is the observed hepatic toxicity. Treatment -related 
AST,  ALT,  and bilirubin  elevations  were observed  at a slightly increased frequency  as compared 
to the nivolumab  program  overall,  but were  generally  mild,  manageable  with established  treatment

infusions will no longer be administered.  
The study  will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow -up. For a complete list of 
study required procedures, please see Section 2  (Schedule of Activities).  
After signing an informed consent form (ICF), participants who have not previously received 
TACE will be evaluated for eligibility. If participants are eligible for receiving TACE and meet 
other eligibility criteria, they will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143748] (Arm A), nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143695] (Arm B), or 
nivolumab placebo and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143695] (Arm  C). Since TACE is the only 
recommended SOC in clinical practice guidelines for the intended population, TACE plus

 5.1.1  Screening  Period  
The screening  assessments  are shown  in Table  2-1. 
• Screening procedures are to occur within [ADDRESS_163566] dose.  
• Screening  begins  by [CONTACT_143894]’s  initial  eligibility  and signing  of the ICF. 
• Participant  is enrolled  using  the interactive  response  technology  (IRT) system.  
• Participant is assessed for study eligibility according to the inclusion ( Section 6.1 ) and 
exclusion ( Section 6.2 ) criteria.  
• Sufficient,  recent  tumor  tissue  obtained  within  3 months  prior  to randomization from  a lesion 
from  an unresectable  primary  tumor  lesion  that has not been  previously  irradiated 
(formalin -fixed,  paraffin -embedded  [FFPE]  block  or minimum  of 20 slides,  obtained  from  core 
biopsy,  punch  biopsy,  excisional  biopsy,  or surgical  specimen)  will be submitted  to the central 
laboratory. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_143702]. If despi[INVESTIGATOR_143750], a minimum of [ADDRESS_163567] received any systemic 
anticancer therapy after the date that the submitted tumor tissue was obtained. Please see 
Appendix 9  for country -specific criteria for the collection of tumor tissue samples in China.  
• Images  must  be submitted  for BICR  to confirm  eligibility.  
• The Screening Period either ends with confirmation of full eligibility and randomization for 
the participant, or with the confirmation that the participant is a screen failure.  
• This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a 
pretreatment failure prior to randomization (ie, participant has not been randomized/has not 
been treated). If re -enrolled, the participant must be re -consented. A new participant 
identification number will be assigned by [CONTACT_143895] -enrollment (see Section 6.4.1  
[Retesting During Screening or Lead -in Period]).  
 
5.1.2  Treatment Period  
The on-treatment procedures  are shown  in Table  2-2. 
• The Treatment  Period  begins  with the randomization  call to the IRT system.  The participant  is 
randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms:  
− Arm A: Nivolumab  240 mg Q2W  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg  Q6W  plus TACE  
− Arm B: Nivolumab  240 mg Q2W  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143697]  Q6W  plus TACE  
− Arm C: Nivolumab  placebo Q2W  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143697]  Q6W  plus TACE  
Note:  The study  will be unblinded  per Protocol  Amendment  01. After  unblinding, 
participants in Arms B and C will no longer receive placebo.  
• Administration of  study  treatment must  begin  within  3 calendar  days after randomization.  
• First TACE  will be administered  7 days (+3 days)  after study  drug administration.  Participants 
will receive study treatment until progression as defined by [CONTACT_1697] (unless treatment 
beyond  progression  is permitted),  unacceptable  toxicity,  or consent  withdrawal  for a maximum 
duration of treatment of 2 years. See Section 5.1.4  (Treatment Beyond Progression).

5.4.2  Rationale  for TTTP  as a Dual  Primary  Endpoint  
Not applicable  per Protocol  Amendment  01. The following  information  refers  to the original 
study design.  
Long OS in the TACE setting necessitates the use of a dual primary endpoint for an earlier 
assessment of clinical benefit.  
TACE  treatment  affords  patients  with long survivals.  A 2016  meta -analysis  review  of conventional 
TACE in a large sample size of patients with HCC  reported  survivals in line with those from the 
seminal  RCTs.  Median  OS was 19.4 months  (95%  CI: 16.2,  22.6).95 A 2017  network  meta -analysis 
projected a similar median survival of 18.1  months  (95% CI: 15.6, 21.6) for conventional TACE 
and a reduction in the hazard of death in the range of 24%.96 These data are aligned with the 
expected median survival of 20 months quoted in the 2012 European Society for Medical 
Oncology and the European Society of Digestive Oncology (ESMO -ESDO) guidelines.[ADDRESS_163577] reported median OS values higher 
than 19.4 months,  ranging from 26.1  to 61 months.15,23,98,99,100,101,102 
The long OS poses  challenges  for demonstrating  OS in the intermediate -stage  TACE  setting.  This 
is not an uncommon challenge for earlier -stage cancer studies, given the relatively long survival

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 relative to later disease stages. The evaluation of OS in settings with long baseline survival 
commonly requires very long study durations and large numbers of participants.  
In addition, there has been an advent of new drug options for the treatment of advanced HCC; 
including atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, nivolumab in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], cabozantinib, lenvatinib,  nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, ramucirumab and  regorafenib. 
These options are now available for HCC patients (in clinical studies or in clinical practice) after 
they migrate  from  an intermediate  to an advanced  stage.  This raises  concerns  that efficacy  of drugs 
administered in conjunction with TACE, as measured by [CONTACT_70112], may be confounded by [CONTACT_143901], thereby [CONTACT_143902].[ADDRESS_163578] that both 
systemic and non -systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143752].23,26 
The situation for TACE is not dissimilar to the challenges faced by [CONTACT_143903] -stage cancer studies, 
where demonstration of OS is difficult given the relatively long OS relative to later stages  of the 
disease. In the adjuvant setting for early stage HCC, alternative endpoints, such as relapse -free 
survival (RFS) and disease -free survival (DFS), have become increasingly important surrogate 
endpoints  that have  been  broadly  used and accepted  by [CONTACT_143904].104,105,106,[ADDRESS_163579]  
the same relevance and carry fundamental issues.  
Treatment  with TACE  follows  a different  paradigm  for discontinuation  of treatment.  For systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], treatment is generally stopped when disease recurs or progresses. TACE treatment, 
however,  can continue in  the case of tumor  progression  (ie, in  cases  where  there  is regrowth  of an 
initially  responsive tumor or the appearance of a new lesion). In actual  clinical practice, repeated 
TACE sessions are felt to increase the efficacy of TACE. Patients commonly receive multiple 
TACE treatments.25,108,109,110,111,[ADDRESS_163580]  v1.1,  target  lesions  are designated 
at participant entry into a clinical study and a sum of the diameters for all target lesions are 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters then 
serves as the comparator for subsequent measurements. A CR is based on disappearance of all 
target  lesions.  A PR is based  on a ≥ 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters.[ADDRESS_163581] of patients (28.2%).114,[ADDRESS_163582] shown that palliative trans -arterial

 response soon after TACE (ie, CR or PR) is mainly attributable to the TACE treatment. An 
objective response post -TACE is the norm  and the highest quality  studies of  conventional  TACE 
show a clear trend of progressively improving ORRs over a [ADDRESS_163583].118,119 Even  in a setting  where  immunotherap y 
agents are administered as monotherapy, there are advocates for a change in the established 
paradigm of response assessment and reconsideration of conventional efficacy endpoints for 
monotherapy immuno -oncology (IO) studies.118,119,120,121,[ADDRESS_163584]  with OS. In the 
exploratory  analysis  of the brivanib  Phase  3 BRISK -TA study, the ORR was 48% in the brivanib 
group  and 42% in the placebo  group,  with an odds  ratio favoring  brivanib  (odds  ratio, 
1.28 [95% CI:  0.90,  1.83]).[ADDRESS_163585] 
showed no difference in participants treated with TACE + sorafenib vs TACE + placebo. The 
definition  of an endpoint  needs  to have  a biological  rationale  for its use and must  take into context 
the setting in  which it is  applied.  The RECIST  guidelines for solid tumors were developed in the 
context  of the ability  of anticancer  cytotoxic  agents  to generate  varying  degrees  of tumor  shrinkage 
and that a change in tumor burden was an important feature of the clinical evaluation of these 
drugs.[ADDRESS_163586] endpoints  (eg, OS) for [ADDRESS_163587]  categories  of reasons:  (1) technical  factors  in measuring  the 
surrogate  introduce  such uncertainty  that their association  with the hard endpoints  becomes  weak; 
and (2) factors  in the relationship  between  the surrogate,  hard endpoint,  and drug weakens  a direct  
causal link between the surrogate and the hard endpoint.123 The destructive effects of TACE, 
coupled with  continued TACE with  tumor  regrowth  or the appearance  of new lesions,  challenges 
the conventional approach to assessing ORR, TTP, and PFS.  
This study will utilize TTTP, which is based on the time to tumor progression. The elements of 
the TTTP endpoint take into consideration: (1) the impact of TACE on tumor lesions; and (2) its 
application in a clinical study that includes participants that can receive more than [ADDRESS_163588] of any of the following:  (1) A 20% increase  in dynamic

 tumor burden over baseline scan (see Section 9.1.1  [Imaging Assessment for the Study] for the 
operational  elements  of a dynamic  tumor  burden  assessment);  (2) development  of MVI;  
(3) development  of EHS;  and (4) death.  
TTTP has been retrospectively evaluated in 3 TACE datasets. Arizumi and colleagues evaluated 
592 Japanese participants treated with conventional TACE.124 Correlation analysis showed a 
moderate positive correlation between OS and TTTP for both B1 (R2 = 0.6563; p  = 0.0045) and 
B2 (R2 = 0.6433; p = 0.0052) substages. The authors concluded that TTTP showed a moderate 
correlation with OS after TACE therapy, where participants with short TTTP represented short 
OS, indicating  that TTTP  is a potential  alternative parameter  for benefit  analysis  of HCC  patients 
undergoing TACE. Izumoto and colleagues subsequently evaluated [ADDRESS_163589] correlation between 
TTTP and OS (r = 0.527; 95% CI:  0.416, 0.622; p < 0.001). The third evaluation was conducted 
on the placebo arm  of the brivanib TACE study.23 To evaluate whether TTTP could be used as a 
survival predictor, landmark analyses of TTTP and OS were conducted that showed that TTTP 
was correlated with  OS. Notable differences were seen in the probability of  survival at 2, 4, 6, 8, 
and 10 months  relative  to whether  or not participants  had reached  TTTP.  Participants  who did not 
reach  TTTP  at the specified  timepoints  had longer  survivals  than those  who had reached  TTTP.  In 
addition, participants who  took longer to progress  by [CONTACT_143905].  
A fourth  evaluation  is ongoing  in collaboration  with TARGET -HCC126 to assess  TTTP  in a 
real-world population. Preliminary  data indicate a median TTTP for BCLC Stage B of 366 days. 
A majority  (80.9%)  of the participants in the TARGET -HCC database achieved TTTP due  to an 
increase  in tumor  burden,  as defined  by [CONTACT_143906].  The study  was started  in Dec-[ADDRESS_163590] analysis of OS could be possible in another year.  
Improvement  in TTTP  may also lead  to a clinical  benefit  in these  participants,  as defined  by [CONTACT_143907]. 
If study  treatment leads to a delay in development of EHS/VI,  these participants do not progress 
to advanced stage and start subsequent 1L systemic  therapy. In addition, they may require fewer 
TACE procedures, which limits damage to the liver and may prevent hepatic decompensation. 
This could lead to prolongation in EFS, which is a key  secondary  endpoint of the study.  
In summary, TTTP differs from previous TACE -specific endpoints as it takes into consideration 
the impact  of the TACE  procedure  on tumor  lesions,  is an endpoint  based  on tumor  lesion  changes, 
is applicable to the population of intermediate -stage HCC that can be treated with a series of 
TACE,  and can potentially  reflect  the added  effect  of a systemic  agent.  It also differs  from  previous 
TACE -specific  endpoints  in that it has been  evaluated  in different  TACE  populations  and datasets. 
This is in contrast  to previous  TACE -specific  endpoints  that were  applied  in TACE  clinical  studies 
without prior evaluation of their relevance. Of note, the 3 evaluations presented used varying 
approaches to assess whether there is a correlation of TTTP with survival, and yet the results 
showed  similar  trends.  The data are of special  significance  in light of the absence  of data

 chosen  as a secondary  endpoint  in order  to support  extrapolation  of this study  with other  completed 
and ongoing studies using PFS in the intermediate stage HCC.  
5.4.6  Rationale  for Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143754] 240 mg (flat dose) Q2W and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W. The combination dosing 
and schedule was selected based on the overall benefit -risk observed in CA209040, a Phase 1/2 
study evaluating safety and efficacy of nivolumab, alone or in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143716], in participants with advanced HCC.3 
Exposure -response  (E-R) analysis  of nivolumab  monotherapy  across  dose ranges  of 1 mg/kg  to 10 
mg/kg revealed similar clinical activity regardless dose, while E -R analysis of  different doses of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285] (0.3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) in the Phase [ADDRESS_163594] demonstrated an increase in antitumoral activity by [CONTACT_143908][INVESTIGATOR_102334].1,82 The 
combination of dual checkpoint blockade with both of these agents administered together has 
demonstrated an efficacy advantage over either single agent alone.  
In HCC,  results  from  CA209040  demonstrate  antitumor  activity  of the combination  of nivolumab 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_188] 2L therapy in the advanced setting, with a manageable safety profile. In this 
trial, participants were  treated  with nivolumab in  combination  with either  high-dose (3 mg/kg)  or 
low-dose (1 mg/kg) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143755]. Efficacy outcomes were mostly similar 
between  the different  regimens;  however,  the nivolumab  3-mg/kg Q2W  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 -mg/kg 
Q6W  arm was associated  with the most  favorable  safety  profile.  Treatment -related  AEs leading  to 
discontinuation, treatment -related elevations in AST and ALT, and the incidence of hepatic 
immune -mediated adverse events (IMAEs) occurred less frequently in the nivolumab 3 -mg/kg 
Q2W and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 -mg/kg Q6W arm compared to the other [ADDRESS_163595] of the AEs were 
Grade  1-2 and manageable  with treatment  algorithms,  leading  to treatment  discontinuation  in 2 out 
of 49 participants  (~ 4%) randomized  to this arm; none  of the participants  discontinued  due to liver 
function  abnormalities  (AST/ALT  elevation).3 
A flat  nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W was selected for Arm A  and Arm  B in this trial, based on 
a less than 15% difference in exposures of nivolumab after 3 mg/kg and [ADDRESS_163596] that combination therapy with nivolumab 240 mg and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg may provide the most appropriate benefit -risk and support the further 
development of this combination in intermediate -stage HCC.

Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143756]  30-minute  infusion.69,[ADDRESS_163597] a burden on patients and treatment centers. Thus, establishing that 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143757] 30 -minute 
duration will diminish the burden, provided that there is no change in the safety profile.

Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Establishing that nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143758] a shorter infusion 
time (30 minutes) is still under investigation. Previous clinical studies have used a 60 -minute 
infusion duration for nivolumab and 90 -minute infusion duration for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 -3 mg/kg 
dosing for both). However, both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143759] 10 mg/kg with the same infusion duration with no safety concerns:  
• Nivolumab has been safely administered up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment periods, and 
infusion reactions, including high -grade hypersensitivity reactions, have been uncommon 
across  the nivolumab clinical program. In study  CA209010, a dose association was observed 
for infusion  site reactions  and hypersensitivity  reactions  (1.7%  at 0.3 mg/kg,  3.7%  at 2 mg/kg 
and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1 -2 and were manageable. An infusion 
duration  of 30 minutes  for 240 mg and 3 mg/kg  nivolumab  (30%  of the dose provided  at 
10 mg/kg) or for 480 mg of nivolumab (~ 60% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not 
expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg 
nivolumab dosing infused over a 60 -minute duration. The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
administered  as a 30-minute  infusion  was assessed  in CA209153  in participants  (n = 322) with 
previously  treated  advanced  NSCLC.  Overall,  there  were  no clinically  meaningful  differences 
in the frequency  of hypersensitivity/infusion -related  reactions  (of any cause  or 
treatment -related)  in participants  administered  nivolumab  over a 30-minute  infusion  compared 
with that reported for  participants with  the [ADDRESS_163598]  showed 
no substantive differences in the safety profile compared to nivolumab 3 mg/kg or 240 mg 
given IV over 60 minutes, further supporting that nivolumab 3 mg/kg or nivolumab 480 mg 
(flat dose) can be safely infused over 30 minutes.  
• Similarly, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In 
participants with advanced Stage II or Stage IV melanoma (CA184022), where ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143760] a dose of 10 mg/kg, on -study drug -related hypersensitivity events 
(Grade  1/2) were  reported  in 1 participant  (1.4%)  in the 0.3 mg/kg  group and  in 2 participants 
(2.8%) in the 10 mg/kg  group.  There  were  no drug-related  hypersensitivity  events  reported  in 
the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment groups, no Grade 3/4 drug -related  hypersensitivity 
events were reported and there were no reports of infusion reactions. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg 
monotherapy  has also been  safely  administered  as a 90-minute  infusion  in a large  Phase  3 study 
in prostate cancer (CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy for Stage III melanoma (CA184029), 
with infusion reactions occurring in participants. Administering 3 mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143761] -third of the 10 mg/kg dose, and thus, a shortened infusion

Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01, as enrollment has been stopped for the study. 
The following information refers to the original study design.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Region  
Differences in patient populations and clinical practice patterns in the different regions are well 
known  and can impact  OS outcomes.  The systematic  review  of the literature  on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143763]  (31.3  months  [95%  CI: 22.9,  39.8])  than in 
the West (18.3 months [95% CI: 13.7, 22.9]) or Asia -Pacific (15.6 months [95% CI: 13.7, 22.9]) 
regions (Japan vs West region, p = 0.007; Japan vs Asia -Pacific region, p  = 0.0007; West vs 
Asia-Pacific  regions:  p = 0.3632).[ADDRESS_163601]  of differing  HCC  patient  populations  and 
different  approaches  to clinical  practice  in the different  regions  is still important  to consider.  This 
study will therefore stratify by [CONTACT_11338].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Alpha -fetoprotein  
Higher  AFP levels  are related  to more  aggressive  cancer  phenotypes  and linked  with hepatic  cancer 
cells that have stem/progenitor features. Depending on the clinical setting, AFP cutoff levels of 
20, 200, 400, and 1000 ng/mL have been examined to assess the prognostic effect of AFP on 
long-term survival, mostly in a retrospective setting. A prospective propensity model study 
analyzed the prognostic ability of 4 different cutoffs of AFP in 2,579 unselected HCC patients. 
The study  showed  the independent predictive ability  of baseline serum AFP levels. Patients with 
baseline AFP levels ≥ 400 ng/mL had notably lower survivals than patients with lower values. 
The researchers  recommended  AFP cutoff  levels  of 20 and 400 ng/mL  as feasible  cutoffs  to predict  
long-term survival outcome in unselected patients.128 The lower cut -off of 20 ng/mL is the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) for AFP  and is more relevant to studies in early -stage HCC. Patients with 
intermediate -stage  disease  are more  likely  to have  elevated  AFP levels.  This study  will use a cutoff 
level of 400 ng/mL for stratification.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Albumin -bilirubin  Grade  
Assessment of liver function is particularly important in HCC trials because cirrhosis is a 
competing cause of death. The ALBI grade129 was developed to assess liver function in patients 
with HCC that involved serum bilirubin and albumin levels. Data from a global database of  
3,887 patients demonstrated that objective measures of liver dysfunction, as measured by [CONTACT_143909], influence survival in patients with HCC in the Japan, US/EU, and China cohorts. 
Patients in the US/EU cohort with an ALBI Grade 1 had a median survival of 24.5 months 
compared  to 14.7 months  for those  with ALBI  Grade  2 and 4.7 months  for those  with 
ALBI Grade  3. Similarly, patients with ALBI Grade 1 in the Japan and China cohorts had better 
median  survival  than those  with ALBI  Grade  2 and 3.130 These  data show  that ALBI  grade  can be 
used to stratify  patients with  HCC into 3 risk categories.  This study  will use  ALBI Grade  1 and 2 
as a stratification factor. Participants with Grade 3 ALBI are not eligible for TACE and therefore 
these patients are excluded.

 5.4.9  Rationale  for 2 Year  Duration  of Treatment  with Nivolumab  ± Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143764]. 
Clinical trials across different tumors types in the nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143765],  with a median  time to response  of 
2-[ADDRESS_163602]  that benefit can  be maintained  in the absence  of continued 
treatment. A retrospective pooled analysis of two melanoma studies suggests the majority of 
patients  who discontinue  nivolumab  and/or  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143766].[ADDRESS_163603] that 2 years of  PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment may be sufficient 
for long -term benefit. CA209003, a dose -escalation cohort expansion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivolumab in participants with previously treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 participants with NSCLC), specified a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. 
Among 16 participants with NSCLC who discontinued nivolumab after completing 2 years of 
treatment, 12 participants were alive > 5 years and remained progression -free without any 
subsequent  therapy.  In the CA209003  NSCLC  cohort,  the OS curve  begins  to plateau  after 2 years,  
with an OS rate of  25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.133 These survival outcomes are similar to 
Phase 3 studies in previously  treated NSCLC, in which nivolumab treatment was continued until 
progression or unacceptable toxicity (2 -year OS rates of 23% and 29%, and 3 -year OS rates of 
16-18% for squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, respectively).[ADDRESS_163604], a shorter duration of nivolumab of  only 1 year was associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously  treated patients with NSCLC, suggesting that treatment beyond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, participants with previously treated advanced NSCLC who 
completed  1 year of nivolumab  therapy  were  randomized  to either  continue  or stop treatment,  with 
the option of retreatment upon progression. Among 163 participants still on treatment at 1 year 
and without progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant 
improvement  in PFS compared  to those  who were  randomized  to stop treatment,  with median  PFS 
(post -randomization) not reached vs 10.3 months, respectively (HR, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.71). 
With a median follow -up of 14.[ADDRESS_163605] -randomization, there also was a trend for patients 
on continued  treatment  to live longer  (OS HR, 0.63 [95%  CI: 0.33,  1.20]).  Of note,  the PFS curves 
in both groups plateau approximately 1 year after randomization (ie, 2 years after treatment 
initiation),  suggesting  that there  may be minimal benefit in extending  treatment beyond a total  of 
[ADDRESS_163606]  that there is minimal, if any, benefit derived from  continuing IO 
treatment  beyond  2 years  in advanced  tumors.  Even  though  immunotherapy  is well tolerated,

5.5 Justification for Dose  
The doses of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143767].  
5.5.1  Nivolumab  Clinical  Pharmacology  Summary  
The PK of nivolumab were studied in participants over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, 
administered  as a single  dose or as multiple  doses  of nivolumab  every  2 or 3 weeks.  The geometric 
mean (coefficient of variation [%CV], %) CL was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume  of 
distribution  at steady  state (Vss)  was 8.0 L (30.4%),  and geometric  mean  elimination 
half-life (t1/2) was 26.7  days (101%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 
12 weeks  when  administered  at 3 mg/kg Q2W,  and systemic  accumulation was  approximately 
3-fold. The exposure  to nivolumab  increased  dose-proportionally  over the dose range  of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg  administered  Q2W.  The CL of nivolumab  increased  with increasing  body  weight.  The PPK 
analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of 
nivolumab:  age (29 to 87 years),  gender,  race,  baseline  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  and PD-L1. 
A PPK analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor 
type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment.  
Although  ECOG  performance  status,  baseline  glomerular  filtration  rate (GFR),  albumin,  and body 
weight  had an effect  on nivolumab  CL, the effect  was not clinically  meaningful.  When  nivolumab 
was administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the CL of nivolumab was increased by 24%, 
whereas there was no effect  on the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Additionally, PPK and E -R analyses have 
been performed to support use of 240 -mg Q2W  dosing in addition  to the 3 mg/kg  Q2W  regimen. 
Using  the PPK model,  exposure  of nivolumab  at a 240-mg flat dose was identical  to a dose of 
3 mg/kg for participants weighing 80 kg, which was the approximate median body weight in 
nivolumab clinical trials.

5.5.3  Justification for Dose of Nivolumab  
The nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W was selected based on clinical data and modeling and 
simulation approaches using population PK (PPK) and E -R analyses of data from studies in 
multiple  tumor  types  (melanoma,  NSCLC,  and RCC)  where  body  weight  normalized 
dosing  (mg/kg)  has been  used.  (See Section  5.4.6  [Rationale  for Nivolumab  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143780]] for additional clinical data in HCC for justification of the selected treatments.)  
PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with proportional exposure over a 
dose range  of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, and no differences in PK across ethnicities and tumor types were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance (CL) and volume of distribution were found to increase as the 
body  weight increases, but less than proportionally with increasing weight, indicating that mg/kg 
dosing represents an over -adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. The PPK 
model  previously  developed  using  data from  NSCLC  participants  has recently  been  updated,  using 
data from  1,544  participants  from  7 studies  investigating  nivolumab  in the treatment  of melanoma, 
NSCLC,  and RCC. In this dataset,  the median  (minimum  - maximum)  weight  was 
77 kg (35-160 kg), and thus,  an approximately  equivalent  dose of 3 mg/kg  for an [ADDRESS_163608]  relevant  summary  exposures 
of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, the PPK model  was used to  simulate nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and

 240 mg Q2W are predicted to be similar for all participants in reference to 80 -kg participants 
receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W.  
Nivolumab is safe and well tolerated up to a 10 mg/kg Q2W dose level. AEs have been broadly 
consistent  across  tumor  types  following  monotherapy  and have  not demonstrated  clear 
dose-response or E -R relationships. Additionally, the simulated median and 95th  prediction 
interval of  nivolumab summary  exposures across body  weight range (35 -160 kg) are predicted to 
be maintained  below the corresponding observed highest exposure experienced  in nivolumab  
(ie, 95th percentile following nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W from clinical study CA209003). Thus, 
while  participants  in the lower  body  weight  ranges  would  have  greater  exposures  than 
80-kg participants, the exposures are predicted to be within the range of observed exposures at 
doses  (up to 10 mg/kg  Q2W)  used in the nivolumab  clinical  program  and are not considered  to put 
participants at increased risk. For participants with greater body  weights, the simulated ranges of 
exposures are also not expected to affect efficacy, because the exposures predicted following 
administration  of a 240 mg Q2W  are on the flat part of the E-R curves  for previously  investigated 
tumors,  melanoma  and NSCLC.  Given  the similarity  of nivolumab  PK across  tumor  types  and the 
similar  exposures  predicted  following  administration  of 240-mg flat dose compared  to 3 mg/kg,  it 
is expected  that the safety  and efficacy  profile  of 240 mg  nivolumab  will be similar  to that of 
3 mg/kg nivolumab. Thus, nivolumab 240 mg Q2W over 30 minutes will be used in this study.  
5.5.4  Justification for Dose of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143781]209040 cohort 4, which evaluated 3 dosing schedules of 
nivolumab  + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (N1+I3  Q3W,  N3+I1  Q3W, and  N3+I1  Q6W)  in advanced  HCC, shows 
a lower  rate of drug-related  AEs,  SAEs, and  AEs leading  to discontinuation  with the N3+I1  Q6W 
dose compared  with the N1+I3 Q3W  dose.3 The response  rate and DOR  are similar  for all dosing 
arms. Nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W dosing is being chosen for this 
study  to be combined  with TACE  as it has a lower  rate of AEs  with comparable  efficacy.  Please

Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of  the study 
participants and that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that participants fully 
meet all eligibility criteria.  
6.3 Lifestyle  Restrictions  
Not applicable.  No restrictions  are required.  
6.4 Screen  Failures  
Screen  failures  are defined  as participants  who consent  to participate  in the clinical  study  but who 
are not subsequently randomized in the study/included in the analysis population. A minimal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements, as applicable, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal 
information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and 
any serious AEs.  
6.4.1  Retesting  During  Screening  or Lead -In Period  
This study permits the re -enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a 
pretreatment  failure  (ie, participant  has not been  randomized  / has not been  treated).  If re-enrolled, 
the participant must be re -consented  
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments within any single Screening or  
Lead -in Period  will be permitted  (in addition  to any parameters  that require  a confirmatory  value).  
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by [CONTACT_35853], as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state.  
Laboratory parameters and/or assessments that are included in Table 2 -1 (Screening Procedural 
Outline) may  be repeated  in an effort  to find all possible  well-qualified  participants.  Consultation 
with the Medical Monitor may be needed to identify whether repeat testing of any particular 
parameter is clinically relevant.  
7 TREATMENT  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study 
randomization or treatment allocation.

necessary  to re-calculate  subsequent  doses  if the participant’s  weight  is within  10% of the baseline 
weight  or the weight  used to calculate  the previous  dose.  All doses  should  be rounded  to the nearest 
milligram per institutional standard.  
After  the first cycle,  subsequent  dosing  should  be based  on the actual  date of administration  of the 
previous  cycle.  Participants  may be dosed  no less than [ADDRESS_163616] resolved to baseline or 
Grade 1 before study treatment is resumed.  
When study treatments (nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143785]) are to be 
administered  on the same  day, nivolumab  is to be administered  first. Nivolumab  infusion  must  be 
promptly followed by a saline flush of diluent to clear the line of nivolumab before starting the

carefully monitored for infusion reactions during administration. If an acute infusion reaction is 
noted, participants should be managed according to Section 7.4.2  (Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143787]).  
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of study treatment allowed. Doses of nivolumab 
and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143788], delayed, or discontinued, 
depending  on how well the participant tolerates  the treatment.  Dosing  visits  are not skipped,  only 
delayed. If dosing is delayed, all study treatments planned to be administered on the same day 
should  be delayed  at the same  time.  If dosing  is resumed  after a delay,  all study  treatments  planned 
must  be resumed  on the same  day. For more  details,  see Section  7.4.2  (Nivolumab  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143787]) and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Criteria for Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143789]).

7.2 Method  of Treatment  Assignment  
CA20974W is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial. Participants with 
intermediate -stage  HCC  whose  tumor  characteristics  exceed  the BMU7  criteria  will be eligible  to 
participate.  All participants  will be randomized  using  an IRT system.  Before  the study  is initiated, 
each user will receive log -in information and directions on how to access the IRT.  
After  the participant’s  initial  eligibility  is established  and informed  consent  has been  obtained,  the 
participant  must  be enrolled  into the study  by [CONTACT_143919]  a participant  number.  Every 
participant  that signs the ICF must be assigned a participant  number in  IRT. Specific instructions 
for using  IRT will be provided  to the investigational  site in a separate  document.  The Investigator 
or other delegated and trained site personnel will register the participant for enrollment by 
[CONTACT_104126].  
The following  information  is required  for enrollment:  
• Date that informed consent was obtained  
• Date  of birth,  where  applicable  by [CONTACT_56819]  
• Gender at birth 
 
Once  enrolled  in IRT, participants  who have  met all eligibility  criteria  will be ready  to be 
randomized through IRT. The following information is required for participant randomization:  
• Participant  number  
• Date  of birth,  where  applicable  per local  regulations  
• ALBI  grade  (Grade  1 vs Grade  2) 
• Baseline  AFP level  (< 400 ng/mL  vs ≥ 400 ng/mL)  
• Region  (West [EU,  Americas,  and Australia]  vs Japan  vs rest of Asia)  
• Confirmation  of tumor  tissue  sample  receipt  and acceptability  at the central  laboratory  
• Confirmation  of eligibility  by [CONTACT_143920] -936558  CA20974W

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: 01 -Dec-2021  90 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 Participants meeting all  eligibility criteria  will be randomized into one of  the treatment arms in a 
1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_15006]:  
• ALBI  grade  (Grade  1 vs Grade  2) 
• Baseline  AFP level  (< 400 ng/mL  vs ≥ 400 ng/mL)  
• Region  (West [EU,  Americas,  and Australia]  vs Japan  vs rest of Asia)  
 
Blinded  study  treatment  was dispensed  at the study  visits  as listed  in Schedule  of Activities 
(Section 2 ). The exact procedures for using the IRT will be detailed in the IRT Manual.  
As of [ADDRESS_163623]/designee, and an 
unblinded site monitor will be assigned to provide oversight of drug supply and other unblinded 
study documentation.  
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical  study. However, in the 
event  of a medical  emergency  or pregnancy  in an individual  participant  in which  knowledge  of the 
IP is critical to the participant's management,  the blind for that participant may be broken by [CONTACT_3786].  The participant’s  safety  takes  priority  over any other  considerations  in determining  if 
a treatment assignment should be unblinded.  
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatment, the Investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary (ie, that it will alter the participant's 
immediate  management).  In many  cases,  particularly  when  the emergency  is clearly  not related  to 
the IP,  the problem  may be properly  managed by [CONTACT_143921].  It is highly  desirable that  the decision  to unblind  treatment assignment  be discussed  with

for the decision  to unblind.  The actual  task of unblinding  can be delegated  by [CONTACT_143922] a

For this study,  the method  of unblinding  for emergency  purposes  is through  the IRT. 
For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IRT Manual.  
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_143923].  
Any request to unblind a participant for non -emergency purposes should be discussed with the 
BMS Medical Monitor or Clinical Scientist.

7.3.1  Unblinding at the Time of Disease Recurrence/Progression  
As of [ADDRESS_163625] HCC disease recurrence/progression 
(Section  9.1.1  [Imaging Assessment for the Study]), and unblinding is considered necessary to 
inform the appropriate subsequent anti -cancer therapy, the study treatment assignment for the 
participant  can be obtained  by [CONTACT_143924]-emergency  unblinding. 
The Investigator should follow the procedures outlined in the IRT Manual to obtain the 
participant’s study  treatment assignment. The BMS central  study  team  (including, but not limited 
to, clinical, statistics, and data management) will remain blinded to treatment assignment.  
Investigators  must  wait for confirmation  of recurrence/progression  from  the BICR  prior  to 
non-emergency unblinding for the purpose of initiating subsequent anti -cancer therapy, unless 
clinical  considerations  require  immediate  intervention  (eg, symptomatic  brain  metastases). 
If subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  (including  systemic  cancer  therapy,  radiotherapy,  or 
tumor -directed surgery) is planned prior to BICR confirmation of recurrence/progression, the 
Investigator  must  contact  [CONTACT_143925].  
If a participant is diagnosed with a non -HCC secondary cancer, blinding should be preserved 
unless  specific  circumstances,  to be discussed  with the BMS  Medical  Monitor  or Clinical  Scientist, 
require that the blind be broken (eg, participant  has metastases and could enroll on a clinical  trial 
but would be ineligible if he or she had prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy).  
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT. For 
information on how to unblind in an emergency, please see Section 7.3  (Blinding).

Date: [ADDRESS_163630] and reported as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusion reactions should be graded 
according to National  Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.0 guidelines.  
Treatment recommendations are provided below based on NCI CTCAE version 5.0 grading 
definitions  and may be modified  based  on local  treatment  standards  and guidelines,  as appropriate.  
For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):  
• Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_163631] 30 minutes before 
additional study treatment administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms (therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, narcotics, IV 
fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours):  
• Stop the study treatment infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol  325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted,  then restart the infusion at 50% of 
the original  infusion  rate when  symptoms  resolve;  if no further  complications  ensue  after 
30 minutes,  the rate may be increased  to 100%  of the original  infusion  rate. Monitor  participant 
closely. If  symptoms  recur,  then no further  study  medication  will be administered  at that visit.  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_163632] 30 minutes before study treatment infusions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [eg, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_143799]/or  brief  interruption  of infusion];  recurrence  of symptoms  following 
initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] [eg, renal impairment,

 • Immediately discontinue infusion of study treatment. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline 
and treat the participant  as follows:  Recommend  bronchodilators,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Participant should be monitored 
until the Investigator  is comfortable  that the symptoms  will not recur.  Study  treatment will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery of the 
symptoms.  
 
In case of late -occurring  hypersensitivity  symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized  or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The IP should be stored in a secure area according  to local regulations. It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator  to ensure  that IP is only dispensed  to study  Participants.  The IP must  be dispensed 
only from official study sites by [CONTACT_20443].  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study  treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental  conditions  (temperature,  light,  and humidity)  as determined  by [CONTACT_20444]. 
If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment 
should not be dispensed and contact [CONTACT_20445].  
Study  treatment  not supplied  by [CONTACT_143926].  
IP documentation  (whether  supplied  by [CONTACT_104132]) must  be maintained  that includes  all processes 
required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of  drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).

The following medications are prohibited during the study (unless utilized to treat drug -related 
AEs):  
• Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio, and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]), within [ADDRESS_163633] dose.  
• Immunosuppressive  agents.  
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Section 6.2  
[Exclusion Criteria] criterion 1) subcriterion 1) and Section 7.7.3  [Permitted Therapy]).  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, 
locoregional  therapy,  hormonal  therapy,  immunotherapy,  palliative  or non-palliative  radiation 
therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment of HCC). TACE on demand is 
allowed as per protocol -defined criteria.  
• Any botanical  preparation  (eg, herbal  supplements  or traditional  Chinese  medicines)  intended 
to treat the disease  under  study  or provide  supportive  care.  Use of marijuana  and its derivatives 
for treatment of  symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment are permitted if obtained by

• Concurrent  use of antiviral  therapy  containing  interferon  (IFN).  
 
7.7.2  Other Restrictions and Precautions  
• Participants  with a condition  requiring  systemic  treatment  with either  corticosteroids  (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of 
randomization  are excluded.  Inhaled  or topi[INVESTIGATOR_103993],  and adrenal  replacement  steroid  doses  
> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune 
disease.  
• Investigators  are strongly  encouraged  to wait for confirmation  of recurrence/progression  from 
the BICR prior to initiating subsequent systemic cancer therapy, loco -regional therapy, or 
tumor -directed surgery for suspected recurrence/progression unless clinical considerations 
require immediate intervention (eg, symptomatic brain metastases). If subsequent systemic 
cancer therapy, loco -regional therapy, or tumor -directed surgery is planned prior to BICR 
confirmation of recurrence/progression, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_143927].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Imaging Restriction and Precautions  
It is the local  imaging  facility’s  responsibility  to determine,  based  on participant  attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history, and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen per imaging study. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks are to be 
considered  in this assessment.  Participants  with renal  insufficiency  are to be assessed  as to whether 
or not they  should receive contrast and if so, which contrast agent and dose is appropriate.

at increased  risk of nephrogenic  systemic  fibrosis;  therefore,  MRI  contrast  is contraindicated. 
In addition, participants may be excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, 
pacemakers, etc. This will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.  
Gentle hydration before and after IV contrast should follow local  SOC. The ultimate decision  to 
perform MRI in an individual participant in this study rests with the site radiologist, the 
Investigator, and standards set by [CONTACT_67825].  
7.7.3  Permitted Therapy  
Participants are permitted the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less -than-3-weeks) course of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis  (eg, contrast  dye allergy)  or for treatment  of non-autoimmune  conditions  
(eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted. 
Immunosuppressive doses (eg, prednisone > 10 mg/day or equivalent) in the context of treating 
AEs are permitted.  
Supportive  care for disease -related  symptoms may  be offered  to all participants  on the trial. 
COVID -19 vaccines  that are NOT  live (not replication  competent)  are permitted  during  the study 
and after the last dose of IP. No data are available on the response to COVID -[ADDRESS_163634]  with 
any questions related to COVID -19 vaccines.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Antiviral Therapy  
Participants  on antiviral  therapy  for hepatitis  B or C should  continue  the treatment  during  the study, 
providing the regimen is IFN -free. Changing of dosage and regimens of antiviral  therapy  will be 
at the discretion of  the Investigator. If a participant has a > 1 log IU/mL increase in HBV DNA, 
then virologic  breakthrough  should  be considered  and HBV  DNA  confirmed.  Adherence  to current 
antiviral  therapy  should  be assessed,  and resistance  testing  performed  according  to local  practices. 
If a participant  has documented  virologic  breakthrough  due to antiviral  resistance,  then this should 
be managed based on standardized regional guidelines and treatment with study treatment 
temporarily held. The participant may resume study treatment once virologic control is 
reestablished  . 
For any participant  who continues  to be HCV  RNA  positive  after receiving  study  treatment,  current 
guidelines  for management  of chronic  HCV  infection,  including  those  from  American  Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), European Association for the Study of the Liver 
(EASL), or Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) may be consulted. 
Initiation  of direct -acting  antivirals  (DAAs)  for HCV  is allowed  at the discretion  of the Investigator 
after discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor or Clinical Scientist.

7.8 Treatment  After  the End of the Study  
At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS -supplied study treatment for the maximum treatment duration 
specified in Section 7.1  (Treatments Administered) . Study treatment will be provided via an 
extension of the study, a rollover study requiring approval by [CONTACT_143928], or through another mechanism at the discretion of BMS.  
BMS  reserves  the right to  terminate  access  to BMS -supplied  study  treatment  if any of the following 
occur:  
• The study  is terminated due to safety  concerns.  
• The development  of nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143800],  including, but  not 
limited to, lack of efficacy and/or not meeting the study objectives.  
• The participant  can obtain  medication from  a government -sponsored  or private  health  program.  
 
In all cases,  BMS  will follow  local  regulations.  
[ADDRESS_163635]  discontinue IP (and  non-IP at the discretion  of the Investigator)  for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Participant’s request to stop study treatment. Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified 
follow -up procedures.  The only exception  to this is when  a participant specifically  withdraws 
consent  for any further  contact  [CONTACT_35859]/her  or persons  previously  authorized  by [CONTACT_143929].  
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684],  indicates  that continued  participation  in the study  is not in the best interest  of the 
participant.  
• Termination  of the study  by [CONTACT_20444].  
• Loss of ability  to freely  provide consent  through imprisonment  or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (Note: Under 
specific  circumstances,  and only in countries  where  local  regulations  permit,  a participant  who 
has been  imprisoned  may be permitted  to continue  as a participant.  Strict  conditions  apply  and 
BMS approval is required.)  
• Criteria  listed  in Section  8.1.1  (Treatment  Discontinuation  Criteria).  
• Participants meeting progression as assessed by [CONTACT_1697], unless eligible to continue with 
treatment beyond progression (see Section 5.1.4  [Treatment Beyond Progression]).

Refer to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ) for data to be collected at the time of treatment 
discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that can be completed.  
In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator  must  immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/Clinical Scientist of this event. In most cases, the 
study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary  for participant  safety).  Study  treatment  must  be permanently  discontinued  where  locally 
mandated. See Section 9.2.6  (Pregnancy).  
All participants  who discontinue  study  treatment  should  comply  with protocol -specified  follow -up 
procedures  as outlined in  Section  2 (Schedule  of Activities). The  only exception to  this requirement 
is when a participant withdraws consent for all study  procedures, including post -treatment study 
follow -up, or loses  the ability  to consent  freely  (ie, is imprisoned  or involuntarily  incarcerated  for 
the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study  treatment is  discontinued  prior  to the participant’s  completion  of the study,  the reason  for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Criteria  for Nivolumab  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143801]  
7.4.2 -1 in Section 7.4 . Discontinue nivolumab and i pi[INVESTIGATOR_143802], laboratory 
abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a 
substantial clinical risk to the participant with  continued nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143666]. Any 
event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 8 weeks from the previous dose requires 
discontinuation, with the following exceptions:  
• Dosing  delays  to allow  for prolonged  steroid  tapers  to manage  drug-related  AEs are allowed.  
• Dosing  delays  lasting  > 8 weeks  from  the previous  dose that occur  for non-drug-related  reasons 
may be allowed if approved by [CONTACT_102440] (or Clinical Scientist).  
 
Tumor  assessments  should  continue  as per protocol,  even  if dosing  is delayed.  Periodic  study  visits 
to assess  safety  and laboratory  studies  should  also continue Q6W, or more frequently if  clinically 
indicated during such dosing delays.

The following information refers to the original study design: In this study, OS is a key 
endpoint of  the study. Post -study follow -up is of critical  importance  and is essential  to preserving 
participant  safety  and the integrity  of the study.  Participants  who discontinue  study  treatment  must 
continue  to be followed  (in this study  or a rollover  study)  for collection  of outcome  and/or  survival 
follow -up data,  as required  and in line with Section  5 (Study  Design)  until death  or the conclusion

• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_3786],  as to whether  the withdrawal  is from  further  treatment  with study  treatment only 
or also from study procedures and/or post -treatment study follow -up, and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.  
• In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information should be used to  determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_163640]  to Follow -Up 
• All reasonable  efforts  must  be made  to locate  participants  to determine  and report  their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by [CONTACT_2299].  
• Lost to follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_104142] a minimum  of three 
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by [CONTACT_104143].  All attempts  should  be documented  in the participant’s medical  records.  
• If it is determined that  the participant has died,  the site will use permissible local methods  to 
obtain the date and cause of death.  
• If the Investigator’s use of third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of  the

 • Protocol  waivers  or exemptions  are not allowed.  
• All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatment.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities ( Section 2 ), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet  all eligibility  criteria  before  randomization.  The Investigator  will maintain  a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm  eligibility  or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures  conducted  as part of the participant’s  routine  clinical  management  (eg, blood  count, 
baseline  scans)  and obtained  before  signing  of informed  consent  may be utilized  for screening 
or baseline  purposes, provided  the procedure  meets  the protocol -defined  criteria  and has been 
performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2 ). 
• Additional measures, including non -study -required laboratory tests, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected 
drug-induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the Follow -up Period via 
on-site/local laboratories until all study drug -related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or 
are deemed irreversible.  
• If a participant  shows  pulmonary -related  signs  (eg, hypoxia,  fever)  or symptoms  (eg, dyspnea, 
cough, fever) consistent with  possible pulmonary AEs, the participant should be immediately 
evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS -936558 (nivolumab) IB.1 
• Some of  the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. 
They  are intended  to be used as safety  monitoring  by [CONTACT_56951].  Additional  testing 
or assessments may be performed as clinically  necessary or where required  by [CONTACT_143932].

design.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition  of Baseline  Tumor  Burden  
The baseline  tumor  burden  in this design  will be the tumor  burden  recorded  on imaging  at the time 
of screening. The [ADDRESS_163643] (arterially enhancing portion measuring at least 10 mm) liver lesions 
will be selected for the calculation of tumor burden at baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dynamic  Assessment  of Tumor  Burden  
During screening (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] [Definition of Baseline Tumor Burden]) and at each 
prescribed  imaging  timepoint  the [ADDRESS_163644]  liver lesions  will be selected  for the calculation  of tumor 
burden. These may be lesions exhibiting regrowth or any new (arterially enhancing portion 
measuring  at least 10 mm) liver lesions. This assessment of tumor burden is therefore a dynamic 
one and is more clinically relevant in a TACE setting, particularly when compared to a static 
assessment  where  tumor  burden  continues  to be assessed based  on the initial  target  lesions  selected, 
which may no longer  be there  after a TACE  procedure. Figure [IP_ADDRESS] -1 illustrates  the concept  of 
a dynamic assessment of tumor burden.

9.1.4  Outcomes  Research  Assessments  
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
The evaluation  of patient -reported  outcomes  (PROs)  is an increasingly  important  aspect  of clinical 
efficacy in oncology trials. Such data provide an understanding of the impact of treatment from 
the participant’s perspective and offer insights into patient experience that may not be captured 
through  physician  reporting.  Additionally,  generic  health -related  quality  of life (HRQL)  measures 
provide data needed for calculating utility values to inform health economic models.  
Participants  will be asked  to complete  the both the EQ-5D-5L and FACT -Hep in the participant’s 
preferred  language when  available. Participants will complete both  measures prior  to any other

 assessments or study  procedures when they  are being administered during study  visits. The PRO 
measures  will also be completed  at designated  timepoints  during  the follow -up period.  In addition, 
the EQ-5D-5L can be captured  during  survival  follow -up visits  by [CONTACT_143937].  There 
exists  a standardized  guide  that can be used to facilitate  telephone  administration  of the EQ-5D-5L. 
See Section 2  (Schedule of Activities) for timing of assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EQ-5D-5L 
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used to measure self -reports of health status and 
functioning.140 The instrument’s  descriptive system  consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has [ADDRESS_163647] health state, respectively, as described by [CONTACT_20367] -5D-5L. 
Altogether, the instrument describes 55 = 3,125 health states.  
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_143805]’s responses to the EQ -5D-5L 
descriptive system to generate an index measuring the value to society of his or her current 
health.141 Utility index values range from a 1 (full health) to 0 (dead) with negative values 
indicating a state considered worse than being dead. In addition, the EQ -5D-5L includes  a visual 
analog  scale  (VAS)  that allows  respondents  to rate their own current  health  on a 0-100 point  scale 
ranging from “the worst health you can imagine” to the “best health you can imagine.”  
The EQ-5D-5L uses a recall  period  of “today.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]  FACT -Hep 
Not applicable per Protocol Amendment 01. The following information refers to the original 
study  design.  
The FACT -Hep questionnaire  will be used to assess  the effects  of HCC  and its treatment  HRQL.[ADDRESS_163648] -G generic cancer -related core questionnaire to assess 
symptoms and treatment -related effects impacting physical well -being (PWB; 7 items), 
social/family well -being (SWB; 7 items), emotional well -being (EWB; 6 items), and functional 
well-being (FWB; 7 items). In addition, the FACT -Hep includes an 18 -item disease -specific 
hepatobiliary cancer subscale (HCS) that assesses back and stomach pain, gastrointestinal 
symptoms,  anorexia,  weight  loss, and jaundice.  A subset  of items  from  the FACT -Hep can also be 
scored as the National Cancer Care Network (NCCN) -FACT  Hepatobiliary -Pancreatic Symptom 
Index  (FHSI).[ADDRESS_163649] -Hep can  also be used to assess  the bother  associated 
with the side effects of treatment. Each item  is rated on a 5 -point  scale  ranging  from  0 (not at all) 
to 4 (very much).

9.2 Adverse  Events  
Use the NCI CTCAE  version  5.0 definitions  and grading  for safety  reporting  of all AEs and SAEs 
on the CRF.  
The definitions  of an AE  or SAE  can be found  in Appendix  3. 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events  that meet  the definition  of an AE or SAE  and remain  responsible  for following  up AEs that 
are serious,  considered  related  to the study  treatment  or the study,  or that caused  the participant  to 
discontinue before completing the study.  
Contacts  for SAE  reporting  specified  in Appendix  3. 
9.2.1  Immune -mediated  Adverse  Events  
IMAEs  are AEs consistent  with an immune -mediated  mechanism  or immune -mediated  component 
for which non -inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection, tumor progression) have been ruled out. 
IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology that were exacerbated by [CONTACT_134691].  Information  supporting  the assessment  will be collected  on the participant’s  eCRF.  
9.2.2  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All non -serious AEs (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be collected 
continuously  during  the treatment  period  and for a minimum  of 100 days following  discontinuation 
of dosing, at the timepoints specified in Section 2  (Schedule of Activities).  
All SAEs must be collected from the time of signing the consent, including those thought to be 
associated with  protocol -specified procedures and for a minimum of  100 days of  discontinuation 
of dosing. For participants randomized/assigned to treatment and never treated with study drug, 
SAEs should be collected for 30 days from the date of randomization.  
All AEs (SAEs and non -serious AEs) associated with confirmed or suspected SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_163654] be collected from the time of signing the consent until 100 days following 
discontinuation of dosing.

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: [ADDRESS_163655] report any SAE that occurs after  these  time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy).  
• Medical  occurrences  that begin  before  the start of study  treatment  but after obtaining  informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF module.  
• All SAEs  will be recorded  and reported  to the Sponsor  or designee  within  24 hours,  as indicated 
in Appendix 3 . 
• The Investigator  will submit  any updated  SAE  data to the Sponsor  or designee  within  24 hours 
of the updated information being available.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged  from  the study,  and he/she  considers  the event  reasonably  related  to the study 
treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.  
9.2.3  Method  of Detecting AEs  and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when 
collecting AEs and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by [CONTACT_143938], when appropriate for the program or protocol.  
Every  AE must  be assessed  by [CONTACT_143939] -mediated. For events that are potentially immune -mediated, additional information will 
be collected on the participant’s CRF.  
9.2.4  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Non-serious  AEs should  be followed  to resolution  or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (refer to Appendix 3).  
• Follow -up is also required for non -serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment, as appropriate.  
•  All identified  non-serious  AEs must  be recorded  and described  on the non-serious  AE page  of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.

• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_143940] a 
product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An Investigator  who receives  an Investigator Safety  Report  describing SAEs  or other  specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local  applicable laws, including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of 
Federal  Regulations  21 CFR  Parts  312 and 320. A suspected,  unexpected  serious  adverse  reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
Investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_163657] immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/Clinical Scientist of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form to the BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event, and in 
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3 . 
If the Investigator  determines  a possible favorable benefit -risk ratio  that warrants  continuation of 
study  treatment, or re -initiation of  study  treatment, a discussion between the Investigator and the 
BMS Medical Monitor/Clinical Scientist must occur. If, for whatever reason, the pregnancy has 
ended, confirmed by [CONTACT_104154], treatment may be resumed (at least 3 weeks 
and not greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of 
participant/Sponsor/IRB/EC, as applicable. Study treatment must be permanently discontinued 
where locally mandated; see Appendix [ADDRESS_163658] sign an ICF for disclosure of this 
information.  Information  on this pregnancy  will be collected  on the Pregnancy  Surveillance  Form.  
In cases where a study  drug can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to potentially 
cause  fetal toxicity,  and if any sexual  activity  (eg, vaginal,  anal,  oral)  has occurred  between  a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the information should be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee, even if the male participant has undergone a successful vasectomy. In order for the 
Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner,

Upon  implementation  of Protocol  Amendment  01, PK and immunogenicity  sample  collection 
is no longer necessary for any participant who is on study treatment. In the event samples 
are collected following implementation of Protocol Amendment 01, samples do not need to 
be analyzed.  
The following information refers to the original study design and is not applicable per 
Protocol Amendment 01 . 
Samples for  PK and IMG assessments  will be collected  for all participants, as  described in Table  
9.5-1. Only samples collected from nivolumab - and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated participants will be 
analyzed; samples collected from placebo participants will not be analyzed. All timepoints are 
relative to the start of study  treatment administration. All  on-treatment timepoints are intended to 
align  with days on which study  treatment is administered. If it is known that a dose is going to be 
delayed,  then the predose  sample  should  be collected  just prior  to the delayed  dose.  However,  if a 
predose sample is collected but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample 
should not be collected. Further details of sample collection, processing, and shipment will be 
provided in the Laboratory Procedures Manual.  
Serum concentration analyses for nivolumab will be performed by a validated immunoassay 
bioanalytical  method  for participants  treated  with nivolumab.  Samples  collected  from  participants 
treated with nivolumab will be evaluated for the development of anti -drug antibody (ADA) to 
nivolumab by [CONTACT_143941]. Samples with a positive ADA response may also be 
analyzed for nivolumab neutralizing ADA characterization by a validated cell -based assay.  
Serum concentration analyses for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143808] a validated immunoassay 
bioanalytical  method  for participants  treated  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Samples  collected  from  participants 
treated  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143809]. Samples with a positive ADA response may also be analyzed for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143810] a validated cell -based assay.  
In addition, selected serum samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_143942][INVESTIGATOR_125], or detect ADAs for technology exploration purposes; exploratory 
results will not be reported. The corresponding serum  samples designated for either PK, IMG, or 
biomarker assessments may also be used for any of those analyses, if required (eg, insufficient 
sample volume to complete testing or to follow up on suspected IMG -related AE).

Pharmacodynamic parameters will be evaluated in this study. Systemic immune monitoring of 
MDSCs, cytokines/chemokines, and other related soluble factors to investigate the 
immunomodulatory  properties  of nivolumab,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  and TACE  will be assessed. 
See Section  9.8 (Biomarkers) for a detailed description of the analyses and Table 9.[ADDRESS_163665] clinical response to nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
and/or  TACE will be investigated  in tumor specimens, peripheral  blood, and stool  taken from all 
participants as described below. Data from  these investigations will be evaluated for association 
with efficacy endpoints. In addition, analyses of markers in all  3 treatment arms will provide the 
necessary data to identify and validate biomarkers with predictive vs prognostic value.  
A detailed  description  of each biomarker  analysis  is described  below  and a schedule  of biomarker 
sample  collections is  provided in  Table 9.8 -1. Tumor  tissue,  peripheral blood, and a stool  sample 
will be collected prior to therapy. Peripheral blood samples and a stool sample will also be 
collected at selected timepoints on -treatment. If  a biopsy or surgical  resection is performed at the 
time of TTTP by [CONTACT_143943], tumor sample (block or slides) should also be 
submitted  for analysis.  If biomarker  samples  are drawn  but study  treatment(s)  are not administered, 
samples will be retained. Detailed instructions of the obtaining, processing, labeling, handling, 
storage  and shipment  of specimens  will be provided  in a separate  Procedure  Manual  at the time of 
study initiation.

 Sample  Collection  and Storage  
All requests  for access  to samples  or data for AR will be vetted  through  a diverse  committee  of the 
study  Sponsor’s senior leaders in R&D (or designee) to ensure  the research supports appropriate 
and well -defined scientific research activities.  
• Residual PK/IMG, tumor tissue, and serum, plasma, whole blood, and stool samples from 
collections  (see Table  9.8.4 -1 [Residual  Sample  Retention  for Additional  Research  Schedule]) 
will also be retained for AR purposes.  
 
Samples kept for future research will be stored at the BMS Biorepository in  or 
an independent, BMS -approved storage vendor.  
The manager of  these samples will  ensure they  are properly  used throughout their usable life and 
will destroy the samples at the end of the scheduled storage period, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study or the maximum allowed by  [CONTACT_1289].  
Transfers of samples by [CONTACT_143954][INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
agreement to establish similar storage procedures.  
Samples  will be stored  in a coded  fashion,  and no researcher  will have  access  to the key. The key 
is securely  held by [CONTACT_143955], so there  is no direct  ability for a researcher 
to connect a sample to a specific individual.

10.1 Sample  Size Determination  
Per Protocol Amendment 01, sample size will be limited to the participants randomized as 
of 22 -Sep-2021. The following information refers to the original study design.  
For the comparison  of nivolumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143698]  (Arm  A) vs nivolumab  placebo  and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143695] (Arm  C), both TTTP and OS are primary endpoints. For sample 
size determination purpose, the family -wise error rate of 5% will be controlled using Bonferroni 
split: comparison of TTTP with alpha of 1% and comparion of OS with alpha of 4%.  
Approximately 765 participants will be randomized to 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio in 
approximately 36 months. Approximately 94% and 89% power will be achieved for TTTP and 
OS, respectively,  under  the detailed  assumptions  described  in following  subsections.  EAST  v6.4.[ADDRESS_163668] simulations for sample size calculation.

 • Pi[INVESTIGATOR_91909] -exponential  distribution  in both control  and experimental  arms.  
• When viewing the OS data from the BRISK -TA study, the TACE arm  was considered as the 
most relevant to this study’s control arm, Arm C. Based on such data, a  exponential 
distribution is assumed for OS of Arm C. The assumed pi[INVESTIGATOR_91909] -exponential model fits the 
OS data of TACE in the BRISK -TA study up to   months. Starting from month 26, the tail 
of the control OS curve rose to have higher OS rates, with a 5 -year OS of   (see Figure

Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: [ADDRESS_163704]:  
• Provide  a copy  of the consent  form  and written  information  about  the study  in the language  in 
which  the participant  is most  proficient  prior  to clinical  study  participation.  The language  must 
be non -technical and easily understood.  
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain  an informed  consent  signed  and personally  dated  by [CONTACT_98901]'s 
legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_52223].  
• Obtain  the IRB/IEC’s  written  approval/favorable  opi[INVESTIGATOR_143848]/participants,  prior  to the beginning  of 
the study, and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian,  and the participant  subsequently  becomes  capable  of making  and communicating his  or 
her informed  consent  during  the study,  consent  must  additionally  be obtained  from  the participant.  
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator,  or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
participant's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented.  
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects/participants must be protected, 
respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the 
subjects’/participants’ signed ICF and, in the US, the subjects’/participants’ signed HIPAA 
Authorization.  
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have direct 
access to participant records.  
Subjects/participants unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects/participants with 
or severe dementia) may only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable 
representative. The participant must also be informed about the nature of  the study to the extent 
compatible with his or her understanding, and should this participant become capable, he or she 
should personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a 
participant who is unable to give his or her written consent, but who is capable of forming an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_143849], or to be withdrawn  from,  the clinical 
study at any time should be considered by [CONTACT_093].

and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of study  treatment,  whether  or 
not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements),  including  those  that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available.  Once  the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic  or intermittent  pre-existing  condition  including  either  an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New  conditions  detected  or diagnosed  after study  intervention  administration  even  though  it 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs,  symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae  of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs,  symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae  of a suspected  overdose  of either  study  intervention 
or a concomitant  medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim  term (as reported  by [CONTACT_093]), 
should  not be reported  as an AE/SAE  unless  it is an intentional  overdose  taken  with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent. Such  overdoses should be reported  regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term.  
Events NOT  Meeting  the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations  in which  an untoward  medical  occurrence  did not occur  (social  and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

 DEFINITION  OF SAE 
If an event is not  an AE per definition above,  then it cannot  be an SAE  even if serious conditions 
are met.  
SERIOUS  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results  in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event;  it does not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if it were 
more severe)  
Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143850]  (see NOTE 
below)  
NOTE:  
The following  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143851]:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours,  that does not  result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective  surgery,  planned  prior  to signing  consent  
• admissions  as per protocol  for a planned  medical/surgical  procedure  
• routine  health  assessment  requiring  admission  for baseline/trending  of health  status  
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
• admission  encountered  for another  life circumstance  that carries  no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy  in the absence  of any other  SAEs  (applies 
to oncology protocols)  
Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect

Is an important medical event (defined as a medical  event(s) that may not  be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one  of the other  serious  outcomes  listed  in the definition  above.)  Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.8  for the definition of potential DILI.)  
 
Pregnancy  and potential  drug induced  liver injury  (DILI)  must  follow  the same  transmission  timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.6  for reporting pregnancies).  
 
EVALUATING  AES AND  SAES  
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study intervention and  each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility”  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or  
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The investigator  will use clinical  judgment  to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors,  as well as the temporal  relationship  of the event  to study  intervention  administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information  to include  in the initial  report  to Sponsor.  However,  it is very important  that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality  assessment is one of  the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting 
requirements.

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required. 
(Note: Follow -up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment or if new 
information  becomes  available,  the SAE  report  must  be updated  and submitted  within  24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs  must  be followed  to resolution  or stabilization.  
 
REPORTING  OF SAES  TO SPONSOR  OR DESIGNEE  
 
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must  be recorded  on the SAE  Report  Form.  
− The required  method  for SAE  data reporting  is through  the eCRF.  
− The paper SAE Report Form is only intended as a back -up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system is unavailable/not functioning for  transmission of  the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee).  
 In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission  
 When  paper forms  are used,  the original  paper forms  are to  remain  on site 
• Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  and transmitted via 
email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission

participants, refer to Section 6.1  of the protocol. Only  the contraception methods as described in 
Section 6.1 are acceptable for this study.  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman  of Childbearing  Potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.  
Women  in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented  hysterectomy  
− Documented  bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented  bilateral  oophorectomy  
 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records , medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal  female  
− A postmenopausal  state is defined  as [ADDRESS_163708]  a serum  follicle  stimulating  hormone,  (FSH)  level  
> 40 mIU/mL  to confirm  menopause.  
 
Note:  Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of  the washout period is a function of  the type of HRT used.  The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels.  
• 1 week  minimum  for vaginal  hormonal  products  (rings,  creams,  gels)  
• 4 week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8 week minimum for oral products

 Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.  
 
End of Relevant  Systemic  Exposure  
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer 
considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in 
context  of safety  margins  from  the no-observed -adverse -effect  level  or the time required  for 5 half- 
lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
One of the highly  effective  methods  of contraception  listed  below  is required  during  study  duration 
and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 5 months after the end of study 
treatment.*  
Local  laws and regulations may  require use  of alternative and/or  additional  contraception  methods.  
 
 
Highly  Effective  Contraceptive  Methods  That  Are User  Dependent  
Failure  rate of < 1% per year when  used consistently  and correctly.a 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal  contraception associated with 
inhibition  of ovulation  and/or  implantation  (These  methods  of contraception  cannot  be used 
by [CONTACT_143970])b 
− oral (birth  control  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353])  
− intravaginal  (vaginal  birth  control  suppositories,  rings,  creams,  gels)  
− transdermal  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception  must begin at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy.  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. This 
method of contraception can only be used by [CONTACT_143971].b

• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation and/or implantation (This method of contraception cannot be used by [CONTACT_143972])b 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)c 
• Intrauterine  hormone -releasing  system  (IUS) (This  method  of contraception  cannot  be used 
by [CONTACT_143970])b,c 
• Bilateral  tubal  occlusion  
• Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effe ctive contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male  sexual  partner  of the WOCBP  and the absence  of sperm  has been  confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
• Sexual  abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual  intercourse  during  the entire  period  of risk associated  with the study  treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
• Continuous  abstinence  must  begin  at least 30 days prior  to initiation  of study  therapy.  
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2 . 
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to: calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.  
NOTES:  
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_143852]. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants participating in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would  be ineffective  or result  in increased  exposures  that could  be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of 
hormonal contraception, refer to Sections 6.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.7.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR 
RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.  
c Intrauterine devices and IUSs are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug 
interaction  studies  when  hormone  exposures  from  intrauterine  devices  do not alter contraception  effectiveness. 
For information specific to this study  regarding permissibility of hormonal contraception, refer to Sections 6.1 
INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.7.1 PROHIBITED AND/OR RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.

 APPENDIX 10  RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA MODIFIED FOR 
HEPATOCELLULAR  CARCINOMA  (mRECIST)  WITH  BMS 
ADAPTATIONS  
1 EVALUATION  OF LESIONS  
In this protocol,  the response  criteria  modified  for the assessment  of HCC  (mRECIST),  published 
in the Journal  of the National  Cancer  Institute  (JNCI  2010)  will be applied.  This modified  RECIST 
for HCC criteria is based on RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_163721] diameter of 
the viable  tumor  tissue  for “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]”  intrahepatic  HCC  lesions.  Intrahepatic  lesions  are considered 
“typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” if they  display hypervascularity in the arterial  phase and a wash -out in the portal  or late 
venous  phase  in dynamic  contrast -enhanced  CT or MRI.  Differentiating  between  viable  vs necrotic 
liver tumor  tissue  may allow  a more  accurate  representation  of anti-cancer  treatment  effects.  In the 
context of  this protocol, these criteria will be termed ‘Modified RECIST for HCC (mRECIST)’. 
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
2 MEASURABLE  
Liver lesions: Must be well -delineated, arterially enhancing lesions that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be 
recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• contrast  enhancement  at least [ADDRESS_163722]/MRI  scan (scan  slice thickness  no greater than 
5 mm).  
 
Extrahepatic  lesions:  Must  be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  in 
the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_163723]/MRI scan  (scan  slice thickness  no greater  than 5 mm),  or ≥2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.  
 
Malignant  lymph  nodes:  To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  node 
must  be  [ADDRESS_163724]/MRI  scan (scan  slice thickness  recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_9661], even if not involved by [CONTACT_20150]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable  and may be identified  as target  lesions  must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of 
 [ADDRESS_163725]/MRI scan.  Only  the short axis of  these  nodes  will contribute  to the baseline  sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is 
involved  by [CONTACT_70188]. Nodal  size is normally  reported  as two dimensions  in the plane  in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial,  sagittal  or coronal).  The smaller  of these measures is  the short  axis. For 
example,  an abdominal  node  which  is reported  as being  20 mm  30 mm has a short  axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies  as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the

 node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  10 mm but < 15 mm) 
should be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
Note:  Lesions  on X -ray are not to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.  
3 NON -MEASURABLE  
All other  lesions  are considered  non-measurable,  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  
< 10mm,  liver lesions  with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_143858],  or pathological  lymph  nodes  with  10 to 
< 15 mm  short  axis)  as well as truly  non-measurable  lesions.  Lesions  considered  truly 
non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_143985].  
Note:  Lesions  on X -ray are not  to be selected  as Target  or Non-Target  Lesions.  
3.1 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability  
3.1.1  Bone lesions  
• Bone scan, PET scan, and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic  bone  lesions  or mixed  lytic-blastic  lesions,  with identifiable  soft tissue  components , that 
can be evaluated  by [CONTACT_143986],  can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability 
described above.  
• Blastic  bone  lesions  are non-measurable.  
 
4 BASELINE  DOCUMENTATION  OF ‘TARGET’  AND  ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS  
The selection  of target  lesions will  be initially guided  by [CONTACT_143987] ‘typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’  intrahepatic 
lesions.  
‘Typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’  intrahepatic  lesions  MUST  meet  the following  criteria:  
• Lesions  can be classified  as measurable  lesion  
• Lesions  are suitable  for repeated  measurements  
• Lesion  shows  typi[INVESTIGATOR_143859] -enhanced  spi[INVESTIGATOR_143860], 
defined as:  
− Well  delineated  intrahepatic  lesions  
− Hypervascularity  in the arterial  phase  
− Contrast  agent  wash -out in the portal  and late venous  phase

 Measurable lesions in  the liver meeting  the criteria for ‘typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’  target  lesions  present  at baseline, 
should be chosen as the sole intrahepatic target lesions. Up to five ‘typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ intrahepatic lesions 
will be selected  as target  lesions.  Measurement  of the longest  viable  diameter,  which  is the longest 
diameter of the viable tumor lesion, will be applied to these lesions.  
HCC lesions that show local recurrence and/or residual disease after loco -regional therapy and 
have typi[INVESTIGATOR_143861]. All other ‘atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ 
intrahepatic lesions will NOT be considered as target lesions.  
If measurable extrahepatic lesions are present in addition to the ‘typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ intrahepatic lesions at 
baseline, up to five lesions (and a maximum of two lesions per organ), representative of all 
involved organs, will be identified as target lesions.  
Note: Outside of the liver, a maximum of two lesions can be selected per organ system. For 
example, a maximum of two lung lesions can be selected (selected from one lung or one lesion 
from  each).  A maximum  of two lymph  nodes  can be selected  at baseline,  as the lymphatic  system 
is considered one organ.  
All measurable  intrahepatic  lesions  (up to a maximum  of five lesions)  and extrahepatic  lesions  (up 
to five lesions and a maximum of  two lesions per  organ) should be identified as target lesions to 
be measured and recorded at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs,  but in addition  should 
be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which 
circumstance, the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
A sum  of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions, up to ten total, will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph 
nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then as noted  above,  only the short  axis is added  into the sum. 
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of  disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions may include:  
Intrahepatic  lesions:  
• Poorly  delineated  HCC  lesions  including  infiltrative -type and diffuse  HCC  
• HCC  lesions  with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_143862] -agent  enhancement  patterns  
• HCC  lesions  showing  local  recurrence  after previous  loco-regional  treatment  without  meeting 
the criteria  for ‘viable’  lesions  (ie, lack of clear -cut hypervascular  recurrence  and/or  
well-delineation from the surrounding liver tissue)  
• Portal  vein tumor  invasion  and/or  thrombosis  
• Intrahepatic  viable  lesions  in excess  to the 5 lesions  in the liver selected  as target  lesions

 Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in 
rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details  to follow). In addition, it is possible to  record 
multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form  
(eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
5 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
5.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): For typi[INVESTIGATOR_143863], complete disappearance of any 
intratumoral  contrast -agent  enhancement  in the arterial  phase  of CT or MRI.  For atypi[INVESTIGATOR_143864]- 
and extrahepatic target, disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive  Disease  (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate 
an absolute  increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also 
considered progression).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither  sufficient  shrinkage to  qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
• Not Evaluable  (NE):  If one or more  target  lesions  cannot  be measured  or adequately  assessed 
as either fully resolved or too small to measure (due to missing or poor quality images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased 
sufficiently to meet Progressive Disease as defined above.  
 
5.1.1  Special  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target Lesions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lymph  Nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress  to below  10 mm on study.  This means  that when  lymph  nodes  are included  as target  lesions, 
the ‘sum’  of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal 
lymph  node  is defined  as having  a short  axis of < [ADDRESS_163726]  achieve  a short  axis < 10 mm. For PR, SD, and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target  Lesions  That  Become ‘Too Small  to Measure’  
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them  as being ‘too small to measure’.  When this occurs,  it is important  
Clinical  Protocol 
BMS -936558  CA20974W  
nivolumab  
Protocol  Amendment  No.: 01 
Date: [ADDRESS_163727]  that the lesion 
has likely  disappeared,  the measurement  should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present  and is faintly  seen but too small  to measure,  a default  value  of 5 mm should  be assigned 
as the reference  diameter. (Note:  It is less likely that this  rule will be used for lymph nodes  since 
they usually  have  a definable  size when  normal  and are frequently  surrounded  by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well.) This 
default  value  is derived  from  the [ADDRESS_163728] slice thickness  (but should  not be changed  with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore 
providing  this default  value  will prevent  false  responses  or progressions  based  upon  measurement 
error.  To reiterate,  however,  if the radiologist is able to provide  an actual measure,  that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lesions  That  Split  or Coalesce  on Treatment  
When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’ , the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be 
added together  to calculate  the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.  
5.2 Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of  the criteria used to determine the tumor  response for the 
group  of non-target  lesions.  While  some  non-target  lesions  may actually  be measurable,  they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only  qualitatively at  the time points specified in 
the protocol.  
• Complete Response (CR): For typi[INVESTIGATOR_143865] -target lesions, complete 
disappearance of any intratumoral contrast -agent enhancement in the arterial phase of CT or 
MRI. For atypi[INVESTIGATOR_143866] - and extrahepatic non -target lesions, complete disappearance of all 
lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  
• Progressive  Disease  (PD):  Unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  
 
5.2.1  Special  Notes  on Assessment  of Progression  of Non-Target Disease  
The concept  of progression  of non-target  disease  requires  additional  explanation  as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  When  the Participant  also has Measurable  Disease  
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’  on the basis of the non -target disease, there 
must  be an overall  level  of substantial  worsening  in non-target  disease  such that, even  in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non -target lesions is 
usually not sufficient  to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial

Date: 01 -Dec-2021  207 
Approved  v 21..00 930142607  2.0  
 effusions  and ascites  will not  be followed  as target  or non-target  lesions  and will not contribute  to 
response or progression. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  When  the Participant  has Only  Non-measurable  Disease  
This circumstance  arises  in some  trials  when  it is not a criterion  of study  entry  to have  measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable  disease  assessment  to factor  into the interpretation  of an increase  in non-measurable 
disease  burden.  Because  worsening  in non-target  disease  cannot  be easily  quantified  (by [CONTACT_108]: 
if all lesions  are truly  non-measurable)  a useful  test that can be applied  when  assessing  patients  for 
unequivocal  progression  is to consider  if the increase  in overall  disease  burden  based  on the change 
in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare  PD for measurable  disease:  ie, an increase  in tumor  burden  representing  an additional  73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient should  be considered  to have  had overall  PD at that point.  While  it would  be ideal  to have 
objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.  
5.2.2  New Lesions  
The appearance  of new malignant  lesions  denotes  disease  progression;  therefore,  some  comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable  to differences in  scanning  technique,  change in imaging modality  or findings  thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply 
healing  or flare of pre-existing lesions).  This is particularly  important  when  the patient’s baseline 
lesions  show  partial  or complete  response.  For example,  necrosis  of a liver lesion  may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’  cystic lesion, which it is not.  
New hepatic lesion with the longest diameter of at least 10 mm with the vascular pattern 
characteristic for HCC (ie, hypervascularization) in the arterial phase with  wash -out in the portal 
venous (or late venous) phase of contrast -enhanced CT or MRI imaging denotes disease 
progression.  
New hepatic lesions larger than [ADDRESS_163729] 10 mm in subsequent scans will also denote disease progression.  
NOTE: Fluid collections (pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites) will not be 
considered  new lesions  and will not contribute  to response  or progression.  In the event  a new fluid 
collection is seen  on a post-baseline imaging  exam,  a comment  may be made,  but the appearance 
of a new fluid collection alone should not result in an assessment  of progressive disease (PD). A 
lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered  a new lesion  and will indicate  disease  progression.  An example  of this is the patient 
who has visceral  disease  at baseline  and while  on study  has a CT or MRI  brain  ordered  which

 reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion identified on Chest X -Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesion and will result in PD.

consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.

5.3.[ADDRESS_163732] response determination of complete or partial response requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial  responses  may be claimed  only if the criteria  for each are met at a subsequent  time point  of 
 4 weeks (28 days) later. In this circumstance, the best overall  response can be interpreted as in 
Table 5.3.[ADDRESS_163733] scheduled follow -up imaging visit is Week 6 (  7 days) for a particular 
protocol, a  best response of SD can only be  made after the subject is on -study for a minimum of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on -study of 35 days from the 
reference  start date (reference  date is considered  Day 1 on study).  If the subject  is not on-study  for 
at least this amount  of time,  any tumor  assessment  indicating  stable  disease  before  this time period 
will have a best response of NE, unless PD is identified.  
Special  note on response  assessment:  When  nodal  disease  is included  in the sum of target  lesions 
and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported 
on scans.  This measurement  should  be recorded  even  though  the nodes  are normal  in order  not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

response  would  depend  on whether  minimum  duration  for SD was met. However,  sometimes  ‘CR’  may be claimed

 APPENDIX 11  FRANCE -SPECIFIC  GENERAL  GUIDANCE  FOR  TRANS - 
ARTERIAL CHEMO -EMBOLIZATION  
1 PURPOSE  
This guidance provides information regarding the Trans -arterial Chemo -Embolization (TACE) 
procedure and is based on TACE procedure commonalities worldwide. For CA20974W, it is 
required  that the same  procedure  technique,  chemotherapy  agent(s),  and embolizing  agent  are used 
for each patient enrolled in this study.  
[ADDRESS_163735] procedure in each investigational site. The same 
chemotherapy agent(s) must be used for all TACE procedures on a patient.  
The general  recommendation  of TACE  procedures  are as follows:  
1) Confirm  tumor  enhancement  and feeding  artery  by [CONTACT_143988].  
2) Insert  a catheter  into the feeding  artery  of the HCC,  which  is technically  accessible,  as close  to 
the lesion as possible.  
3) EITHER  
a) Inject  the emulsion  of the anticancer  agent(s)  with lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143867].  Drugs 
that may be considered include doxorubicin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], idarubicin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin 
and mitomycin (see Table 2 -1). 
4) Embolize  the feeding  artery  with an embolization  agent  (eg, gelatin  sponge),  and complete  the 
therapy.  
OR 
a) Inject Drug Eluting Beads (DEB). Only DEBs with single -agent chemotherapy, are 
allowed.  The use of DEBs  must  be in accordance  with the registered  indication  (see Table  
2-2). 
5) The end of TACE  procedure  is the cessation  of arterial  blood  flow to the  tumor.

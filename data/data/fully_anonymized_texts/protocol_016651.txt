1 SYNOPSIS 
Study Title A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Finding 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of KD025 in Adult 
Subjects with Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis who are 
Candidates for Systemic Therapy or Phototherapy 
Clinical Phase 2 
Number of Study Centers Up to 20 
Study Background Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body but 
is primarily manifested in the skin. It affects 2% to 3% of the population 
of the world, making it a very common inflammatory autoimmune disease. 
The most common form of psoriasis, called psoriasis vulgaris, accounts for 
over 80% of the people with psoriasis. This type of psoriasis appears as 
raised plaques of dry scaly skin that may affect multiple regions of the 
body. Psoriasis is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the 
percentage of the body affected and the intensity of the inflammation. 
Several genetic loci have been associated with psoriasis and the major 
genetic determinant, psoriasis susceptibility, accounts for up to 50% of the 
hereditary aspects of the disease. This locus encodes several immune 
functions as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]-associated proteins that are expressed and 
up-regulated in psoriasis. The genetic basis of sensitivity to psoriasis is 
supported by [CONTACT_486510] 70% concordance in identical twins. 
The pathogenesis of psoriasis is not fully understood. However, it has 
been recognized that the recently discovered T helper 17 (Th17) cells, 
which represent highly proinflammatory cells that function in the 
induction of multiple autoimmune diseases as well as enhancing the 
clearance of extracellular pathogens, play a critical role in the pathogenesis 
of psoriasis. Th17 cells secrete interleukins IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, 
which can activate keratinocytes and endothelial cells in the skin. 
Antibodies directed against IL-[ADDRESS_625205] been approved by [CONTACT_24623] 
(US) Regulatory Authorities. Secukinumab is a human 11-17A antagonist 
indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis 
in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
It is administered subcutaneously and has demonstrated robust efficacy in 
4 well-controlled clinical studies. The primary endpoints for these 
4 studies were the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PAST) score of at least 75% (PAST 75) 
from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (clear or almost clear) on 
the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA; modified 2011). An increase of

infections was reported, as well as a few exacerbations of Crohn's disease 
and hypersensitivity. 
Another subcutaneous agent, ustekinumab, has been approved for the same 
indication. Ustekinumab is a human IL-[ADDRESS_625206] indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients (18 years or older) with moderate to 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or 
systemic therapy. An increase of infections and a few cases of skin cancer 
were reported in [ADDRESS_625207] (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4), has been 
approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic 
therapy. However, safety concerns such as depression, weight decrease, 
and issues with drug interactions due to a strong cytochrome P450 enzyme 
induction have been reported. Also, administration requires a titration at 
initiation due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. The efficacy at [ADDRESS_625208] 75 
of 33.1% and 28.8% versus placebo 5.3% and 5.8%, with the static 
Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of "clear" or "almost clear" of 
21.7% and 20.4% versus placebo 3.9% and 4.4%. Apremilast is also 
approved for psoriatic arthritis. 
Several Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors have been studied for the therapy of 
psoriasis as well as other autoimmune diseases. However, none has been 
approved for the treatment of psoriasis to date. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor 
of Jak [ADDRESS_625209] Jak 1 and Jak 2. It has been 
approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as a twice daily 
(BID) oral medication for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and is 
marketed as XELJANZ ®, and has multiple severe infectious and 
immunologic side effects associated with therapy. Monotherapy with 
tofacitinib was associated with a modest increase in American College of 
Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement criteria compared with 
placebo (57% versus 26%). Ruxolitinib is a Jak [ADDRESS_625210] been perfolined with etanercept and adalimumab, 
both of which block tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and have 
demonstrated efficacy in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, but no 
therapy has been as effective as IL-[ADDRESS_625211] in psoriasis, it is possible that an oral formulation 
(e.g., KD025) could offer significant advantages over other available oral 
formulations. This study will provide safety and efficacy data of the 
therapeutic response to evaluate the risk/benefit of treating plaque 
psoriasis with KD025.

relationship of the AE to study drug. Any known untoward event that 
occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses as 
possibly related to study drug also should be reported to the sponsor. 
Subjects with ongoing AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolution or a 
new treatment is started. 
Efficacy Evaluation The primary efficacy endpoint for analysis will be the number (%) of 
subjects with a 75% decrease in PAST at Week 16. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for analysis will include the following: 
1. A 50% reduction in Week [ADDRESS_625225] score (PAST 50) 
2. The mean Week [ADDRESS_625226] 
3. Improvements in PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at Week 16 
4. Improvements in DLQI at Week 16 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints are: 	 . 
• To evaluate the concentration and changes in IL-17 expression 
in blood, tissue, and other biomarkers in punch biopsy after 
16 weeks of dosing with KD025 
Efficacy analyses will be divided into 2 periods: the double-blind 
treatment period through database lock at Week 16, and the 32-week, 
open-label continuation period. 
Pharmacodynamics All subjects will have PD blood samples collected over the course of the 
study. Subjects who elect to continue therapy will also have PD blood 
Kadmon Corporation 	Page [ADDRESS_625227] who discontinues prematurely, blood 
for PD evaluation will also be collected at the Early-Termination visit. 
Samples will be evaluated for the expression of the psoriasis-associated 
cytokine, 1L-17, in plasma. 
Statistical Analysis Data Presentations/Descriptive Statistics 
The sample size will be 110 subjects due to early study termination. 
Two populations will be employed in the analysis of study data: 
• The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population will consist of 
all subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of 
study drug. All safety analyses will be performed on the mITT 
population. 
• The Evaluable for Efficacy population will consist of subjects 
who have non-missing baseline and Week [ADDRESS_625228] disposition, and screening and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized for mITT populations, where 
appropriate. 
Efficacy analyses will include the number (%) of subjects with a 75% 
decrease in PAST (number of subjects that reach PAST 75) at Week 16 in 
the KD025 treatment groups compared with the placebo group in a 
pairwise manner using a Fisher's exact test. The number of subjects who 
reach PAST 50 at Week 16 will be analyzed similarly. 
Treatment group differences in DLQI and PGA changes from baseline to 
Week 16 will be assessed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment as a fixed effect and a subject's baseline value as a 
covariate. 
No adjustments for multiplicity are being made for this Phase 2 study. 
The primary safety endpoint will be the percentage of subjects in each 
treatment group experiencing AEs. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_486512] (MedDRA ®) System 
Organ Class (SOC) and preferred teun, classified from verbatim terms 
(Version 18.1 or higher). The incidence and percentage of subjects with at 
least [ADDRESS_625229] severe grade using a 5-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life 
threatening, or death). The number of events per preferred term will also 
be summarized. Causality (relationship to study treatment) will be 
summarized separately.

4 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects many parts of the body but is primarily 
manifested in the skin. It affects 2% to 3% of the population of the world, making it a very 
common inflammatory autoimmune disease. The most common form of psoriasis, called 
psoriasis vulgaris, accounts for over 80% of the people with psoriasis. This type of psoriasis 
appears as raised plaques of dry scaly skin that may affect multiple regions of the body. 
Psoriasis is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the percentage of the body affected and 
the intensity of the inflammation. Several genetic loci have been associated with psoriasis and 
the major genetic determinant, psoriasis susceptibility, accounts for up to 50% of the hereditary 
aspects of the disease. This locus encodes several immune functions as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]-
associated proteins that are expressed and up-regulated in psoriasis. The genetic basis of 
sensitivity to psoriasis is supported by [CONTACT_486510] 70% concordance in identical twins. 
The pathogenesis of psoriasis is not fully understood. However, it has been recognized that the 
recently discovered T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which represent highly proinflammatory cells that 
function in the induction of multiple autoimmune diseases as well as enhancing the clearance of 
extracellular pathogens, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Th17 cells secrete 
IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, which can activate keratinocytes and endothelial cells in the skin. 
Antibodies directed against IL-[ADDRESS_625243] been approved by [CONTACT_209060] (US) Regulatory 
Authorities. Secukinumab is a human IL-17A antagonist indicated for the treatment of moderate 
to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or 
phototherapy. It is administered subcutaneously and has demonstrated robust efficacy in 4 well-
controlled clinical studies. The primary endpoints for these 4 studies were the proportion of 
subjects who achieved a reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PAST) score of at least 
75% (PAST 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (clear or almost clear) on the 
Physicians Global Assessment (PGA; modified 2011). An increase of infections was reported, 
as well as a few exacerbations of Crohn's disease and hypersensitivity. 
Another subcutaneous agent, ustekinumab, has been approved for the same indication. 
Ustekinumab is a human IL-[ADDRESS_625244] indicated for the treatment of adult patients

(18 years or older) with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy. An increase of infections and a few cases of skin cancer were 
reported in [ADDRESS_625245] (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4), has been approved for the 
treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates 
for phototherapy or systemic therapy. However, safety concerns such as depression, weight 
decrease, and issues with drug interactions due to a strong cytochrome P450 enzyme induction 
have been reported. Also, administration requires a titration at initiation due to gastrointestinal 
(GI) side effects. The efficacy at [ADDRESS_625246] 75 of 33.1% and 
28.8% versus placebo 5.3% and 5.8%, with the static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of 
"clear" or "almost clear" of 21.7% and 20.4% versus placebo 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively. 
Apremilast is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. 
Several Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors have been studied for the therapy of psoriasis as well as 
other autoimmune diseases. However, none has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis to 
date. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Jak [ADDRESS_625247] Jak 1 and Jak 2. It 
has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) as a twice daily (BED) oral 
medication for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and is marketed as XELJANZ ®, and has 
multiple severe infectious and immunologic side effects associated with therapy. Monotherapy 
with tofacitinib was associated with a modest increase in American College of Rheumatology 
20% (ACR20) improvement criteria compared with placebo (57% versus 26%). Ruxolitinib is a 
Jak [ADDRESS_625248] been performed with etanercept and adalimumab, both of which block 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFcc) and have demonstrated efficacy in the therapy of rheumatoid 
arthritis, but no therapy has been as effective as IL-[ADDRESS_625249] in psoriasis, it is possible that an oral formulation 
(e.g., KD025) could offer significant advantages over other available oral foimulations. This 
study will provide safety and efficacy data of the therapeutic response to evaluate the risk/benefit 
of treating plaque psoriasis with KD025.

Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK1 and ROCK2). The potency of 
fasudil against ROCK2 is similar to KD025. Fasudil has been marketed in Japan for more than 
10 years as an intravenous drug for the prevention of cerebrovascular spasm after stroke. Fasudil 
was also under development for the treatment of chronic angina. In a Phase 2 clinical study in 
the US (Vicari et al, 2005), fasudil was dosed from 20 mg three times a day (TlD) up to 80 mg 
TlD over 8 weeks. At all doses tested, the adverse events (AEs) in the treatment arm were

reported as no different from placebo. In a separate study to examine endothelial function in 
subjects and healthy subjects (Nohria et al, 2006), fasudil was dosed at 40 mg TID for 30 days. 
The single-ascending dose (SAD)/multiple-ascending dose (MAD) (KDO25-101) and MAD 
(KDO25-102) studies support daily dosing with KD025 and have shown a safety profile that 
allows daily dosing up to 1000 mg per day. In addition, in Study KD025-103, a Phase 1, 
placebo-controlled study examining the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
[ADDRESS_625251]-menopausal female 
subjects for up to 28 days, the regimen was generally well tolerated. 
Phaimacodynamic (PD) studies in these normal healthy subjects have shown biological activity 
in inhibition of secretion of IL-17 and IL-21 by [CONTACT_174624]-17 cells in ex vivo stimulated peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells at the 120-, 240-, and 320-mg dose levels. Thus, the dosing selected in 
the proposed study (200 mg once daily [QD], 200 mg BID, 400 mg QD, and 600 mg/day) should 
be both safe and at a level at which biological activity has been measured. 
4.3 	Previous Clinical Experience with KD025 
A Phase 1 fed or fasted study (KD025-105) was conducted to evaluate the food effect as well as 
to further evaluate the safety and PK of a single 500-mg dose of KD025 administered orally to 
fed and fasted healthy males. 
Study results showed approximately a 3-fold higher exposure (maximum serum concentration 
[Cmax] and area under the curve [AUC]) in the fed state compared with the fasted state. There 
were no treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no treatment-related AEs were reported 
in any subject after receiving KD025 in either the fed or fasted state. There were no clinically 
relevant changes in vital signs, physical examination (PE) findings, or electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters. There were no clinically relevant changes and no clinically meaningful trends in 
hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory results attributable to study drug during this 
study. Plasma concentrations achieved in this study were comparable to plasma levels achieved 
in previous studies at similar dose levels, where breakfast was provided immediately after dose 
administration. These studies support dosing KD025 with food.

study with 3 cohorts (200 mg BID, 400 mg QD, and 400 mg BID). KD025 was well tolerated in 
all subjects and demonstrated activity as measured by [CONTACT_47736]. The only adverse experience was 
related to elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in 
approximately 20% of the subjects. The KD025 400-mg BID group showed the highest 
(Grade 3) elevations. The 400-mg BID dose will not be pursued in future studies.

clinically significant for the purposes of this study, and will be recorded on the AE eCRF page. 
With the exception of LFTs, laboratory results will be classified using the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Studies (see Appendix A). Laboratory results for ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and

bilirubin will be classified according to Table 9-2 in Section 9.4. If laboratory values constitute 
part of an event that meets criteria defining it as serious, the event (and associated laboratory 
values) must be reported as an SAE (see Section 11.3.1). 
7.2.5 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 12-lead ECGs will be obtained prior to blood sample collection (tolerance window: -240 
minutes to 0 hour). 
Digital 12-lead ECG measurements are to be taken with the subject in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_486495] 5 minutes before each reading. The ECG is to be 
repeated 3 times consecutively within 30 minutes (with a required interval of at least 1 to 
2 minutes between ECGs). At each visit, and when possible, the ECG is to be performed 
immediately prior to any blood sample collection. 
The following ECG parameters will be collected: PR interval, RR interval, QRS interval, QT 
interval, and QTc interval (QTc[F]; Fridericia's correction, see Appendix B for formula). The 
ECG findings will be evaluated by a qualified physician for the presence of abnormalities 
(qualitative assessment). The physician will assess each ECG as normal, abnormal/not clinically 
significant, or abnormal/clinically significant. 
Abnormalities in the ECG that lead to a change in subject management (e.g., dose interruption or 
delay, requirement for additional medication or monitoring) or result in clinical signs and 
symptoms are considered clinically significant for the purposes of this study and will be recorded 
on the AE eCRF. If ECG abnormalities meet criteria defining them as serious, they must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 11.3.1). 
7.2.6 Pregnancy Testing 
Urine pregnancy tests will be collected for women of childbearing potential. Positive results will 
be confirmed with serum testing. 
7.2.7 Randomization 
Following the completion of screening assessments, eligible, consenting subjects will be 
randomized to 1 of 5 dose cohorts. See Section 5.7 for further details.

7.2.8 Punch Biopsy (Optional) 
Punch biopsies will be obtained from at least 75% of the subjects. Subjects have the option to 
decline the punch biopsy. Punch biopsies will be taken from clear unaffected skin and a selected 
lesion will be collected predose on Day 1 (Week 1) and from the selected lesion on Day 112 
(Week 16). Biopsies will be obtained through a standard punch biopsy procedure. These 
biopsies will be analyzed for PD markers associated with psoriasis and with Rho Kinase 
inhibition. 
7.2.9 Blood Sampling for Pharmacodynamics 
Blood sample collection for PD will be performed at all sites (refer to Table 1-1 for time points). 
All subjects will have PD blood samples collected over the course of the study. Subjects who 
elect to continue therapy will also have PD blood samples collected. 
For any subject who discontinues prematurely, blood for PD evaluation will be collected at the 
Early Termination visit. 
Samples will be evaluated for the expression of the psoriasis-associated cytokine, IL-17, in 
plasma. Detailed instructions for sample collection and preparation will be provided in a separate 
manual. 
7.2.10 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Scoring 
• The PAST is a measure of the psoriasis disease severity using the average redness, thickness, and 
scaliness of the lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighted by [CONTACT_486514] 44 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 12 Mar 2019 Kadmon Corporation 
KDO25 	
IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
(Wozel eta!, 2005). PAST combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area 
affected into a single score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). 
To score the PAST, the body is divided into 4 sections 
• head (Id): 10% of a person's skin 
• arms (A): 20%) of a person's skin 
• trunk (T): 30%) of a person's skin 
• legs (L): 40% of a person's skin 
Each of these areas is scored by [CONTACT_5071], and then the [ADDRESS_625271]. 
For each section, the percent of area of skin involved, is estimated and then transformed into a 
grade from 0 to 6: 
• Grade 0: 0% of involved area 
• Grade 1: <10% of involved area 
• Grade 2: 10%-29% of involved area 
• Grade 3: 30%-49% of involved area 
• Grade 4: 50%-69% of involved area 
• Grade 5: 70%-89% of involved area 
• Grade 6: 90%-100% of involved area 
Within each area, the severity is estimated by 3 clinical signs: erythema (redness), induration 
(thickness), and desquamation (scaling). Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4, 
from none to maximum. 
The sum of all 3 severity parameters is then calculated for each section of skin, multiplied by [CONTACT_486515] (0.1 for head, 0.2 for arms, 
0.3 for body, and 0.4 for legs). 
7.2.11 Relative Physician's Global Assessment 
The relative PGA documents the physician's assessment of the subject's psoriasis status 
(Robinson 2012). Consideration should be given to the percent of body involvement as well as 
overall induration, scaling, and erythema (refer to Appendix C).

The DLQI is a skin disease-specific instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a 
subject's quality of life (Finlay et al, 1994). Refer to Appendix D for the complete 
questionnaire. 
7.2.12 Photography (Optional) 
Subjects have the option to participate in the photography of selected lesions. The same lesions 
should be photographed throughout the study. Further information can be found in the Kadmon 
photography manual. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_625272] will receive 2 tablets to take each 
morning and 1 tablet to take each evening. During the 32-week continuation period, all subjects 
will receive open-label 400 mg KD025 QD, as two 200 mg tablets to be taken in the morning. 
At each designated visit, subjects will receive the morning dose (2 tablets) of study drug in the 
clinic. Subjects will self-administer the balance of daily doses of study drug at home. 
Each dose of study drug should be taken together with a meal or within [ADDRESS_625273] the date of study 
drug administrations. These diaries will be dispensed at the Day 1 (Week 1) visit. Final

appropriate study drug inventory. This inventory will be maintained throughout the duration of 
the study and will be periodically reviewed by a representative of the sponsor. 
The investigator (or designee) will instruct the subject that all dispensed bottles must be returned 
at each follow-up visit, at which time a tablet count will be conducted to assure subject dosing 
compliance. 
Additionally, subjects will be required to keep study drug diaries in which they will record the 
details of study drug administrations. These diaries will be dispensed and/or collected according 
to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1-1). 	
9.8 	Study Drug Storage 
All supplies of study drug are to be stored at [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia controlled room 
temperature of 20°C to 25°C (66°F to 77°F) with excursions pelinitted between 15°C and 30°C 
(59°F and 86°F). At the clinic, the study drugs are to be stored in a securely locked area, 
accessible to authorized persons only, until needed for dosing.

may be conducted. This information will be recorded on the Drug Dispensing Log. 
9.10.[ADDRESS_625314] receives from signing ICF through 
the end of study (30-Day Follow-Up visit) will be documented. After discontinuation of study 
drug, any concomitant medication used in response to an AE is to be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF. 
Administration of acid-reducing medications should be avoided during the study as these agents 
may decrease exposure to KD025. If acid-reducing agents are needed, H-[ADDRESS_625315] no less 
than 2 hours before or after dosing with KD025. 
Subjects may be receiving low-dose oral corticosteroids (< 10 mg daily prednisone or 
equivalent) at study entry. Oral corticosteroid dose must be stable for at least 1 month prior to 
study entry and expected to remain stable throughout participation. Any changes in systemic 
corticosteroid dose will be documented on the eCRF. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_486498], groin, or scalp are allowed. 
Prior systemic treatment, including biologics, is to be recorded on the eCRF, including duration 
of exposure and reason for discontinuation. 
The concomitant medication names will be coded by [CONTACT_486520] (WHO) Drug Dictionary and classified by [CONTACT_2220] (ATC) 
categories.

11 SAFETY 
11.1 Safety Parameters 
The Clinical Symptom and Adverse Event Grading Scale will be used for grading toxicities (see 
Appendix E). With the exception of LFTs, laboratory results will be classified using the 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Studies (see Appendix A). LFTs will be classified using Table 9-[ADDRESS_625316] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. AEs include: 
• Suspected adverse drug reactions (abbreviated as either SADR or SAR). This may be 
serious or not serious 
• Reactions from drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity 
• Significant changes or abnormalities, when compared with baseline, in structure 
(sign), function (symptom), clinical laboratory results, ECG results, or physiological 
testing. This includes any worsening of a pre-existing condition temporally 
associated with the use of study drug 
• Other medical events, regardless of their relationship to the study drug, such as injury, 
surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms, or apparently unrelated illnesses 
For the purpose of data collection, all untoward events that occur after ICF through [ADDRESS_625317] dose of study treatment are to be recorded on eCRFs by [CONTACT_2727]. 
11.3 Evaluating Adverse Events 
The investigator will determine the seriousness, intensity, and causality of an AE associated with 
the use of the study drug (i.e., events where there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]) based on the definitions that follow.

11.3.1 Serious Adverse Events 
(Notify sponsor or designee within 24 hours; document on eCRF) 
The SAE definition and reporting requirements are in accordance with Title 21 Part Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety 
Reporting Requirements for Investigational New Drug (ID) applications and 
bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies. 
SAE: An adverse event is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death: This includes any death that occurs while the subject is "on study" as well as any 
death that occurs within 30 days after study drug administration. 
Note: Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself. The event(s) that 
caused death (e.g., illness, accident) is the SAE. Death due to any other 
cause(s) must also be reported as an outcome of the reportable SAE. 
• Life-threatening AE:  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
"life-threatening" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence 
places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]:  
In the absence of an AE, the investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207456]. This is the case in the following situations: 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760] 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486499] 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486500], a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a pre-existing condition 
which has not worsened does not count as an SAE.

IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical event: An event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
11.3.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
(Notify sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_625318] awareness; document on eCRF) 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any adverse drug event, the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with those noted in the current protocol and/or 
lB. This refers to any AE that has not been previously observed (e.g., included in the D3), rather 
than from the perspective of such an event not being anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the product. 
11.3.3 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An AE is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the lB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an lB is not required or available, is not consistent with the 
risk infoimation described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. The term also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the lB as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_625319] is participating in the study. For example, a protocol-related AE 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 59 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
may be an event that occurs during a washout period or that is related to a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760]. 
11.3.6 Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator will attempt to assess the relationship of the event to study drug using a 5-point 
scale (not related, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related; see 
Appendix F; Clinical Adverse Events: Determining Relationship to Study Drug). 
11.3.7 Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the Adverse Event page of the 
subject's eCRF during the subject's participation in the study. The severity of each AE will be 
graded using a 5-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, or death; see Appendix E). 
The date of onset as well as the end date of the event also should be recorded or the event should 
be entered as "ongoing". In addition, the method used to treat the AE and the outcome of the AE 
also will be noted. The investigator will assess the relationship of the event to study drug. 
11.3.8 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331357], the investigator should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135627]. This is the case in the following situations: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486501]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486502]. 
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a pre-existing condition that 
has not worsened does not count as an SAE. 
11.3.9 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
[IP_ADDRESS] Governing Regulatory Requirements 
Compliance with this request for prompt reporting is essential in that the sponsor is responsible 
for informing the US FDA as well as all other participating investigators of the event. 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 60 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
Under FDA ruling (Title 21 CFR Part 312.32) and the Guidance for Industry and Investigators 
Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies, the sponsor is required to submit 
written documentation, in the form of an IND safety report, detailing: 
• Any event associated with the use of the drug, that is both serious and unexpected, or 
• Any findings from clinical, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], or pooled analysis of multiple studies or any 
findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed 
to the drug. 
Written submission must be made by [CONTACT_486521] 15 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of notification of the 
event. Any unexpected death or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction must be reported to 
FDA no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. The 
sponsor shall also infoim all investigators. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Time-Frame for Reporting 
Any death, pregnancy, SAE, or unexpected (and severe) AE experienced by a subject after ICF 
or within [ADDRESS_625320] be promptly reported (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event) by e-mail to the sponsor (or sponsor's designee).

[IP_ADDRESS] Information to be Provided by [CONTACT_486523]. 
This requirement includes all SAEs that occur after the subject signs the ICF and through 
[ADDRESS_625323] number, an event description, SAE teim(s), onset date, the reason why the event 
is considered to be serious (i.e., the seriousness criteria) and the investigator's assessment of the 
relationship of the event to study treatment. Additional SAE information including medications 
or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, action taken with the study treatment due to 
the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event will be recorded on the SAE form. Forms for 
reporting SAEs will be provided to the study sites. 
In all cases, the investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. Furthermore, the investigator 
may be required to provide supplementary infoiniation as requested by [CONTACT_486524]. 
When reporting an SAE, the following additional points should be noted: 
• When the diagnosis of an SAE is known or suspected, the investigator should report 
the diagnosis or syndrome as the primary SAE term, rather than as signs or 
symptoms. Signs and symptoms may then be described in the event description. For 
Page 62 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 12 Mar 2019 Kadmon Corporation 
KDO25 	1ND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
example, dyspnea should not be used as an SAE term if the diagnosis which caused 
the dyspnea is known to be malignant pleural effusion. 
• Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE, unless 
the event preceding the death is unknown. In the exceptional case where the events 
leading to death are unknown, then death may be used as an event tetra. If an autopsy 
was performed, the autopsy report should be provided. 
• While most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143190], some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486503], as follows:

o Pre-specified study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486504] 
o Events that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486505] 24 hours and that do not require 
admission (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a 
diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics) 
• SAEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural complication 
resulting in prolongation of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Regulatory Reporting 
Kadmon Drug Safety (or designee) will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are 
received. For each SAE received, Kadmon will make a determination as to whether the criteria 
for expedited reporting have been met. 
Kadmon (or designee) will submit SAEs that meet the criteria for expedited reporting to the 
Regulatory Authorities in accordance with local regulations governing safety reporting. 
Reporting of SAEs by [CONTACT_486525]. Adequate documentation must be 
maintained showing that the IRB was properly notified.

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
All descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistical 
software (Version 9.4), unless otherwise noted. For categorical variables, the number and 
percent of each category within a parameter will be calculated for non-missing data. For 
continuous variables, the mean, median, and standard deviation (SD), as well as the minimum 
and maximum values, will be presented. 
Statistical significance will be declared when the p-value is found to be < 0.05, unless otherwise 
noted. Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated. All clinical data captured will 
be provided in data listings. 
Complete details of the planned analysis will be documented in the SAP. 
12.[ADDRESS_625327] observed measurement prior to the initial dose of KD025 will be considered the baseline 
measurement. 
Continuous data will be described using descriptive statistics: number of observations (n), mean, 
SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be used for 
summarizing discrete (categorical) data. When categorical data are presented, the percent will be 
suppressed when the count is zero in order to draw attention to the non-zero counts. The 
denominator for all percentages, unless otherwise specified, will be the number of subjects in the 
specified analysis population. Two-sided 95% confidence interval employing the exact binomial 
method will be provided for efficacy activity endpoints. 
Hypothesis testing, if appropriate, will be carried out at the 5% (2-sided) significance level. Due 
to the exploratory nature of the study, no adjustments may be made for the multiplicity of 
endpoints. Non-parametric tests may be used in preference to parametric tests if the underlying 
distributions of the data are not known. Missing values will not be imputed. If a subject does 
not have sufficient data for a particular analysis, then, that subject will be excluded from that

Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	lND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
analysis. Endpoints defined as an average of multiple measurements will be used for those data 
points that were non-missing, and the denominator will be adjusted accordingly. 
12.2 Sample Size Justification 
The sample size will be 110 subjects due to early study termination. 
12.3 Study Populations 
Two populations will be employed in the analysis of study data: 
• The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population will consist of all subjects who are 
randomized and take at least [ADDRESS_625328] in data listings. In addition, delays and all other alterations in KD025 
administration will be presented. 
12.6 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary and the data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_486529]. 
12.7 Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint for analyses will be the number (%) of subjects with a 
75% decrease in PAST by [CONTACT_10585] 16. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for analysis will include the following: 
Kadmon Corporation 12 Mar 2019 Page 66 of 90 
Confidential and Proprietary 
KDO25 	IND Number 120787 
Protocol Number KDO25-211 
1. A 50% reduction in Week 16 PASI score (PAST 50) 
2. The mean Week [ADDRESS_625329] 
3. Improvements in PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at Week 16 
4. Improvements in DLQI at Week 16 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints are: 
• To evaluate the concentration and changes in IL-17 expression in blood, tissue, 
and other biomarkers in punch biopsy after 16 weeks of dosing with KD025 
Efficacy analyses will be divided into 2 periods: the double-blind treatment period through 
database lock at Week 16 and the open-label, 32-week continuation period. 
Efficacy analyses will include the number (%) of subjects with a 75% decrease in PAST (number 
of subjects that reach PAST 75) at Week 16 in the KD025 treatment groups compared with the 
placebo group in a pairwise manner using a Fisher's Exact test. The number of subjects who 
reach PAST 50 at Week 16 will be analyzed similarly. Treatment group differences in DLQI and 
PGA changes from baseline to Week 16 will be assessed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect and a subject's baseline value as a covariate. 
No adjustments for multiplicity are being made for this Phase 2 study. 
For further details, see the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
12.8 Safety Data 
Safety assessments will include AEs, SAEs, PEs (including weight), vital sign measurements 
(including BP, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature), clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, lipid panel, TSH) ECGs, and reasons for 
treatment discontinuation due to toxicity. 
The primary safety endpoint will be the percentage of subjects in each treatment group 
experiencing AEs. 
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_486530] ®  SOC and preferred term, 
classified from verbatim terms (Version 18.1 or higher). The incidence and percentage of

number of events per preferred term will also be summarized. Causality (relationship to study 
treatment) will be summarized separately. 
AEs, SAEs, related AEs, related SAEs, > Grade 3 AEs, related > Grade 3 AEs, and AEs leading 
to withdrawal or treatment discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_486531]. AEs will also be presented in listings. Duration of AEs will be 
determined and included in listings, along with action taken and outcome. 
Laboratory results will be classified using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Studies (see Appendix A) and 
summarized. Incidence of laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The

Appendix C: Relative Physician's Global Assessment 
The relative PGA documents the physician's assessment of the subject's psoriasis status. 
Consideration should be given to the percent of body involvement as well as overall induration, 
scaling, and erythema. The PGA is assessed relative to baseline condition and is defined as: 
(1) = clear, (2) = excellent, (3) = good, (4) = fair, (5) = poor, and (6) = worse. The following 
table further defines the rating. 
Rating % Clearing Definition of Response 
1 = Clear 100% clear Some residual pi[INVESTIGATOR_486507]: 
Woronoff s ring may be present. 
2= Excellent 75 to 99% clearing Marked improvement: nearly normal skin 
texture; some erythema may be present. 
3 = Good 50 to 74% clearing Moderate improvement: plaque has cleared to 
point of small scattered papules with normal 
intervening epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. 
= 4 	Fair 25 to 49% clearing  Slight improvement: decrease in scaling and 
softening of plaque. 
5 = Poor 0 to 24% clearing Little or no change in scaling, erythema, or 
plaque elevation. 
6 = Worse Worse

Appendix F: Clinical Adverse Events: Determining Relationship to Study Drug 
1 	NOT RELATED 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are clearly felt to 
be due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) that are unrelated to the administration of 
study drug. 
2 	UNLIKELY RELATED (must have first 2) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are felt unlikely to 
be related to the administration of the study drug. The relationship of an AE to the study drug can 
be considered unlikely if: 
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could readily have been a result of the subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It does not follow a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
• It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re-administered. 
3 	POSSIBLY RELATED (must have first 2) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are felt unlikely to 
be related to the administration of the study drug, but the possibility cannot be ruled out with 
certainty. The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be considered possible if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could readily have been a result of the subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
4 	PROBABLY RELATED (must have first 3) 
This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration, are felt with a high 
degree of certainty to be related to the administration of the study drug. The relationship of an AE 
to the study drug can be considered probable if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
• It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction in dose.* 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug.

5 	DEFINITELY RELATED (must have first 3) 
This category applies to those AEs, which, after careful medical consideration, are felt to be 
related to the administration of the study drug. The relationship of an AE to the study drug can be 
considered related if: 
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or drug levels have 
been established in body fluids or tissues. 
• It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases upon cessation of drug or reduction on dose and appears upon 
rechallenge.* 
• It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug. 
*There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug 
relatedness clearly exists.

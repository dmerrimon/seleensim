More than one million patients present to US emergency departments (ED) annually to obtain relief from an 
acute migraine.1 Nearly twenty different medications are commonly used to treat acute migraine in the ED, yet 
the g
oal of sustained headache relief remains elusive.1,2 Fewer than 25% of ED migraine patients achieve 
fr
eedom from their headache and remain headache free for [ADDRESS_192745] been 
well established for migraine, this procedure is hypothesized to work by [CONTACT_166076] (TCC)The TCC is believed to be an important way station in migraine pathogenesis. 
Within the TNC, nociceptive input arriving from the trigeminal nerve is relayed to second order nerves that 
ter
minate in the thalamus. As with the trigeminal nerve, upper cervical nerves, including the greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_166057].  It is believed that nerve fibers originating from the upper cervical nerves 
converge on the same second order nerves as the trigeminal nerve fibers. Decreasing transmission of sensory

Methods. 
Study Overview:  This will be a randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing an active treatment of acute 
migraine versus placebo in an emergency department after the standard of care for acute migraine has already 
been administered. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine IRB will provide ethical oversight. The trial will be 
re
gistered at http:www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
Setting:  This study is to be performed in the emergency departments of Montefiore Medical Center. Salaried, 
trained, bilingual (English and Spanish) technician-level research associates, who execute research studies 
under the supervision of the principal investigators, staff the emergency department 24 hours per day/ seven 
days per week and will collect outcome data for this study. 
Selection of Participants: Eligible patients are adults who present with an acute moderate or severe headache 
meeting migraine headache criteria, as defined by [CONTACT_166079]-3β  
(
1.1, migraine without aura).4 Patients who meet criteria for Probable Migraine without Aura (1.5.1) will also be 
include
d, provided they have had at least one similar attack previously. Status migrainosus, prolonged duration 
of headache (>72 hours), or early presentation (<4 hours) do not preclude participation. Patients are to be 
enrolled if they fail first line parenteral migraine therapy. Specifically, we will require patients to have received 
metoclopramide for treatment of migraine during the ED visit and to request additional treatment for persistent 
moder
ate or severe headache. Patients will be excluded if informed consent cannot be obtained, if there is 
concern for a secondary cause of headache, if the maximum documented temperature is greater than 100.[ADDRESS_192747], suspected infection overlying injection site, 
known ble
eding disorder, ongoing use of anti-platelet agents including P2Y12 platelet inhibitors (clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 
prasugrel, ticagrelor), heparins, warfarin, or 10a inhibitors (rivaroxaban, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], edoxaban, fondaparinux), 
prior treatment with a greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992], pregnancy, or allergy, intolerance,or contra-indication to the 
study medication. Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_166080]. Alternatively, research personnel may identify potential participants by [CONTACT_166081], and asking the attending emergency physician if patients are appropriate for the study.  
Intervention:

Randomization and Blinding: Study participants and outcome assessors will be blinded. Because the technique 
will vary depending on assignment, the clinician performing the procedure will not be blinded.  A 
randomization list will be generated using an online generator at http://www.randomization.com . Participants 
will be assigned to active or sham arm in a 1:[ADDRESS_192749] 
blinding. We hope subjects are more likely to believe they got active agent if part of their scalp is numb. 
 
 
Methods of Measurement: As a primary measure of headache intensity, this study will utilize a standard ordinal 
headache intensity scale, in which subjects describe their headache as “severe”, “moderate”, “mild”, or “none”. 
We will also assess pain using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). This latter scale asks subjects to assign 
their 
pain a number between [ADDRESS_192750] satisfaction with the experimental treatment by [CONTACT_166082]
y want to receive the same treatment the next time they come to the ER with a migraine headache. 
Adverse events will be elicited using a dichotomous question (Did you have any side effects that were caused 
by [CONTACT_164532]?) followed by [CONTACT_166083] (Please tell us about the side effects you 
experienced).Light touch will be assessed in the C2 dermatome. If done correctly, patients will be numb in 
GON distribution and hopefully migraine free. The number of previous GONB performed will be recorded.  
Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the frequency of headache freedom (headache level = none) thirty 
minutes after completion of the procedure. Important secondary outcomes will be the frequency of sustained 
headache relief (achieving a pain level of mild or none within one hour of the procedure and maintaining a level 
of mild or none without the use of additional medication for 48 hours) and subject satisfaction, as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_166084], do you want to receive the same procedure the next time you come to 
the ER with migraine. We will also report the improvement in 0 – 10 pain scale between baseline and one hour 
a
nd the frequency of adverse events. 
Protocol:  After obtaining informed consent, a brief pain assessment will be performed. A clinician will then 
inject bilateral GONs (Appendix 1). Research associates will ascertain the patient’s headache level 15, 30, 60, 
a
nd [ADDRESS_192751]-injection. We will ask about the frequency of adverse events 30 minutes af ter  the 
injection. We will also perform an assessment of light touch and allodynia before and after the procedure 
(Appendix 2 and Figure). Research associates will contact [CONTACT_166085] 48 hours after ED discharge to 
ascertain headache status, satisfaction with treatment, and presence of adverse events.  
Sample Size calculation: We chose a frequency of headache freedom of 50% as the lowest frequency of success 
for which clinicians would be willing to perform this procedure. We hope to minimize the placebo effect on the 
primary outcome by [CONTACT_166086]. It is unlikely that a 
patient would progress from moderate/ severe headache to headache freedom within 30 minutes without 
intervention. We estimated a placebo rate of headache freedom of 20%. Using an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 
IRB NUMBER: 2015-4754
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/01/[ADDRESS_192752] provided 
primary outcome data.  
Analysis:  The primary outcome is the rate of headache freedom at 30 minutes. Absolute risk reduction and 
number needed to treat will be reported with 95%CI. All dichotomous secondary outcomes will be reported as 
frequencies with 95%CI. Improvement in numerical rating scale will be reported as mean with 95%CI. The 
primary goal of this analysis is to demonstrate efficacy. If we do not demonstrate statistically significant 
differences but do see a signal through the noise, we will use the point estimates to decide the feasibility of 
another study. We will determine the between-group difference (absolute risk reduction) in rates of headache 
freedom and report this with 95%CI.  
 
Data safety and monitoring :The goal of the data safety committee will be to review study protocol and adverse 
events on an ongoing basis to determine if risk to subjects can be minimized further without compromising 
study integrity. Because the overall sample size is relatively small and it will be important to report our findings 
with sufficient precision, the study will not be halted early for efficacy or futility. 
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Section  
  
(i) A description of the types of data or events that will be captured by [CONTACT_166087]: 
- What safety information will be collected: Adverse events will be collected in the ED and at 48 hour 
follow- up by [CONTACT_7939] a screening question: “Did you experience any side effects from the medication” 
followed by [CONTACT_3440]-ended query to have the patient explain.  
- How safety information will be collected: Subject Interview  
- When data will be collected: In ED, every 30 minutes, and by [CONTACT_756] 48 hours later .

Appendix 2. Assessment of light touch and allodynia  
Prior to procedure and 15 minutes after the procedure, research associates will assess light touch sensation and 
allodynia in 6 locations around the scalp: bilateral forehead, bilateral upper posterior scalp, and bilateral lower 
posterior scalp overlying the injection site (see figure). Using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166075], research associates will gently 
stroke
 each area 4 times and ask two questions: 1) Did you feel that? 2) Did that hurt?

RATIONA LE
Protocol WA42380 has been amended to better align with the statistical analysis plan
(SAP) . Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are 
summarized below:
An additional secondary efficacy endpoint of time to recovery was added to facilitate
comparison with other trials of treatments for COVID -19(Sections 2.1.2 and 6.4.2) .
Text on the sample size and power calculation was updated to incorporate the 
increased enrollment target to maintain 90% power for the primary endpoint, as 
described in the SAP (Sections 3.1, 4.1, 6.1, 9.5) .  The potential for an increase in 
enrollment was included in Version 2 of the protocol, and the confirmation of 
increased enrollment was communicated to sites, Agencies, and ethics committees 
in the week of 4 May 2020.
The geographic stratification factors were updated to address the inclusion of only 
North American and Europe because no sites outside of these regions were 
included in the study (Sections 3.1, 4.2.1, 6.1, 6.4.2) .
Text on the reporting of pregnancies in pa rtner of male patients was removed to 
align with the informed consent form and recommendations for tocilizumab in other 
indications (Section 5.4.3).
The method of analysis for the primary endpoint was updated to utilize a 
non-parametric method that was det ermined to be a more appropriate method, as 
described in the SAP (Sections 6.1 and 6.4.1) .  
The method of analysis for the secondary endpoint of clinical status at additional 
timepoints was updated to utilize a non -parametric method that was determined to
be a more appropriate method, as described in the SAP (Section 6.4.2) .
Selected secondary efficacy endpoints were specified as key secondary endpoints 
to address Type I error control, as described in the SAP (Section 6.4.2).
For clarity and as described in the SAP, l anguage on the planned interim analyses 
was updated to address the increased enrollment target to maintain 90% power for 
the primary endpoint and the criteria for not conducting the interim analyses 
(Section 6.9). 
Additional minor changes ha ve been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

STUDY DESIGN
Description of the Study
This is a Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -contro lled, multicenter study to assess 
the efficacy and safety of TCZ in combination with SOC compared with matching placebo in 
combination with SOC in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899683] -[ADDRESS_1261378] 18 years of age with confirmed SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19)infection per 
WHO criteria, including a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], blood, urine, stool, 
other bodily fluid).  At the time of enrollment, patients must have SpO 293% or PaO 2/FiO 2
300 mmHg despi[INVESTIGATOR_899684], which may include anti -viral treatment, low dose steroids, 
and supportive care.
Patients in whom, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], progression to death is imminent and 
inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded 
from the study.  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, 
or other infection (besides COVID- 19) will be excluded from the study.  
Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening at a 2:[ADDRESS_1261379] be given in 
combination with SOC.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1617] (North 
America andEurope )andmechanical ventilation ( yes, no). The proportion of patients who are 
on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of 
the overall study  population .
Patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg, with a maximum 
dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the placebo arm will receive one infusion of placebo, 
both in addition to SOC.  
For both arms, if the clinical signs or sy mptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by 
[CONTACT_899701] a one -category worsening on the 7- categor y ordinal scale of clinical 
status), one additiona l infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8 –24 hours 
after the initial infusion. 
Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may  qualify 
for one re -screening opportunity (for a total of 2 sc reenings per participant) at the investigator’s 
discretion.  Patients are not required to re -sign the consent form if they are re -screened within 
7days after previously signing the consent form.    
The study assessments to be conducted include the follow ing: physical examination, vital signs, 
oxygen saturation, assessment of consciousness, presence and absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], 
adverse events, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical laboratory tests, and nasophar yngeal swabs.  
Patients will be followed up for a total of [ADDRESS_1261380] weekly if 
possible; other follow -up visits may  be conducted by [CONTACT_591529] .  Patients should 
return to the site for a Day [ADDRESS_1261381] follow up visits on 
Day 35, Day 45, and Day 60; the Day [ADDRESS_1261382] supportive care will be given according to clinical practice.

14/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Number of Patients
This study aims to enroll approximately 450hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249107] -[ADDRESS_1261383] meet the following criteria for study entry:
Signed Informed Consent Form by  [CONTACT_899702] g consent, or, when the 
patient is not capable of giving consent, by [CONTACT_95272]/authorized representative
Age 18 years at time of signing Informed Consent Form
Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] w ith COVID -19 pneumonia confirmed per a positive PCR of any specimen 
(e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid) and evidenced by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray or CT 
scan 
SpO 293% or PaO2/FiO 2300 mmHg 
If a patient is on supplemental oxygen with SpO 293%, but desaturation to 93% on 
lower supplemental oxygen or ambient air is documented during screening , the 
inclusion criterion is met.
For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% 
per year during the treatment period and for 90days after the final dose of study drug.  
Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery 
(i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], and/or uterus) or another cause as 
determined by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of 
childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include bilateral 
tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, 
hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.
The reliab ility of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of 
the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal 
are not adequate methods of contraception.  If required per local guidelines or 
regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information 
about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.
For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a 
condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:
With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must 
remain abstine nt or use a condom during the treatment period and for 60days after 
the final dose of study  drug to avoid exposing the embryo.  Men must refrain from 
donating sperm during this same period.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relat ion to the duration of 
the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal 
are not adequate methods of preventing drug exposure.  If required per local 
guidelines or regulations, information about the reliability of abstinence will be 
described in the local Informed Consent Form.
Exclusion Criteria
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:
Known severe allergic reactions to TCZ or other monoclonal antibodies

randomizat ion (investigational COVID -19 antivirals may be permitted after consultation with 
the Medical Monitor )
Any serious medical condition or abnormality of clinical laborator y tests that, in the 
investigator ’s judgment, precludes the patient’s safe participatio n in and completion of the 
study
End of Study
The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs or the 
date at which the last data point required for last follow -up is received from the last patient, 
whichever occ urs later.  The end of the study is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_1261385] (Investigational Drug)
Patients assigned to the active arm will receive one or two doses of tocilizumab (TCZ) via IV 
infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg IV to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1261386] of care using the following endpoint:
Clinical status assessed using a 7- category ordinal scale at Day 28 
Assessment of patient status using an ordinal scale will be recorded a t baseline and daily in the 
morning (between 8 am and 12 pm) while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The ordinal scale categories are as

vasopressors, renal replacement therapy)
7.Death
The estimand is the difference in distributions between TCZ plus SOC and placebo plus SOC ,
which will be tested using a non -parametric method, the Van Eltere n test, including the 
stratification factors at randomization (region [North America, Europe] and mechanical 
ventilation [yes, no]).  The median ordinal scale result for each treatment group and the 
corresponding 95% CI for the median will be presented alo ng with the Van Elteren p -value, 
as well as the difference in medians and a 95% CI for the difference.
Further details of the primary endpoint analysis will be included in the SAP.
As an additional analysis, the clinical status according to the 7 -category ordinal scale will be  
compared between the TCZ group and the placebo group at Day 28, using a proportional odds 
model accounting for stratification factors at randomization in the model (region [North 
America, Europe] and mechanical ventilation [yes, no] ).  The odds ratio, p -value, and 95% 
confidence interval will be presented.
For patients who withdraw before D ay 28, their last post baseline ordinal categor y prior to 
withdrawal will be used in the analysis.  Any other missing data handling rules for the p rimary  
endpoint will be specified in the SAP.
Determination of Sample Size  
The estimated sample size was determined for the primary  endpoint of comparison of clinical 
status based on a 7-category ordinal scale at D ay [ADDRESS_1261387] . 
The t otal m ITT sample size of 450with a 2:1 randomization of TCZ to placebo patients provides 
approximately 90% power to detect a difference in distribution between the treatment groups 
of the ordinal scale at Day [ADDRESS_1261388] at the 5 % significance level 
under the following assumptions of the expected probability distribution of patients in the 
placebo arm:
1 (discharge) 2 3 4 5 6 7 (death)
0.58 0.05 0.09 0.09 0.02 0.02 0.15
And, a ssuming proportional odds with an odds ratio of 2 , the expected distribution in the TCZ 
arm with would be:
1 (discharge) 2 3 4 5 6 7 (death)
0.734 0.039 0.064 0.058 0.012 0.012 0.081
In addition, this sample size provides approximately 90% power to detect a ratio of 2 (TCZ to 
PBO) for the odds of being in a category or a better using a proportional odds model with a 
two-sided p -value at the 5% significance level.
Assuming proportional odds and the given distribution of the placebo group, the smallest odds 
ratio that could be statistically significant wou ld be approximately 1.5 .
This sample size also provides approximately 90% power to detect a 10% absolute difference 
in mortalit y rate under the assumption of a 15% mortality rate in the placebo group.
Planned Interim A nalyses
Up to three interim looks for efficacy will be carried out on the data with mortality rate at 28 days 
(secondary endpoint) evaluated for interim efficacy  analy ses.  The interim looks will occur after 
roughly 111, 222, and 333patients are enrolled, but all interims a re subject to change 
depending on enrollment. If the sample size is increased during the study ,the remaining 
efficacy  interims will be performed at similar proportions of information to the original planned 
efficacy  interim analyses.
The first efficacy  interim analy sis will be conducted when approximately 111patients ( 74TCZ 
and 37placebo) have reached the 28- day follow -up time point and will be based on the 
mortality rate at 28 day s (secondar y endpoint).  If the results of one of the interim analyses 
meets the pre- specified criteria for efficacy , further enrollment in the placebo arm will be 
discontinued and all enrolled patients will receive open -label TCZ.  At this point ,efficacy  will be 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
17/Protocol WA42380, Version 3declared.  If the study is at least 90% enrolled within 5 weeks (28 days follow up plus 1 week 
to perform the analysis) of the 111th patient being enrolled, then no interim analyses will be 
conducted.
If there is a potential for further recruitment into the placebo arm to be stopped for positive 
efficacy  because of t he interim analysis, the type I error rate will be controlled to ensure 
statistical validity is maintained.  Specifically, the Lan -DeMets -spending function that 
approximates the O ’Brien -Fleming boundary will be applied to determine the critical value for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_294775] (DeMets and Lan 1994).  Interim analyses 
for efficacy  will use the Fisher’s exact test for difference in proportions and will utilize an 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending function.  The efficacy boundaries for the z -scores at the four 
looks (three interim looks and final analysis) are4.364, 2.986, 2.377, and 2.[ADDRESS_1261389] Lan -DeMets methodology.
The study management team will remain blinded unless the results meet the efficacy  criteria. 
The interim  efficacy  analyses will be produced by a statistical programmer independent of the 
study management team and will reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
Full statistical details of the planned interim analyses, along with the rationale and timing w ill be 
documented in an interim statistical analysis plan, which will be made available to the relevant 
health authorities before the data snapshot for the first interim.
A Data Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and proce dures 
detailed in a DMC Charter.  Regular safety reviews will begin after approximately 15 patients 
(10 TCZ, 5 placebo) have been enrolled and reached 14-day follow -up.  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_899685].  The safety interim analyses will also be conducted by a statistical programmer 
independent from the study management team and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1363].  Interactions 
between the DMC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the DMC Charter.
The Data Monitoring Committee may  initially consist of Sponsor representatives not involved in 
any operational aspects of the study before transitioning to a fully independent data monitoring 
committee (iDMC) when feasible.

1.1 BACKGROUND ON COVID -19 PNEUMONIA
Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive- stranded RNA viruses , named for thecrown -like 
appearance of their spi[INVESTIGATOR_249103].  They are a large family 
of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases 
such as Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (MERS -CoV) and severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_244089] (SARS -CoV).  
COVID -19, which is the acronym of “coronavirus disease 2019 ,
”is caused by a novel
coronavirus strain (SARS -CoV- 2) and was newly named on 11 February 2020 by [CONTACT_38771] ( WHO). An epi[INVESTIGATOR_899686], the largest metropolitan area in 
China ’s Hubei province, and was reported to the W HO Country Office in China on 
December 31, 2019.  A pandemic was subsequently declared by [CONTACT_941] W HO on 11 March 
2020 .
According to the WHO, as of 12 April 2020 over 1,600 ,000 cases of COVID -19 were 
reported inover 200countries and territories worldwide, withover 105,0 00deaths (WHO 
2020a) .  Up to ~20% of infected patients experience dcomplicat ions related to a severe 
form of inter stitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS) and/or multi organ failure (MOF) and death (WHO 2020b) .
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine shown to be effecti ve in
prevent ingor treat ingCOVID -19. Most patients with mild cases of disease recover with 
symptomatic treatment and supportive care. However, patients with more severe illness 
frequently require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094](WHO 2020 b).
1.2 BACKGROUND ON TOCILIZUMA B
Tocilizumab ( TCZ)is a recombinant humanized, anti -human monoclonal antibody of the 
IgG1 subclass directed against soluble and membrane- bound IL -6R.  TCZ binds 
specifically to both soluble IL -6R (sIL -6R) and membrane -bound IL- 6R and has been 
shown to inhibit both soluble and membrane -bound IL -6Rmediated signaling.  IL -6 is a 
pleiotropic proinflammatory multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cell types
andhas been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T -cell 
activation ; induction of acute phase proteins; stimulation of hem atopoietic precursor cell 
growth and differentiation; proliferation of hepatic, dermal, and neural cells; bone 
metabolism ;lipid metabolism ;hepatoprotection ;and fibrosis.  Elevated tissue and serum 
levels of IL -[ADDRESS_1261392] been implicated in the disease pathology of several inflammatory and 
autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Castleman disease, systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), giant 
cell arteritis ( GCA) , Takayasu arteritis (TAK), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and cytokine-
release syndrome (CRS). Inhibition of the biological activity of IL -6 or IL -6R has been 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
21/Protocol WA42380, Version 3effective in the treatment of these disorders ,including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
T-cell induced CRS, for which treatment with TCZ has been approved in many countries. 
TCZ has IV and SC formulations.  Some of the above -listed indications (RA, sJIA, and 
pJIA) have received approval for both the IV and SC formulati ons, whereas others have 
received approval exclusively for the IV (Castleman disease and CRS) or the SC (GCA 
and TAK) formulation .  
The estimated cumulative clinical trial exposure to tocilizumab from the DIBD (28 April 
1997) and until 10 April 2019 (DLP for PBRER) is 24,826 patients ([ZIP_CODE].98 patient 
years [PY]). Since the IBD (11 April 2005), the estimated cumulative market exposure to 
tocilizumab until 10 April 2019 is 1,301,050 patients (1,053,779 PY). The combined 
cumulative post -marketing exposure of patients to IV tocilizumab is estimated to be 
896,672 patients (726,347 PY). The combined cumulative postmarketing exposure of 
patients to SC tocilizumab is 404,378 (327,432 PY).

CAR T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_249108]. Characteristics of CRS include 
fever, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy, hypotension, tachycardia, coagul opathy, 
nausea, capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], and multi -organ dysfunction. The reported incidence of CRS 
after CAR T- cell therapy ranges from 50% to 100%, with 13% to 48% of patients 
experiencing the severe or life -threatening form. Serum levels of inflammatory cytoki nes 
are elevated, particularly interleukin -6 (IL- 6). The severity of symptoms may correlate 
with the serum cytokine concentrations and the duration of exposure to the inflammatory 
cytokines.
On August 30, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approv ed tocilizumab 
(Actemra)for the treatment of severe or life -threatening CAR T cell -induced CRS in 
adults and in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. The approved dose is 8 mg/kg 
for body weight 30kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight 30 kg.  Up to three additional 
doses may be given if no improvement of sign/symptoms ,and the interval between the 
subsequent dose sshould be at least 8 hours .  
The approval of TCZ was based on a retrospective analysis of data for patients treated 
with TCZ who developed CRS after treatment with tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) or 
axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) i n prospective clinical trials , (Le et al. 2018 ). Thirty-
one out of the 45 patients (69%) from the CTL019 series achieved a response (defined 
as being afebrile and off vasopressors for at least [ADDRESS_1261394] 
dose of TCZ (maximum up to two doses) and without use of additional treatment other 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
22/Protocol WA42380, Version 3than corticosteroids) within [ADDRESS_1261395] dose to response was 4 days. Eight of the 15 patients (53%) from the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel series achieved a response, and the median time to response 
was 4.[ADDRESS_1261396] dose of TCZ, and duration of CRS 
prior to treatment with TCZ.  There were no reports of adverse reactions attributable to 
TCZ.
Pharmacokinetic ( PK)data were available for [ADDRESS_1261397] dose of TCZ and 
for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ.  Based on 131 PK observations, the 
geometric mean (% CV) maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with CAR T cell 
induced, severe or life -threatening CRS was 99.5 g/mL (36.8%) after the first infusion 
and 160.7 g/mL (113.8%) after the second infusion. The PK modeling analysis showed 
that patients with CRS had a faster clearance of TCZ than healthy volunteers and other 
patient populations, and simulations showed th at exposure was considered acceptable 
with up to four doses of TCZ at least 8 hours apart in patients with CRS.
TCZ is also approved for CAR -T induced severe or life- threatening CRS in theEuropean 
Union and certain other countries.
1.4 REA L WORLD EXPERIENCE WITH T OCILIZUMA BIN COVID -19 
PNEUMONIA
Physicians in China initiated the off-label us eof TCZ in the treatment of COVID -19 
pneumonia. Based on the results of an initial 21- patient retrospective study in which 
patients with severe or critical COVID -19 pneum onia were treated with TCZ (Xu et al. 
2020), a n investigator -sponsored randomized, controlled trial (n = 188) has been
initiated in the same population in China, testing the same TCZ dose regimen and is 
currently ongoing, with approximately 70 patients enrolled.  At present, the 21 -patient 
publication (Xu et al. 2020) is the only published clinical data the Sponsor is aware of 
regarding the use of TCZ in the treatm ent of COVID -19 pneumonia.  
On 3 March 2020, TCZ was included in the seventh updated diagnosis and treatment 
plan for COVID -19 issued by [CONTACT_899703] -19 pneumonia .  The Chinese Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention defined disease severity according to the following
criteria :
Severe disease: dyspnea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_249109] 30/min, blood oxygen saturation 
(SpO 2) 93%, PaO2/FiO 2ratio ( the ratio between the blood pres sure of the oxygen 
[partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2 ]and the percentage of oxygen supplied [fraction 
of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401], FiO 2]) 300mmHg , and/or lung infiltrates 50% within 24 to 
48 hours; this occurred in 14% of cases.
Critical disease: respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction 
(MOD) or failure (MOF); this occurred in 5% of cases ( Wu et al. 2020 ).  
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
23/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Because body weight measurement is not always feasible in urgent circumstances , the
dose regimen used in China is a single fix ed dose of 400 mg TCZ IV (which equates to 
between 4 8 mg/kg based on the body weight range of the Chinese adult population), 
with the maximum single dose no more than 800 mg . Ifclinical signs/symptoms donot 
improve ,an additional dose can be administer ed after 12 hours. The guidance advise s
that no more than two doses should be given. TCZ treatment is not permitted for people 
with active infections including TB, bacterial ,or fung al.  
Results from 21 Patients Treated with Tocilizumab in China
In Feb ruary 2020, twenty -one patients with severe or critical COVID -19 pneumonia were 
treated with TCZ IV (400 mg) plus standard of care. The average age of the patients 
was 56.8 16.5 years, ranging from 25 to 88 years. Seventeen patients (81.0%) were 
assess ed as severe and four(19.0%) as critical.  Most patients (85%) presented with 
lymphopenia.  C -reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased in all 20 patients (mean, 
75.06 66.80 mg/L).  The median procalcitonin (PCT) value was 0.33 0.78 ng/mL, and 
only two of 20 patients (10.0%) presented with an abnormal value.  Mean IL -6 level 
before TCZ was 132.38 278.54 pg/mL (normal 7pg/mL).
Standard of care consisted of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], methylprednisolone, other symptom relievers ,
and oxygen therapy as recommended by [CONTACT_899704] (Sixth Edition). All [ADDRESS_1261398] image wor sening. 
Eighteen patients (85.7%) received TCZ once, and three patients (14.3%) had a second 
dose due to fever within 12 hours.  According to the authors, after TCZ treatment, fever 
returned to normal and all other symptoms improved remarkably. Fifteen of the 20 
patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient needed no oxygen 
therapy.  CT scans showed significant remission of opacities in both lungs in 19/20 
patients (90.5%) after treatment with TCZ.  The percentage of lymphocyte s in peripheral 
blood, which was decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 
15.52 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after 
treatment.   Abnormally elevated CRP decreased significantly in 84.2% pati ents (16/19).  
No adverse drug reactions and no subsequent pulmonary infections were reported.  
Nineteen patients (90.5%) were discharged at the time of the report, including two critical 
patients.  There were no deaths among the 21 treated patients.
The study authors concluded that TCZ is an effective treatment for patients with severe 
COVID -19 (Xu et al .2020 ).

In addition, the Sponsor may decide to terminate the study at any time.
The total length of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is 
expected to be approximately 6 months.
Patients with evidence of lung fibrosis will be referred to their regular healthcare provider 
for further follow up.
3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for Tocilizumab Dose and Schedule
At baseline, patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receiv e one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg
IV, with a maximum dose of 800 mg . If the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not 
improve (reflected by [CONTACT_899701] a one -category worsening on the 
7-category ordinal scale of clinical status ),one additio nal infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg IV can 
be given, 8– 24 hours after the initial infusion. 
The TCZ dose regimen chosen in this study for adult patients is consistent with the 
approved TCZ dose for patients experiencing CRS induced by [CONTACT_81418]- T cell therapy who 
weigh 30kg.  Further, based on the off-label experience from China (one additional 
dose if fever is not improved within 12 hours ) and the fact that up to three additional 

Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
29/Protocol WA42380, Version 3infusions of TCZ (with at least 8 hours in between infusions) are allowed for CAR -T 
induced CRS, the proposed additional one infusion if clinical signs/symptoms worsen or 
do not improve is justified. 
Patients will be followed -up for a period of 60 days from randomization .This period is 
supported by [CONTACT_899705](study LRO300 and LRO301) where the mean apparent half -life was determined by 
[CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis and ranged from 7 to 8 days following a si ngle dose of 10 
mg/kg IV or multiple doses of 8 mg/kg IV Q4 W. Moreover, modeling of free sIL6R levels 
over time, as the principal marker of target engagement, showed that soluble receptors 
returned to their maximum level after 4 weeks following a single administration of 8 
mg/kg IV, demonstrating the absence of drug binding and therefore of drug effect after 4 
weeks (Gibiansky and Frey 2012) .
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population
Based on the current knowledge of COVID -19, approximately 80% of patients infected
with SARS- CoV- 2 (COVID- 19)experience mild disease and can recover at home and 
require only simple symptomatic relief .  However, approximately 20% require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249116] .  A study o f138 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_401536] -19 published on 7 February 2020 found that 26% of patients admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899687] (ICU) and 4.3% died ;however, given that a 
number of patients were still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249119] ,this number may be 
an underestimate (Wang et al. 2020) .  A previous study had found that out of 41 
admitted hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20889], 13 (32%) were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died (Huang 
et al. 2020 ).A more recent study with 1099 patients indicated that 16% of patients 
developed asevere form of disease, 5% were admitted to an ICU, 2.3% underwent 
invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died (Guan et al .2020).
Given the significant unmet need in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899688] D-19, and 
based on the emerging evidence for TCZ use in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia , this 
study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ in this population.  Morbidity 
and mortality are particularly high for elderly patients and those with comorbidities. This 
study will include both these groups, with no upper age limit.  
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group
The study willcompare the efficacy and safety of TCZ IV compared with matching 
placebo in combination with SOC . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_899689] -19, 
SOC for patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia generally includ essupportive care
and may include available anti -viral agents and low-dose corticosteroids as dictated by 
[CONTACT_303808] . Therefore, SOC plus placebo treatment isappropriate as a 
control in this study . 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
30/Protocol WA42380, Version 33.3.[ADDRESS_1261408] activation (Xu et al. 2020). Therefore, all 
patients may not be equally likely to benefit from treatment with TCZ.  Pharmacodynamic
biomarkers will be assessed to demonstrate evidence of biologic activity of TCZ in 
patients, to support selection of a recommended dose and dosing regim en, and to inform 
potential revisions to the PK sample collection schedule. The exploratory biomarkers 
will be assessed to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to TCZ, to 
characterize TCZ mechanism of action, to provide further evidence ofTCZ efficacy, and 
to understand progression of COVID -19.
4. MATERI ALS AND METHOD S
4.[ADDRESS_1261409] meet the following criteria for study entry:
Signed Informed Consent Form by [CONTACT_591530], or, whe n
the patient is not capable of giving consent, by [CONTACT_95272]/authorized 
representative
Age 18 years at time of signing Informed Consent Form
Ability to com ply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 pneumonia confirmed per a positive PCR of any 
specimen (e.g.,respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid) and evidenced by 
[CONTACT_13190] X-ray or CT scan 
SpO 293% or PaO2/FiO 2300 mmHg
If a patient is on supplemental oxygen with SpO 293%, but desaturation 
to93% on lower supplemental oxygen or ambient air is documented during 
screening , the inclusion criterion is met .
For women of childbearing potential:  agre ement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of1% per year during the treatment period and for 90days after the final dose 
of study drug.  Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], 
and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by [CONTACT_899706] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
31/Protocol WA42380, Version 3(e.g., Mülleria n agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.  
Ifrequired per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate 
methods of co ntraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will 
be described in the local Informed Consent Form.
For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sp erm, as defined below:
With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men 
must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 
60days after the final dose of study drug to avoid exposing the embryo.  Men 
must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of preventing drug 
exposure.  If required per local guidelines or regulations, information about the 
reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Inform ed Consent Form.
4.1.2 Exclusion Criteria

been completed, and eligibility has been established for a patient, the study site will 
obtain the patient's identification number and treatment assignment from an interactive 
voice or web -based response system (IxRS).
Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:  TCZ in combination 
with SOC or placebo in combination with SOC .  Randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio
through use of a permuted -block randomization method to ensure a balanced 
assignment to each treatment arm.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_555768] (North America andEurope) andmechanical ventilation (yes, no) .The proportion
of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be 
capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population . 
4.2.2 Blinding
Study site personnel and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment during the 
study.  The Sp onsor and its agents will also be blinded to treatment assignment, with the 
exception of individuals who require access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill 
their job roles during a clinical trial. These roles include the unblinding group 
responsible, clinical supply chain managers, sample handling staff, operational assay 
group personnel, IxRS service provider, and Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC )
members .
While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to 
maintain th e blinding of treatment assignment, PK results for these patients are 
generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of the study data.  
Laboratories responsible for performing study drug PK assays will be unblinded to 
patient treatment assignments to identify appropriate samples for analysis.  PK samples 
from patients assigned to the comparator arm will not be analyzed for study drug PK 
concentration except by [CONTACT_32236] (e.g. to evaluate a possible error in dosing).  In addition, 
[COMPANY_002] mo nitors, project statisticians ,and the project team will be blinded from PK and 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
33/Protocol WA42380, Version 3PDresults (including IL -6, sIL -6R,and CRP) until the primary analysis .Study centers 
may be unblinded after the final study results arereported.
If unblinding is necessary for a medical emergency (e.g., in the case of a serious 
adverse event for which patient management might be affected by [CONTACT_123514]), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by 
[CONTACT_123517].  The investigator is not required to contact [CONTACT_123516]; however, the treatment code should not be broken 
except in emergency situations.
As per health authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor 's Drug Safety representative
will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
(see Section 5.7) that are considered by [CONTACT_123518].  The patient may continue to receive treatment, and the investigator , patient, 
and Sponsor personnel, with the exception of the Drug Safety representative and 
personnel who must have access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill their roles 
(as defined above), will remain blinded to treatment assignment.

4.4 CONCOMITA NT THERA PY
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-
counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements , 
investigational anti -viral agent s, blood products ) used by a patient in addition to protocol -
mandated treatment from 7days prior to initiation of study drug to the study 
compl etion/discontinuation visit.  All such medications should be reported to the 
investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.
4.4.[ADDRESS_1261417] of care may include anti -viral treatment, low-dose steroids, 
and supportive care.
Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) is permitted as part of 
local practice. The recommended maximum dose of c hloroquine is [ADDRESS_1261418] the use of 
corticosteroids in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia. However, country -and 
region- specific guidelines recommend considering corticosteroids in some COVID -19 
patients.  This protocol allows the use of low -dose steroids as part of local SOC. If 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
36/Protocol WA42380, Version 3steroids are given , the Sponsor recommends a dose of no more than 1mg/kg 
methylprednisolone or equivalent for no more than 5 days.
In general, investigators should manage a patient 'scare with supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_40801], per local standard practice.  Patients who experience 
infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2-receptor antagoni sts (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine ), 
or equivalent medications per local standard practice.  Serious infusion associated 
events manifested by , for example, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, 
tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_226800] (e.g., supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic 
agonists).
4.4.2 Cautionary  Therapy
[IP_ADDRESS] Medications Given w ith Precaution due to Effects Related to 
CYP Enzy mes
The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by [CONTACT_86618] 
(e.g., IL -6) during chronic inflammation.  Therefore, for molecules that antagonize 
cytokine activity, such as TCZ, it is expected that the formation of CYP450 enzymes 
could be normalized.  When starting TCZ therapy, patients taking medications that are 
individually dose adjusted and metabolized by [CONTACT_249165]450, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or 
CYP2C9 (e.g., atorvast atin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, 
cyclosporin, or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) are recommended to be monitored as doses may need 
to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic effect.  
The above list of medications is not necessarily comprehensive.  The investigator should 
consult the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication 
can be safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_249166].
[IP_ADDRESS] Herbal Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_204719], safety profiles, and potential drug drug interactions are generally 
unknown.
4.4.3 Prohibited Therapy
Use of the fo llowing concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_123420]:
Treatment with any investigational agent (except for SARS- CoV- 2 [COVID -19]
anti-viral agent s with approval of Medical Monitor ), cell -depleting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], biologic 
agents (e.g., tumor necrosis factor antagonists or IL-6/IL-6R therapi[INVESTIGATOR_899690], siltuximab), Janus kinase inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib), alkylating 
agents (e.g., chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide), thalidomide, IV gamma globulin, 
anti-thymocyte globulin, and az athioprine during the study
Bone marrow transplantation with total lymphoid irradiation during the study

4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The sequence of assessments at each visit will be standardized as follows (at visits 
required in the schedules of assessments).
1.Efficacy assessments:  clinical status, clinical signs and symptoms , oxygen 
saturation
2.Safet y assessments:  vital signs, review of adverse events, concomitant 
medications
3.Laboratory samples:  on days when study drug is administered, all samples 
(including  predose PK, safety and biomarkers ) must be taken within 4hours prior 
tostudy drug treatment, except for postdose samples for PK analyses, which will be 
obtained after study drug treatment.  
4.IV infusion of TCZ/placebo (only at baseline and an additional dose if needed)
5.Safety assessments; v ital signs post TCZ (if applicable)
Schedules of assessments are found in Appendix 1,Appendix 2, and Appendix 3.
If patients are discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] 28, follow -up visits should occur 
twice weekly through Day 28. Patients are encouraged to return for onsite visit sat least 
weekly if possible; other follow -up visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_591529] . 
Patients should return to the site for a Day [ADDRESS_1261419] follow -up visits on Day 35, Day 45, and Day 60; the Day [ADDRESS_1261420] be obtained before 
performing any study -related procedures (including screening evaluations) . In the 
pandemic situation where access to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249129] ,if allowed ,verbal consent can 
be obtained from the patient’s legally authorized representative and must be 
documented by [CONTACT_899707].   Informed Consent Forms 
for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the study site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before enrollment .  The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
38/Protocol WA42380, Version 34.5.2 Medical History , Baseline Conditions, Concomitant Medication,
and Demographic Data
Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history ,
home oxygen use, will be recorded at baseline.  In addition, all medications 
(e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic 
remedies, nutriti onal supplements) used by [CONTACT_25701] [ADDRESS_1261421] dose of 
study drug will be recorded.  At the time of each follow -up physical examination, an 
interval medical history should be obtained and any changes in medications and 
allergies should be recorded.
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination, performed at screening, should include an evaluation 
of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, 
musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at unscheduled 
postbaseline visits as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should 
be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should 
be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
In addition, patient body weight will be measured at the timepoints specified in the 
schedule of activities (see Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3).If it is not feasible 
to wei ghbed-bound patients, historical body weight may be used.
4.5.4 Vital Signs and Oxy gen Saturation
Vital signs will include measurements of respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse ra te, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature.   Peripheral oxygen saturation should 
also be measured at the same time as the vitals.  For patients requiring supplemental 
oxygen, the oxygen flow rate (L/min) and/or fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO2) should be 
recorded. 
In order to allow assessment of th e NEW S2 score (see section 4.5.5 ), all of the vital sign 
parameters and oxygen saturation should be recorded together twice per day , with 
approximately 12hours inbetween, for the duration of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899691] . This is toensure that the measurements reflect the patient’s condition over the 
entire study day, where possible. If vital signs or oxygen saturation are measured more 
than once during a [ADDRESS_1261422] values (highest temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862],and heart rate ;lowest blood pressure ,oxygen saturation, and consciousness level ) 
during that period should be recorded on the eCRF. Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899692] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
39/Protocol WA42380, Version 3parameters should be recorded once at each return visit to the clinic. Vital sig ns and 
oxygen saturation will not be recorded if follow -up visits are conducted by [CONTACT_756]. 
Record abnormalities observed at baseline on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  At subsequent visits, record new or worsened clinically s ignificant 
abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF.
4.5.5 Assessments Specific to National Early  Warning Score 2
In addition to the vital measurements, the patient’s consciousness level and the 
presence or absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_249131]. The NE WS2 parameter 
for respi[INVESTIGATOR_95242] “oxygen” and can include other 
forms of ventilation to maintain oxygen saturation (see Appendix 4).  The form of 
ventilation used should be recorded on the eCRF.
These should be recorded at the same time points as the vital sign measurements (see 
Section 4.5.4 andAppendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3).
NEW S2 values do not need to be calculated by [CONTACT_779], b ut will be calculated 
electronically by [CONTACT_249168]2 related 
assessments recorded by [CONTACT_249169]. 
4.5.6 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be measured by [CONTACT_3885]'s local 
laboratory :
Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2, if arterial blood gases are performed during 
screening or follow -up)
Hematology: W BC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, 
differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes) , and 
lymphocyte subsets (T cells, Bcells,and NK cells; if the test is available at the site )
Chemistry panel (serum or plasma): bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (if 
considered standard of c are for the region), sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, 
BUN or urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, total bilirubin,

All women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test at screening 
(urine or serum). If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test .
SARS- CoV- 2 (COVID -19) PCR ( screening): nasopharyngeal swab, BAL ,or other 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_92814] , blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to designated central laboratories
or to the Sponsor or a designee for analysis:
Serum samples for PK analysis
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
40/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Serum samples for pharmacodynamic analysis (IL -6, sIL -6R and CRP) and 
exploratory biomarker research
Serum samples for SARS -CoV- 2 antibody titer
Nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL (if applicable )for SARS- CoV-2 virology tests (viral 
load and exploratory analysis)
Whole blood PAXgeneRNA for RNA se quencing or QPCR
Cryopreserved PBMCs for high dimensional cytometry analysis (for sites capable of 
sample collection)
Exploratory biomarker research may include, but will not be limited to, analysis of 
inflammatory mediators and/ or cytokines , ARDS -related variables, serum viral load ,and 
virus resistance/mutation analysis.
In countries where acceptable, r esearch may involve extraction of DNA, cell -free DNA, 
or RNA; analysis of mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other genomic 
variants; and genomic profiling thr ough use of next -generation sequencing (NGS) of a 
comprehensive panel of genes.
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.
Biological samples will be destroyed no later than the time of completion of the final 
Clinical Study Report, with the following exceptions:
Serum samples collected for PK analysis may be needed for additional PK assay 
development and validation , and biomarker research; therefore, these samples will 
be destroyed no later than 15years after the final Clinical Study Report has been 
completed.
Blood (serum, plasma, PBMCs), blood P AXgene RNA, and tissue -derived samples 
(nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL, if applicable) collected for pharmacodynamic
analysis and biomarker research will b e destroyed no later than [ADDRESS_1261423] to 
the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4.
Given the complexity and exploratory n ature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd

42/Protocol WA42380, Version 34.5.10 Ordinal Scale Determination
Assessment of clinical status using a 7-category ordinal scale will be recorded at 
baseline on Day 1 and then again once daily every morning (between 8 am and 12 pm) 
while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  The ordinal scale categories are as follows:
1.Discharged (or “ready for discharge” as evidenced by [CONTACT_589964][INVESTIGATOR_697] , and stable oxygen saturation on ambient air 
or 2L supplemental oxygen)
2.Non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494] (or “ready for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494]”) not requiring 
supplemental oxygen
3.Non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494] (or “ready for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494]”) requiring supplemental 
oxygen
4.ICUor non- ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494], requiring non -invasive ventilation or high -flow 
oxygen
5.ICU, requiring intubation and m echanical ventilation 
6.ICU, requiring ECMO or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support 
(e.g.,vaso pressors, renal replaceme nt therapy)
7.Death
Patients who are ready to be discharged but are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (e.g., due to 
non-medical or administrative reasons) will be assigned an ordinal scale category of 1. 
Patients in a non -ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899693] 4. 
Patients in an ICU for administrative or non -medical reasons who are ready for a non -
ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_591517] 2 (if not requiring 
supplemental oxygen), 3 (if requiring supplemental oxygen) ,or 4 (if requiring 
non-invasive ventilation or high -flow oxygen).
In general, patients with oxygen saturation consistently 90% should be considered for 
escalation to a higher clinical status category, while patients with oxygen saturation 
consistently 96% should be considered for de -escalation to a lower category.   Patients 
on supplemental oxygen should be evaluated at least daily and considered for reduction 
or discontinuati onof oxygen support. Actual changes in level of support will be at the 
discretion of the clinician (s)treating the patient based on the patient’s overall condition 
and may be dictated by [CONTACT_249172] -clinical considerations. 
Normal body temperature is defined as oral, rectal, axillary ,temporal, or tympanic 
temperature 36.1 38.0C.  Normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_249134] 12 20 breaths per

5.[ADDRESS_1261428] -market ingexperience.  The important safety risks for TCZ are 
outlined below.  Please refer to the Tocilizumab Investigator's Brochure for a complete 
summary of safety information.
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study .  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  
Patients will undergo safety monitoring d uring the study, including assessment of the 
nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events .  In addition, guidelines for managing 
adverse events and laboratory abnormalities , including criteria for dosage modification 
and treatment interruption or disc ontinuation, are provided below .
5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with Tocilizumab
This section highlights the main risks f or this study population andfollowing 12doses of 
TCZ.  For a complete list of all identified or potential risks of TCZ therapy, please refer to 
the current version of the TCZ Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity  Reactions, Including A naphylaxis
An infusion reaction is defined as any adverse event that occurs during or within 
24hours after the infusion.  This may include hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions.  
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
45/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Stevens -Johnson syndrome has been reported during treatment with TCZ in the 
post-marketing setting.  Signs of a possible hypersensitivity reaction include, but are not 
limited to, the followi ng:
Fever, chills, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and skin rash
Cardiopulmonary reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, or 
hypertension
TCZ infusions will be administered to patients at the site under close supervision.  Health 
care profe ssionals administering TCZ infusions should be trained in the appropriate 
procedures for TCZ administration, should be able to recognize the symptoms 
associated with potential hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and should 
have the appropriate medication available for immediate use in case of hypersensitivity 
reaction such as anaphylaxis during or after administration of TCZ.  The patient should 
be treated according to the standard of care for management of the hypersensitivity 
reaction. 
If a patient has symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, or 
requires an interruption of the study drug because of symptoms of hypersensitivity 
including anaphylaxis, administration of TCZ must be discontinued permanently.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with 
increased risk of infection, such as a history of recurring infections or with underlying 
conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus) which may predispose patients to serious infections 
and opportunistic infections such as TB and viral reactivations (e.g., hepatitis B virus).  
Vigilance for timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving 
biologic agents, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened 
because of suppression of the acute -phase reaction.  The effects of TCZ on CRP and 
neutrophils, and the signs and symptoms of infection, should be considered when 
evaluating a patient for a potential infec tion.  It is recommended that neutropenic 
patients (ANC 1000/ L) undergo weekly surveillance blood cultures during the study.
If a patient develops a serious infection, administration of TCZ should be discontinued .
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Perforations
Symptomatic diverticulosis, diverticulitis, or chronic ulcerative lower GI disease, such as 
Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or other chronic lower GI conditions, might predispose 
patients to GI perforations. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the 
potential for complications of diverticular disease and thus reduce the risk of GI 
perforations.  
Discontinuation of TCZ is required for patients who develop GI perforations.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
46/Protocol WA42380, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic A bnormalit ies
Decreases in neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels have been 
observed following treatment with TCZ for labelled indications.  Treatment -related 
neutropenia was not associated with serious infection in clinical trials in any indicati on 
and no association between decreases in platelet counts and serious bleeding events 
has been observed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Demy elinating Disorders
The effect of treatment with TCZ on demyelinating disorders is not known; events have 
been reported rarely.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of 
TCZ in patients with preexisting or recent -onset demyelinating disorders.  
Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of 
central demyelinating disorders.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Elevated Live r Enzymes
In clinical trials, mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been 
observed with TCZ treatment. 
Recommended TCZ dose modifications for elevated liver enzymes in these populations 
are not applicable to this study due to single dose therapy (with possible additional 
infusion) with TCZ or placebo.
Patients who develop elevated liver function tests during the study must have repeat 
tests performed as clinically indicated until levels return to baseline , even if they 
withdraw from the study .If the specialist deems a liver biopsy necessary, the prepared 
histologic slides will be requested by [CONTACT_249173] a third party, and 
the biopsy report should be forwarded to the Sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS] CYP450 Enzy me Normalization
The expres sion of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes is suppressed by 
[CONTACT_167356], such as I L-6, that stimulate chronic i nflammation.  TCZ normalizes expression 
of these enzymes.  The effect of TCZ on CYP450 enzyme s (except CYP2C19 and 
CYP2D6) is clinical ly relevant f or CYP450 substrates with a narrow th erapeutic in
dex
and/or when the dose is individual ly adjusted.
When starting or stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_899694], patients taking medi cinal products which 
are individual ly dose adjusted and are metabolized via CYP450 CYP3A4, CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP2C9 (e. g., atorvastatin, calcium -chann el blockers, theop hylline, warfarin, 
phenprocoumon, phe nytoin, cyclosporine, or ben zodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) should be mon itored as 
doses of these products may need to be adjusted to maintain their the rapeutic eff ect.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
47/Protocol WA42380, Version 35.[ADDRESS_1261429], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]
and5.3.5.10 for more information)
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray)that is 
associated with symptoms or le ads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
48/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient 'sability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medical event in the inve stigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [ NCI CTCAE ]; see 
Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_1261430] (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest f or this study 
are as follows :
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s 
Law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] , as defined below
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Serious and/or medically significant infections
Myocardial infarction or acu te coronary syndrome
GI perforations
Malignancies

Demyelinating disorders
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.[ADDRESS_1261431].  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient 'smedical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedur es such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adver se events).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported during the 60-dayfollow -
up period.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at al l patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of nondirective
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 1 will b e used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

aInstrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money, etc.
bExamples of self -care activities o f daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by [CONTACT_25744].
cIf an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_1261432] be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"or "no"
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 2 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study dr ug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
51/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Table 2Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon rechallenge .
NO An adverse ev ent will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomita nt medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
5.3.[ADDRESS_1261433] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
Adiagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse e vents 
based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically signifi cant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
52/Protocol WA42380, Version 3If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the ev ent 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant ther apy
Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment 
It is the investigator 'sresponsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
53/Protocol WA42380, Version 3If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above o r below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section for details on 
recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompa nied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investi gator 'sjudgment 
It is the investigator 'sresponsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinica lly significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or o ther 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law ).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
54/Protocol WA42380, Version 3The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of COVID- [ADDRESS_1261434] event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death "should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death "should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed solely to progression of COVID -19 pneumonia , "COVID -19 
pneumonia progression" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_899708] d escriptors 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
55/Protocol WA42380, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of COVID -19 Pneumonia
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should notbe recorded as adverse events (with the excep tion of 
death due to COVID -19 pneumonia progression as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  These 
data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only.  If there is any uncertainty as to 
whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse 
event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26663] (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899695] s should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678]
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_736404] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25682]
[IP_ADDRESS] Cases of A ccidenta l Overdose or Medication Error
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special 
situations"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the as signed dose
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adver se 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
56/Protocol WA42380, Version 3(i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  For TCZ (or 
matching placebo) , adverse events associated with special situations should be 
recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adver se event term.  
Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated with TCZ (or mat ching placebo ), regardless 
of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF as described below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong dru g, expi[INVESTIGATOR_26669]) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.
Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the error in the ad ditional case details.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two 
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entries.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  Biomarker Data
Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by [CONTACT_1034],

To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events through use of the reference safety 
information in the document listed below:
Drug Document
Tocilizumab Tocilizumab Investigator's Brochure
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator 's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
A DMC will monitor the incidence of the above -listed anticipated events during the study.  
An aggregate report of any clinic ally relevant imbalances that do not favor the test 
product will be submitted to health authorities.
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
All primary and secondary efficacy outcomes will be analyzed in the modified intent to 
treat ( mITT) population .  The mITT population is defined as all patients randomized in 
the study that received any amount of study medication , with patients grouped according 
to the treatment assignment at randomization.
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
61/Protocol WA42380, Version 3Safety a nalyses will be performed on the safety evaluable population, which consists of 
all patients who receive any amount of study medication .  In all safety analyses, patients 
will be grouped according to the treatment that the patients actually received rather than 
the treatment assigned at randomization.  
Detailed specifications of the statistical methods will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
6.[ADDRESS_1261442] . 
The total mITT sample size of 450with a 2:1 randomi zation of TCZ to placebo patients 
provides approximately 90% power to detect a difference in distribution between the 
treatment groups of the ordinal scale at Day [ADDRESS_1261443] at 
the 5% significance level under the following assumptions of the expected probability 
distribution of patients in the placebo arm :
1 (discharge) 2 3 4 5 6 7 (death)
0.58 0.05 0.09 0.09 0.02 0.02 0.15
And, a ssuming proportional odds with an odds ratio of 2 , the expected distribution in the 
TCZ arm would be:
1 (discharge) 2 3 4 5 6 7 (death)
0.734 0.039 0.064 0.058 0.012 0.012 0.081
In addition ,this sample size provides approximately 90% power to detect a ratio of 2 
(TCZ to PBO) for the odds of being in a category or a better using a proportional odds 
model with a two -sided p -value at the 5% significance level.
Assuming proportional odds and the given distribution of the placebo group, the smallest 
odds ratio that could be statistically significant would be approximately 1. 5. 
This sample size also provides approximately 9 0%power to detect a 10% absolute 
difference in mortality rate under the assumption of a 15% mortality rate in the placebo 
group.

(e.g.,vaso pressors, renal replacement therapy)
7.Death
The estimand is the difference in distributions between TCZ plus SOC and placebo plus 
SOC ,which will be tested using a non -parametric method, the Van Elteren test, 
including the stratification factors at randomization (region [North America, Europe] 
and mechanical ventilation [yes, no]). The median ordinal scale result for each 
treatment group and the corresponding 95% CI for the median will be presented along 
with the Van Elteren p -value, as well as the difference in medians and a 95% CI for the 
difference. 
Further details of the primary endpoint analysis will be included in the SAP.

will be compared between the TCZ group and the placebo group at Day 28, using a 
proportional odds model accounting for stratification factors at randomization in the 
model (re gion [North America, Europe] and mechanical ventilation [yes, no ]).  The 
odds ratio, p -value, and 95% confidence interval will be presented.
For patients who withdraw before Day 28, their last post baseline ordinal category prior 
to withdrawal will be used in the analysis. Any other missing data handling rules for the 
primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP.

descriptively .
Comparison of clinical status according to the 7 -category ordinal scale ( as detailed for 
the primary endpoint at Day 28) willalso be analyzed at Day 14 ( key secondary 
endpoint ).
The NE WS2 score and the ordinal clinical status will be summariz ed descriptively by 
[CONTACT_765].

Duration of ICU stay
Duration of supplemental O2
Duration endpoints will be summari zed descriptively using the medians, with 95% CIs for 
the medians by [CONTACT_1570].
6.4.3 Exploratory  Efficacy  Endpoints
Incidence of vasopressor use and incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) will be summarized descriptively.
Duration of vasopressor use and ECMO will be summari zed using the median along with 
95 % CIs for the median by [CONTACT_1570].
Organ failure -free days to Day 28 will be summarized descriptively using th e median, 
with 95% CI for the medians by [CONTACT_1570].
Organ failure is defined as present on any date when the most abnormal vital 
signs/abnormal lab value meets the definition of clinically significant organ failure 
according to the Brussels Organ F ailure Table ( Vincent 2006). Cardiovascular, 
pulmonary and central nervous system function will be assessed through blood pressure 
and requirement for pressors (instead of responsiveness to fluids), PaO 2:FiO 2 (or 
SpO 2:FiO 2if arterial blood gases were not measured) ratio and the alert, verbal, pain, 
unresponsive scale (AVPU ;instead of Glasgow Coma Scale), respectively. Renal, 
hepatic and coagulation parameters will be assessed via blood tests in order that the 
presence of clinically significant organ fai lure can be determined. Any day that a patient 
is alive and free of all 5 organ failures (pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, central 
nervous system) will be considered organ failu re-freedays. Days without organ failure 
will be summ arized through Day 28 during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
6.5 SAFETY ANAL YSES
Safety assessments will be performed on the safety evaluable population, which 
consists of all patients who receive any amount of study medication.  In all safety 
analyses, patients will be grouped according to the treatment that the patients actually 
received rather than the treatment assigned at randomization.  
Safety will be assessed through descriptive summaries of treatment emergent adverse 
events (nature, frequency, severity, and causality). Adverse eve nts will also be listed.
All verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms, and 
adverse event severity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 scale
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
66/Protocol WA42380, Version 3The proportion of patients with any post -treatment infection will be summarized at time 
points including Day 60.
A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any new adverse event reported or
any worsening of an existing condition on or after the first dose of study drug.
Separate summaries will be generated for serious adverse events, deaths, adverse
events leading to discontinuation of study drug, and adverse events of special interest.
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_78745], appropriate thesaurus level, and
toxicity grade.
Descriptive summaries of laboratory values and change from baseline throughout the 
study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_2939]. For selected parameters, changes from the
proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant changes relative to baseline will
be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].
Value s, along with change from baseline, will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
for each vital sign parameter.
SARS- CoV- 2 viral load over time, as collected by [CONTACT_899712] (if applicable) will be summari zed descriptively by [CONTACT_236851].
Time to reverse -transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_1261446] of patients with sufficient data to enable 
estimation of key parameters (e.g., area under the curve [AUC ], maximum serum 
concentration observed [Cmax]), with patients grouped according to treatment received . 
Non-linear mixed effects model ing will be used to analyze the serum TCZ concentration 
over time data collected in this study using pre- existing population PK models .  
Individual and mean serum TCZ concentration versus time data will be tabulated and 
plotted by [CONTACT_15994].  The serum pharmacokinetics of TCZ will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_178821] (AUC), Cmax, total clearance, volume of distribution.  Estimates 
for these parameters will be tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, 
Tocilizumab —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
67/Protocol WA42380, Version 3co-efficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum).  Inter -patient variability will 
be evaluated.
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate. ThePK parameters derived 
from the se analyses might be used for exploratory graphical analys es of the 
pharmacodynamic parameters.
These analyses will be reported separately in a stand- alone report.

Although no formal statistical analysis of exploratory biomarkers will be performed, data 
may be analyzed in the context of this study and in aggregate with data from other 
studies.  
6.9 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES
Up to three interim looks for efficacy will be carried out on the data with mortality rate at 
28 days (secondary endpoint) evaluated for interim efficacy analyses.  The interim looks 
will occur after roughly 111, 222, and 333patients are enrolled, but all interims are 
subject to change depending on enrollment. If the sample size is increased during the 
study ,the remaining efficacy interims will be performed at similar proportions of 
information to the original planned effica cy interim analyses.
The first efficacy interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 111patients ( 74
TCZ and 37placebo) have reached the 28 -day follow -up time point and will be based on 
the mortality rate at 28 days (secondary endpoint).  If the results of one of the interim 
analys es meet s the pre-specified criteria for efficacy, further enrollment in the placebo 
arm will be discontinued and all enrolled patients will receive open- label TCZ.  At this 
point ,efficacy will be declared. If the stud y is at least 90% enrolled within 5 weeks 
(28days follow up plus 1 week to perform the analysis) of the 111th patient being 
enrolled, then no interim analyses will be conducted.
If there is a potential for further recruitment into the placebo arm to be stopped for 
positive efficacy because of the interim analysis, the type I error rate will be controlled to 
ensure statistical validity is maintained.  Specifically, the Lan -DeMets -spending 
function that approximates the O'Brien -Fleming boundary will be applied to determine 
the critical value for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_294775] (DeMets and 
Lan 1994). Interim analyses for efficacy willuse the Fisher’s exact t est for difference in 
proportions for mortality at 28 days andwill utilize an O’Brien- Fleming alpha -spending 
function . The efficacy boundaries for the z -scores at the four looks (three interim looks 
and final analysis) are4.364, 2.986, 2.377, and 2.[ADDRESS_1261447] Lan -DeMets methodology.

68/Protocol WA42380, Version 3The study management team will remain blinded unless the results meet the efficacy 
criteria (boundary is crossed) . The interim efficacy analys es will be produced by a 
statistical programmer and statistician independent of the study management team and 
will reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) . 
Full statistical details of the pl anned interim analyses, along with the rationale and timing 
will be documented in an interim statistical analysis plan, which will be made available to 
the relevant health authorities before the data snapshot for the first interim .
AData Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and 
procedures detailed in a DMC Charter. Regular safety reviews will begin after 
approximately 15 patients (10 TCZ, 5 placebo) have been enrolled and reached 14-day 
follow -up.  Ea rly stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_899696].   The safety interim analyses will also 
be conducted by a statistical programmer and statistician independent from the study 
management team and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1363] .  Interactions between the DMC 
and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the DMC Charter.
TheData Monitoring Committee willinitially consist of Sponsor representatives not 
involved in any operational aspects of the study before transitioning to a fully 
independent data monitoring committee ( iDMC )when feasible.

7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Due to the pandemic situation, access to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249143] ; therefore, only remote 
data monitoring will be performed for this study.   Study monitors will perform ongoing 
remote data review to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into 
the eCRFs by [CONTACT_899713]. Sites will be asked 
to implement a QC step ofa second person review ing the data entry in the eCRFwhere 
possible.
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, labo ratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_26671], microfiche, pho tographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be gene rated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to v erify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification and review , the investigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -

70/Protocol WA42380, Version 37.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site'scomputerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lie u of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computeri zed data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail

National Early  Warning Score 2 (NEWS2)
SpO 2=oxygen saturation. 
The oxygen saturation should be scored according to either the SpO 2Scale 1 or 2 
presented in the table above.  The SpO 2Scale 2 is for patients with a target oxygen 
saturation requirement of 88% 92% (e.g., in patients with hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_249149], such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease [COPD]).  This should only be used in patients confirmed to have hypercapnic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_95244] a prior or their curre nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517].
The decision to use the SpO 2Scale 2 should be made by [CONTACT_589995].  In all other circumstances, the SpO 2Scale 1 should be 
used.
For physiological parameter “Air or Oxygen?”:  Any patien ts requiring the use of oxygen 
or other forms of ventilation to maintain oxygen saturations and support respi[INVESTIGATOR_589963] a score of 2.
The consciousness level should be recorded according to the best clinical condition of 
the patient during t he assessment.  Patients who are assessed as “Alert” (A) should be 
assigned a score of 0.  Patients assessed as “New Confusion” (C), “Responsive to Voice” 
(V), “Responsive to Pain” (P), or “Unconscious” should be assigned a score of 3.

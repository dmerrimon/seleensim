Ration ale for StudyTo im prove the length and quality-of-life outcomes for people with non- 
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by [CONTACT_469657].  This is a two-year software 
development and impl ementation project to develop and field-test a 
decision aid based on the NCCN patient  guidelines for NSCLC.  The 
study goal is to improve the treatment decision-support  process and 
experience for NSCLC patients in an academic medical center.
Primary Ob jectiveThe primary st udy outcomes will emerge from measurement  of changes 
in overall practice patterns after implementation of  the decision aid. Pre- 
and post-inter vention data will be used to determine the level of 
difference  before and after implementation of  the decision aid into the 
thoracic oncology clinics.  Six specific practice patterns will be queried in 
a binary (yes/no) manner:
1.  All stages: smoking cessatio n discuss ion reinforced with a 
specific follow up plan and/or medication/patch/psychotherapy or 
counseling;
2.  stag e IB, IIA, IIB  receiving surgery: adjuvant chemoth erapy given 
after surgery;
3.  stag e III receiving surgery: pathologic staging of mediastin al
nodal di sease prior to initiati on of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];
4.  stag e III not receiving surgery: pathologic staging of  mediastinal 
nodal disease prior to initiati on of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
5.  stag e III patients not receiving surgery: if concurrent
chemoth erap y and radiation are given upfront;
6.   stage IV : molecular testing for EGFR and ALK muta tions prior to 
initiation of systemic therapy.

Objec tivesSecond ary objectives are to:
1.  Determine ag reement between patient  and physician post- 
consultatio n reports of  treatments discussed and recommended, 
prognosis, and expected tolerance.
2.  Determine cor relatio ns between overall and lung cancer-specific 
quality of life and decision-support  preferences.
3.  Determine cor relatio ns between overall and lung cancer-specific
quality  of life and decisional conflict.
4.  Determine cor relatio ns between overall and lung cancer-specific 
quality of life and satis faction with decision.
5.  Determine cor relatio ns between decision-support  preferences
and decisional conflict and sati sfaction with decision.
6.   Determine  cor relations betw een decisional conflict  and 
satisfaction with decision.
Study D esignThis study involves the evaluation of  the decision support tool Patients 
with Power, previously used with breast cancer pati ents, in the non- 
small cell lung cancer patient  populatio n.
1. Charac ter ize physician and patient  populations and treatment 
decisions in the UCSF thoracic oncology practices.
2. Establish the  acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of a novel 
decision aid for decisions made about  treatment for NSCLC.
3. Cond uct an  evaluation of changes in NCCN-guided practice patterns 
before and after implementat ion of the decision aid, with respect to 6 
clinical scenario s:
All pati ents: if smoking cessation inte rvention is provided at initial 
visit;
Stage IB-IIB patients receiving surgery:  if adjuvant chemoth erapy 
is given after surgery;
Stage III patients receiving surgery:  if pathologic staging of 
mediastin al nodal disease is done prior to initiati on of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];
Stage III patients not receiving surgery: if pathologic staging of 
mediastin al nodal disease is done prior to initiati on of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];
Stage III patients  not receiving surgery: if concurrent 
chemoradi ation is given upfront;
Stage IV patients: if molecular testing is done prior to initiation of 
systemic therapy.
4. Collect dat a to facilitate the design of future larger-scale evaluations, 
including assessments of  physician-patient agreement and patients’ 
levels of decisional conflict  and satisfaction with decisions made as well 
as potential correlatio ns to patient-reported quality to life.

(lifetime) but collectio n of all study metrics will end at [ADDRESS_602088] ionnaires will be completed at the time of  initial consultatio n, with 
no planned follow up;  PwP website-based metrics will be followed in 
aggregate for a maximum of  1 year.
Duration of studyTwenty fo ur months:
Month 1-8: (1) Analyze existing practice patterns focused on [ADDRESS_602089].  Yom’s direction. (2) 
Programming of NSCLC decision aid unde r [CONTACT_469673]’s direction , 
conducted with technical assistance as needed from PwP. The results 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_3252]-investi gators for accuracy and ease of use.
Month 8-20: Conduct prospective trial of the decision aid, collectin g data 
directly from patients over the course of their initial 2 consul tations.
Month 2 0-24: Completion of data collectio n and data  analysis activities.
Study InterventionThe inte ract ive PwP inte rface allows structured exploration of choices, 
sequencing, and timing of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The aid thus enables the patient to 
discuss proposed treatments with the oncologist (rather than assumin g 
passive acceptance) . Furthermore,  the decision aid allows evolving 
display of the treatment  choices and timeline/calendar in a graphical, 
simplified format during the discussion (rather than assuming absorption 
and recall of details of a verbal communication).  We will collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_469651], patient-oriented approach facilitated  by [CONTACT_469658].
Study A ssessments A total of fiv e patient-reported instr uments will be used to score overall 
and lung cancer-specific quality of  life, decision-support preferences , 
decisional conflict, and sati sfaction with decision:

Page 6 of 33Unique Aspects of 
this StudyThe deci sion aid in this study will be developed in collaboration with a 
technology startup, Patients  with Po wer (PwP).  PwP has developed an 
innovati ve web-based soft ware that displays patient-friendly content 
adapted from the NCCN guidelines. The inte ractive web inter face allows 
physicians or patients to input  an individual patient’s charact eristics and 
then,  drawing from the NCCN-guidelines-based decision trees, to design 
a patient-specific decision tree accompanied by a timeline tying 
anticipated procedures to specific dates.  At present, PwP has developed 
a proof of  concept only for breast cancer, but PwP has shared
proprie tary da ta with the Principal Investig ator establishing the feasibility 
of customizing the inter face for NSCLC-related content .

1.2 P atients with Power  – An Inno vative Decis ion Aid to Visualize NCCCN 
Guidel ines
The decisi on aid in this study will be developed in collaborati on with a technology 
startup, Patients with Power (PwP). PwP has developed an innovativ e web-based 
software that displa ys content excerpt ed from the NCCN patient  guidelines. Th e 
interacti ve web interface allows physicians or patients to input an individual patient’s 
charact eristics and then,  drawing from the NCCN-guidelines-based decision trees, to 
design a patient-specific decision tree accompanied by a timeline tying anticip ated 
procedures to specific dates. At present,  PwP has developed a proof of concept only for 
breast  cancer, but PwP has shared proprieta ry data with the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_469652]-related content.
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: [ADDRESS_602095] (rather than assuming passive accept ance). Furthermore,  the 
decision aid allows evolving displa y of the treatment  choices and timeline/calendar in a 
graphical, simplified f ormat during th e discussion (rather than assuming absorptio n and 
recall of details of a verbal communication). We will collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_469653] e, patient-oriente d approach facilitate d by [CONTACT_469659].
1.2.1  Patients’  Reac tions to PwP Proof of Co ncept
The Pw P prototype decision aid has met  with very positi ve responses in th e breast 
cancer community :
From a ne wly diagnosed patient: “[I[t is amazing. It seems that my surgeon is 
following the right course.  She has not talked about chemotherapy yet since the 
surgery comes first  and then pathology…. My surgeon is also interest ed in 
learning more about  this soft ware.”
From a 2-year s urvivor:  “[K]nowing th e NCCN guidelines as compared to what 
doctors are recommending is really valuable.”
From a 6- year survivor:  “I love the concept and the sleek, clean, bright design…. 
With your drop down lists, it was a snap to pi[INVESTIGATOR_469654]. Your site 
has the potential to be a great  source of informati on for hungry patients.  I would 
have loved to have had something like it  when I  went  through treatment.”
From a fr iend of a patient:  “She and I went  on[lin e] together. She is not tech 
savvy so I wasn't  sure how she would react.  I am a geek so it makes perfect 
sense to me. She really liked it and was able to navigate around with ease…. We 
especially liked the fact that informati on was available at decision points where 
choices would need to be made. That makes the journey a whole lot less 
confusing.”
From a cancer survivor and activ ist: “If this exist ed when I'd been diagnosed, it
would' ve been  the compass to help guide and map out  my journey.”
Startup te chnology companies often launch proto types in high-profile diseases such as 
breast  cancer. This  project  will extend the innovatio n to a more marginalized and 
underserved population in NSCLC. While extending the concept to NSCLC,  our project 
will preserve the core features of the decision aid, including the graphical visualizatio n 
of the guidelines, the ease of navigatio n in the user interface, t he personalizatio n 
enabled by [CONTACT_469660]-down boxes,  and the ability to create,  modify, and review multiple 
scenarios (see Figure 1).
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: [ADDRESS_602096]  of a development phase followed by [CONTACT_469661] n phase. After 
initial protot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], refinement, coding, and implementa tion of the intervention, a study 
will  be  implemente d  using  a  pre/post  design  to  estimate  the  effect  size  of  the 
interventio n with respect  to disseminatin g NCCN-guided treatment  choices (primary 
outcome) and to generate preliminary data about  secondary outcomes.
Specificall y, this project will:
1. Chara cterize physician and pati ent populations and trea tment  decisions in the UCSF
thoracic oncology practices.
2. Esta
blish th e accept ability , feasibili ty, and effectiveness of a novel decision aid for 
decisions made about  treatment  for NS CLC.

5 Reporting and Docume ntation of Results
5.1 E valua tion of  PwP
1. Decision  Support  Prefere nce  Questi onnaire  (DMPQ ):       The  Decision 
Support  Preferenc e  Questi onnaire  (DMPQ)  is  a  brief  assessment  of 
patients’ preferred style in decision making with their physician. Patients 
check off the single statement  out of five that best describes their preferred 
level of shared decision making responsibili ty. The Decision  Support 
Preference Questionnaire (DMPQ)  will be completed once before the 
consult ation.
2. FAC T-L:    The FACT-L is a 44-item self-report instrument that measures 
multid imensi onal quality of life, focused on common concerns of lung cancer 
patients measured on a 5-point Likert  scale.  It includes domains of Physical 
Well Being, Emoti onal Well Being, Social Well Being, and Functional Well 
Being. Available in eight languages, it is currently being used in several 
Phase II and III lung cancer clinical trials  (Cella DF, Bonomi AE, Lloyd SR, 
Tulsky DS, Kaplan E, Bonomi P. Relia bility and validity of  the Functi onal 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT -L) quality of life instru ment.

nurses,  and patients with advanced-sta ge lung cancer.25  It employs a five- 
point  Likert scale and is scored from 0-68.  It includes three subscales, 
Disease-Relate d Subscale (DRS), Treatment Side  Effects  (TSE), and 
Functional Well-B eing (FWB).  A unique aspect of this instrument is t he
Version dat e: 03 -15-2016 Protocol  CC#: [ADDRESS_602111] Scale: The Decisio nal Conflict Scale (DCS) is a scale 
designed   to   m easure   patients'   uncerta inty   in   making   healt h-related 
decisions, factors contrib uting to uncerta inty, and patients'  perceived 
effective decision-support. The DCS  has [ADDRESS_602112]-Co nsultatio n Questionnaire:  The Post-Consultatio n Questionnaire will 
be comp leted by [CONTACT_469662]. 
It includes the fo llowing components:
a. Treatm ent Recommendati ons and Decisions: Treatments  discussed, 
recommended, and chosen by [CONTACT_469663]. Options may include surgery,  radiation therapy, chemot herapy, 
targeted therapy, observation,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125],  no treatment,  or unresolved. The 
oncologist and patient will also be asked for an estimati on of the tolerance 
of the treatment.  This informati on will be obtained from the patient and 
oncologist immediately after the consulta tion.
b. Prognosis Estimat es:  Estimates of prognosis with no treatment  and with the 
recommended treatment  will be obtained from the patient and oncologist 
immediately after the consult ation.
c. Program Evaluatio n:  The patient will be asked to score the extent  to 
which this process increased their understa nding of their cancer treatment 
options and confidence in their oncologist immediat ely after the 
consulta tion.
6. Sati sfactio n  with  Health  Care  Decision  (SWD):  Although  the  DCS  will 
provide a  general measure of satisfaction with the medical encounter, it 
does not specifically query t he patient's  satisf action with the health  care 
decision itself. The Patient  Satisfaction with Health  Care Decision  (SWD) is 
a six-item scale with excellent reliability and good discriminate validity . The 
instrument  was  validate d  using  a  sample  of  postme nopausal  women
specifically  to e valuate the utility of patient decision aids.14 The strength of 
the SWD is that it measures satisfaction with the decision made regardless 
of how good or bad th e prognosis or health outcome might be f or the
individua l patie nt. The SWD will be completed once after t he consulta tion.

Page 21 of 33All patients: if s moking cessatio n interventi on is provided at initial visit;
Stage IB-IIB  pa tients receiving surgery:  if adjuvant chemotherapy is given after surgery; 
Stage III patients receiving surgery: if pathologic staging of mediastinal nodal disease is
done pri or to initiation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];
Stage  III  patien ts  not  receiving  surgery:  if  pathologic  staging  of  mediastinal  nodal 
disease is done prior to initia tion of  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];
Stage III  pati ents not receiving surgery: if concurrent chemoradiati on is given upfront; 
Stage IV patient s: if molecular testin g is done prior to initiation of systemic therapy.
4. Collect data to facilitate the design of future larger-scale evaluations, including 
assessments of physician-patie nt agreement and patients’ levels of decisional conflict 
and satisfaction with decisions made as well as potenti al correlatio ns to patient-reported 
quality to life.

assuming a null hypothesis of 50% in the pre-interventio n cohort. This estimate for the 
null hypot hesis will be modified using the results obtained prior to use of the decision 
aid (Mont hs 1-8). Based upon the one-sample binary exact test with power set at 90%

differ from 50% and result  in reduced power but will be at least 80%. For example,  if 
adjuvant chemot herapy is given after surgery to  40% of stage IB and II patients 
determined from the pre-interventio n assessment,  then a test to detect a 50% 
improvement to 60% will require 70 patients with 80% power and 88 patients with 91% 
power. Si milarly, if  60% of  patients satisfy the smoking cessatio n crit erion during th e

The total n umber of partic ipants  to be enrolled is 250.   The expected number of 
partic ipants  to be enrolled per quarter is 60-65
6.3     Analy ses P lans
6.3.1  Prima ry Analysis (or Analysis of Primary Endp oints)
The major f ocus of the trial analysis will be to determine if there is a statistically 
discerni ble effect for the decision aid in influencing practice patterns before and after 
implementa tion of the decision aid. The rates of NCCN adherence by [CONTACT_469666] .  The  current  sample  size  now  reflects  the  ability  to  detect  a 
moderate effect size for decision aid interactions with outcomes. More detailed analysis 
to correlate correlations between changes in practice patterns to other variables will be 
carried out with logistic  regression, with special modifications f or patient 
sociodemographic and clinica l characteristics (e.g ., nodes, tumor size, histology).
6.3.2  Secondary A nalysis (or Anal ysis of Seco ndary Endpo ints)
In additi on to  the primary analysis, additio nal analyses will be carried out to determine 
correlations between sociodemographic and clinical variables, similarity in physician 
and patient post-consulta tion  reports,  quality of  life  scores,  decision-support 
preferences, decisional conflict, and sati sfaction with  decision.
All  data  analy ses  will  be  conducte d  by  [CONTACT_469667].  Multivariate 
models will be construct ed using statistical crit eria, plausibili ty of associations, the 
existence of a priori hypotheses, and proposed causal path ways.  Chi-square, non- 
parametric and log-linear techniques will be used for categorical or ordina l data, and t- 
tests, where appropriate , for conti nuous data.  Multivariate models will use the observed 
likelihood ratio statistic  as a statistical index of model fit. Observed effect  sizes and their 
precision (expressed as 95% confidence intervals) will be more important components 
of these analyses than the associat ed p-values.

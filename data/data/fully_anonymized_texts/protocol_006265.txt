Regimen -Specific Appendix E 
For SLS-005, also known as Trehalose injection, 90 .5 mg/mL for intravenous infusion . 
Rationale and RSA Design  
Trehalose is a disaccharide that is well known for its protein -stabilizing properties (Elbein  2003, 
Emanuele 2014) and its ability to activate autophagy. Because of its known ability to reduce 
abnormal protein aggregations, trehalose was studied in several cellular and animal models of 
hereditary neurologic and muscular disorders. Three in vivo st udies (Castillo et al (2013), Zhang 
et al (2014 ) and Li Y et al (2015)) demonstrated that trehalose is a potential protective agent in 
ALS. These studies were performed using the SOD1 mouse model with the G93T mutation or 
the G86R mutation.  In mice , treha lose can be used orally because they lack intestinal trehalase , 
the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of trehalose to two glucose molecules . Treatment with 
trehalose both oral and intraperitoneal delayed onset of disease, prolonged survival, preserved 
motor  function and motor neurons in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] .  When  trehalose is taken orally  in humans,  
trehalase enzymes in the brush border of the gut actively cleave trehalose into [ADDRESS_963139] to ensure that adequate amounts of trehal ose reaches the 
primary therapeutic target organs, brain and muscle cells, is to circumvent the extensive gut 
metabolism  in humans  by [CONTACT_708576].  
This is a randomized double -blind  placebo -controlled  trial. Participants  who qualify will be 
randomized 3 :1 to receive weekly  infusions of Trehalose  Injection,  90.5 mg/mL for intravenous 
infusion at a dose of 0.75g/kg  or placebo (sodium chloride  injection, 0.9%, USP) intravenous 
infusion at an equivalent weight -based volume .  
Allocation to Treatment Regimens  
Participants must first be screened and determined to be e ligible under the Master Protocol 
before they are randomized to a treatment regimen .  
As soon as pre -defined criteria for futility for  the regimen  are met, or the target number of 
randomized participants has been reached, enrollment will stop in the regimen .   
Number of Planned Participants and Treatment Groups  
The number of planned participants for this regimen is  approximately  160.   
There are 2 treatment groups for this regimen, active and placebo. P articipants will be 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio  to active treatment or placebo  (i.e., 120 active: 40 placebo) .   
Planned Number of Sites  
Research participants will be enrolled from approximately 80 centers in the US.   
Treatment Duration  
The maximum duration of the placebo -controlled treatment period is 24 weeks.  
Follow -up Duration  
At the conclusion of the 24 -week placebo -controlled treatment period of the study, all 
participants will either schedul e a 28 -day follow up phone call and end the ir participation in the  
 
HEALEY ALS Platform Trial  
Regimen -Specific Appendix E, Trehalose   
Version  2.0 12/03 /[ADDRESS_963140] the option to receive intravenous infusions of trehalose in the Open Label 
Extension (OLE) period of the study. The duration of the OLE period  is planned for 52 weeks . 
Total Planned Trial Duration  
For participants completing the placebo -controlled treatment period of the study , the planned 
amount of time for a participant in the trial is up to 34 weeks , or about 8 months.  This duration 
assumes a 6-week screening window,  a 24-week placebo -controlled treatment period, and a 4 -
week safety follow -up period for those participants who do not enter the OLE . Participants will 
complete  approximately 10 study visits during the placebo -controlled treatment period of the 
study , in addition to weekly infusions outside of these visits .  
If the participant opts into the subsequent OLE , the total planned amount of time for a participant 
in the trial is appro ximately  86 weeks . This duration assumes a 6-week screening window,  24-
week placebo -controlled treatment period, a 52-week OLE  period , and a 4 -week safety follow -up 
period . Participants will complete 10 study visits across the planned 52 -week OLE period  of the 
study , in addition to weekly infusions outside of these visits .

will occur at the completion of the visit, v ital signs should be collected within 30 minutes of the start of infusion  to serve as the pre -infusion vital signs collection .  
5 During each infusion, vital signs  associated with the infusion  (systolic and diastolic  pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate )  are to be measured  pre-infusion , 30 minutes ( ± 5 
mins) after the start of infusion (SOI) , 60 minutes after the start of infusion (± 10 mins ), and 90 minutes ( ± 10 mins) after the start of infusion . If a participant  requires a 90 -minute 
infusion duration due to receiving more than 2 bags of study drug an additional vital signs measurement is to be completed  approximately 30 minutes  (± 10 mins)  after the end of 
the 90 -minute infusion.  
6 Clinical safety labs include hematology (CBC with differential), complete chemistry panel, thyroid function and urinalysis.  Hb A1C will be included in labs at baseline , week [ADDRESS_963147] known alive, will be determined fo r each randomized participant at the end of the 
placebo -controlled portion of thei r follow -up (generally the Week 24 visit, as indicated). If at that time the participant is alive, his or her vital status should be d etermined again at 
the time of the last patient last visit (LPLV) of the placebo -controlled portion of a given regimen.  We may also ascertain vital status at later time points by [CONTACT_708577] 8.[ADDRESS_963148] the safety of the participant due to a pandemic  or other

Regimen E:  SLS-005 Trehalose  
1.1 Trehalose  Background Information  
Trehalose is a disaccharide that is well known for its protein -stabilizing properties ( Elbein 2003 , 
Emanuele 2014 ) and its ability to activate autophagy  (Rusmini 2019) ). Because of its known 
ability to reduce abnormal protein aggregations , trehalose was studied in several cellular and 
animal models of here ditary neurologic and muscular disorders , especially those associated with 
CAG repeat expansion and polyalanine/polyglutamine accumulation ( Tanaka 2004 , Davies 
2006 ). This was the basis for human trials of intravenous (IV) trehalose in oculopharyngeal 
musc ular dystrophy (OPMD) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_375987] 3 (SCA3 or Machado Joseph 
disease).  
Trehalose has been shown to penetrate both muscle and brain.  In recent years it became clear 
that trehalose exposure results in the activation of cellular pathways that are relevant to its use as 
a potential t reatment of ALS. Trehalose activates lysosomal and autophagic activity by [CONTACT_708578] -associated 
protein 1A/1B -light chain 3 (LC-3 II). It was shown that the basis of activation of these pathways 
is cellular glucose starvation ( Mardones 2016 ). However, the mechanism of lysosomal -
autophagic activation by [CONTACT_708579]. Trehalose  also activates 
autoph agy through the activation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB),  and relocation to the 
nucleus,  a key factor in lysosomal and autophagy gene expression.  (Rusmini 2019) Activation of 
TFEB is an emerging therapeutic target for a number of diseases with patholog ic accumulation 
of storage material .  
Trehalose is not absorbed  well in the human gut because of trehalase enzymes in the brush 
border that cleave the molecule into two glucose molecules. Oral ingestion of trehalose results in 
<0.5% absorption of trehalose . Seelos Therapeutics has developed IV trehalose to circumvent the 
breakdown of trehalose in the gut. In Study BBCO -001, an open -label Phase 2a study of 25 
OPMD patients with dysphagia, weekly trehalose treatments at a dose of 27 grams (g) for 6 
months was  well tolerated. A single ascending dose  study identified that clearance of trehalose is 
weight dependent and that the  maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as 0.75  g/kg. This is the dose to 
be employed in this study.  
1.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Data  
1.2.1 Nonclinical  Experience  
The safety and tolerability of trehalose has been extensively investigated. A detailed review of 
safety in animals is presented in the trehalose Investigator's Brochure (IB).  
Three -month IV Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies in rats and dogs at a dose of 
3.6 g/kg administered twice weekly showed no organ toxicity. A 6 -month GLP toxicology study 
in rats with doses of 2.7, 5.4, and 10.8 g/kg demonstrated no organ t oxicity. An inflammatory 
response at the end of the indwelling catheter was noted in a dose -dependent manner. Although 
there were an increasing number of observations with the increasing dose it was not a linear 
increase and thus it was considered by [CONTACT_941] r eporting pathologist to  a procedural related change 
due to manipulation of the catheter  and not drug related . There was no systemic inflammatory

10.8 g/kg did no t demonstrate any organ toxicity.  
1.2.2 Nonclinical Literature  
Three in vivo studies demonstrated that trehalose is a potential  protective agent in ALS. These 
studies were performed using the SOD1 ‘classical’ mouse mo del with the G93T mutation or the 
G86R mutation.   In mice trehalose can be used orally because they lack intestinal trehalase . 
In the work of Castillo et al ( 2013 ), trehalose was administered to animals with a G86R SOD1 
mutation from age [ADDRESS_963157]. The dose used was 3 weekly IP injections of 2 g/kg plus 3% 
trehalose in free drinking water. It was found that in female mice trehalose increased survival 
from a mean of [ADDRESS_963158] in trehalose treated animals.   
In a similar study, Zhang et al ( 2014 ) administered trehalose to animals with the G93A SOD 1 
mutation in the drinking water only (2% concentration) starting on day 60. Trehalose delayed 
mean onset of disease from day 95 to 112 (based on clinical observation in the animals). Mean 
survival was prolonged from 124 to 145 day s of age; however, disease duration was unchanged.   
The number of preserved motor neurons in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_708573] 120. 
Trehalose -treated animals had increased numbers of preserved motor neurons compared with 
untreated control animals. Neuronal SOD1 aggregates and p62 accumulation were decreased 
with trehalose treatment. Furthermore, histologic studies of muscle showed an increase in mean 
fiber size and evidence of preserved neuromuscular junctions, indicating reduced denervatio n of 
muscle tissue.  
Li Y et al ( 2015 ) evaluated 2 protocols for the study of trehalose in the SOD1 -G93A mouse 
model (given in 2% solution in the drinking water). A short -term therapy protocol evaluated the 
effects after 30 days of treatment. Long -term ther apy monitored the effects from onset to death. 
In both protocols, trehalose therapy was started on day 60. Disease onset , defined as the time 
when the animal dragged 1 leg , was significantly delayed by [CONTACT_708580]. Similarly, the time to 
reach grade 2 (2 affected limbs) was prolonged. Survival (defined as animal sacrifice time when 
it reached grade 4 of the disease) was delayed by 7 days, but this change did not reach statisti cal 
significance. In the short -term protocol motor function was improved as assessed by [CONTACT_708581]. There was a clear change in autophagy activation (levels of p62) in the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_708574] -term protocol.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_963159] been exposed to trehalose: 18 healthy subjects, 25 OPMD patients, 15 
SCA3 patients , 1 adult with Sanfilippo Type B . Out of the 59, 11 patients received SLS -005 in 
the under expanded access use programs (10 subjects with OPMD and 1 with Sanfilippo type B).  
The healthy subjects received a single dose of 27, 54, or 81 g (6 subjects each dose), the OPMD 
patients received repeated weekly doses of 27 g trehalose for a duration of 6 to 18 months, the

Version 2.0 12/03 /2021   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 51 SCA3 patients received repeated weekly doses of 13.5 or 27 g for a d uration of 6 to 12 months , 
and the Sanfilippo patient is receiving 0.75 g/kg weekly, currently at over 4 months of treatment . 
Overall, trehalose was well tolerated.  
Study BB -TRE -101 studied the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single 
ascending doses of SLS-005 in healthy subjects. The study demonstrated proportional linear 
kinetics for increasing doses of trehalose from 27 g to 81 g. In addition, it demonstrated a need 
for weight -based dosing since clearance increased with increasing weig ht. One (1) treatment -
emergent adverse event was assessed as possibly related elevated liver enzymes  in [ADDRESS_963160] in 
the 81  g treatment group  and was reported  as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R).  Based on the data from this study, al ong with supportive data from animal studies, the 
MTD was established as 0.75 g/kg.  
Study BBCO -001, an open -label study in patients with OPMD, assessed the safety, tolerability, 
PK, and efficacy of SLS-[ADDRESS_963161] common adverse event (AE) was 
elevated urine glucose that occurred in 52% of patients. The AE of glyc osuria was only reported 
from 1  site and , although the patients were asymptomatic, the investigator assessed the 
laboratory result as clinically significant. Increased glucose in urine is an anticipated result 
because trehalose is metabolized to glucose , however serum glucose did not exceed norma l range   
There  were 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring in 2 patients: urinary tract infection, 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499], and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_708575]. None of the SAEs were considered related 
to study drug.  
The subsequent Study BB -OPMD -[ADDRESS_963162] common AE was transient glucosuria occurring in  20% (n=3) of patients. 
SLS-005 treatment was generally safe and well tolerated in this patient population.  
1.3 Trehalose  Therapeutic  Rationale  
1.3.1 Rationale for the study  
The nonclinical data generated to date for trehalose support its potential to be used  as an 
effective treatment for ALS.  Through its effects on reducing proteinac eous 
aggregates/inclusions promoting autophagy  and lysosomal pathways  and reducing cell death, 
trehalose improved muscle strength and overall motor skills in animal models of OPM D, SCA3 , 
and ALS. The clinical safety profile of trehalose and the nonclinical toxicology data support the 
investigation of trehalose as a potential treatment of ALS.   
1.3.2 Rationale for the Dose, Dosing Regimen, and Route of Administration  
Error! Reference source not found. If administered orally < 0.5% of ingested trehalose is 
absorbed into the blood stream. Therefore, to achieve therapeutic blood levels of trehalose, it is 
necessary to circumvent the metabolism in the  human  gastrointestinal  tract. As such,  Seelos has 
 
HEALEY ALS Platform Trial  
Regimen -Specific Appendix E, Trehalose   
Version 2.0 12/03 /2021   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 51 developed SLS-005 an IV formulation of trehalose for injection, 90 .5 mg/mL to be evaluated in 
this study.  
In the single ascending dose study of IV trehalose in healthy subjects, the mean weight in the 54 g 
dose cohort was 74.5 kg. At the dose of 54 g, subjects received 0.72 g/kg. The area under the curve 
to time infinity ( AUC inf) at that dose was 8,595±2,575 hour × µg/mL. Since clearance is dependent 
on body weight  (i.e., clearance increases with increasing body weight ), in order to achiev e a 
consistent exposure in, at , or near the exposure at the MTD, 54 g/1 hour, a weight -based dose of 
0.75 g/kg should achieve an exposure within the clinically acceptable safety range.  
One of the proposed mechanisms of action of trehalose is to activate au tophagy , the blockade of 
glucose receptors result s in a starvation scenario within the cell (DeBosch 2016). Therefore, the 
MTD will be used to ensure significant exposure. Weekly dosing of IV trehalose is the only 
regimen to be evaluated in clinical trials  to date (patients with OPMD and SCA3) and will be used 
in this trial . 
1.3.3 Rationale for the Patient Population  
The pathologic hallmark of the disease is aggregation of proteinaceous inclusions in motor 
neurons. The main composite of these inclusions is misfolded TDP43 (especially the 
phosphorylated form), which accumulates in the cytoplasm and is depleted in the nucleus. Patients 
with either sporadic or familial ALS accumulate TDP43  and patients with the SOD  mutation 
accumulate SOD aggregat es and thus have the potential to benefit from treatment with trehalose  
through activation of autophagy .

Regimen -Specific Appendix E, Trehalose   
Version 2.0 12/03 /2021   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 51 The dose of IV trehalose or placebo will be calculated based on participant  body weigh t to 
determine the volume administered to each participant . Each participant’s weight should be 
measured consistently at each in -clinic visit. Shoes and heavy winter clothes (e.g. coats, 
sweaters, boots) should be removed prior to weighing. If shoes cannot  be removed, then weight 
should be assessed with the participant’s shoes on at each clinic visit.  Doses are adjusted based 
on changes in body weight ( 2 kg increase or decrease) noted during clinical trial assessments. 
More than 1 bag may be needed per inf usion based on the participant ’s body weight.  The 
intended SLS -005 total infusion time , excluding interruptions , is 60 minutes for infusion 
volumes up to 2 bags (i.e. up to 600mL) and should not exceed 70 minutes. For patients who 
require more than 2 bags (i.e. >600mL) of study drug the intended SLS -005 total infusion time 
should be increased to 90 minutes and not exceed 100 minutes.  Management of 
deviations/excursions is described  in the Study Drug MOP.  
5.4 Study M edication/Intervention , Administration, Escalation, and Duration  
The participant  will receive weekly infusions of study drug (trehalose or placebo ). Although for 
most p articipants  the total infusion time of SLS -005 is set  at 60  minutes  (+ 10 minutes) , 
participants  who require more than 2 bags of study drug  the infusion time should be  increased to 
90 minutes  (+10 minutes) throughout the study. All infusions will be administered using an 
infusion pump and will be followed with an IV flush. The start calendar date and 24 -hour clock 
time as well as the end calendar date and 24 -hour clock time of each infusion will be recorded in 
the study database.   If an infusion is interrupted due to infusion issue s, i.e. loss of IV site, the 
infusion can be completed once access has been re -established unless > [ADDRESS_963169] elapsed the infusion should not be restarted,  and t he volume infused  
prior to the interruption recorded  in the CRF  as the total dose administered . 
If needed the use of an implanted venous access device ( e.g. Mediport , PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875] ) or percutaneous 
indwelling cath eter is permitted however  small caliber indwelling c atheters  in peripheral vessels 
should only be inserted for single use . Participants  are to be monitored for administration site 
reactions during study drug administration. Infusion site reactions or infusion reactions are to  be 
recorded as AEs using the appropriate coding terms on the eCRF.  
If needed , remote services such as infusions at home can be considered after the pa rticipa nt has 
completed at least 4 weeks of in -clinic infusion s, as long as the  participa nt has had no adverse 
reaction to the infusion s and all safety assessments are within acceptable limits.  Decision to 
permit home infusions is at the discretion of the site investigator. Participa nts approved by [CONTACT_708584]-
site study  visits  at Week 16 (unless completed remotely due to pandemic -related or other 
reasons) and 24,  and their associated IP infusions at these timepoints can be done in -clinic  
following completion of the study visit . Telephone v isits at Weeks 2, 12 and 20 may be 
conducted  in clinic if the participant is receiving their weekly infusions at the study site and the 
infusion will occur during the visit window .   
5.5 Justification for Dosage   
Based on the preclinical and clinical safet y and PK data trehalose injection 90 .5 mg/mL  should 
be dosed using a weight -based dosing up to a maximum of 0.75  g/kg. Participants  should  receive 
trehalose injection 90 .5 mg/mL  over 60 + 10 minutes , with the exception noted above for more 
than 2 bags, using an infusion pump.

If for any reason a participant  is unable to receive a full dose this should be documented as per 
participant compliance.  Doses are adjusted  (increased or de creased)  based on a weight  change  of 
2kg or greater  from the previous in -clinic volume . A dosing chart, with the volume of study drug

• Suspected abuse/misuse of the investigational product  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the investigational product  
• Medication error involving study drug (with or without participant exposure to the

5.[ADDRESS_963174] been no infusion reactions to date in patients administered IV tr ehalose; 
however, 1 patient had an infusion site reaction (erythema). Toxicology data suggests that small 
indwelling catheters may result in vessel changes after multiple infusions. The inflammatory 
reaction noted was not associated with any generalized in flammation and there was no organ 
toxicity, thus it was considered a procedural complication of the indwelling catheter.  If needed 
the use of an implanted venous access device (i.e. Mediport , PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875] ) or percutaneous indwelling 
catheter is permitted however  small caliber indwelling catheters in peripheral vessels should be 
single use . Additional risks include those risks related to venipuncture (e.g., hematoma, bleeding,

• ALSAQ -40 
• CNS Bulbar Function Scale  
• Serum PK parameter estimates  
• CSF biomarker LC3 -II and Neurofilament light chain  
• HbA1c  as part of the clinical safety labs  
Participants may be required to reconsent to the regimen if new procedures or information is  
added in the future. Should a participant need to reconsent, this should occur during the 
participant’s next in -person visit. If the participant’s next in -clinic visit is conducted remotely, 
reconsent may also be completed remotely using the following pro cedures:  
 
1. The site staff sends copy of the informed consent form to the participant.  
2. The participant reads through the consent form but does not sign.  
3. The Site Investigator, or other study staff member approved and delegated to obtain informed 
consent, ca lls the participant and reviews the informed consent form with the participant over 
the phone or via telemedicine.  
4. The participant signs the informed consent form and mails the original signed consent form 
back to the site.  
5. Once received at the site, the individual who consented the participant via phone signs the 
informed consent form.  
 
Modifications to Regimen Schedule  
Designated v isits in the Schedule of Activities  (i.e. Week 16) may be conducted via telemedicine 
(or phone if telemedicine is not av ailable) with remote servi ces instead of in -person if needed to 
protect the safety of the participant due to a pandemic  or other reason . If a planned in -clinic visit 
is conducted via telemedicine (or phone if telemedicine is not available) with remote  services, 
only selected procedures will be performed . Instructions on how to document missed procedures 
are included in the MOP .  
In addition to the procedures in the Master Protocol that should be conducted during the phone or 
telemedicine and remote visits, the following regimen -specific procedures should be completed :  
• CNS Bulbar Function Scale  
Details on collection of the CNS Bulbar Function Scale, dispensing IP during remote visits, and 
documenting subjects’ willingness to participate in OLE are described in the MOP.  
6.[ADDRESS_963176] on Day 0 .  The following procedures will be performed  for the regimen

o During each infusion, vital signs associated with the infusion (systolic and diastolic 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and heart rate are to be measured pre -infusion, 30 minutes ( ± 
5 mins) after the start of infusion (SOI), at the end of infusion ( ± 10 mins), and 90 
minutes ( ± 10 mins) after the start of infusion. If a participant  requires a 90 -minute 
infusion duration due to receiving more than 2 bags of study drug  an additional vi tal 
signs measurement is to be completed approximately 30 minutes (±10 mins) after the 
end of the 90 -minute infusion.

During the placebo -controlled treatment period , all pa rticipa nts will receive a weekly infusion of 
study drug (trehalose or placebo for 60 + 10 minutes , participant s who require more than 2 bags 
of SLS -005 the infusion time is to be increased to 90  + 10 minutes ) for the first [ADDRESS_963178] any PK samples; therefore, the 
Week 8 PK samples would be missed if the Week 8 infusion does not occ ur in-clinic at the time 
of the Week 8 in -clinic visit. This would not result in a protocol deviation.  
Concurrent assessments such as vital signs, reporting of any infusion related adverse event s, and 
reporting of new concomitant  medication s is to be completed weekly in conjunction with the 
study drug infusion.  
Blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and heart rate , should be conducted at four timepoints  during 
each infusion :  (1) Pre -dose, (2) midway through infusion = 30 ± [ADDRESS_963179] start of infusio n, (3) 
end of infusion = 60 ± [ADDRESS_963180] start of infusion, and (4) 90 ± [ADDRESS_963181] start of infusion.  If 
a participant  requires a 90 -minute infusion duration due to receiving more than 2 bags of study 
drug an additional vital signs measurement is to be completed approximately  30 minutes  (± 10 
mins) after the end of infusion.

7.1  ALSAQ -40 
The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire -40 (ALSAQ -40) is a participant  
self-report health status patient-reported outcome. The ALSAQ -40 consists of forty  questions 
that are specifically used to measure the subjective well -being of participant s with ALS  and 
motor neuron disease.  
Participants will be handed the questionnaire and asked to write their answers themselves.  
Caregivers can also help, if needed.  
7.2  Center for Neurologic Study Bulbar Function Scale  
The Center for Neurologic Study Bulbar Function Scale (CNS -BFS) is a participant  self-report 
scale that has b een developed for use as an end point in clinical trials and as a clinical measure for 
evaluating and following ALS participant s. The CNS -BFS consists of three domains 
(swallowing, speech, and salivation), which are assessed with a 21 -question, self -report 
questionnaire.  
Participants will be handed the questionnaire and asked to write their answers themselves.  
Caregivers can also help, if needed.

Version 2.0 12/03 /2021   CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 51 9 REGIMEN -SPECIFIC STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1  Deviations from the Default Master Protocol Trial Design  
The statistical design for this regimen will be in accordance with the default statistical design 
described in Appendix I of the Master Protocol with only one deviation. This regimen will not 
include interim analyses for early success.   
9.2  Regimen Specif ic Operating Character istics  
Clinical trial simulation is used to quantify operating characteristics for this regimen (refer to the 
regimen SAP for further details).   
9.3  Sharing of Controls from other Regimens  
The primary analysis of this regimen will include sharing of all controls from the other 
regimens.   This is justified by [CONTACT_191958]/exclusion criteria of the RSA, 
such that there are no expected systematic differences in the primary endpoint between the 
controls across regi mens.

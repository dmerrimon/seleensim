B7471002
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1066515] been aleading 
cause of bacter emia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and 
continue to be a major global public health concern. Serious pneumococcal disease may  
occur at an y age; however, children <5 years and adults  65 years of age are at particularly  
increased risk.  Individuals with certain comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions 
are also at risk.  Centers for Disease Control an d Prevention (CDC) data estimated that in 
2015 there were 29,500 cases and 3350 deaths due to invasive pneumococcal disease (I PD) 
in the [LOCATION_002].  I n 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 
1.6million people die from pneumococcal di sease each year.  Spneumoniae remains an 
important cause of serious disease in the [LOCATION_002] and worldwide.
The poly saccharide capsule has been identified as an important virulence factor for this 
pathogen. While more than [ADDRESS_1066516] been identified , only a subset of serot ypes are more 
commonly  associated with severe disease.  Pneumococcal disease can be prevented with 
polysaccharide -based vaccines that induce antibody  responses with functional 
(opsonophagocy tic) activity  and target the capsular serot ypes res ponsible for disease.  
Pneumococcal vaccines ,such as the licensed 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine (PPSV23), containing free pol ysaccharide s for23 pneumo coccal seroty pes, elicit a 
T
-cell–independent immune response .  These vaccines are poorl y immunogenic for man y of 
the serot ypes contained in the vaccine in children less than [ADDRESS_1066517] nonbacteremic disease, including 
community -acquired pneumonia (CAP) . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which contain 
capsular polysaccharide scovalentl y linked to a protein c arrier, elicit a T -cell–dependent 
immune response inducing protective responses in y oung children, older adults, and 
populations with high
-risk conditions. 
Prevnar(7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) , which was licensed in the United 
States in 2000 , and Prevnar 13(13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [13vPnC]) , 
which was licensed in the [LOCATION_002] in 2010, are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 
containing 7 and 13, respectivel y,pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide sindividually
conjugated to cross -reactive material 
197 (CRM 197), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin.  
These vaccines target seroty pes that caused the majority of pneumococcal disease in infants 
and older adults at the time of their introduction.  They  have demonstrated 
efficacy /
effectiveness against vaccine- type (VT) IPD, AOM, and pneumonia andthe ability  
to reduce nasophary ngeal carriage and transmission, resulting in indirect beneficial effects.  

20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (20vPnC)
B7471002
Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 9[COMPANY_007] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) candidate to 
further expand protection against the global burden of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal disease in children and adults over that of Prevnar 13. 20vPnC has the same composition as Prevnar 13, but contains an additional [ADDRESS_1066518] undergone extensive clinical research. A Phase 1 study is being conducted in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age to support further development of 20vPnC. The purpose of the proposed Phase 2 study in older adults is to generate a safety and immunogenicity data set with 20vPnC to support and inform the design of the Phase 3 clinical development program for adults.
Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 
2-arm parallel design.  A total of 440 adults 60 through 64 years of age with no history of 
pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled and randomized equally to receive an initial vaccination with either:
•a single dose of 20vPnC followed 1 month later by [CONTACT_49990] (placebo) administration in 
the active vaccine group (20vPnC/saline group), or
•a single dose of 13vPnC followed 1 month later by a dose of PPSV23 in the control 
group (13vPnC/PPSV23 group).
13vPnC will serve as a control for safety, as well as immunogenicity of the 13 serotypes in 
common with 20vPnC. PPSV23 will serve as a control for immunogenicity of the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) in 20vPnC.
Blood samples will be collected on the day of investigational product administration prior to 
each study vaccination (Vaccination 1 and Vaccination 2), 1 month after Vaccination 2, and 12 months after Vaccination 1 for immunogenicity assessments.  Prompted local reactions at the injection site and prompted systemic events will be collected daily for 10 and 7 days,respectively, after Vaccination 1.  Adverse events (AEs) occurring from signed informed consent through 1 month after Vaccination 2 will be collected and serious adverse events (SAEs) and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs) will be collected from signed informed consent through 12 months after Vaccination 1.

1.1.Indication
20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) is being developed for: 
Active immunization to prevent disease caused by  [CONTACT_776658].
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Pneumococcal Disease
S pneumoniae are gram -positive encapsulated cocci that 
have been a leading cause of 
bacter emia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and continue to 
be a major global public health concern.1,2,3  Serious pneumococcal disease may  occur at any  
age; however, children <5 years and adults  65 years of age are at particularly  increased 
risk.4  Individuals with certain comor bidities and immunocompromising conditions are also 
at risk.  
The annual burden of pneumococcal disease in children and adults in the United 
States has been estimated, using 2004 healthcare utilization and disease data. There were
approximatel y 445,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 2. 3million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], 5.0 million outpatient
visits, and 22,000 annual deaths, including 19,000 from pneumonia annually, with the
majority  of the deaths ( 18,000) having occurred in persons 65 years of age.3These data 
represent disease burden after a relativel y short period of Prevnar(7-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine) use in the infant vaccine schedul e (<5 years). A preliminary  update of 
estimates in adults after introduction of Prevnar 13(13-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine [13vPnC]) suggests that although there has been a reduction in disease burden, 
207,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776640] ,meningitis , and sepsis (plausibility  
range of 106,000 -308,000) and 283,000 cases of pneumococcal disease (plausibility  range of 
145,000- 422,000) occurred in US adults in 2015.5Surveillance studies conducted in 
2010- 2012 by  [CONTACT_776659] (CDC )found that S 
pneumoniae 
remains among the most common pathogens identified in community -acquired 
pneumonia ( CAP ) requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776641].6,7
Bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (accounting for the majority of invasive pneumococcal 
disease [ IPD]in adults) is less common than nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (an 
estimated 3 or more cases of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia occur for every  1 case 
of bacteremic pneumonia) , but it is associated with significant morbidity  and mortality1in all 
age groups. The CDC estimated that in 2015 there were 29,500 cases and 3350 deaths due to 
IPD in the [LOCATION_002].8In man y regions of t he world the disease burden is much higher, 
reflected in an assessment by  [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) in [ADDRESS_1066525], 
Spneumoniae remains an important cause of serious disease in the [LOCATION_002] and 
worldwide.

specific seroty pe bind to the capsule and promote complement -mediated opsonophagocy tic 
killing and cl earance of the organism.12  Pneumococcal disease can be prevented with 
polysaccharide -based vaccines that induce antibody  responses with functional 
(opsonophagocy tic) activity  and target the capsular serot ypes responsible for disease.13
1.2.2. Vaccines to Prevent P neumococcal Disease
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccines
Vaccines containing free poly saccharides have been licensed since the 1970s.  One such 
vaccine, the 23 -valent pneumococcal poly saccharide vaccine (PPSV23), has been licensed in 
the [LOCATION_002] sinc e 1983.14
,15  PPSV23 contains capsular pol ysaccharides for 23 
seroty pes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 
22F, 23F, and 33F).  PPSV23 elicits a T -cell–independent immune response.  Unconjugate d 
polysaccharide 
vaccines do not induce robust responses in certain pop ulations
(eg,immunocompromised persons, children <2 years of age, and adults  65 years of age), 
nor do they  generate immunologic memory , so their protective effect wanes over [ADDRESS_1066527] dose of poly saccharide vaccine.21,22
,23Such “hy poresponsiveness ”
hasbeen observed with other poly saccharide vaccines as well, and raises co ncern regarding 
thequality  of response after revaccination or natural exposure to an invading vaccine -type 
(VT) pneumococcus.24Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141859], a number of national vaccine policy  expert
bodies recommend PPSV23 vaccination of adults 65 years of age and/or in persons with
substantial risk factors for pneumococcal disease, to provide some degree of protection
against I PD due to serot ypes not covered b y existing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.25
However, in the [LOCATION_002], the Advisory  Committee on I mmunization Practices (AC IP)
recommends that adults [ADDRESS_1066528] PPSV23 to a
single lifetime dose in adults  [ADDRESS_1066529] other high -
risk
populations.25,26,27

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccines
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines contain poly saccharides that are covalently  linked 
(conjugated) to an immunogenic protein.  This modification results in T -cell–dependent 
immune responses , which have been shown to be protective in y oung children, older adults, 
and populations with high -risk conditions.16,[ADDRESS_1066530] pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine to be licensed (2000) and was indic ated for prevention of pneumococcal disease in 
infants and young children on the basis of efficacy studies.  Prevnar contained capsular 
polysaccharide conjugates for 7 pneumococcal seroty pes ( 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F), 
each covalentl y linked to cross-reactive material 197 ( CRM 197), a nontoxic variant of 
diphtheria toxin.  These 7 seroty pes were responsible for approximatel y 80% to 90% of IPD 
in children <5 years of age in the [LOCATION_002] and approximatel y 60% to 80% of IPD in the 
same age group in Europe at that time (1998- 2000).[ADDRESS_1066531] 
clinically /radiographically  defined pneumonia.[ADDRESS_1066532] effects, 
with a 92% reduction of Prevnar VT IPDin older adults 65 years of age.41,42
Prevnar 13 was developed to expand serot
ype coverage and was licensed in the [LOCATION_002] 
in 2010.  Prevnar 13 includes t he same S pneumoniae serot ypes as Prevnar and an additional 
6 poly saccharide conjugates for serot ypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A.28,32,43  The vaccine was 
licensed for use in infants and y oung children based on comparisons of seroty pe-specific 
immunoglobulin G ( IgG
)to Prevnar, with supportive data to demonstrate the functional 
activity  of the immune responses.  Prevnar [ADDRESS_1066533]  demonstrating comparable serot ype-specific opsonophagocy tic

totwelve months later (except for those who had alread y received PPSV23 and for whom an
additional dose was not indicated ).In 2015, a 12-month interval between vaccinations was 
recommended, based on demonstrated higher frequency  of local reactions with short

high-risk adults.56,57
,58The continued presence of IPD due to serot ypes contained only  in
PPSV23 is likely  due to a combination of intrinsic population factors including age and
comorbidities, lim itations in the ability  of PPSV23 to prevent disease and reduce carriage,
limited duration of PPSV23 protection, and lack of boosting with subsequent doses, which
highlights the need for a better vaccine than PPSV23 and expanded coverage.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for 20v PnC
Because of the number of serot ypes that may cause pneumococcal disease among different 
geographic regions, different age populations, and different environmental backgrounds, 
there remains value in expanding serot ype coverage .
20vPnC is being develope d to further expand protection against the global burden of 
vaccine -preventable pneumococcal disease in children and adults over that of Prevnar 13. 
20vPnC contains the seroty pes present in Prevnar 13 plus 7 new serot ypes (8, 10A, 11A, 
12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F), as well as the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_776643].  The pol ysaccharides of the 20 capsular seroty pes of S pneumoniae are each 
covalentl y linked to CRM 197.  These 7 additional serotypes were selected based on their 
relative pr evalence as a cause of IPD, their generalized geographic distribution, and other 
factors that would support inclusion, such as the presence of antibiotic resistance and greater 
disease severity  (eg, meningitis, mortality ).59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70These 7 s erotypes are 
also present in PPSV23.71Adding these additional serotypes to the 13 serot ypes in Prevnar 
13 is anticipated to further reduce the global burden of pneumococcal disease and provide 
protection comparable to, or greater than, that of PPSV23.

A Phase 1 study is being conducted in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age to support further 
development of 20vPnC. The details of this study can be found in the IB. 
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 20vPnC 
in adults 60 to 64 years of age and to generate a safety and immunogenicity data set with 20vPnC to support and inform the design of the Phase 3 clinical development program for adults. The targeted age of the population for this study, adults 60 through 64 years of age, 
has been selected as this approximates the population ( ≥65 years of age) who are 
recommended for vaccination with 13vPnC and PPSV23 by [CONTACT_776661], but are unlikely to have 
already received a pneumococcal vaccine. All subjects will receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC for the initial vaccination. 13vPnC will serve as a reference vaccine for safety and tolerability assessments and for immunogenicity of the 13 common serotypes in 20vPnC. At the second vaccination, 1 month later, the 20vPnC recipi[INVESTIGATOR_776644] 13vPnC recipi[INVESTIGATOR_776645]23. PPSV23 will provide a reference for the immune responses to the 7 additional serotypes in the 20vPnC. Subjects will also return 12 months after Vaccination 1 for measurement of circulating antibodies at that time.
Additional information for this compound may be found in the single reference safety 
document (SRSD), which for this study is the 20vPnC IB. The SRSD for 13vPnC and PPSV23 are the US package inserts (USPIs).

3. STUDY DESIGN
This will be a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 
2-arm parallel design, conducted at investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002].  A total of 440 
adults 60 through 64 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled and randomized equally to receive an initial vaccination with either:
oa single dose of 20vPnC followed 1 month later by [CONTACT_49990] (placebo) administration in 
the active vaccine group (20vPnC/saline group), or 
oa single dose of 13vPnC followed 1 month later by a dose of PPSV23 in the control 
group (13vPnC/PPSV23 group).  
13vPnC will serve as a control for safety, as well as immunogenicity of the 13 serotypes in 
common with 20vPnC. PPSV23 will serve as a control for immunogenicity of the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) in 20vPnC as described in Table 1 .CCI

197.   
 
 
 
 
20vPnC and 13vPnC will be supplied to the site as packaged, single-use prefilled syringes 
and labeled according to local regulatory requirements.
PPSV23 is a licensed commercial product (Pneumovax, [COMPANY_006]) and is a clear, sterile solution 
consisting of a mixture of purified capsular polysaccharides from 23 types of S pneumoniae : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20, 22F, 23F, 
and 33F. The vaccine is formulated to contain 25 μg of each of the 23 purified
polysaccharide serotypes per 0.5-mL dose of vaccine in an isotonic saline solution containing 
0.25% phenol as a preservative. PPSV23 will be supplied by [CONTACT_776665].
The placebo will consist of a sterile normal saline solution for injection (0.9% sodium 
chloride injection) and will be supplied to the site as packaged vials and labeled according to local regulatory requirements.
5.6.2. Preparation and Dispensing
See the Investigational Product Manual (IP manual) or package insert for instructions on how 
to prepare the investigational product for administration.  Investigational product should be prepared and dispensed by [CONTACT_110444] (eg, physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician, or pharmacist) as allowed by [CONTACT_5737], state, and institutional guidance.

Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1066556] will be administered to blinded subjects.
5.7. Administration
All subjects will receive a single dose (0.5 mL) of investigational product administered 
intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle, preferably in the nondominant arm, at Visit [ADDRESS_1066557] immunization practices.
Administration of investigational products should be performed by [CONTACT_407395], Good Clinical Practice (GCP)-trained, and vaccine-experienced member of the study staff (eg, physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or medical assistant) as allowed by [CONTACT_5737], state, and institutional guidance. 
Investigational product administration details will be recorded on the CRF.
5.8. Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, unblinded 
dispenser/administrator, will ensure that all investigational products, including any comparator and/or marketed products, are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with 
the labels.
20vPnC, 13vPnC, PPSV23, and saline will be shipped to the study site after required 
regulatory and legal documents have been received by [CONTACT_456].
 
 
 
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD (20vPnC IB, 13vPnC USPI, and PPSV23 USPI)
will be superseded by [CONTACT_580051].
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room-temperature products).  This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study.  Even for continuous-monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last CCI
20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (20vPnC)
B7471002
Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 31evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all nonworking day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature -monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery . The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling , as soon a s possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007] .
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a 
protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the 
temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where

considered excursions.
5.9. Investigational Product Accountability 
The unblinded dispenser/administrator at the investiga torsite must maintain adequate records 
documenting the receipt, use, loss, or othe r disposition of the investigational product 
supplies.  All investigational products will be accounted for using a drug accountability  
form/record .
Used needles and s yringes should be disposed of according to local practice.  Empty outer 
investigational pr oduct containers must be retained until reviewed by  [CONTACT_456]'s unblinded 
site staff and then may  be destroy ed after the sponsor’s unblinded site staff has performed 
accountability .  Investigational product return/destruction must be documented on the 
accountability  log.
5.9.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of un used investigational 
product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, t he 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by

An investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a subject from the stud y if deemed appropriate.  
In addition, if a subject fails to continue to meet the inclusion criteria, new information 
becomes av ailable that would exclude the subject, or the subject develops a condition or 
situation that would meet exclusion criteria, the subject may  be considered for withdrawal.
Reasons wh y a subject may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not 
limited to, failure to meet entrance criteria (screening failure), AE, death, pregnancy, 
protocol deviation, lost to follow -up, no longer willing to participate in the study , study  
terminated b y the sponsor,  or an y other reason.  Subjects who have re ceived the 
investigational product will not be replaced regardless of the reason for withdrawal.

withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events ,Section 8.1.3) or behavioral reasons, or 
the inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given investigator site. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_8873]’s medical record. In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator s hould inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, 
and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved AEs.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Withdrawal of Consent :
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of investigational product will remain in the 
study  and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow- up procedures. The 
only exception to this is when a subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further 
contact [CONTACT_776670]. Subjects should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw 
consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be 
explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is 
only from further receipt of investigational product or also from study  procedures and/or 
posttreatment study  follow -up. In the event that vital status (whethe
r the subject is alive or 
dead) is being measured, publicly  available information should be used to determine vital 
status only  as appropriately  directed in accordance with local law.
Lost to f ollow -up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjec ts to determine and report their ongoing
status. This includes follow- up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084]. Lost 
tofollow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_53981] y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by  [CONTACT_691116] [ADDRESS_1066569]’s medical records. If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the investigator site may use locall y permissible 
methods to obt ain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third
-party

representative to assist investigator site staff with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_74086] -up portion of the study . 
The investigator site staff and representative may consult publicly available sources, such as 
public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact [CONTACT_3031]. If,
after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow- up, then the last -known -alive date as 
determined b y the investigator should be r eported and documented in the subject’s medical 
records.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -
required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However ,it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumsta nces outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessar y to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject. When a protocol -required test cannot be per formed ,the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
heor she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timel y manner .
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact [CONTACT_19987] .Serum samples should be processed an d stored as indicated in the 
study reference manual (SRM) or equivalent document .

electronically  to [COMPANY_007] for anal ysis and reporting. 
Thee-diary  data do not need to be reported b y the investigator in the CRF.  However, if a 
subject withdraws because of prompted events reported in the e- diary , the event(s) should be 
recorded on the AE page of the CRF, regardless of whether the investigator considers the 
event(s) to be clinically  significant.
Investigators (or an appropriately  qualified designee) are required to review the e -diary  data 
online at frequent intervals (daily  is optimal) to evaluate subject compliance and as part of 
the ongoing sa fety review .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Fever
In order to record information on fever, a digital thermometer will be given to the subject 
with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home.  Temperature will be 
collected in the evening daily  for 7 day s following Vaccinat ion 1 (Day s 1 through 7, where 
Day 1 is the day  of vaccination) and at an y time during the 7 day s that fever is suspected.  
Fever is defined as an oral temperature of 100.4F (38.0C).  The highest temperature for 
each day  will be recorded in the e -diary .  In the event of a fever on Day  7, temperature will 
be collected daily  until fever has resolved (1 day  of temperature less than 100.4 F [38.0C]) 
in order to collect a stop date in the CRF.  A subject with a fever >104.0 F (>40.0C) will be

7.2. Immunogenicity
Blood samples (approximately 30 or 50 mL/visit) for immunogenicity assessments will be 
collected from all subjects prior to Vaccination 1, prior to Vaccination 2(post-Vaccination 1/pre–Vaccination 2), approximately 1 month (28 to 35 days) after Vaccination 2, and approximately [ADDRESS_1066583] completing participation through 
Visit 5 will be approximately 160 mL. Sera will be used for immunogenicity assessments and vaccine development research (eg, assay development to support vaccine programs).  
 
 
Immunogenicity assays will be performed at [COMPANY_007] Vaccine Research & Development 
Laboratory located at [ADDRESS_1066584], Pearl River, NY [ZIP_CODE] and/or at a facility designated by [CONTACT_4618].
7.3. Biological Samples 
Blood samples will be used only for scientific research.  Each sample will be labeled with a 
code so that the laboratory personnel testing the samples will not know the subject’s identity.
Samples that remain after performing assays outlined in the protocol may be stored by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Unless a time limitation is required by [CONTACT_240846], the samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the end of the study and then destroyed.  If allowed by [CONTACT_86839], stored samples may be used for additional testing to better understand the immune responses to the vaccine(s) under study in this protocol, to inform the development of other products, and/or for vaccine-related assay work supporting vaccine programs.  No testing of the subject’s genetic material will be performed.  
The subject may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroyed at any time; 
however, any data already collected from those samples will still be used for this research.  The biological samples may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality is maintained and no testing of the subject’s genetic material is performed.CCI

to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; (2) 
nonserious AEs; and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study  during 
pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.  
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report 
Form  to [COMPANY_007] Safety Within [ADDRESS_1066585] under study during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), except 
occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure (regardless 
of whether associated with an AE)
a.Nonserious AEs will be recorded from the time t he subject provides informed consent through and 
including Visit 3.  After Visit 3, only newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (can be nonserious) and 
SAEs will be reported.
All observed or volunteered events regardless of vaccine group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_1066586] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within [ADDRESS_1066587] pursue and obtain adequate information b oth to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF.  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination o f possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible

Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1066588] SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, any nonserious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and und erstanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used o n both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each s tudy subject will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study d ue to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal Section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,
according to the definition of AE noted b elow, and recorded on the CRF.
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirem ents section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs and NDCMCs (“active 
collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed 
consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before 
undergoing an y stud y-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through 
and including Visit 3. Between Visit 3 and Visit 5, only  NDCMCs and SAEs will be 
reported. An NDCMC is defined as a disease or medical condition, not previously  identified, 
that is expected to be persistent or is otherwise long- lasting in its effects.  At Visit 4
(6months after V accination 1) , the subject will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y telephone to inquir e about 
SAEs, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776649] 3. At Visit 5 (12 months after 
Vaccination 1) , the subject will be asked about SAEs, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776650] 4.

status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be rep orted to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both nonserious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigatio nal product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records.  
In addition, if the investigator dete rmines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE r eporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.

Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1066589] or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdos e;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.

20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (20vPnC)
B7471002
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1066590] findings should be recorded as AEs when any of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, i n the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct norma l life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 49Medical device complaints may  meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see the Medical 
Device Complaint Reporting Requirements section).  An incident is an y malfunction (ie, the 
failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended; 
performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device) that, 
directly  or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, or of 
other persons, or to a serious deterioration in their state of health.  
A serious injury  that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:
Alife-threatening illness, even if temporary  in nature;
Apermanent impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; 
Acondition n ecessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 
2bulleted items;
Examples: clinically  relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure; a 
condition that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776651];
Any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in vitro diagnostic 
device test results when used within the manufacturer’s instructions for use;
Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_776652] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to th e emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;

Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 50Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam ination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a me dical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SA E 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator w ill use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum i ntensity of the AE. For purposes of 
consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:
[ADDRESS_1066591]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_1066592]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_1066593]'s usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) bu t would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.

B7471002
Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 518.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) ar e termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury  but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible " to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug- induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
Liver function tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in this 
study .  However, should an investigator deem it necessary  to assess LFTs because a subject 
presents with clinical signs/sy mptoms, such LFT results should be managed and followed as 
described below.
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab oratory
sample).  In rare instances, by  [CONTACT_22858], AST/A LT values might 
have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law cri teria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baselin e values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:

20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (20vPnC)
B7471002
Final Protocol, [ADDRESS_1066594] or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values 
>2times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller).
oPreexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches >3 × ULN 
(which ever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_1066595] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), t otal bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase ,and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further cont emporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and pot ential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of avail ability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product d uring Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to Pf izer Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.

B7471002
Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure d uring Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an EDP occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
expose d (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
oAn example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
inves tigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during 
his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] prod uct in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the c ase of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fet us should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1066596].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Re lease of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure d uring Breastfeeding
Scenarios of e xposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the e xposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertai n to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject;
The administration of expi[INVESTIGATOR_149325];
The administration of an incorrect investigational product;
The administration of an incorrect d osage;
The administration of investigational product that has undergone temperature 
excursion from the specified storage range, unless it is determined by  [CONTACT_233034].
Such medication er rors occurring to a study  participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF.
Medicat ion errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within [ADDRESS_1066598] SAE Report

8.5.Medical Device Complaint Rep orting Requirements
All medical device complaints, regardless of whether the medical device complaint is 
associated with an AE, will be recorded on the applicable pages within the CRF.  This 
includes potential incidents or malfunctions associated with the use of a medical device 
product.  An incident or malfunction is an event that might have led to death or serious 
deterioration in health, or if it occurred again might lead to death or serious deterioration in 
health.
[COMPANY_007] is to be notified of all medic al device complaints within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event. 
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a s tatistical analysis plan(SAP) , which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate ; however, any  major modifications of the primary  endpoint definition s or their 
analyses will also be reflected i n a protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The study  size is not based on any formal statistical hy pothesis test.  Approximately  220 
adults per vaccine group are planned to be randomized.  No formal statistical comparisons 
between vaccine groups are planned. Therefore, no power calculations for comparison of 
vaccine groups are included; however, the probabilities of at least [ADDRESS_1066599]
1AE, local reaction, or sy stemic event where the true rate is 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, and  5% are 
0.198, 0.668, 0.890, and >0.999, respectivel y. 
9.2.Analysis Populations
The safet y population will include all subjects who receive [ADDRESS_1066600] :
1. who receives the assigned vaccine as randomized, 
2.whose has either Visit 2 or Visit 3 blood collection within 27 to 49 day s, inclusive, after

blood collections is outside the window.  However, titers  obtained outside the window will be excluded from the evaluable population analysis.  Additional criteria (eg, without major protocol violations) are described in the SAP.
The evaluable immunogenicity population will be the primary analysis population for 
immunogenicity results.
The all-available immunogenicity population will include all subjects who receive 20vPnC or 
13vPnC and have  1 valid and determinate OPA titer  after either vaccination. The all-available immunogenicity population will be the secondary analysis population for immunogenicity results.  Subjects will be assigned to their randomized vaccine.
9.3. Immunogenicity Analysis
Geometric means (GMs) will be calculated for  OPA  results at every time point
by [CONTACT_29299], as well as the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Each serotype will be analyzed separately.
GMFRs will be calculated for the OPA  results.  GMFRs will be calculated for 
change in value from before the first vaccination until [ADDRESS_1066603] vaccination(Visit 2), from before the first vaccination (Visit 1) until 1 month after the second vaccination(Visit 3),  
  GMFRs will 
be defined as the latter result divided by [CONTACT_776672].
GMs and their confidence intervals (CIs) will be obtained by [CONTACT_639298] 
, calculating the 95% CI with reference to the t-distribution, then 
exponentiating the mean and the limits. The GMFR and its CI will be calculated using the same method.
The proportions of subjects with OPA titers ≥the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be 
calculated for each time point and each serotype.  The 95% CIs will be obtained using the 
Clopper-Pearson method.CCI CCI

Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 58Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_776653].  The 
visits in each RCDC will depend on the serotype.  RCDCs for the 13 shared serotypes will be limited to before vaccination, 1 month after Vaccination 1,  
.  RCDCs for the additional 7 serotypes will be limited to before vaccination, 1 month after 
Vaccination 1 or 1 month after Vaccination 2 (depending on the investigational productsreceived), .  Further details will be specified in the SAP. 
9.4. Safety Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_776654]. In each group, local reactions and systemic events from Day 1 to Day 10 and from Day 1 to Day 7, respectively, after Vaccination 1 only, will be presented by [CONTACT_122706].  Descriptive statistics will include proportions of subjects with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs.
AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) with causality and severity will be 
summarized from Vaccination 1 until Visit 2, approximately 1 month (up to 35 days) after Vaccination 1. AEs will also be summarized from Vaccination 2 until Visit 3, approximately 2 months after 20vPnC (and 1 month after saline) administration in the 20vPnC/saline group, and 1 month after PPSV23 administration in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group.  Additionally, SAEs and NDCMCs will be presented for 2 intervals: from Vaccination 1 until Visit 4(6 months after 20vPnC administration) and from Vaccination 1 until Visit 5 (12 months after 20vPnC administration).  The descriptive statistics for AEs will be summarized as the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 event of each preferred term with the associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs, arranged by [CONTACT_9313], and will also be summarized as the number of occurrences of the event.
9.5. Analysis Timing
1. Unblinded descriptive analyses of safety data for the first 30 subjects through 10 days of 
follow-up after Vaccination 1. These analyses will be performed by a designated unblinded statistician.
2. Unblinded safety and immunogenicity data from Visit 1 through Visit 2 will be analyzed 
when available.  The analyses will be descriptive.  This analysis will inform internal program development decisions and potentially support regulatory interactions.
3. Unblinded safety and immunogenicity data from Visit 2 to Visit 3 will be analyzed when 
available.  The analyses will be descriptive.  This analysis will also inform internal program development decisions and potentially support regulatory interactions.
4. Safety data from Visit 3 through Visit 4 (6-month telephone call) will be analyzed when 
available.
5. Safety  data from Visit 4 through Visit 5 will be analyzed when 
available. These will be the final analyses.CCI

Final Protocol, 20 July 2017
Page 60It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulato ry 
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,
and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_110292]. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi [INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases , data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents
, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source docum ents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, acco rding to local 
regulations, or as specified in the c linical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].

IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for

Each investigational site will identify a designee who will be held responsible for controlling the investigational device and ensuring that it is dispensed only for the purposes of this investigation.  This designee will be expected to retain all unopened, unused, investigational product supplied until the completion of the investigation or until the Sponsor or designated Sponsor representative has made arrangements for the return or proper destruction of unused investigational product.  3.[ADDRESS_1181180]™, the investigational device, is supplied as bellows pre-loaded with hemostatic powder.  The bellows contains 1.65g of implant material.  The product is sterilized using gamma irradiation and is provided in double-packaging.  HEMOBLAST™ will be specifically labeled for this investigation as “Investigational Product” per applicable laws and regulations.  Use of the device outside of this clinical investigational plan is strictly prohibited; further, the instructions for use will be strictly followed.  [ADDRESS_1181181] current definition is the “cessation of bleeding.”7  The term comes from the Greek roots heme (blood) and stasis (halt).  Hemostasis can be considered as control of bleeding within the finely tuned balance of procoagulant, anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and anti-fibrinolytic activities.8  Hemostasis refers to the process of causing blood to form a clot (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage).  Most of the time, this process includes the changing of blood from a fluid to a solid state.  Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood’s tendency to clot.  The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood coagulation by [CONTACT_774594]-like molecules and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation by [CONTACT_774595].  When endothelial injury occurs, the endothelial cells cease secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secret von Willebrand factor and tissue thromboplastin which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury.  Hemostasis has three major steps: vasoconstriction, formation of a platelet plug, and blood coagulation.  
  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-[ADDRESS_1181182] savings.9, 10, 11 During surgical operations, it is important to maintain a fine balance between bleeding and clotting so that blood continues to flow to the tissues at the surgical site without excessive blood loss.  There are many tools used for hemorrhage control; these include preventive measures, transfusion of blood products, and traditional methods.[ADDRESS_1181183] pressure or compression at a bleeding site is often the Investigator’s first choice to assist in the control of bleeding.  The placement of direct pressure over the injury site serves to compress vascular structures and promote localized clotting.  Direct pressure, while widely accepted as standard of care for the control of all levels of bleeding severity, has limited discourse in the surgical literature.  Other mechanical methods, including sutures, staples, and ligating clips, are useful if the source of bleeding is easily identifiable and able to be sealed.11  Compression and other mechanical methods may not be appropriate during all surgical procedures; this method of controlling bleeding may not be sufficient when the source of bleeding is hard to identify, as for diffuse venous bleeding.[ADDRESS_1181184]’s condition and the assessment/modification of intra- and post-operative management.

A tool to assess the severity of intraoperative bleeding at a target bleeding site (TBS) has been developed and validated by [CONTACT_1034].  This Surface Bleeding Severity Scale (SBSS) will be used to evaluate bleeding, as well as hemostasis, for the purposes of this clinical investigation.  The SBSS was developed by [CONTACT_849544]’Up in cooperation with the FDA.  This method of bleeding severity assessment was validated in preclinical and clinical studies and will be used in this clinical investigation.  The utility of the SBSS was confirmed in a clinical setting during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_585037], also providing initial data on the safety and efficacy of HEMOBLAST™.  The agreement between Investigators utilizing the SBSS in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_849508]-defined criteria.  Satisfactory assessment with respect to agreement of bleeding severity, hemostasis, and eligibility using the SBSS was demonstrated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_585037], substantiating its use in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_849506].  Severity of bleeding of the TBS for each subject in the clinical investigation will be assessed by [CONTACT_849545], as defined in Table 2 below.

Class 2 – involves 15-30% of total blood volume; patient is often tachycardic with a narrowing of the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures; the body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction; skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch; volume resuscitation with crystalloids is all that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_80454]; blood transfusion is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_80454].  Class 3 – involves loss of 30-40% of circulating blood volume; patient’s blood pressure drops; heart rate increases, peripheral hypoperfusion worsens; fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary.  Class 4 – involves loss of > 40% of circulating blood volume; the limit of the body’s compensation is reached and aggressive resuscitation is required to prevent death.  The SBSS will be used to determine the intraoperative eligibility (described further in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) as well as hemostatic success (described further in Section 6.4.3).  Use of the SBSS will ensure consistent enrollment of TBSs of similar bleeding severities and help ensure subject safety by [CONTACT_849546].  Investigators will be trained and tested on the SBSS prior to their enrollment of any subjects into the clinical investigation, as described further in Appendix D.  4.4 Rationale  Although the properties of the ideal local hemostatic agent may vary according to the surgical specialty, some properties are universally valued including: rapid and effective control/cessation of bleeding; ability to make effective contact [CONTACT_849547]; acceptable safety profile; and ease of preparation and use.  According to Spotnitz et al, the ideal hemostat, sealant or adhesive must have certain performance characteristics (safety, efficacy, usability, cost, and approvability) that enable it to be used by [CONTACT_4718].[ADDRESS_1181185] can yet be used for all potential applications.  The challenge is to develop a local agent that may combine all those characteristics.  Biom’Up ([LOCATION_009]) has developed and manufactured a new medical device, HEMOBLAST™, which is intended for use in surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis when control of bleeding by

  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-002   Version 4.0 
Confidential  Page 31 of 56  
 An adverse event (AE) is defined according to the European Standard EN ISO [ZIP_CODE] as ‘any untoward medical occurrence in a subject’.  An adverse event related to a device is defined as an ‘adverse device effect’ (ADE) and is defined as ‘any untoward and unintended response to an investigational medical device’.  An adverse event or an adverse device effect may be mild, moderate or severe and are usually unexpected.   A device deficiency is defined as the inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, which may include device malfunctions, use errors and inadequate labeling.   All adverse events, adverse device effects, and or device deficiencies, either observed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_479306], must be reported to the Sponsor/Sponsor representative.  To report an adverse event or adverse device effect or device deficiency, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_849512].  The report will include the following information: nature, severity, date of onset, duration, course and history of the adverse event/adverse device effect and causality. The subject will be questioned about any adverse event(s) and adverse device effect(s) at each visit.  Expected adverse events and anticipated adverse device effects are included in Section 13.  7.2 Adverse Event Documentation  Adverse events will be documented by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_849513](s) at the investigational site and also on the Adverse Event CRF.  Adverse events are to be recorded and dated according to when they are first observed.  The subsequent treatment(s) should also be documented.  The following will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF:  • Accepted medical term for the event; • Description of the event; • Date of onset; • Date of resolution, if applicable; • Outcome; • Treatment(s)/action(s) taken; • Severity; • Relationship to the investigational device; and • Determination of reportability (see Reporting Section below).  The severity of the event will be determined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:  • Mild: the symptoms are transient, barely perceptible by [CONTACT_849554]; no treatment is usually prescribed to reduce these symptoms; • Moderate: the symptoms are sufficiently severe to provoke discomfort in the subject and sufficiently uncomfortable to prevent normal activity; a treatment may be required; or • Severe: the symptoms considerably modify the normal course of the subject’s activities or are disabling or are life-threatening; the treatment studied should be suspended; a treatment for the symptoms is prescribed.  
  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-002   Version 4.0 
Confidential  Page 32 of 56  
The relationship to the investigational device will be determined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:  • Not related: the adverse event is due to the underlying disease state or is due to concomitant medications or therapy not related to the use of the device; • Possibly related: the adverse event has a reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device but alternative etiology is equally or more likely compared to the potential relationship to the use of the device; • Probably related: the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the use of the device and alternative etiology is less likely compared to the potential relationship to the use of the device; or • Definitely related: the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the use of the device, follows a known response pattern and cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The expectedness of the adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_17174]:  • Anticipated; or • Unanticipated.  7.3 Reporting  A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that:  • Led to death; • Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, or a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function; or  A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less opportune.  An unanticipated [serious] adverse device effect (UADE/[LOCATION_003]DE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

Table 8: Primary and secondary endpoints and hypotheses Endpoint and Hypothesis Definition of Endpoint Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Hypothesis Non-inferiority for TTH within [ADDRESS_1181214] will be considered a success if complete hemostasis (SBSS of 0) is achieved and maintained within [ADDRESS_1181215] being ready to use (measured in minutes and seconds). Non-inferiority for TTH within [ADDRESS_1181216] will be considered a success if complete hemostasis (SBSS of 0) is achieved and maintained within [ADDRESS_1181217] will be considered a success if complete hemostasis (SBSS of 0) is achieved and maintained within [ADDRESS_1181218] will be considered a success if complete hemostasis (SBSS of 0) is achieved and maintained within [ADDRESS_1181219] success will be defined as hemostasis of the target bleeding site within 6 minutes of hemostat application.  The proportion of subjects, overall, and in each surgical indication, meeting this success criterion will be estimated and a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of subjects meeting the success criteria will be presented.    Overall study success will be defined as non-inferiority of HEMOBLAST™ relative to G+T in the proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis within 6 minutes of hemostat application.   12.2 General Analysis Considerations  All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® and R.  Unless otherwise specified, all continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics, which will include the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  All categorical endpoints will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.

12.2.1 Analysis Populations  Safety analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized into the study and received study intervention and all lead-in subjects.  Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the time to hemostasis (TTH) Analysis Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, received study intervention, and had a TTH assessment recorded regardless of whether the measurement was censored (defined as the use of an additional hemostatic product or surgical rescue prior to the end of observation time, or failing to achieve and maintain complete hemostasis prior to the end of observation time).  Data summaries will be based on the intervention received, regardless of which intervention was randomly assigned.  12.2.[ADDRESS_1181220] of potential missing data will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  12.2.3 Subgroup Analyses  Descriptive analyses of safety and efficacy data will be presented by [CONTACT_58314]. The primary efficacy endpoint, as well as all secondary efficacy endpoints and safety outcomes will be presented by [CONTACT_58314]. Estimates of the distribution of TTH over a maximum follow-up of 10 minutes will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method, stratified by [CONTACT_58314]. Kaplan-Meier estimates for the probability of continued bleeding at all scheduled assessment times (3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes) will be displayed on each plot along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  Additionally, the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as all secondary efficacy endpoints and safety outcomes will be presented stratified by:  • The number of interventions (separate applications of randomized hemostat); • Baseline SBSS score; and • Abnormal versus normal coagulation values.  The study will recruit patients undergoing elective surgery.  Based upon this and the inclusion/exclusion criteria to be implemented, it is assumed that patients with abnormal coagulation studies will not be randomized and treated.  In the unlikely event that patients with abnormal coagulation studies are present, a secondary analysis of the primary endpoint considering only those subjects with normal coagulation studies will also be conducted.  Further, to assess the robustness of the primary endpoint with respect to possible imbalances in the frequency of patients with abnormal studies by [CONTACT_2939], a “worst-case” sensitivity analysis assuming all randomized and treated subjects in the HEMOBLAST™ arm with abnormal studies are treatment failures for the primary endpoint (TTH greater than 6 min) while all randomized and treated subjects in the G+T arm with abnormal studies are treatment successes (TTH less than 6 min).  These subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be presented along with the primary results conducted on the TTH Population defined in Section 12.2.1.  12.2.[ADDRESS_1181221]™ to those receiving G+T will be conducted to maintain an overall 0.025 (one-sided) significance level accounting for one interim analysis and one final analysis (see Sections 12.4.1 and

12.4.2).  The exclusion of a >10% difference in the probability of TTH at 6 minutes will be indicated by [CONTACT_849555] a 95% confidence interval for the adjusted difference in binomial proportions (HEMOBLAST™ – G+T). All reported inference (confidence intervals and p-values) will account for the planned interim analysis.   Adjustment for multiple comparisons when assessing secondary endpoints will be performed using a fixed sequence closed testing procedure. The experiment-wise Type I error rate will be controlled in the strong sense at a (two-sided) 5% significance level. In a fixed sequence testing procedure, the formal inferential testing can proceed to the next step only when statistical significance is declared in the current step. If the testing sequence is stopped, the remaining endpoints in the testing sequence will be considered exploratory. Furthermore, any comparisons that are not presented in the a priori specified testing procedure will also be considered exploratory. The fixed sequence testing procedure will be employed among the primary and secondary endpoints in the order presented below:     1) Primary endpoint: Success at achieving hemostasis within [ADDRESS_1181222] treated bleeding site (comparable efficacy of HEMOBLAST™ relative to G+T, evaluated using a 10% non-inferiority margin); 2) Secondary endpoint: The difference between arms in mean preparation time, defined as the time from the opening of package to product being ready to use (measured in minutes and seconds); 3) Secondary endpoint: Success at achieving hemostasis within [ADDRESS_1181223] treated bleeding site (comparable efficacy evaluated using a 10% non-inferiority margin); 4) Secondary endpoint: Success at achieving hemostasis within [ADDRESS_1181224] treated bleeding site (superiority of HEMOBLAST™ relative to G+T); and 5) Secondary endpoint: Success at achieving hemostasis within [ADDRESS_1181225] treated bleeding site (superiority of HEMOBLAST™ relative to G+T).  12.2.[ADDRESS_1181226] Disposition and Characteristics  The number of subjects randomized to each treatment arm will be tabulated and a flow diagram describing the disposition of subjects will be constructed. Demographic variables will include age (continuous and by [CONTACT_67579] [categorized by [CONTACT_849556]]), sex, race, ethnicity, height, and weight.  Baseline disease characteristics will include reason for surgery and related co-morbidities. All continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics, that will include the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  All categorical endpoints will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  12.2.[ADDRESS_1181227] compliance with completing the follow-up visit will be reported.  12.2.8 Protocol Deviations

Eligibility criteria that were not met will be listed along with whether or not an exception was granted.  Important protocol deviations will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Important protocol deviations are defined as:  - Any unauthorized protocol deviations that result in a significant added risk to the study subject; - Non-adherence to eligibility criteria without prior Sponsor approval; - Non-adherence to good clinical practices, FDA regulations, and/or ICH guidelines (e.g., failure to obtain proper informed consent or failure to report SAEs); - A high frequency of unauthorized non-adherence to study procedures or schedules that do not involve eligibility; - Development of withdrawal criteria during the study without corresponding subject withdrawal; - Receipt of a prohibited concomitant medication by a subject; and - Protocol deviations will be summarized in tables produced by [CONTACT_849557].  12.3   Analytic Methods   12.3.1 Analysis of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Population  Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the TTH Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, received study intervention, and had a TTH assessment recorded regardless of whether the measurement was censored.  Lead-in subjects are not part of the TTH Population.  [IP_ADDRESS] Methods of Analysis  The primary efficacy endpoint is the difference in the probability of TTH within [ADDRESS_1181228]™ to G+T.  The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in binomial probabilities will be used to assess comparable efficacy.  The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on data from the first identified bleeding site for each subject. The estimated difference in the probability of TTH at 6 minutes between treatment arms will be adjusted for surgical indication by [CONTACT_849558]-specific differences in observed proportions using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weighting.18   The trial seeks to establish comparable efficacy based upon a non-inferiority margin of 10% for the difference in the probability of TTH within [ADDRESS_1181229]™ to G+T (HEMOBLAST™– G+T). Letting θ denote the true difference in the probability of hemostasis at [ADDRESS_1181230]™ to G+T, the trial will test the null hypothesis H0: θ  ≤ -0.10 vs. the alternative hypothesis HA : θ > -0.[ADDRESS_1181231].  The null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected and comparable efficacy will be established if the resulting lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for θ is greater than -0.10.  Comparable efficacy will be evaluated using a group sequential testing design as described in Section 12.4 with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849520] a maximum overall 1-sided significance level of 0.025.  Following the completion of the trial, a confidence interval for the estimated difference in the probability of hemostasis at 6 minutes will be computed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel estimator and asymptotic variance estimate in combination with the repeated confidence interval method.19  Estimates of the distribution of TTH over a maximum follow-up of 10 minutes will be computed based on all available assessment times (3 minutes, 6 minutes, and 10 minutes) using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated only once, at the end of the study, using a family-wise 2-sided significance level of 0.05.  Adjustment for multiple comparisons when assessing 
  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-002   Version 4.0 
Confidential  Page 41 of 56  
secondary endpoints will be performed using a fixed sequence closed testing procedure to control the family-wise type I error rate at 0.05, as described in Section 12.2.4. The difference in mean preparation time will be tested using a linear regression model with stratified adjustment for surgery type. The difference in the probability of TTH within 3 minutes will be tested using a general linear model with stratified adjustment for surgery type as described above. Wald-based 95% confidence intervals for the difference in probability of TTH will be computed.   12.3.2 Analysis of Safety Outcomes  [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Population  Safety analyses will be conducted on the Full Analysis Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized into the study and received study intervention and all lead-in subjects.  [IP_ADDRESS] Methods of Analysis  Summaries of the number and percent of subjects with at least one SAE will be provided.  Comparisons of the proportion of subjects experiencing SAEs will be made between treatment arms.   Summaries of the number of percent of AEs will be provided for each treatment arm.  Differences in mean overall blood loss, mean volume of intra-operative transfusions, mean total operative time, and mean duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_849521]. In all cases, the robust variance estimator will be used and a 95% Wald-based interval will be computed. Comparisons of the incidence of re-operation (total and reoperation due to bleeding) and the incidence post-surgery bleeding complications will be made using a general linear model to estimate the difference in the probability of each outcome after stratified adjustment for surgery type.  Comparisons of the incidence of re-operation and the incidence post-surgery bleeding complications within each surgery type will be made using a two sample binomial test of proportions.  12.4 Interim Analyses    12.4.1 Interim Efficacy/Futility Analysis  A single interim analysis will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint (difference in the probability of TTH within 6 minutes) using data on the TTH Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, received study intervention, and had a TTH assessment recorded regardless of whether the measurement was censored.    The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_223233] (IDMC).  The IDMC will be provided with blinded efficacy data at the time of the interim analysis.  Detail of the activities associated with the IDMC will be provided in an IDMC Charter. In the following, we provide the description of the a priori defined interim analysis plan that will be used in the trial.   In making a decision to recommend early termination of the study, the IDMC shall be guided by a formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849522]. The test statistic shall be the estimated difference in the probability of TTH within [ADDRESS_1181232]™ and G+T arms as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. The clinical trial may only be stopped early either for reasons of futility (the observed difference in the probability of TTH within [ADDRESS_1181233]™ to G+T is not sufficiently high enough to warrant continuation of the trial) or efficacy (the observed difference in the 
  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-[ADDRESS_1181234]™ to G+T is sufficiently high enough to conclude non-inferiority).   The formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849523].20 In the notation of the latter paper, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849524] a one-sided group sequential design testing an upper alternative hypothesis at a level of significance α =0.025 with a lower (futility) stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849525] =0.8 and a  upper (efficacy) stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849526] =0.8 (a boundary with conservatism in between the Pocock type boundary and an O'Brien-Fleming type boundary).21, 22    The trial will utilize a 2:1 randomization scheme (HEMOBLAST™ : G+T). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_849559]. It is envisioned that one interim analysis will be performed during the monitoring of the study, occurring after outcomes have been observed for 240 randomized and treated subjects belonging to the TTH Population (approximately [ADDRESS_1181235]™ under 2:1 randomization), and may continue to a maximal sample size of 400 subjects (approximately [ADDRESS_1181236]™ under 2:1 randomization). Although the above interim analysis is pre-defined, final inference for comparable efficacy will treat the futility boundary as non-binding (implying that the type I error rate for the trial will be bounded at or below .025 even if the futility boundary is crossed at the interim analysis but the trial continues on).   Under such a monitoring schedule and assuming a probability of TTH within 6 minutes of 88% in both the HEMOBLAST™ arm and the G+T arm, a maximal sample size of 400 treated subjects ([ADDRESS_1181237]™ arm and 133 in the G+T arm) will provide approximately 80.1% power to determine comparable efficacy based upon a 10% non-inferiority margin of absolute difference in the probability of TTH within 6 minutes. Of particular note, if the study were to stop in favor of comparable efficacy at the interim analysis after 60% of the maximal sample size were accrued, data would be available on approximately [ADDRESS_1181238]™ plus up to an additional [ADDRESS_1181239]™ for each surgery type.  Enrollment will continue in parallel with the interim analysis.  Thus, if the interim analysis supports early termination of the clinical investigation, the number of subjects included may be higher than the number available at the time of the interim analysis.  All available data for the analysis populations defined above will be included in the final analysis and report.  Under the planned schedule of one interim analysis at 240 treated subjects and a assumed 6 min TTH success rate of 88% in the G+T arm, Table 9 presents the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849527] z-statistic for testing non-inferiority and the corresponding fixed sample p-value.   Table 9: Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_195446] a level 0.025 one-sided design with a single interim analysis (NON-BINDING FUTILITY (Pa =0.8) AND EFFICACY (Pd =0.8)  occurring at 240 patients, and a maximal sample size of 400 patients (2:1 randomization).

Alternatively, if the observed Z-statistic for testing non-inferiority is 2.[ADDRESS_1181241] that the study be terminated early with a decision in favor of comparable efficacy between the two products. A repeated 95% confidence interval for the stratum-weighted difference in proportions, corrected for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], will be computed at the completion of the trial. In the event that true probability of TTH within 6 minutes for G+T arm is observed to be different from 88% or the timing of the interim analysis differs, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849530] a one-sided type one error rate of 0.025 as described in Section 12.4.3.    12.4.2 Sample Size Justification  The sample size for the proposed study is based on a level 0.025 (one-sided) test to exclude a probability of TTH within 6 minutes that is 10% less among subjects treated with HEMOBLAST™ compared to those treated with G+T.  The maximum number of subjects enrolled will be computed as to provide approximately 80.1% power to declare comparable efficacy when the two treatments have the same probability of TTH within 6 minutes. The variance estimate in the sample size calculation assumes an 88% [ADDRESS_1181242]™ and G+T arms. The planned stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849531] a single interim analysis after outcome data have been observed on 240 treated subjects.  If the study were to continue to the final analysis with a decision in favor of comparable efficacy, it is anticipated that efficacy data would be available on 400 treated (approximately [ADDRESS_1181243]™ under a 2:1 randomization scheme).  Assuming equal accrual to each surgical indication this would provide efficacy data on roughly [ADDRESS_1181244]™ for each surgery type.  The variance of a proportion is dependent on the proportion itself.  Hence, power for the study will be partially determined by [CONTACT_849561] 6 minutes on each of the treatment arms.  Under the design assumption that the probability of TTH within 6 minutes on the G+T arm is 88%, the study will require a maximum of 400 treated subjects to attain approximately 80.1% power to declare comparable efficacy based upon a 10% non-inferiority margin.  As discussed in Section 12.4.3, in order to maintain approximately 80.1% power should a larger variance be observed, a flexible sample size based on statistical information from pooled trial data will be used.23   12.4.3 Implementation of the Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849532], a blinded sample size recalculation will be performed prior to the interim analysis. An independent statistical reporting group preparing reports for the IDMC will use the constrained boundaries method as implemented in S+SeqTrial® to recalculate the maximal sample size based on the marginal response rate observed in the study at the time of the pre-planned interim analysis (marginalized over treatment arms).23 The one-sided type I error rate for the study will be maintained at 0.025, and the maximal sample size will 
  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-002   Version 4.0 
Confidential  Page 44 of 56  
be adjusted up to maintain 80.1% power provided that the recalculated maximal sample size is 460 treated subjects or less within the TTH Population as defined in [IP_ADDRESS]. Further details of the implementation of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849533].  13 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  13.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits  It is anticipated that application of the investigational device to a bleeding site will result in a reduced time to hemostasis compared to conventional methods of hemostasis (pressure, suture, or cautery).  Individual subjects may not directly benefit from participation in this investigation.  However, conducting this research could contribute to the overall advancement of medical and scientific knowledge and may benefit future patients.  13.2 Risks Associated with Participation in the Clinical Investigation  There are possible risks, complications, and discomforts associated with undergoing a surgical procedure.  There are also additional risks specifically associated with the surgical arm (cardiothoracic, abdominal, orthopedic lower extremity). The Investigator will be responsible for discussing these risks, complications and discomforts with subjects along with the risks associated with anesthesia.    Adverse events observed during and after the application of a hemostatic agent other than HEMOBLAST™ in a large pi[INVESTIGATOR_849534] 309 patients at a greater than 1% frequency included:  • Anemia; • Arrhythmia; • Atelectasis; • Confusion; • Dural tear; • Edema; • Fever; • Fibrillation Atrial; • Fibrillation Ventricular; • Heart Failure Right; • Hemorrhage; • Hypotension; • Infection; • Pleural Effusion • Pneumonia; • Rash; • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]; • Thrombosis Arterial; and • Urinary Tract Infection.  None of the adverse events that occurred were judged by [CONTACT_849562] “Probably Related” to the use of the hemostatic agent.  
  Clinical Investigational Plan ETC 2015-[ADDRESS_1181245]™ in a large pi[INVESTIGATOR_849534] 309 patients at a less than 1% frequency included:  • Abscess; • Acute kidney failure; • Back pain; • Bradycardia; • Cellulitis; • Cerebrovascular accident; • Dehiscence; • Diarrhea; • Dyspnea; • Gastritis; • Hallucination; • Heart arrest; • Heel ulcer; • Hyperglycemia; • Kidney tubule necrosis; • Lung edema; • Myocardial Infarction; • Nausea; • Nausea and vomiting; • Neuropathy; • Pain; • Paraesthesia; • Pneumothorax; • Rash; • Skin ulcer; • Transfusion reaction; • Urinary Retention; and • Ventricular Tachycardia.  None of the adverse events that occurred were judged by [CONTACT_849562] “Probably Related” to the use of the hemostatic agent.  Risks possibly related to the use of hemostats similar to HEMOBLAST™ include:  • Adhesion formation • Allergy or anaphylaxis • Blockage of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_849563]; • Compromised attachment of orthopedic implants; • Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent; • Increased infection; • Lack of efficacy  • Nerve compression; • Thrombosis or thromboembolism • Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE); and • Viral disease transmission;

 Hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur with HEMOBLAST™.  Symptoms associated with allergic anaphylactic reactions include: flush, urticaria, pruritus, nausea, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, dyspnea, severe hypotension, and anaphylactic shock.  These reactions may occur in patients receiving HEMOBLAST™ for the first time or may increase with repetitive applications of HEMOBLAST™.  In the event of hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue administration of HEMOBLAST™.  Mild reactions can be managed with antihistamines. Severe hypotensive reactions require immediate intervention using current principles of shock therapy.   Subjects randomized to receive the control are exposed to risks associated with G+T, as described in the current device labeling.  Participation in this clinical investigation also presents additional risks or inconveniences.  These may include, but are not limited to:  • An additional blood draw preoperatively and an additional blood draw at 6-week follow-up for antibody evaluation; • Urine or serum pregnancy test (females of child bearing age) performed preoperatively; • Additional intraoperative assessments of bleeding severity at 3, 6, and 10 minutes after hemostat application; and • Follow-up visit at 6 ± 2 weeks postoperatively.  There may also be other unforeseen risks.  13.3 Risk/Benefit Analysis  Individual patients may experience no direct benefit from participation in the study.  However, potential benefits of HEMOBLAST to be investigated in the study include shorter preparation time, in addition to the other endpoints that will be tested for potential superiority as discussed above.  Risk mitigation steps have been taken through investigational device specifications and the performance of non-clinical testing and a clinical study.  Risk mitigation steps are also implemented in the manufacture and shipment of the investigational device.  The Sponsor, Medical Expert, and co-ordinating Investigator have determined that this clinical investigation is justified because the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Additionally, an IDMC is being put in place to perform continual reviews on the study, including making recommendations based on risk/benefit.  13.[ADDRESS_1181246] and results of this clinical investigation will be documented in the final report, as mentioned above.

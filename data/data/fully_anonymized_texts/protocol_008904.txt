Study Protocol  
Protocol Version 3 01/ 26/[ZIP_CODE] 02/16/[ADDRESS_484570] of t hree conditions exposing participants to unpredictable shock, 
predictable shock, or no shock. The eye blink startle response will be measured as a physiological index of the 
participants’ reactivity to the stressful task (i.e., predictable and unpredictabl e shocks). Previous research has consistently 
demonstrated that drugs that reduce the stress response, such as alcohol and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], reduce the startle response 
specifically to unpredictable stressors. Furthermore, drug deprivation among drug dependent individuals (e.g., nicotine, 
marijuana or alcohol) selectively increases the startle response during unpredictable stressors. This is an attractive lab task 
as very similar methods (e.g. unpredictable shock) and measures (e.g., startle) have been used extensively in rodents and 
non-human primates, so the field has a rich understanding of the neurobiology involved in this stress system. In particular, 
the neurotransmitter norepi[INVESTIGATOR_386648], and Prazosin,  a drug that blocks 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_345127]1 receptors, has been shown to reduce stress -induced relapse in rodent models of alcoholism. This 
study will examine whether Prazosin reduces the startle response during unpredictable stressors in abstinent alcoholic s in 
early recovery vs. healthy volunteers. These findings would suggest that norepi[INVESTIGATOR_345127]1 receptors are involved in 
stress-reactivity in humans and that Prazosin may be an effective treatment of stress -induced relapse for alcoholics 
pursuing abst inence.  
 Given the tremendous cost associated with conducting large scale clinical trials to vet treatments for addiction, the 
current proposal represents an efficient laboratory-based screening procedure to evaluate the potential efficacy of novel pharmac otherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This type of translational research aims to expand treatment options for the eighteen million people in 
the [LOCATION_002] who suffer from an alcohol use disorder.  
 
  
4 Background and Significance  
Background and Significance  
DRUG ADDICTION, NOREPI[INVESTIGATOR_149758], AND UNPREDICTABLE STRESSORS  
Stressors are potent instigators of relapse to drug use in clinical research with abstinent drug dependent humans 
and preclinical relapse models (i.e., stressor -induced reinstatement) in rodents. In rodents, brain norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE) 
levels are elevated in response to both discrete stressors1–6 and drug deprivation7,8. Similarly in humans, plasma and CSF 
NE-metabolite levels are elevated du ring alcohol withdrawal9–11 and in response to acute stressors12–14. Manipulations that 
increase central nervous system (CNS) NE levels (e.g., yohimbine, NET inhibitor, NE injections) increase drug-seeking 
behavior in rodents and non-human primates across a wide class of drugs including nicotine15, alcohol16, cocaine17–19, 
heroin20, and methamphetaime21. Although all central nor adrenergic receptor classes (post -synaptic α1 & ß; autoreceptor 
α2) have been implicated in the etiology of addiction, NE -α1 receptors may be particularly important in stress -induced 
relapse. Prazosin, a selective noradrenergic NE -α1 receptor antagonist, blocked escalation of drug-seeking behavior in 
rodent models of dependence for alcohol22, cocaine23, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]24, and nicotine25. Prazosin also reduces baseli ne alcohol 
consumption22, particularly in alcohol -preferring genetic strains of rats26–28. Prazosin, but not ß antagonists or α2 agonists, 
dose-dependently reduced dysfunctional brain reward thresholds observed during nicotine withdrawal25. Most critically, 
systemic administration of Prazosin blocks reinstatement of alcohol self -administration that is induced by [CONTACT_386666]29. Thus NE -α1 antagonists have broad treatment relevance for 
reducing stressor -induced relapse in drug addiction.  
 
Unfortunately, “stress” remains ill -defined and inconsistently operational ized in both basic research and clinical 
research on drug addiction in humans. Research on stress responding implicates central nervous system, endocrine, and peripheral biological systems that produce changes in affect, arousal, and attention
30–33. However, research is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_386649], and more specifically, acute negative 
affective response to a subset of stressors characterized by [CONTACT_386667], may provide a critical mechanism t o 
account for stressor -induced relapse among drug dependent rodents and humans34. These unpredictable stressors (i.e., 
ambiguous, low probability, temporally imprecise stressors) appear to produce phenomenologically distinct affective 
responding via partially separable neural mechanism relative to predictable stressors (i.e., well -defined, high probability, 
imminent stressors)35. 
 STARTLE POTENTIATION DURING STRESSOR EXPOSURE  
Programmatic affective neuroscience research has relied heavily on startle potentiation as a primary measure of 
defensive system activation to parse the neural mechanisms involved in response to unpredictable vs. predictable stressors. The use of startle potentiation to index affective response to stressors among rodents, non-human primates, and humans has provided an important animal -human translational bridge in this research
36–38. As such, we have detailed 
knowledge of the neurobiology of the startle response and its potentiation37–40. Startle potentiation also can be measured 
with both minimal disruption of task-related processes and reduced influence by [CONTACT_386668] (e.g., self -report).  
 
In preclinical models, startle reflex potentiation during unpredictable stressors has strongly implicated NE and 
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) sensitive pathways through the lateral divisions of the centr al amygdala (CeA) and 
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)
35,41,42. In contrast, distinct pathways through the medial division of the CeA 
appear r esponsible for startle potentiation during predictable stressors35,43,44. A large corpus of research implicates CRF as 
a critical mediator of the stress response35,45 and NE is a powerful modulator of extrahypothalamic CRF46. Prazosin 
reduces startle potentiation in rodents due to manipulations of  CRF46 and other stress -relevant neurotransmitter systems 
(e.g., DA47). In humans, the startle response is potentiated by [CONTACT_386669]48,49. However, the effect of Prazo sin on 
startle potentiation has never been examined in humans to date. Thus, startle potentiation during unpredictable stressors 
represents 1) a psychophysiological index of heightened response to stressors, 2) is sensitive to CNS NE system activation 
in rodents, 3) has well known neurobiological substrates in rodents, and 4) and can be assessed in rodents, non-human 
primates, and humans, positioning it as an attractive translational measure.  
 
THE NO SHOCK, PREDICTABLE SHOCK, UNPREDITABLE SHOCK (NPU) TASK  
Research in affective neuroscience has relied extensively on cued stressor (e.g., threat of electric shock) tasks to 
explicate psychological and neurobiological mechanisms involved in the negative affective response to stressors in 
5 animals and humans. Chri stian Grillon at NIH has developed a cued-stressor task called the “No Shock, Predictable 
Shock, Unpredictable Shock” (NPU) task to carefully contrast response to unpredictable vs. predictable stressors50,51. 
Predictable shock conditions involve administration of 100% cue -contingent, imminent electric shock. Unpredictable 
shock conditions involve temporally uncertain administration of shock. Startle potentiation during unpredictable shock 
(relative to no-shock blocks) provides the primary measure of negative affective response to stres sors that in rodents 
engages both NE system activity and elicits etiologically relevant behaviors for addiction (i.e., stressor -induced 
reinstatement). This task represents a direct translation of methods and measures used by [INVESTIGATOR_165675], Walker and colleagues t o 
parse neural mechanisms involved in response to unpredictable vs. predictable stressors35,43. We will use this task in the 
proposed research with humans.  
 
PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE  
Research from our lab provides compelling evidence that unpredictable stressors elicit startle potentiation t hat is 
attenuated by [CONTACT_386670]. Alcohol administration robustly 
suppresses startle potentiation during tasks involving unpredictable stressors, including the NPU task52,53. Similarly, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_386650]54. Furthermore, these anxiolytic effects are specific 
to unpredictable stressors as these drugs produce minimal effects on startle potentiation to predictable stressors. These studies provide evidence that startle potentiation in the NPU and similar tasks is a sensitive index of t he effects of 
pharmacologic agents on negative affective response to stressors.  
 In a parallel line of research we have demonstrated that these tasks have proved effective at differentiating drug 
deprived, dependent users from non-dependent healthy control s for a variety of drugs including tobacco
55, marijuana56, 
and alcohol57. Cigarette smokers displayed elevated startle response selectively during unpredictable stressors (vs. 
predictable str essors) after 24 -hours of nicotine deprivation compared to non-deprived smokers55. Dependent marijuana 
users show significantly increased startle potentiation during unpredictable stressors after three days of abstinence relative to non-deprived smokers and non-smoker controls
56. Furthermore, alcoholics in 1-8 weeks early abstinence show larger 
startle potentiation to unpredictable stressors (vs. predictable stressors) compare d to healthy controls in a variant of the 
NPU task57. This demonstrates that these tasks provide an objective non-invasive physiological biomarker of the effects of 
drug deprivation on affective responses to unpredictable stressors that represents an etiologically relevant cross -drug 
phenomenon.  
 
 We believe these data in humans, in combination with ample evidence from rodent models, supports our use of 
the NPU task to advance translational research aimed at identifying mechanisms for novel pharmacological treatment s of 
stress induced relapse mechanisms in addiction.  We also provide this preliminary evidence to confirm that our laboratory 
has the necessary expertise to work with clinical samples of drug dependent users, acutely administer drugs safely in the 
laborat ory, and measure psychophysiological response (including startle potentiation) during stressor tasks55–58. 
 REPU RPOSING PRAZOSIN 
Though Prazosin has been clinically available for forty years only recently has human research focused on 
addiction treatment. Fox and colleagues
59 demonstrated that among treatment -seeking alcohol dependent patients, 
Prazosin (16mg/day, 4wks) re duced self -reported alcohol craving and negative affect in response to guided imagery 
exposure to stress. This is the first evidence in humans implicating NE -α1 in stress -induced relapse mechanisms in 
addiction. However, this measure of stress imagery reactivity has less direct ties to preclinical models of stress reactivity than our model of startle potentiation in the NPU task. One additional study by [CONTACT_386671]
60 found that Prazosin 
(16mg/day, 6wks) reduced the number of drinks per day and number of days drinking in the final weeks of an RCT for alcohol dependence treatment . These first positive findings in humans instill excitement regarding Prazosin, particularly 
since they likely underestimate the true potential efficacy of NE -α1 antagonists because they do not focus specifically on 
stress-induced relapse outcomes. These studies demonstrated that in drug dependent samples Prazosin has a good safety profile and was generally well tolerated with minimal side effects, which is an important consideration given that aversive 
side effects are often a primary factor limiting the clinical effectiveness of psychiatric medications. Further considerations 
that increase the excitement for repurposing Prazosin for addiction treatment is that it is the most lipid soluble NE -α1 
antagonist increasing its ability to cross the blood-brain ba rrier, is highly selective for the NE -α1 receptor (K
i=0.12-0.31), 
has a better side effect profile than other NE receptor modulators (e.g., Clonidine), and it is available in generic formulation
61–64. Doxazosin another NE -α1 antagonists reduces alcohol drinking in alcohol -preferring rats65, and is being 
investigated for cocaine dependence in humans66,67, but Prazosin is the only drug shown to specifically reduce stress -
induced relapse in rats and has preliminary human evidence in alcoholism. The use of Prazosin is not contraindicated with 
[ADDRESS_484571] line treatments for alcohol dependence and has been found to increase the effectiveness of Naltraxone to reduce 
alcohol consumption in rodent models68. Finally, the re has been increased excitement in the field over the possibility that 
Prazosin may be an effective treatment for PTSD69–73. This may lead to fruitful lines of future research within the NIMH 
RDoC initiative that aims to focus on transdiagnostic dimensions, such as heightened stress -reactivity, which may 
represent a common feature in PTSD and addiction. In summary, in a ddition to the strong preclinical evidence implicating 
NE-α1 activation as a key mechanism involved in stress -induced relapse; there is mounting support from human studies to 
justify further examination of the potential for Prazosin to alleviate the exagge rated stress reactivity observed in alcohol 
and drug dependent individuals pursuing abstinence.  
 DIVERSITY AND HEALTH DISPARITIES  
 There are clear health disparities in alcoholism and substance use disorders that manifest as greater negative 
health consequences and cost for low SES and racial minority populations
74. The stress -induced relapse mechanisms that 
are the focus of the current grant may be particularly problematic for low SES populations where significant life stressors 
are more prevalent. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_386651] 
a relatively greater benefit to individuals who are at risk to experience more frequent and intense stressors.  
Innovation  
This research is innovative in its attempt to directly translate research findings from animal models to the 
examination of human addiction etiology and treatment (“bench to bedside”).  There is substantial evidence implicating stress-related neurocircuitry in the etiology of addiction and relapse in rodents but the evidence in humans is much more 
limited
7,34,45,75. This application uses a well -validated translational task with strong connections to the preclinical literature. 
The use of reliable biomarker of neuroadaptations resultant from chronic drug use that are a lso sensitive to the acute 
effects of both prescription and non-prescription anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_386652]) allows for generalizations across a wide class of drugs that alter the stress response
52,54,76. 
 This research is also innovative in its attempts to ‘repurpose’ Prazosin from its original FDA approved use for 
hypertension to a new purpose of relapse prevention in alcoholism. Thomas Insel, director of NIMH, clearly argues that given substantial cuts in R&D  budgets for new psychiatric drugs at most major pharmaceutical companies the near term 
outlook of novel molecular targets is grim
77,78. Therefore, it is critical to take advantage of existing compounds acting on 
neurotransmitter systems that have been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. The current proposal is one clear example of this theme to screen Prazosin for repurp osing for the treatment of stress -induced relapse in alcoholism by 
[CONTACT_386672] a surrogate endpoint.  
 This laboratory approach of identifying biomarkers of stress -reactivity that can be measured along a continuum 
from normal to abnormal addresses the current paradigm shift being advocated by [CONTACT_3718]’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). RDoC calls for a dime nsional approach to studying the roots of human behavior at multiple levels of analysis 
that cuts across DSM diagnostic categories 
77,79 –82. The current proposal aims to examine a number of the constructs (e.g., 
responses to acute threat (fear) or potential harm (anxiety)) defined within the Negative Valence System, using a paradigm recommended by [CONTACT_386673]
83. Indeed, although this paradigm is used to study abnormal processes 
in abstinent alcoholics, it represents a framework to evaluate abnormal stress -reactivity that spans not only multi ple drugs 
of addiction (e.g., tobacco, marijuana); but likely other disorders (e.g., PTSD) that may share a common neuroadaptation that manifests as a heightened stress response.  
    
[ADDRESS_484572] Objective:  To confirm NE -α1 involvement in startle potentiation during unpredictable stressors in humans with 
alcoholism and matched controls. This will support the use of this laboratory assay that implicates NE mechanisms as a 
surrogate endpoint in this ‘proof -of-concept’ trial aimed at identifying novel treatment targets.  
 
Second Objective:  Provide preliminary evidence that Prazosin is effective at reducing stressor -reactivity, particularly 
among alcoholics in early abstinence, thereby [CONTACT_386674] -induced 
relapse in addiction.  
 
To accomplish these objectives we propose three specific aims:  
 
Specific Aims  
AIM 1: Examine the effects of a NE-α1  antagonist (Prazosin) on responses to unpredictable stressors.  
1.1 Prazosi n (2mg vs. placebo) will reduce negative affective response to unpredictable stressors measured via startle 
potentiation, translating preclinical to clinical neuroscience.  
1.2 Prazosin (2mg vs. placebo) will reduce negative affective response to unpredictable stressors measured via self -
report, identifying uniquely human phenomenology.  
 AIM 2: Confirm evidence of exacerbated stress reactivity in abstinent alcoholics (vs. matched controls).  
2.1 Abstinent alcoholics (vs. matched controls) will display elevated negati ve affective response to unpredictable (vs. 
predictable) stressors measured via startle potentiation, conceptually replicating previous findings that provide a 
laboratory assay of stress -induced relapse mechanisms in addiction.  
2.2 Abstinent alcoholics (vs. matched controls) will display elevated negative affective response to unpredictable 
stressors measured via self -report.  
 
AIM 3: Examine the differential effects of Prazosin in abstinent alcoholics vs. matched controls.  
3.1 The predicted effects of Prazosin on reducing negative affective responses to unpredictable stressors as measured 
via startle potentiation (Aim 1.1) and self -report (Aim 1.2) will be moderated by [CONTACT_115135], such that the effects of 
Prazosin will be larger in abstinent alcoholics than matche d volunteers.  
  
  
8 Study Population 
Participant Populatio n and Recruitment  
 The site of the proposed research is the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Prospective participants will be 
recruited through the greater Madison community via paper fliers and online advertisements. Paper flyers will be posted 
in a variety of locations throughout the UW campus and community (e.g., laundromats, restaurants, gas stations, etc.).

Thirty -six alcohol dependent participants in early protracted abstinence (at least [ADDRESS_484574] alcohol use) will be recruited for the study. Thirty-six non-alcoholic participants will also be recruited to will 
serve as the comparison group.  Participants in the alcoholic and control groups will be matched on selected characteristics 
includin g age, sex, education level, daily nicotine use, and Axis I psychopathology. These characteristics will be matched 
at the group level such that the average and range of both groups will be comparable.

10 Research Design  and Methods Overview  
Overview  of Study Procedures  
Seventy-two participants (36 alcoholic & 36 controls) will be recruited to participate in a double -blind, placebo-
controlled, mixed-design, cross -over study examining the effects of a NE -α1 antagonist (prazosin) on the affective 
response to stressors. Both study visits will take place in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) in patient unit at the University 
of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A screening visit will take place in the Addiction Research  Center  at the University of Wisconsin 
– Madison. At the first study screen ing visit general laboratory procedures and risks and benefits will be explained to the 
participants and informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be confirmed 
using interviews conducted by a nurse, graduate  level clinician, self -report questionnaires and urine test  for pregnancy. 
Study Nursing staff will collect a medical history, current medication, orthostatic vital signs, and urine pregnancy test to 
confirm eligibility. For both participant groups, resear ch staff will first confirm that the potential participant is free from 
severe and persistent mental illness. Following this, the more in-depth Substance Use Disorders Module of the SCID -
Research Version (SCID -RV84) will be administered to confirm the alcoholic participants’ status with respect to an 
Alcohol Dependence diagnosis and no lifetime history of substance dependence for control participants. Participants will 
complete a shock sensitivity rating as per standard procedures from our laboratory.  
 Eligible participants will be scheduled for two study visits that will take place in the Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) inpatient unit at the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Modifiable inclusion/exclusion criteria will be re -confirmed 
at both study visits by [CONTACT_386675] a medical history and physical exam . Participants will be randomly 
assigned to drug order (prazosin 1st vs. 2nd visit) in a stratified blocked schedule by [CONTACT_386676] (alcoholic vs.  control) 
using urn randomization procedures85. The randomization and double -blind will be implemented and maintained by [CONTACT_386677], which is located in the same building in the UW hospi[INVESTIGATOR_386654]. All participants are told that they will receive both 2mg of prazosin and placebo , one agent at each study visit. 
Drug/placebo order is counterbalanced between participants. However, neither participants nor researchers will be aware 
of whether prazosin or placebo is administered at each visit.  
All subsequent procedures will be identical at the first and second study visits except for the assessment of study 
eligibility and the drug administered. Alcoholic participants will complete a brief alcohol craving questionnaire, a 6 item subset of the 14-item version of the Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire (DAQ
86) to det ermine baseline craving levels. 
Women of childbearing potential  participants will provide a urine sample to verify they are not pregnant. All participants 
will then provide a breath sample to verify an initial blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.00 (Alc osensor IV; 
Intoximeters, Inc.) . All participants will be asked to refrain from consuming alcoholic beverages or any other 
psychoactive drugs for [ADDRESS_484575] procedures from our laboratory. Based on the known pharmacodynamics of prazosin87, participants will begin 
the NPU task (see below) exactly 90 minutes after drug administration. During the stress -reactivity task participants will 
view geometric shapes and words presented on a computer monitor. Participants  will be asked to answer short questions 
during this procedure, which will be audio recorded for later scoring for accuracy. At various times during this procedure, 
brief electric shocks will be administered to the fingers of the participants’ hand. The intensity of all shocks will be within 
the range that they indicated they could tolerate during the shock sensitivity procedure. In addition, acoustic white noise 
probes will be presented through earphones at random points during the procedure. These probes are used to elicit a startle 
blink reflex, which is used to index emotional response. After completion of the task, participants will complete 
questionnaires related to their emotional state during the task and a battery of self -report questionnaires to as sess alcohol 
use history, trait affect and broadband personality traits.  
11 After the NPU task participants will remain in the CRU inpatient unit overnight  to monitor and assess for side 
effects under medical supervision by [CONTACT_263533]. Participants second appointment will be scheduled 7 days (+/ - 2 days) 
after the first study visit.  Participants with unusable data at the first study visit (e.g., excessive physiological artifact, 
insufficient understanding of NPU task, startle non-responder)  will not return for  the second study visit . This study visit 
will be identical to the first study visit except for the drug administered (Prazosin vs. Placebo) and eligibility screening 
procedures. At the end of the first visit participants will be paid $150. At the  second visit participants will be paid $150 
for the study visit and a $75 bonus for study completion, debriefed, and released. Participants who do not complete the 
study (e.g., not eligible, refuse consent, withdraw, etc.) will be paid $25/hour for their time up to $150/visit. Alcoholic 
participants will be required to demonstrate that they are not experiencing significantly elevated levels of alcohol craving 
(Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire) before they are released, per standard lab procedures.

13 Statistical Analysis  and Timeline  
Statistical A nalysis  
Analyses for quantitative dependent measures will be accomplished within General Linear Models using R88. In 
the sections below, we briefly describe the primary factors in statistical models to evaluate each Specific Aim. All models 
will include number of days abstinent at Visit 1 as an interactive between-subjects regressor to evaluate if drug effects and 
outcomes are comparable across alcoholics who vary in their previous duration of abstinence ( 1-8 weeks) on study 
initiation, although this has not moderated the effects on NPU task in our preliminary studies. Numerous individual difference measures (e.g., s ex, mood/anxiety disorder comorbidity, tobacco use, trait affect, alcohol dependence severity) 
are available to add to these models as interactive between -subject regressors in secondary analyses to evaluate possible 
individual difference moderators of drug effects.  
Unpredictable startle potentiation and self -reported negative affect from the NPU task across Visits 1 -2 will be 
analyzed in separate general linear models with repeated measures on Drug (2 mg prazosin vs placebo) and Condition (unpredictable vs . predictable shock). Participant Group (alcoholic vs. control) and Drug Order (prazosin: visit 1 vs visit 
2) will also be included as an interactive between subjects regressors to increase power. Specific Aim [ADDRESS_484577] sizes 
observed in previous research from our laboratory that has used variants of the NPU task to examine acute drug effects (i.e., moderate dose of alcohol), drug deprivation effects (24 hours of nicotine deprivation among daily s mokers), or 
differences between alcoholics in early abstinence (1 -8 weeks) vs. matched controls. In the current study, N = 72 will 
provide 85% power to detect the effect of prazosin on startle potentiation during unpredictable (vs. predictable) stress in alcohol dependent participants (vs. controls) assuming a conservative small effect size (∆R2= .10) in a model containing 
the predictors noted above (R2 = .30).  
T imeline Justification  
This project aims to be completed within three years. This goal is reasonable given our team’s expertise in 
conducting psychophysiological laboratory research working with drug administration (i.e., alcohol and nicotine), community participants, and stress reactivity. Our lab has the experience and infrastructure to recruit and retain a sample 
of this size. We recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_386655] 115 participants (58 alcoholic 
and 57 matched controls) over the course of 14 months. This study involved diagnostic interviews and stress -reactivity 
task over the course of two study visits. The current study will plan to initially consent eighty-five participants with a final 
sample size goal of seventy-two participants. Based on prior experience we anticipate that 85% of eligible participants 
will return to complete all study visits. A total of 157 complete visits ([ADDRESS_484578], 72 second) will be conducted. If we 
conservatively expect to average 2 study visits per week to account for no-shows, failed eligibility criteria, and equipment failure we anticipate completing data collection within 1.5-2 years.

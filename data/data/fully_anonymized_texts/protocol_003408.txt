Phase  Phase I/IIa 
Methodology  Open -label approach  
Study Duration  Approximately 4 -5 years  
Study Center(s)  CHOP   
Objectives  The primary objective is to determine the safety and survival of the 
redirected auto logous T cells transduced with the anti -CD19 lentiviral 
vector (referred to as “CART -19” cells)  given in the context of an adu lt 
and a pediatric protocol tar geting CD19+ malignancies . 
Number of Subjects  72 infused, up to 86 enrolled  
Diagnosis and Main  
Inclusion Criteria  Inclusion criteria are designed to include pediatric patients aged 1-24 
years  with CD19+ B cell malignancies with no available curative 
treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation) who have limited prog nosis (several months to <2 year 
survival) with currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Study Product, Dose, 
Route, Regimen  CART -19 cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express either anti -
CD19 scFv:TCR or anti -CD19 scFv TCR :41BB, administered by i.v. 
injection  using a n intra-patient dose escalation  approach: 10% on day 0, 
30% on day 1, possibly followed  by 60% on day 14 (or later) with a 
total dose goal of ~1.5 x107 – 5 x109 (~0.3x106 - 1.0x108/kg) T cells . 
Duration of 
administration  Approximately 10-15 minutes; drug is expected to persist at detectable

Reference therapy  None. This protocol will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs 
for which there are no current curative therapeutic options.  
Statistic al 
Methodology  The statistical analysis will be primarily descriptive in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_729254].  Descriptive statistics will be applied to 
determine the relative engraftment  and persistence. All adverse events 
will be described a nd exact 95% confidence intervals will be produced 
for adverse event rates, both overall and within major categories.  The 
change in the ratio of CART -[ADDRESS_995887] is 
very efficient (>95%) compared to the t -test if the underlying data are 
normally distributed.  Analysis of other secondary endpoints such as 
anti-tumor activity will also be primarily descriptive and may include 
summary statistics such as means a nd standard deviations or Kaplan -
Meier curves for survival information.

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.[ADDRESS_995888] majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), as well as acute 
lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL). An estimated 87,000 
new cases of leukemia and non- Hodgkin’s lymphomas are diagnosed in the US annually1, and 
most of these are of B cell origin. Current treatments for B cell malignancies include 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplantation, and peripheral blood stem cell 
transplantation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_708781], most patients will remain incurable. 
B lineage acute leukemia (B-ALL) is responsive to chemotherapy, however the ability to 
uniformly eradicate the disease has not been achieved, as about 65% of adults and 20% of 
children have disease recurrence 2, 3. Improved response rates have thus far only been achieved 
with intensified cytotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in substantial morbidity. Adoptive 
immunotherapy with allogeneic donor leukocytes has potent anti-leukemic effects, however th e 
benefit is confined largely to patients with myeloid leukemias, as B-ALL has a durable remission 
rate of less than 10% 4, and often at the cost of substantial morbidity due to GVHD5, 6. 
 
Adoptive immunotherapy.  Adoptive transfer is a term coined by [CONTACT_729292]7 to study 
allograft rejection, and the term adoptive immunotherapy denotes the transfer of 
immunocompetent cells for the treatment of cancer or infectious disease8. Adoptive 
immunotherapy appears to be the most robust form of immunotherapy for treatment of 
established tumors9. However, several problems remain to be solved before this therapy becomes 
routine; see our reviews for deta ils10, 11. 
 
CD19 as a therapeutic target for leukemia and lymphoma. CD19 is a 95kDa glycoprotein 
present on B cells from early development until differentiation into plasma cells12-14. It is a 
member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and a component of a cell surface signal 
transduction complex that regulates signal transduction through the B cell receptor14-16. Mice 
lacking CD19 have a decreased number of B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, a decreased B 
cell response to oral vaccines and mitogens, and decreased serum Ig levels14, 17. Expression of 
CD19 is restricted to B lineage cells and is not expressed by [CONTACT_379210]18. CD19 
is also expressed by [CONTACT_304900] B cell lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma, ALLs, CLLs, hairy cell 
leukemias, and a subset of acute myelogenous leukemias12, 19, 20. CD19 thus represents a highly 
attractive target for immunotherapy18. Furthermore, CD19 is not present on most normal tissues, 
other than normal B cells, including pluripotent blood stem cells18, which makes CD19 a 
relatively safe target presenting a minimal risk of autoimmune disease or irreversible 
myelotoxicity. Anti-CD19 antibodies and scFvs either native or conjugated to radioisotopes or 
toxins are currently being developed and have demonstrated promise in both mouse models21-25 
and human and non- human primates26-36.

[CONTACT_729293] T cells with redirected specificity: chimeric immune receptors (CIR). The 
daunting task of breaking tolerance to self antigens is the major obstacle facing the field of 
cancer immunotherapy. This can be difficult or impossible if the TCR repertoire has been deleted 
or rendered non functional by [CONTACT_729294]37, 38. One strategy is to 
identify therapeutically effective T cell clones, clone the heterodimeric TCR, and express it in 
other T cells, creating bispecific T cells with reactivity against the original TCR and the cloned 
TCR (reviewed in39-41). This was first carried out using protoplast fusion to transfer the TCR 
genes from a mouse T cell into another mouse T cell clone with a different specificity42. Other 
labs used cell fusion or electroporation to transfer TCR genes43, 44, and in these cases 
demonstrated that MHC restricted specificity could be transferred. The advent of retroviral 
vectors made it possible to make this process more efficient. The Pease laboratory first used a 
retroviral vector with the LTR directing expression of TCR  and an internal CMV promoter 
driving TCR  expression in mouse T cells45, 46. In [ADDRESS_995889] tumor challenge, and could treat established metastasis48. The T cells were shown to 
expand dramatically (by [CONTACT_726] 3 logs) after in vivo antigen encounter, and they trafficked to 
tumor sites. 
An alternativ e strategy to produce genetically engineered T cells is the ‘T -body’ or 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approach, which uses genetically programmed, patient-derived 
lymphocytes transfected with chimeric receptor genes to combine the effector functions of T 
lymphocytes with the ability of antibodies to recognize predefined surface antigens with high 
specificity in a non-MHC restricted manner49, 50. These receptors have the ability to recognize 
intact membrane proteins independent of antigen processing. CARs or T-bodies typi[INVESTIGATOR_729255] T cell activation (reviewed in41, 51). In principle, universal targeting vectors can be 
constructed because the scFv bind to native cell surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_729256]. The tumor binding function of CAR is usually accomplished by [CONTACT_729295] a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, containing the V H and V L chains joined by a 
peptide linker of about [ADDRESS_995890] two decades has documented 
that maximal activation, proliferation and persistence of T cells responding to antigenic stimuli is 
dependent on receipt of two discrete signals mediated by [CONTACT_614179]. The primary 
“activation” signal is generated by [CONTACT_729296] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_729257] I molecules) and the second signal by [CONTACT_614181] a 
costimulatory molecule with its cognate ligand. T cell costimulatory molecules which have been 
identified to date include members of the immunoglobulin super-family (CD28), members of the 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) super-family (e.g. CD40L, CD134 [OX-40], CD137 [4-1BB]53. 
One issue that needs to be addressed with CARs is that signaling through the cytosolic 
domain of the usual scFv-TCR  single chain construct does not fully replicate the multichain 
TCR signaling complex54, 55. Chimeric receptors bearing TCR  signaling modules are sufficient 
to trigger sustained proliferation in T cell hybridomas and clones but are not sufficient to drive

re
ceptor induced by [CONTACT_614182], and evokes various T cell responses56. We and others have 
observed that 4-1BB signals are critical for long term proliferation of CD8 cells, and that CD28 
is essential for sustained CD4 cell proliferation 57, 58. We have begun to investigate the 
requirement for costimulation in our CD19-CAR by [CONTACT_729298]. Our preclinical data are in accordance with 
the results from other laboratories 59, 60, and indicate that “bipartite receptors” comprised of 
TCR and either CD28 or 41BB signaling modules substantially improve the function and 
proliferation of T cells.  The coalescence of improved T cell culture methods and lentiviral 
vector technology have made it possible to test this novel concept, which is now ready for 
clinical evaluation, and thereby [CONTACT_729299]. 
 
Rationale for lymphodepletion. Adoptive immunotherapy strategies may be able to 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_560482] T cell proliferation 61, a recent finding that naive T cells begin to 
proliferate and differentiate into memory-like T cells when total numbers of naive T cells are 
reduced below a certain threshold 62, 63. Host lymphodepletion may enhance the effectiveness of 
adoptively transferred T cells61.  Homeostatic T cell proliferation can result in the induction of 
autoimmunity 64, providing a clue to improved antitumor strategies.  T cells can undergo up to 
seven rounds of cell division after being deprived of contact [CONTACT_729300] 65, 66. This homeostatic 
response of T cells is directed largely to self antigens 67. 
Lymphodepletion eliminates regulatory T-cells and other competing elements of the 
immune syst em that act as “cytokine sinks”, enhancing the availability of cytokines such as IL -7 
and IL-15 68. This hypothesis has been tested clinically in patients with metastatic melanoma 
refractory of conventional treatments 69. The patients received a lymphodepleting conditioning 
regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2 days) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2 x 5 
days) prior to adoptive transfer of T cells. We have treated patients with myeloma and 
lymphopenia after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and observed improved engraftment70, 71. In 
this protocol we propose to transfer RAT-[ADDRESS_995891] conditioning is more than simply “making room” because the 
quantitative recovery of adoptively transferred T cells in mice reveals that in vivo proliferation 
following adoptive transfer is identical in mice with or without previous irradiation 72.   
 
Competitive repopulation trials . As a secondary endpoint, we propose a competitive 
repopulation strategy for this trial. Competitive repopulation strategies have been used 
pre
viously to test the relative performance of vector constructs.  In a [ADDRESS_995892] confirmed and extended these findings in 10 subjects with a more 
sophisticated series of anti-HIV vectors74.

al Agent 
The investigational agent in this protocol is CART-19 cells . Autologous T cells will be 
engineered to express an extracellular single chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19. 
This will be expected to redirect specificity of the transduced T cells for cells that express CD19, 
a molecule that is restricted in expression on the surface of the malignant cells and on normal B 
cells. In addition to CD19 scFv, the cells will be transduced to express an intracellular signaling 
molecule comprised of either the TCR  chain or a tandem signaling domain comprised of 4-1BB 
and TCR signaling modules. The scFv is derived from a mouse monoclonal antibody, and thus 
contains mouse sequences, and the signaling domains are entirely of the native human 
sequences. The CART-19 scFv plasmid was previously reported30 and was generously provided 
. CART-19 T cells are manufactured by [CONTACT_729301] T cells by 
[CONTACT_16166], and using lentiviral vector technology75-77 to introduce the scFv:TCR   into 
CD4 and CD8 T cells. In some patients, a control scFv:TCR  will be introduced into a portion 
of the cells for the competitive repopulation experiment described below.  These receptors are 
“universal” in that they bind antigen in an MHC -independent fashion, thus, one receptor 
construct can be used to treat a population of patients with CD19 antigen-positive tumors. 
The CAR constructs were developed at the , and the clinical 
grade vector will be manufactured by  [CONTACT_729302]’s 
specifications, as outlined in the FDA-approved . The CART-[ADDRESS_995893] of the infusion of 1.5x107- 5x109 (0.3x106-1.0x108/kg) total cells.  Each infusion will 
contain an aliquot (volume dependent upon dose) of cryomedia containing the following 
infusible grade reagents: plasmalyte-A, dextrose (5%), NaCl, up to 7.5% DMSO, dextran 40, 
human serum albumin with up to 5x109 autologous T cells per bag. The initial dose will be 
decreased 10-fold, with intra-patient dose escalation (see Section 5.3 for details).

[CONTACT_729304]  (modified from Manilla et al125). The 
lentiviral vector is derived from the NL4-3 clone of wildtype HIV. It is maximally gutted so that 
its backbone is constructed only from conserved regions of HIV (5’ and 3’ long terminal repeats, 
central polypurine tract/central termination sequence, and Rev-responsive element). The final 
transgene constructs were cloned into a SIN vector under the control of the mammalian 
e
longation factor 1  promoter. The vector is pseudotyped with a VSV-G envelope coat. The 
VSV-G DNA and the vector DNA are encoded on separate plasmids and are then transfected 
int
o cells for production of viral vector. The VSV-G envelope facilitates vector attachment to 
cell membranes for efficient vector entry into the cells, and helps to retain the infectivity of the 
vira
l vector during the stringent purification required for a clinical-grade vector.  
Mechanism of action of transduced T cells. Redirected T cells have been shown in 
experimental models to bind to cells that express the target antigen. Over the past decade, CARs 
directed against a wide variety of tumor antigens have been developed41, 78. In the case of CART-
19 cells, retrovirally transduced primary human T cells containing a TCR  cytosolic signaling 
domain were shown to engraft and to eradicate Raji Burkitt lymphoma tumor cells in 
immunodeficient mice34. Human T cells that express the CD19 scFv:TCR  or CD19 
scFv: TCR4-1BB can kill B-ALL and lymphoma cells in vitro35, 79- 81. There are several 
potential limitations to the CAR T cells: 1) the tumor must express the target antigen on the cell 
surface; 2) large amounts of shed or soluble antigen can inhibit the CAR T cells; 3) the chimeric 
receptor may be immunogenic, resulting in the elimination of the redirected T cells by [CONTACT_729305].  
Absorption, distribution and metabolism of T cells. Lymphocytes have complex trafficking 
and survival kinetics, and after adoptive transfer several fates have been demonstrated: 1) 
margination; 2) exit from the peripheral blood trafficking to lymphoid tissues; and 3) death by 
[CONTACT_20983]. Following an intravenous dose, retrovirally modified and adoptively transferred T 
cells have been shown to persist in the circulation for at least [ADDRESS_995894] an elimination 
half life from the peripheral blood of about 8 days, and this increases to about 16 days when low 
doses of IL-2 are given83. In patients with HIV infection, we found that the mean half life of 
lentivirally modified CD4 T cells in the circulation of 5 patients following a single infusion was 
23.5 (± 7.7) days in patients. Adoptively transferred human T cells have been shown to traffic to 
tumor and secondary lymphoid tissues69, 83- 85.   
Drug interactions. CART-19 cells are expected to retain many of the properties of natural 
T cells. As such, they will be expected to be susceptible to immunosuppressive agents such as 
corticosteroids, immunophilins such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, methotrexate, 
mycophenolate mofetil, mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ontak. 
Lymphocytes are especially susceptible to cytotoxic and chemotherapeutic agents that are 
commonly administered for hematologic malignancies such as cyclophosphamide and 
fludarabine. 
Immune elimination. An important consideration is that the CAR can be immunogenic, 
either because foreign sequences such as antibiotic selection genes or mouse antibody sequences 
are expressed, or because of novel epi[INVESTIGATOR_729258]19 Lentiviral T body Protocol page 14

FIDENTIAL 
This material is the property of Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729251].  Do not disclose or use except as au thorized in writing by 
[CONTACT_729306]. Immunogenicity of the CAR can lead to the rejection 
of the adoptively transferred T cells. The basis for this supposition is that human retrovirally-

[CONTACT_729310]. Human data relevant to CART-19 cells is summarized 
below:  
 CD4:TCR  experience in HIV infection. CD4  is a genetically engineered, MHC –
unrestricted receptor composed of the  subunit of the CD3 T cell receptor, the cytoplasmic 
domain involved in signal transduction, fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of 
human CD4, which targets HIV env expressed on the surface of infected cells 107. Upon binding 
to HIV envelope, CD8+ T cells engineered to express the CD4  fusion protein proliferate and 
initiate effector functions such as cytokine secretion and HIV-specific cytolytic activity 108, 109. In 
collaboration with K. Hege at Cell Genesys Inc. and others, we assessed the survival of co-
stimulated gene–marked T cells in 3 published studies 84, 85, 98.  CD4 modified T cells were 
detected by [CONTACT_729311], and sustained 
mean levels of 1 to 3% of T cells were detected at all time points after infusion.  In extended 
follow-up, CD4  was detected in the blood of 17 of 18 patients 1 year following infusion. In the 
only published phase II HIV gene therapy trial, 40 patients were randomized to receive an 
infusion of CD4 –modified T cells or non-transduced costimulated T cells; the treatment was 
found to be safe and associated with treatment-related increases in CD4 T cell counts98.  
Together these clinical results indicate that CD4  CAR anti-HIV vector is safe and has stable 
engraftment and persistence in lymphopenic patients with HIV infection.   
 G250:TCR  experience in renal cell carcinoma. Lamers and colleagues recently reported 
the interim results of a trial testing T bodies in 3 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma87, 
110. The T bodies were targeted with an scFv specific for carboxy-anhydrase-IX (the G250 
antigen) that is overexpressed on clear cell RCC and in the biliary tract. The T body was 
expressed in autologous T cells using retroviral transduction. The subjects were treated with a 
dose-escalation scheme of intravenous doses of 2 x 107 T cells at day 1; 2 x 108 T cells at day 2; 
2 x 109 T cells at days 3 through 5 (treatment cycle 1); and 2 x 109 cells at days 17 to 19, in 
combination with human recombinant IL-2, given subcutaneously at 5 x105 U/m2 twice daily 
administered at days 1 to 10 and days 17 to 26.  Infusions of these G250 T bodies were initially 
well-tolerated. However, after four to five infusions, liver enzyme disturbances reaching NCI 
CTC grades 2 to 4 developed. These toxicities necessitated the cessation of treatment in subjects 
1 and 3, corticosteroid treatment in patient 1, and reduction of the maximal T-cell dose in 
subjects 2 and 3. All three patients developed low levels of anti-scFv (G250) antibodies between 
[ADDRESS_995899] the target antigen expressed on normal tissue, that is, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_729260]. Thus, this is interpreted as a form of “on target, off organ” toxicity.  
 Anti-CD20 expressing CD8 cells for follicular lymphoma.  Jensen, Press and colleagues 
reported a clinical trial evaluating escalating doses of CD8 T cells modified by [CONTACT_729312] a chimeric immune receptor targeting the CD20 B cell marker and linked to the CD3zeta 
activation domain for the treatment of refractory follicular lymphoma and mantle cell 
lymphomas 106 106. A total of 7 subjects were enrolled in the trial, and  each received 3 infusions 
of escalating doses of CD20 specific CARTs of 108 cell/m2, 109 cell/m2, and 3.3 x 109 cell/m2 
spaced [ADDRESS_995900] 4 patients who received subcutaneous low dose (500,000 IU/m2)

 Lentiviral vector clinical experience.  Considerable data shows that retroviral vectors are 
safe when expressed in human T cells; however, retroviral vectors appear less safe when used in 
human stem cells111, 112. Lentiviral vectors have the potential to be safer from the perspective of 
insertional mutagenesis, and they have substantially higher efficiency for genetically engineering 
human T cells76, 113, 114. Therefore, we propose to use lentiviral vector technology to introduce the 
CART-19 T body constructs into the T cells.

protocols should be carefully chosen, so as to be expressed only by [CONTACT_729317]. CD19 expression has been reported to be restricted to the B cell lineage, and thus 
the expectation is that toxicity from CART-[ADDRESS_995904] not caused aplasia. 
Furthermore, the widespread clinical use of anti-CD20 (Rituximab), targeting CD20, an antigen 
with a distribution of expression similar to CD19, has shown an acceptable clinical toxicity

immune receptors targeting CD20 and CD19 have also shown that redirected T cell 
immunotherapy appears safe for these targets.

some degree of residual donor engraftment, which will include T cells of donor origin. Most 
children who relapse after allo SCT will not have reverted to full recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22566], and would 
be enrolled in the allo cohort. The collection of cells from the patients (as opposed to the donors) 
has 3 potential advantages: 1) many pediatric SCTs use umbilical cord cells as a donor source, in 
which case the donor would not be available; 2) in matched sibling donor SCT, the donor may be 
a minor and pheresing that donor would introduce further complications and potential risks; 3) 
most importantly, the allo cells collected from a subject without GVHD are tolerized and less 
likely to cause GVHD after infusion.  There is limited experience with using activated allogeneic

This material is the property of Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729251].  Do not disclose or use except as au thorized in writing by 
[CONTACT_729320]. A prior UPENN/CHOP study of “activated DLI” (ex vivo activated cells 
collected from the donor and grown in the same fashion as CART19 but without the CAR 
introduction) did not show high rates of GVHD (2/18 pts with grade 3 GVHD and none with 
grade 4; Porter et al. Blood 2006). A patient recently treated at the NIH with CAR-modified 
“allo” T cells collected from the patient did not experience GVHD (A. Wayne, personal 
communication). While the risk of GVHD still exists, we feel it is low in this setting and the risk-
be
nefit favors treating this incurable group of ALL patients with CART19 cells. At the same 
time, it must be acknowledged that treatments for GVHD would necessarily limit or destroy 
CART19 cells, so GVHD remains an important risk for these patients. The allo cohort will allow 
us to test CART19 therapy in this group of patients with significant unmet medical need and 
assess the GVHD risk. In [ADDRESS_995907] experienced confusion and/or aphasia

Although the etiology of this is unclear, it may well be related to the CART19 cells or 
CRS/MAS/HLH in some way. None of these patients have required any treatment, and all of 
them r
ecovered fully in a few days.     
1.[ADDRESS_995910] initial feasibility data from adult trials is appropriate. This is the approach 
that is generally pursued in early phase cancer trials for three reasons: i) to get clinical 
experience in pediatric populations, ii) to learn about issues with dosing or administration that 
might be specific to younger patients, and iii) allow pediatric access to novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_729261]. The population of pediatric relapsed/refractory leukemia and 
l
ymphoma patients targeted for enrollment in this study have no curative options for treatment. 
There is very little available on the horizon, especially for ALL patients, in terms of novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_729262]. New and highly innovative approaches are desperately needed 
for this group of pediatric patients. Our initial adult experience suggests a possible signal for 
efficacy. With this, we believe there exists both compelling reasons to include children and 
the prospect of benefit in patients with no curative options.

[CONTACT_4530] 1.7 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
The primary objective of this protocol is to test the safety and feasibility of administering 
CART-[ADDRESS_995911] T cell engraftment and persistence. In this “competitive repopulation” scenario, 
we must administer a dose of cells that is 1) safe and 2) feasible to produce and can be tracked in 
the subject after infusion in order to determine if one T body construct is superior to the other. 
The basis for setting the starting dose was based on 1) Guidance for Industry: S6 Preclinical 
Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived Pharmaceuticals; 2) Joint taskforce report from the 
BioIndustry Association (BIA) and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry 
(ABPI) and 3) the available literature on phase I trials to date conducted with CIR T cells.  The 
FDA guidance on safe starting dose (FDA Guidance for Industry: Estimating the Maximum Safe 
Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers) does not 
apply well for cell and gene therapy, and as such was not used to guide the selection of the 
starting dose for this study.   
We believe that an initial i.v. dose of 1.5x107- 5x109 (0.3x106-1.0x108/kg) CART-19 cells 
is optimal for this protocol. Because there are about 1 x 1012 T cells in a healthy adult (equivalent 
to 2x1010 T cells/kg), the proposed total (100%) dose is equivalent to about 0.5% of the total 
body mass of T cells122, 123. Therefore, we expect the initial frequency of cells to be present at 
about 0.5% at baseline following infusion.  In addition, in our animal models, we find that a dose 
of [ADDRESS_995912] antitumor response.  The dose given to animals, 
whe
n scaled, is similar to 5x109 cells in humans. As an additional safety feature 124, the cells will 
be administered using an intrapatient dose escalation approach (see section 6.6). The proposed 
dose
 in children is also consistent with or less than our prior T cell infusion trial in young 
children (CHP-667).    
Safety. As described above in section 1.2, we propose to insert the scFv CIR constructs 
into T cells using lentiviral vector technology. At the University of Pennsylvania we have treated 
 patients using a related approach for patients with HIV infection with autologous T cells that 
contained a lentiviral vector. In the first protocol, each subject received a single i.v. infusion of 
1x1010 lentiviral modified T cells; in the second protocol, each subject received up to [ADDRESS_995913] the mouse scFv sequences. In summary, this dose was 
chosen because it is anticipated to be safe based on previous studies, and because it will permit 
sufficient engraftment in o rder to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints of this study. 
Risk of tumor lysis related to cytoreductive chemotherapy .  The risk of tumor lysis 
s
yndrome (TLS) is dependent on the disease and burden of disease, but in most cases, this risk 
will
 be very low.  Patients at highest risk for TLS have aggressive lymphomas (Burkitt’s or other 
‘high grade” NHL) and ALL.  The risk of TLS in CLL, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell 
lymphoma and diffuse large cell lymphoma is thought to be low, but may be higher with highly 
effective therapy (Porter et al., NEJM 2011).  Patients will be closely monitored both before and 
a
fter chemotherapy and infusions including blood tests for potassium and uric acid.  Patient-

Feasibility. The manufacturing feasibility is not expected to be an issue in this protocol, 
as given the combination of ex vivo cell culture and lentiviral vector technologies shown in 
figure 3, we expect to readily exceed the target dose of CART-[ADDRESS_995914] chosen.  
Risk/benefits. Participation in this study will expose the patient to genetically engineered 
autologous T cells. The risk of the cells alone is low based on clinical experience. The unknown 
risk is that of the signaling domains in the CAR. T cell proliferation could be uncontrolled, 
however we have not observed this in our pre-clinical models. In this case, corticosterioids and 
chemotherapy would be given in an attempt to eradicate the CIR cells; this has worked in 
previous cases87. It is possible the cells may be immunogenic, and that the patients will have an 
immune response directed against the scFv; this has not had clinical consequences in previous 
trials. If an immune response to the cells occurs, it is possible that the cells will be rejected. 
Three of [ADDRESS_995915]; in a preliminary study, two patients 
treated with T bodies encoding an scFv specific for CD20 had a response that has lasted for a 
year 106.  
 
Transient host B cell depletion is also a likely risk with CART-19 cells, since normal B cells 
e
xpress CD19.  This is expected to resolve when the CART-19 cells are cleared.  
 
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
Primary objectives:   
1. Determine the safety and feasibility of administration of chimeric antigen receptor T cells 
transduced with the anti- CD19 lentiviral vector (referred to as “CART -19” cells), in 
pa
tients who either: 
a. have not received a prior allogeneic SCT or have 0% residual donor engraftment 
(“no allo ” cohort), or 
b. ha ve relapsed after prior allogeneic SCT with any degree of residual donor 
engraftment ( “a llo ” cohort). 
I
n each case, the cells used will be collected from the subject, not from an allogeneic donor. 
2. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-[ADDRESS_995916] and quantify survival of CART-19 TCR :4-1BB and TCR  
cells over time. 
 
Secondary objectives: 
1. F or patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-19 cell 
infusions.   
2. To determine if the 4-1BB transgene is superior to the TCR  only transgene as measured 
by [CONTACT_729322]-19 TCR :4-1BB and TCR  cells over time. 
3. F or patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active CLL, ALL, 
etc) determine tumor cell killing by [CONTACT_288479]-19 cells in vitro.

and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-19 (loss of engraftment).   
5. De termine the relative subsets of CART-19 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg) 
6. De termine safety and efficacy in a test cohort of patients with CNS3 disease. 
 
Exploratory objectives: 
1. De termine if insufficient in vitro T-cell test expansion in response to CD3/CD28 
costimulation is predictive of manufacturing or clinical outcome. 
 
[ADDRESS_995917] designed a single-arm open-label phase I/IIa study to determine the safety, 
tolerability and engraftment potential of CART-19 T cells in patients with CD19+ hematologic 
malignancies. The general protocol schema is shown above in figure 1  in section 1. All subjects 
will be dosed with CART-19 T cells. In all subjects treated to date, the CART-19 T cells 
c
ontained  only the TCR :4-1BB transgene. A total of 72 subjects will be infused across “ no 
allo” , “ allo” , and CNS-3 cohorts.  In order to infuse 72 patients, assuming a 20% drop out rate, 
we would enroll up to 86 patients. 
 A secondary objective is to determine if the 4-1BB transgene is superior to the TCR  
only transgene. To test this, a cohort of 5 patients will be dosed with mixtures of TCR :4-1BB 
and TCR only cells, using a competitive repopulation strategy to determine the optimal signal 
transduction module in the chimeric receptor ( figure 13). This cohort will proceed only after the 
[ADDRESS_995918] in vivo, and 
therefore, we think that CART-19:TCR :4-1BB will be superior to CART-19:TCR  only. The 
null hypothesis is that they are equivalent.   
At 
entry, subjects will be staged and the suitability of their T cells for CART-[ADDRESS_995919] 
adequate T cells will be leukapheresed to obtain large numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) for CART-[ADDRESS_995920] is pheresed; however, in 
the allo cohort, T cells derived from donor engrafted cells may be collected from the subject. The 
T 
cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with CART-[ADDRESS_995921] blood tests to assess safety, and engraftment and persistence of the 
CART-19 cells at regular intervals through week 4 of the study (see table in Appendix 2).  The 
subsets of circulating T-cells that contain the CART-19:TCR :4-1BB and CART-19:TCR  only 
lentiviral vector will be assessed at various times after infusion and compared to the baseline 
sample. Following the 6 months of intensive follow-up, subjects will be evaluated quarterly for 
two years with a medical history, a physical examination, and blood tests.   Following completion 
of the primary follow-up phase, subjects will continue to be followed for disease-free survival 
(as applicable) and overall survival every [ADDRESS_995922] infusion, as part of Secondary Follow-up .  Subjects will also be asked

 STUDY DRUG  
5.1 Description 
CART-19 cells are autologous T cells (collected from the patient) that have been engineered to 
express an extracellular single chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an 
intracellular signaling molecule comprised of a tandem signaling domain of the 4-1BB and 
TCR signaling modules. The CART-19 cells are cryopreserved in infusible cryomedia and will 
be administered in either 1 or 2 bags.  Each bag will contain an aliquot (volume dependent upon 
dose) of cryomedia containing the following infusible grade reagents: plasmalyte-A, dextrose, 
NaCl, up to 7.5% DMSO, dextran 40, human serum albumin with up to 5x109 autologous T cells 
per bag. 
 
Expected toxicities associated with infusion of CART-19 cells include transient fever, chills 
nausea, and rigors.  In order to minimize these events, patients will receive premedication as 
instructed below in section 5.4.  Later toxicities (7-[ADDRESS_995941] infusion) are likely to be related 
to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or possibly tumor lysis. Toxicities that could potentially 
occur but are unprecedented are primarily related to the gene transfer and are described in 
Section 8.4.2.  These include generation of a replication competent lentivirus (RCL), insertional 
oncogenesis, and uncontrolled proliferation of the CART-19 cells.

 P atients experiencing toxicities from their preceding cytoreductive 
chemotherapy will have their infusion schedule delayed until these 
toxicities have resolved. The specific toxicities warranting delay of T cell 
infusions include: 
 Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep

abnormalities on chest x-ray that are progressive

5.3.1 Patients 1-72 (infused), including CNS3 cohort 
CART-19 transduced T cells will be given, up to a total dose of 1.5x107-5x109 (0.3x106-
1.0x
108/kg)- total cells transduced with the 41BB-z vector. We will use the following schedule, 
star
ting with a 10x dose reduction but allowing for intra-patient dose escalation (see section 6.6): 
 Da y 0: 10% of total dose 
 Da y 1 : 30% of total dose if patient is clinically stable from prior day’s 
infusion 
See section 6.6 for details on timing and doses of subsequent CART-19 infusions. The toxicities 
that would pr
eclude the next dose of T cells are DLTs or GVHD attributable to the cell infusion, 
and not toxicities attributable to the prior chemotherapy, such as cytopenias. A DLT will prevent 
the infusion of the next dose, even if fully resolved by [CONTACT_14713].  
5.3.2 Comparison Cohort 
NOTE: This cohort is on hold pending redesign of the comparison strategy (i.e., which CAR the 
41-BB CAR will be compared to). Both the protocol and the consent form will require 
modi
fication and IRB approval prior to this cohort being treated. 
 
CART-19 transduced T cells will be given consisting of a mixture of 1.5x107-5x109 (0.3x106-
1.0x108/kg) total cells transduced with either the 41BB-zeta or zeta only vector.  The first patient 
to receive the combined T cell infusion will be an adult, either at PENN on their CART-19 
protocol, or an adult at CHOP. This dose will include 50% of cells of each CART-19-T product, 
whic
h is separately manufactured and released, and then mixed prior to infusion.  Currently, the 
plan is to give the CART-19 cells using the original “split dose” regimen on day 0, [ADDRESS_995946] dose and sufficient CART-19 cells 
were manufactured. If we proceed with the modified dosing schedule, this day 11 dose will not 
occur. We will clarify this prior to enrolling to this phase of the study.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
Preparation 
The CART-19 T cells are prepared in the  as described in Section 1.2, and are not 
released from the  until release criteria for the infused cells (e.g., cell purity, sterility, 
average copy number of vectors/cell, etc.) . Upon

Overview 
The study consists of 1) a screening phase, 2) followed by [CONTACT_361299]/treatment phase 
consisting of apheresis, chemotherapy (to be determined according to disease as per section 6.5), 
3) infusions of CART-19 cells, and 4) follow-up. Schedule of evaluations and infusion are 
include
d in Attachment 2. 
6.1 Pre-Entry Evaluations 
Subjects will be tested for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  If this was obtained as 
part of the pheresis process, this test result can be used.  The HIV test must be completed no 
more than 8 weeks before the infusion date as per the Schedule of Study Procedures (Section 
15.1).   
6.[ADDRESS_995955] an adequate pre-entry evaluation will 
undergo a routine lymphoma/leukemia staging workup including: 
 Hist ory and Physical Examination (including height, weight, body surface 
area) 
 CT scans of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis done within 21 days of study 
entry if required for disease evaluation. 
 C omplete Blood Count, Differential. 
 C hemistry Panel ( Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, 
Total Protein, Albumin, Total Bilirubin, Alk Phos, AST, ALT, Mg, Phos, 
LDH, Uric Acid)  
 Serum pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential 
 B2 Microglobulin Level if used in disease evaluation 
 S erum immunoglobulin levels 
 P erformance Status Assessment 
 GV HD assessment (allo cohort) 
 Vira l serologies (may use Miller-Keystone Autologous Panel) 
 Autoa ntibody screen (ANA, ESR) 
 B one marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], spi[INVESTIGATOR_122499] (for any patient where spi[INVESTIGATOR_729270], such as ALL) and lymph node 
biopsy (if accessible). Samples are sent to hematopathology for MRD 
assessment and CD19 expression. These tests will often already be 
available from prior treatment, in which case they will not be repeated at 
this point unless clinically indicated.   
 For patients with ALL, CLL, PLL or other malignancy with circulating 
disease, bone marrow assessments will be done if clinically indicated to 
identify disease burden.  If there is circulating disease, blood will be sent 
for flow cytometry to confirm CD19 expression if this has not been done 
in the past 6 months. 
 An ECHO/MUGA should be performed within [ADDRESS_995956] 
infusion.

chosen and administered by [CONTACT_382718]/referring oncologists. The choice of chemotherapy will 
depend on the patient’s underlying disease and prior t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day x 4 
days) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/day x 2 days) are the agents of choice, as there is the 
most
 experience with the use of these agents in facilitating adoptive immunotherapy.

Subjects will undergo the following for pre-infusion testing: physical exam, documentation of 
adverse events and blood draws for hematology, chemistry and pregnancy testing (if applicable).

ART-19 transduced T cells will be given, up to a total dose of 1.5x107-5x109 (0.3x106-
1.0x108/kg) total cells transduced with the 41BB-z vector. We will use the following schedule, 
starting with a 10x dose reduction but allowing for int ra-patient dose escalation: 
 Da y 0: 10% of total dose 
 Da y 1: 30% of total dose if patient is stable from prior dose (no significant toxicity such as 
fever from 10% dose). This dose may be given between day 1 and 4 if the patient develops 
transient fever and is subsequently afebrile and clinically stable. If not given on day 1-4, this 
dose
 will then become available for infusion at day 14 or later (see next paragraph regarding 
timing and subsequent infusions).

a
t HUP experienced fevers but not CAR expansion after his first (100%) dose of CART-19 cells . 
He then was redosed 4 months later, and subsequent ly experienced a delayed marrow CR 45 
days after this second infusion (D Porter, personal communication). Patients may receive doses 
of up to 60%, no less than 14 days from a ny prior infusion (including the first infusion). 
 
I
t is possible that a subject's cumulative dose could exceed 100% of the dose specified above. 
More than 100% of the cell dose may be given in aliquots to sustain an initial response or 
address rapid CAR clearance (as evidenced by e.g. B cell recovery) if the cells grew well and a 
sufficient number are available. In this scenario, additional doses of 30% (if available) would be 
given at 2 week+ intervals. The rationale for this dosing regimen is that there does not appear to 
be a significant dose-response relationship with the initial dose. We have observed varying and 
significant degrees of cell expansion post infusion, making the amount of the infused cells less 
relevant. Thus, a multiple doses given over time may be more efficacious in sustaining a 
response. In terms of safety, the worst toxicities have been observed with the first infusion. There 
has been minimal toxicity with subsequent infusions in the few patients that have received them. 
The
refore, we consider the potential benefits of administering a greater cell dose over time to 
outweigh the potential risks. However, the cumulative dose will not exceed 1.5 x 108/kg 
administered over time in several doses.  
 
The goal is to give 30% aliquots for these subsequent infusions, unless only a 60% aliquot exists 
to be infused. Prior to amendment 10, the  has preparing the product in 10%, 30% and 60% 
a
liquots, thus, it was not possible to administer less than 60% if that was the only aliquot 
remaining. Going forward, the manufacturing facility will prepare the product in several 30% 
aliquots (if sufficient cells exist), making subsequent administration of 30% doses possible. We 
will not administer several 60% doses over time (i.e. only one 60% dose would be given after the 
initial 10% and 30% doses).  
 
Regardless of timing, toxicities that would preclude a subsequent dose of T cells are DLTs 
(defined in section 8.1) or GVHD attributable to the cell infusion, and not non-DLT toxicities or 
tox
icities attributable to the prior chemotherapy, such as cytopenias. A DLT will prevent the 
infusion of the next dose, even if fully resolved by [CONTACT_14713]. 
 
The cells are thawed by [CONTACT_941] . The thawed cells will be given as a slow IV push or 
infusion rate as quickly as tolerated so that the duration of the infusion will be approximately 10-
15 minutes, adjusted for size of patient and volume of infusion. In subjects 15-20 who receive 
mi
xtures of CART-19 cells, in order to facilitate mixing, the cells may be administered 
simultaneously using a Y-adapter. Subjects will be infused and premedicated as described in 
section 5.3. Subjects’ vital signs will be assessed and pulse oximetry will be done prior to 
dosing, at the end of the infusion and every [ADDRESS_995963] resolved. The specific toxicities warranting 
delay of T cell infusions include: 1) Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep

subjects as recommended by [CONTACT_614207].  
Evaluations include: physical exam and medical history (including concomitant medications and 
adverse events) with careful attention to features possibly related to oncoretroviral diseases such 
as cancer, neurologic disorders or other hematologic disorders. In addition, labs will be drawn to 
evaluate engraftment, T body PCR and research labs.  Blood for an appropriate RCL test (i.e. 
HIV-gag or VSV-G or similar) will be drawn yearly in order to detect RCL. If all RCL tests are

7.1 General Design Issues 
This is an open label, phase I/IIa study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and persistence and 
engraftment of autologous T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor targeting 
CD19, that is linked to the CD3z-4-1BB signaling chains in the setting of a competitive 
re
population in patients with chemotherapy resistant or refractory CD19+ leukemia or 
lymphoma. Patients at CHOP will be enrolled on this protocol (including some adults up to age 
24), while patients at UPENN will be enrolled on the UPENN protocol. Inclusion of patients 
a
ges 22-24 will be limited to patients already being treated at CHOP or another pediatric center. 
The eligibility criteria are similar. The accrual goals at CHOP and UPENN will be separate. 
SAEs will be reported to both IRBs, with CHOP SAEs being reported according to the timing 
below and UPENN SAEs being provided according to the “outside center” reporting rules.  
Events on both the CHOP and UPENN protocols will be evaluated by [CONTACT_729337]. Possible 
triggering of pausing and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729273]. 
Failure to complete the study due to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_729274]. This study is primarily intended to 
provide data that might allow the investigators to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety and 
feasibility. 
Upon enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis (if needed) and an optional bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_729275].  Between leukapheresis and 
treatment, patients may undergo an additional chemotherapy treatment depending upon their 
disease.  At dosing, patients will receive redirected autologous T cells against CD19 (CART-19 
cells), containing a CD3z-4-1BB intracellular signaling chain.  Patients will be monitored weekly 
for
 four weeks.  At the end of four weeks, patients will undergo a second evaluation.   
Obse
rvation and monitoring of patients will continue on a monthly basis until [ADDRESS_995973] observed a drop out rate of 
less 
than 20% or less due to disease progression or clinical deterioration between enrollment and 
initial infusion (this will take about 6 -8 weeks for screening-apheresis to dosing).  However, as 
we are eliminating the test expansion, we may increase this dropout rate by 5-15%. Thus, up to 
86 subjects will be initially enrolled to allow our goal of 72 infusions.  
All 
safety data after initial CART-19 infusion will be summarized regardless of whether 
patient receives subsequent CART-19 infusions or not (Section 6.6).  Efficacy data will be 
summarized from initial CART-[ADDRESS_995974]. Additional analyses may be planned as needed.

 F easibility to manufacture CART-19 cells from patient apheresis products. The 
number of manufactured products that do not meet release criteria for vector 
transduction efficiency, T cell purity, viability, sterility and tumor contamination 
will be determined (defined as “manufacturing failures”).   
 Dur ation of in vivo survival of CART- 19 cells is defined as “engraftment”. PCR 
for CART-19 vector sequences will also be performed after infusion at 24 hours, 
weekly x 4, monthly x 6, and every 3 months thereafter until any 2 sequential 
tests are negative documenting loss of CART-19 cells.   
 Ne w onset secondary malignancies. 
7.2.2 Secondary Endpoints 
 Describe anti-tumor responses to CART-19 cell infusions.

 F or patients with stored or accessible tumor cells, evaluate the post infusion 
tumor response in comparison to baseline responses prior to cytoreductive 
chemotherapy (week -4), to evaluate the effect on general anti-tumor immunity. 
 I n subjects infused with mixtures of CART-19 TCR  a nd TCR :4-1BB cells, 
RT-PCR analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify relative

8.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related 
documents such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc.) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
ha
ve been caused by [CONTACT_3459]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm). 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should 
be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to 
be adverse events if the abnormality: 
1. re sults in study withdrawal 
2. is associated with a serious adverse event 
3. is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
4. leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
5. is considered by [CONTACT_729340]19 Lentiviral T body Protocol  page 49

that is:  
1. fa tal 
2. li fe-threatening 
3. re quires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
4. re sults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
5. a  congenital anomaly or birth defect 
6. a n important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug 
overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive 
treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_60062].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events .  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a))   
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possi
bility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
"reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a 
drug. 
 
Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed 
in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  
 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
Dose limiting toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or 4 toxicity as determined by [CONTACT_435188] 3.0, 
which is unmanageable, unexpected and unrelated to chemotherapy and attributable to 
protocol therapy. For instance, grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia related to pre-
infusion chemotherapy would not be related to study drug and would not be considered as a

dosing, a grade [ADDRESS_995984] result of the cytotoxic 
chemotherapy will not be reported as an adverse event but should be listed under medical 
history.  
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an 
adverse event.   
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study 
sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued 
or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor 
should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that 
has participated in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of 
the following conditions is met:   
1. The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality 
2. The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
3. The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.

8.3.2 Investigator reporting: notifying the IRB 
The IRB requires expedited reporting of those events related to study participation that 
are unforeseen and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm, or 
where required by [CONTACT_1034].  The IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or bulk 
adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The IRB requires 
re
searchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days from the 
time the investigator becomes aware of the event: 
 
Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non-serious, on-site or 
off

Reporting Deaths:  more rapid reporting requirements 
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following 
describes the more rapid reporting requirement of the IRB for specific situations:  
1. Report the event within 24 hours when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and 
indicates participants or others are at increased risk of harm. 
2. Report the event within 72 hours, for all other deaths, regardless of whether the 
death is related to study participation. 
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made through the eIRB 
s
ystem. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to the initial 
submission. 
 
Other Reportable events: 
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the IRB: 
1. An y adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
2. An y adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators 
brochure, protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_729346]. 
3. I nformation that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the 
research, in terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
- An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected. 
- Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected. 
- A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your 
research study is of no therapeutic value. 
4. C hange in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol. 
5. Breach of confidentiality

8.3.3 Reporting obligations to the ACC DSMC 
The Abramson Cancer Center has developed a detailed data safety and monitoring plan.  
The
 Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee (CTSRMC) serves as a 
rigorous scientific peer review mechanism for all cancer protocols conducted within the 
University of Pennsylvania. The CTSRMC’s focus is the scientific merit, p riorities, and 
progress of Cancer Center clinical research while the DSMC ’s focus is data quality and 
subject safety monitoring and auditing. The guidelines governing both committees have 
been adapted from the NCI/NIH policies.  
The DSMC requires AE/SAE submission through Velos as follows  
 All grade 3 or higher events, including GVHD, within 5 business days of 
knowledge of the adverse event .  Grade 3 and 4 events that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_729279], with the exception of those that could be symptoms/early 
indicators of any of the toxicities defined in the Toxicity Management section of 
the protocol, signs/symptoms of an allergic response, severe hypotensive crisis or 
any other reaction to the infusion, do not require DSMC reporting. It is important 
to note that these events must be reported in the absence of a diagnosis of a 
spe
cific toxicity.   
 All unex pected deaths within 24 hours of knowledge 
 All ot her deaths within 30 days of knowledge (including death of subjects off

19 cells. In making this determination, the investigator will assess: 
 Timi ng (most other toxicities, other than cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinema 
are resolved within 28 days of infusion). 
 Predisposing structural CNS lesions, prior strokes, or prior seizure history 
 Ne urologic baseline at study entry 
 Eve nts during CRS that may have been predisposing to CNS toxicity (such as 
significant coagulopathy) 
 Infections are most likely attributable to cytopenias due to disease and 
chemotherapy, and are therefore less likely to be due to CART-19 infusion  
8.4.3 
General toxicity management considerations 
– Replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) may be generated during the CART-[ADDRESS_995991](s), and therefore, monitoring for RCL 
will be conducted during the course of the trial. 
 
Regulatory agencies and the gene therapy community have previously discussed 
measures to be taken should an RCL be confirmed in a subject. However, because the 
probability and characteristics of an RCL are unknown, no guidelines have been put in 
place. Nevertheless, all agree that the subject must be isolated until an understanding of 
how to manage the subject becomes clear. Some considerations are  
 I ntensive follow-up of subject in consultation with gene therapy experts, study 
investigators, FDA and NIH. 
 I nform local public health officials and CDC. 
 Identify sexual partners and provide appropriate counseling and intervention.  
 
– RCL Testing: If a positive RCL assay result is obtained from a subject blood 
specimen, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_729283] a retest for the DNA 
test.  If the second RCL test is positive, then infusions will be temporarily halted.  The 
patient will undergo a blood draw for isolation of HIV from his/her cells.  The virus 
will be sequenced and compared to sequences of the transfer vector and packaging 
constructs, as well as to available HIV sequences to determine the origin of the virus.  
Determination of the origin of the virus can be easily performed by [CONTACT_729353], vpr and vpu which are not present in the packaging 
constructs.  If the sequence is derived from wt-HIV then infusions for all subjects can

This material is the property of Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729251].  Do not disclose or use except as au thorized in writing by

or the virus cannot be isolated from the blood draw, the patient will be scheduled for 
apheresis and will undergo a full biological RCL testing for detection and/or 
characterization of the RCL.   
 
– Clonality and insertional oncogenesis: The occurrence of adverse events caused by 
[CONTACT_729355] a gene therapy trial for X-linked SCID 
following stem cell therapy emphasizes the potential for problems in translating this 
a
pproach to the clinic112. To date, clinically evident insertional mutagenesis has not 
been reported following adoptive of engineered T cells. Lentiviral vectors may have a 
lower risk than oncoretroviral vectors based on several considerations113.  Monitoring 
for
 T cell clonal outgrowth will be performed by [CONTACT_729356] T-body-
expressing cells, and by [CONTACT_379226].  If the number of chimeric immune receptor cells 
continues to increase after 6 weeks, a V  repertoire analysis will be performed to 
evaluate clonality, or if the CBC analysis reveals abnormal T cell counts, then the V  
analysis will be performed earlier.  If a subject's V  repertoire is found to be 
monoclonal or oligoclonal, the subject's T cells will be evaluated for the pattern of 
vector insertion. If the pattern of insertion is found to favor a single dominant insertion 
site pattern the clinical trial will be placed on hold for dosing to allow evaluation of 
the subject in consultation with gene therapy experts, study investigators, DSMB, 
FDA and NIH. Further evaluation of the subject will comprise confirmation of the 
persistence of the clonality within a [ADDRESS_995992] for 
hematologic malignancies. Optionally, a sequence analysis of the dominant insertion 
site(s) will be performed, in order to locate any association of the insertion sites with 
known human oncogenes. 
 
– Uncontrolled T cell proliferation. CART-[ADDRESS_995993] develops excessive CART-19 T cell accumulation, 
corticosteroids will be administered to eradicate the infused cells.  
8.4.4 Management of toxicity 
Uncontrolled T cell proliferation. Toxicity associated with allogeneic or autologous T cell 
infusions has been managed with a course of pharmacologic immunosuppression. T body 
associated toxicity has been reported to respond to systemic corticosteroids87.  If uncontrolled T 
cell proliferation occurs, subjects will be treated with corticosteroids. Subjects will be treated 
with pulse methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg i.v. divided q6-8 hr x 2 days), followed by a rapid taper.  
 
Recommended treatment of cytokine release/ possible macrophage activation syndromes. Given 
the dramatic clinical improvement of several of the patients treated on this protocol after 
treatment with anti-cytokine therapy, we will prospectively manage potential cytokine toxicities

F). This management approach is designed to avoid life-threatening toxicities, while 
attempting to allow the CART-19 cells to establish the proliferative phase that appears to 
correlate with anti-tumor efficacy. Thus, the timing of the interventions below will be 
individualized in close consultation with the admitting service.  
– Subjects will be treated with tocilizumab (CHOP Formulary dose 8 mg/kg, or 
12mg/kg for patients<30kg, as per the package insert) with or without 
corticosteroids if grade 4 toxicity related to CART-19 cells is observed, such as 
hypoxia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], or hypotension. If possible and when used, 
steroids will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_333379].

year after infusion. 
28. For CNS3 cohort only: Brain MRI/CT (MRI preferred) within 2 weeks of enrollment. 
29. For CNS3 cohort only: Brain MRI (same modality as above) within 2 weeks of infusion if known chloromatous disease: otherwise an MRI 
within [ADDRESS_996020]’s relapse, post treatment antineoplastic therapy,  and survival status every [ADDRESS_996021] infusion. Once subjects’ relapse or they begin a new cancer therapy, additional follow-up for relapse will not be 
re
quired, and subjects will be followed for survival only.  
31. In the event that something unexpected occurs, additional research sample collection may be done as necessary.   
32. Serum samples may also be used for HACA testing when sufficient samples are available.  
33. All prior antineoplastic therapy for the study indication received prior to the start of study treatment will be documented and recorded on the 
a
ppropriate CRF as required per the CRF Completion Guidelines.  All antineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_729289]19 T-cell 
infusion (HSC
T and non-HSCT therapy for their study disease) will be collected and recorded on the appropriate CRF, until the time of 
disease relapse. 
 
Recommended additional labs after subsequent infusions: 
/ 
Recommended disease assessment and visit schedules vary for these additional infusions based on the scenario: 
 Af ter disease relapse from primary infusion:   
o Study labs are performed at Day 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, 42, and then monthly.   
o Bone marrow disease assessments are performed from the point of this additional infusion at Day 28, month 3, month 6, month 9, and 
month 12.   
 No response from primary infusion:  
o Study labs are performed at Day 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, 42, and then monthly.   
o Bone marrow disease assessments are performed from the point of this additional infusion at Day 28, and then continued per the 
original schedule from the primary infusions.   
 CART loss/B cell recovery from primary infusion:  
o
 Study labs are performed at Day 3, 7, 10, 14, 28, 42, and then monthly. 
o Bone marrow disease assessments are continued per the original schedule from the primary infusions and no additional assessments 
will be added.

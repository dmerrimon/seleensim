Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_884753] of Combined Morphine and Duloxetine on Chronic Pain  Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_656678], M.D., Ph.D. Detailed Protocol   I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE a. Historical Background Patients suffering from chronic pain often present with comorbidities such as depression and require multi-modality treatment including medications.  Preclinical studies on the pathophysiology of pain suggests that pain symptoms may be treated by [CONTACT_656728], but a number of obstacles have so far made it difficult to translate preclinical findings to clinical applications (Mao, 2013).  To date, several categories of medications are commonly used in chronic pain management including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], antidepressants, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_656679], and topi[INVESTIGATOR_12450] (Mao et al. 2011; Cohen, Mao, 2014).  Moreover, the concept of combination drug therapy for pain management has been known for several decades, which refers to the combined use of different categories of pain medications in order to achieve improved pain relief as a primary goal (Vorobeychik et al., 2011).  While opi[INVESTIGATOR_656680], their use is often complicated by [CONTACT_656729], abuse, and paradoxical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) (e.g., Mao, 2002; 2010; Chu et al., 2006, 2011; Ram et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009).  Although it is uncommon for clinicians to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_271626] a single drug treatment for chronic pain, few clinical trials have adequately assessed opi[INVESTIGATOR_656681] a non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_656682] 1) analgesic effect, 2) side effect profile, and 3) adverse outcomes including opi[INVESTIGATOR_656683].  Accordingly, we propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical study in order to examine whether duloxetine, a serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI), could enhance opi[INVESTIGATOR_656684].  We expect that this prospective human study will yield timely and much-needed clinical data on the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of adding an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_656685].  Positive outcomes of this study will help improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_656686].  b. Previous studies Combination drug therapy with opi[INVESTIGATOR_656687] – preclinical studies A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various drug combinations in rodent or primate models of tissue injury (Banks et al., 2010; Sikka et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011).  In addition, combining monoamine reuptake inhibitors with morphine enhanced the morphine anti-nociceptive effect in rats (Taiwo et al., 1985; Shen et al., 2013).  Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), influenced isolation-induced morphine self-administration in rodents by [CONTACT_656730] (Raz, Berger, 2010), prevented morphine tolerance in mice (Nayebi et al., 2009), and attenuated morphine withdrawal signs in neonatal rats (Sills, Fletcher, 1997; Wu et al., 2005).  Moreover, maprotiline, a non-selective antidepressant, enhanced morphine antinociception when both drugs were injected intrathecally in rats (Pettersen et al., 2009).  Of note, most preclinical studies on the interaction between opi[INVESTIGATOR_656688].    Combination drug therapy for chronic pain management – clinical studies    
P.I. Jianren Mao, M.D., Ph.D.  
Version Date: 2/18/2022     3  Although effective in some cases, using single drug therapy often fails to provide adequate analgesia for many chronic pain conditions.  Indeed, clinicians regularly use more than one medication in pain treatment regimens in order to improve analgesia and/or reduce side effects.  Some of the commonly used combinations of pain medications include gabapentin or pregabalin with a tricyclic antidepressant, opi[INVESTIGATOR_656689] a tricyclic antidepressant, and an oral medication (e.g., gabapentin) with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_656690] (Bril et al., 2011; Vorobeychik et al., 2011; McCormick et al., 2014).  For example, a previous study has shown that combining gabapentin with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_656691] (Gilron et al., 2005).  Fluoxetine has also been shown to improve drug-related side effects such as morphine-induced pruritus and sedation (Erjavec et al., 2000).  However, several studies using combination drug therapy have yielded either negative or equivocal results.  In a study of 28 completed subjects, morphine (15-90 mg), either alone or in combination with nortriptyline (25-100 mg), produced no significant analgesic effect on sciatic pain (Khoromi et al., 2007).  In another study of 16 subjects with neuropathic pain due to advanced cancer, adding amitriptyline (up to 50 mg) to opi[INVESTIGATOR_656692] (Mercadante et al., 2002).  While the number of clinical studies on combination drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_656693], several preliminary indications have emerged from these studies (Mao et al., 2011; Vorobeychik et al., 2011).  (1) Most studies demonstrate some benefits by [CONTACT_656731]-herpetic neuropathy.  (2) High concentration topi[INVESTIGATOR_656694] 5% lidocaine patch seems to be effective as add-on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_656695].  (3) Most clinical studies suggest that the effectiveness of combination drug therapy is dependent on the type of pain conditions and dose regimens.  Therefore, we feel that several key issues must be addressed in a combination drug therapy in order to evaluate its clinical effectiveness, including patient population, choice of medications, treatment regimen, and appropriate outcome assessment.  c. Rationale for using duloxetine as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_656696], fibromyalgia, and musculoskeletal pain (www.FDA.gov).  In this project, we choose to study the effectiveness of duloxetine as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_656697].  First, SNRI such as venlafaxine has been shown to modulate morphine analgesia in a rodent neuropathy model. Its acute effect improved and chronic effect reduced morphine antinociception, respectively (Cegielska-Perun et al., 2012, 2014, 2015). Venlafaxine also attenuated morphine dependence and withdrawal in naive rats (Lu et al., 2001).  Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine also attenuated morphine tolerance and morphine withdrawal signs in rodents without persistent nociception (Ozdemir et al., 2012; Charkhpour et al, 2014).  Duloxetine itself has been shown to reduce nociceptive behavior in both inflammation (Jones et al., 2005) and post-operative pain (Obata et al., 2010) models in rats. The effect of duloxetine on pain modulation may be due to its ability to increase the spi[INVESTIGATOR_656698] (Meske et al., 2014).  Of interest to note is that, in a rat nerve injury model, morphine appears to be more effective to reduce mechanical allodynia whereas duloxetine is more effective to diminish neuroma-induced nociception (Miyazaki, Yamamoto, 2012).  Second, duloxetine has been shown to reduce morphine requirement in patients with knee replacement surgery in a small (50 subjects) clinical study (Ho et al., 2010).  An earlier human study also suggests that increasing the central serotonin level may enhance morphine analgesia (Coda et al., 1993).  To our knowledge, no randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies have been carried out to examine the effect of duloxetine on opi[INVESTIGATOR_656699].  Third, duloxetine is an FDA-approved drug for depression and pain treatment with a relatively good safety profile (but with a warning for suicidal 
P.I. Jianren Mao, M.D., Ph.D.  
Version Date: 2/18/2022     4  risk in young subjects; www.FDA.gov).  Since its approval by [CONTACT_656732], duloxetine has been increasingly used in clinical settings.  Fourth, among SNRIs including milnacipran and venlafaxine, duloxetine (60 mg, oral) has a pharmacokinetic profile that favors a chronic course of treatment with minimal day-to-day dose adjustment, including about 6 hours to reach the peak plasma level, an elimination half-life of 8-17 hours (average 12 hours), and a 50% oral bioavailability (www.FDA.gov).  In comparison, milnacipran involves a more complicated titration schedule and is approved for fibromyalgia treatment whereas venlafaxine is used off-lable for pain treatment and has a rather short half-life requirig 2-3 daily doses (www.FDA.gov).  Therefore, we choose to add duloxetine (generic formula; daily doing) to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_656700].  We expect that this combination therapy will enhance opi[INVESTIGATOR_656701], thereby [CONTACT_656733][INVESTIGATOR_2561]/withdrawal and OIH.  II. SPECIFIC AIMS This study has two specific aims: 1. To examine changes in VAS scores and to determine total versus rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (primary outcomes) after each treatment 2.

Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_884758] is eligible and decides to participate, he/she will be scheduled for a visit at the MGH Center for Translational Pain Research.  At the first visit, the subject will read the Consent Form and then meet with a study physician via phone call to review and discuss the details of the study that are outlined in it. Any questions pertaining to the study will be answered at that time.  If the subject agrees to participate, he/she will sign the Consent Form through a survey on REDCap with Adobe sign feature using a laptop provided or personal electronic device. The study physician will then log into REDCap right after and sign their signature. Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_656705]. The subject will take one copy and the other copy will be kept in his/her study folder.  Subjects will have the option to meet with a study physician who is not their pain physician.  c. Treatment Assignment and Randomization A total of 135 subjects will be enrolled for this double-blind, randomized study.  Subjects will be randomized into three groups (n=45 subjects/group) using a computer-generated randomization protocol (Randomization.com). Group 1: morphine + placebo with acetazolamide Group 2: morphine + duloxetine with acetazolamide  Group 3: placebo + duloxetine with acetazolamide  The duloxetine and placebo for duloxetine are specifically compounded with acetazolamide (15 mg), which will be used as a tracer to determine a subject’s compliance with the study medication.  V. STUDY PROCEDURES a. Study visits and parameters to be measured Subjects will participate in a 10 week study consisting of three phases: Phase I is the dose titration period of 4 weeks, Phase II is the dose maintenance period of 4 weeks, and Phase III is the dose taper period of 2 weeks.  Seven office visits (screening visit, weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and end of week 10)and four follow up phone calls ( weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10) will be used to collect data.  Since this is a prospective study, we will be able to first determine baseline quantitative sensory testing (QST) and VAS pain score, followed by [CONTACT_656738].  To assess OIH, QST will be performed at each office visit before subject takes the next dose of the study drugs.  We will also measure plasma morphine concentration during the titration and maintenance phase to help validate morphine intake.  Urine Screening Subjects who are using illicit drugs detected by [CONTACT_252255]/drug screen including stimulants, benzos, alcohol, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (other than the study opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]), cocaine will be withdrawn from the study.

Drugs to be used:  Dose of study medications Group 1: Extended release morphine (15 mg) + placebo with acetazolamide (15 mg): Subjects will be titrated onto extended release morphine until their pain level is reduced to a VAS ≤ 3 or until the maximal tolerable dose (up to 60 mg/day) is reached.  The placebo will be a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_656706] (15 mg).   Group 2: Extended release morphine (15 mg) + duloxetine (30 mg) with acetazolamide (15 mg):  Subjects will be titrated onto extended release morphine until pain level is reduced to a VAS ≤ 3 or until the maximal tolerable dose (up to 60 mg/day) is reached.  Subjects will be titrated onto duloxetine until they have reached 60 mg/day.  The duloxetine will be compounded with acetazolamide (15 mg). Group 3: Placebo + duloxetine (30 mg) with acetazolamide (15 mg)The placebo will be a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  Subjects will be titrated onto duloxetine until they have reached 60 mg/day.  The duloxetine will be compounded with acetazolamide (15 mg).  Morphine placebo and duloxetine placebo will have similar weight and packaging to the true morphine and true duloxetine in order to maintain blinding for subjects and study staff.  The morphine/morphine placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_656707] a different colored capsule than the duloxetine/duloxetine placebo so subjects can differentiate between the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  All medications will be taken orally, and will be prepared, dispensed, and coded by [CONTACT_491593].  The assignment will not be disclosed to the study subject or study staff.  Rescue medication: Subjects in all three groups will be asked to stay on the same non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454], if any, without change once the study starts. Although no progression of overall pain condition is expected for study subjects, there may be sporadic breakthrough pain on top of an otherwise stable pain condition (i.e., no worsening of underlying pathology).  This would be more likely to occur in the

Subjects will be titrated onto the rescue medication and will be allowed to take up to two 15 mg instant release morphine pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/day, so that the total maximum dose of morphine (extended release + instant release) is 90 mg/day. Subjects will be tapered off the rescue morphine before they finish the study. To avoid overdosing, subjects will be instructed to wait at least 2 hours after taking their other study medication (extended release morphine or placebo) before taking the rescue dose.  They will also be asked to wait at least 2 hours before taking the next dose of the study medication.     Medication schedule: Subjects will participate in this 10 week study that consists of three phases: Phase I is the dose titration period of [ADDRESS_884763]’s safety, study medication for the titration and maintenance periods will be dispensed with up to an additional three days of medication; this will prevent medication withdrawal if the subject has to reschedule a visit.  Subjects will take the medication according to the table below:    TITRATION PERIOD Week Extended Release Morphine (15mg) or Placebo Rescue medication: Instant Release Morphine (15 mg) Week Duloxetine or Placebo (30mg) Morning Evening As needed Evening 1 0 1 ≤1 1 1 2 1 1 ≤2 2 2 3 1 2 ≤2 3 2 4 2 2 ≤2 4 2        MAINTENANCE PERIOD Week Extended Release Morphine (15mg) or Placebo Rescue medication: Instant Release Morphine (15 mg) Week Duloxetine or Placebo (30mg) Morning Evening As needed, no more than 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/day Evening 5-8 2 2 ≤2 5-8 2        TAPER PERIOD Day Extended Release Morphine (15mg) or Placebo Day Rescue medication: Instant Release Morphine (15 mg) Day Duloxetine or Placebo (30mg) Morning Evening As needed, no more than 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/day Evening 56-60 1 2 56-62 ≤1 56-62 1 61-65 1 1 63, 65, 67, 69 0 63, 65, 67, 69 0 66-69 0 1 64, 66, 68 ≤1 64, 66, 68 1  Study drug compliance We will use the following methods to monitor subjects’ compliance with the study medication: 1. We will provide study subjects with a log sheet to record their daily medication intake (date and time).  Study subjects will be asked to bring the medication and log to each scheduled study visit.  The medication will be counted to make sure the returned quantity matches the balance between total given and taken based on the log sheet.  2. Study medication vials will be secured with a CleverCap Pro which is a tamper resistant electronic cap that dispenses medication at a pre-set interval and a pre-set amount.

Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_884764]’s daily medication log.      3. The duloxetine and placebo for duloxetine are specifically compounded with acetazolamide (15 mg), which will be used as a tracer to determine a subject’s compliance with the study medication. We will collect a urine sample at each visit and test for levels of acetazolamide and creatinine. An acetazolamide/creatinine ratio will be used to determine if the subject has been taking the study medication containing acetazolamide if the cut-off ratio is set at 1. The urine samples will be sent to WuXi AppTec for the acetazolamide analysis. Blood will also be drawn at two visits to monitor the morphine plasma level.  Noncompliance with medication and study visits, which affects the subject’s health or data integrity, may require withdrawal from the study.    c. Electronic medical record When subjects enroll in this study, a notation will be made in their electronic medical record, which associates the subject with the study. We will also upload a copy of their signed Consent Form. Once subjects are associated with the study, anytime they are admitted to a Partners Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656708] a Partners Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122066], the study doctors will be alerted electronically.  d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656709] a Partners Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656710] a Partners Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122066]. The study doctors can know if you experience any side effects or other problems while partaking in the study.  e. Devices to be used Medoc Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA), a thermal quantitative sensory testing device. This device is FDA approved in diagnosing neuropathic pain syndromes. The MGH Bioengineering Department inspects this device annually.  f. Procedures/surgical interventions QST is a commonly used pain assessment tool both for human pain studies and clinical diagnosis. The thermode-skin interface will change temperature at 1 ºC/second from a baseline of [ADDRESS_884765] thermode will be placed to a designated body part (e.g., forearm).  Subjects will stop the stimulation by [CONTACT_7326] a button when pain is first felt.  This same test will be repeated three times with a 20 second interval and the average of three threshold temperatures from these tests will be used as the pain threshold temperature (in degrees Celsius). To detect heat pain tolerance, a contact [CONTACT_656741] a designated body site (e.g., forearm). Subjects will stop the stimulation by [CONTACT_7326] a button when the pain is no longer tolerable.  This same test will be repeated three times with a 1 minute interval and the average of three threshold temperatures from these tests will be used as the pain tolerance temperature (in degrees Celsius). To examine windup (temporal summation of second pain), a train of four identical stimuli at 47 ºC (supra-threshold heat stimulation), separated by a 2.[ADDRESS_884766] will also be repeated three times.

Four heat stimuli (HS) of 47 ºC, each lasting 4 seconds, will be delivered according to pre-set intervals.  Subjects will be asked to rate the pain (VAS) after each heat stimuli.  Pain score in response to the first heat stimulus will serve as baseline (Trial 1).  The second heat stimulus (Trial 2) will be delivered during the final [ADDRESS_884768]’s hand (opposite to the side of QST) is immersed in a cold water (12 ºC) bucket.  Two additional heat stimuli will be delivered at 15 and 30 seconds after removal of the hand from cold water (Trial 3 and Trial 4, respectively).  Pain scores from Trials 2-4 will be compared with the baseline (Trial 1) to determine the degree of DNIC (Ram et al, 2008).  This same test will be repeated three times and the average of these tests will be used.  g. Data to be collected Seven office visits (screening visit, weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and end of week 10) and four follow up phone calls (at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10) will be used to collect data.  VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  a. Specific data variables being collected • Pain Questionnaire and Follow-up Pain Questionnaire • Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) • Short-form 36 (SF-36) • Anxiety and Sensitivity Index (ASI) • Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ2) • Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) • Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] (COWS) • Screener and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_334634]- Revised (SOAPP-R) • Neurological examination including a detailed sensory examination (e.g., von Frey, cotton swab, pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107], tuning fork, alcohol wipe) • A check on routine vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygen level) • Urine drug and pregnancy tests • Acetazolamide/creatinine ratio •  CleverCap • Blood plasma drug concentration • Pain and medication log  QST will include the following: • Heat pain threshold, heat pain tolerance, windup, and DNIC.  A cut-off of 53 0C will be preset to avoid tissue damage.  b. Study endpoints Aim 1 (primary outcomes)  1. Changes in VAS pain score after each treatment- we will make both within group and between group comparisons of VAS changes.  VAS scores from a given study group will be compared across various time points (e.g., weeks 0, 4, 8, and 10).  VAS scores will also be compared among the three groups at the same time points (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 10). 2. Overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] (extended release morphine + rescue immediate release morphine) and rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] (immediate release morphine)- we will compare overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]

Version Date: 2/18/2022     13  dose between the morphine/duloxetine group and the morphine/placebo group and compare rescue dose among all three groups. Aim 2 (secondary outcomes)-We will compare secondary outcomes among three groups including:  1. Side effect profile 2. Dropout rate using Kaplan Myer survive curve 3. Functional status and co-morbidities (scores on questionnaires)  4. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] 5. OIH- we will compare QST responses along with VAS changes across three groups including changes in: a. Heat pain threshold b. Temporal summation and DNIC c. Mechanical pain threshold (von Frey filament) d. Pain location and quality as compared to pre-existing pain (e.g., aching vs. burning pain, localized vs. diffuse pain based on questionnaires 6. Urine drug screening  c. Statistical methods Our research center has used Redcap as the database for several previous and ongoing clinical studies.  For this study, we will also use Redcap to setup and maintain a designated research database.  The statistical packages will include both descriptive and quantitative data analyses using Sigma Stat (version 11) with the significance level at P< 0.05.  [CONTACT_656752] (20% effort), a statistician in our department, will be available for consultation.  Descriptive analysis will be used to analyze the data obtained from various questionnaires (e.g., SF-MPQ-2; SF-36).  Percent (%) changes in each category will be analyzed using the Chi-square test.  Quantitative analysis will be used to analyze the data obtained from QST and VAS.  (A) The Mann Whitney U test will be used to analyze the non-parametric data (e.g., results from the von Frey filament test).  (B) For the parametric data, two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to examine differences across multiple groups at a given time point (between-group comparison) or across different test points for a given group (within-group comparison).  The post hoc Waller-Duncan k-ratio t-test will be used to determine the source(s) of differences.  Since ANOVA analyses do not take into consideration the fixed (e.g., drug dose) versus random (pain duration, age, etc.) effects on study outcomes, we will also use a simple mixed effects modeling (SPSS program) to analyze the interception among these factors.  (C) Spearman Correlation Coefficient test will be used to examine correlations between clinical data (e.g., VAS change) and QST data.  We will recruit equal numbers of male and female subjects so if there is sufficient statistical power for subgroup analysis, we will also analyze the sex/gender and ethnicity differences in our research data.  d. Power analysis Estimation of group size (power analysis): Since VAS score change is a primary study outcome and previous studies have suggested that a VAS change of 2 points (or 30% from baseline) could be considered as clinically meaningful (Farrar et al., 2001; Cepeda et al., 2003; Grilo et al., 2007; Turk et al., 2008; Dworkin et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009), we will use this parameter as the basis of power analysis.  Thus, a group size of [ADDRESS_884769] 80% power assuming that the standard deviation is less than 2 points (VAS).  We anticipate a dropout rate of around 20%.  Accordingly, we will recruit up to 45 subjects for each study group.  If the dropout rate increases above 20%, we will add more subjects in each group to replace the dropouts beyond the estimated

Version Date: 2/18/2022     14  20% rate.  Since a) the MGH pain clinic alone receives over 15,000 visits per year, b) other pain clinics in the [LOCATION_011] area have a similar number of chronic pain patient visits (e.g., Brigham & Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656711]), and c) we have established a referral network and have recruited about [ADDRESS_884770] Common: Heat stimulation for pain threshold and tolerance tests, although transient may elicit pain.  Heat stimulation may cause temporary skin sensitivity similar to mild sunburns.  Immersion of a hand into a cool water (12 0C) bucket can be uncomfortable for subjects, particularly for those with pain in their upper extremities.  Uncommon: If a skin change persists, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and proper treatment will be given or the subject will be referred to a dermatologist.  2. Risks of blood drawing Subjects may experience slight pain, discomfort, bleeding, bruising or, rarely, an infection from the blood draws. A total of 20 cc of blood will be drawn over the course of the study.   b. Drug side effects and toxicities 1. Morphine  Common side effects: decreased blood pressure, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, upset stomach or throwing up, hard stools (constipation), headache, feeling tired or weak, abdominal pain, sweating, and pruritis. Uncommon side effects: bronchospasm, change in pulse, hives, trouble breathing, loss of appetite, blurred or double vision, nervousness, sweating, and chills.  2. Duloxetine Common side effects: drowsiness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, loss of appetite, tiredness, sweating, and lightheadedness. Uncommon side effects: headache, muscle ache, diarrhea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach ache, decreased interest in sex, dizziness, weakness, trouble breathing, dark-colored urine, and tremor.    3. Acetazolamide- It is important to note that associated side effects are on-target, dose-related effects so using ultra low, sub-therapeutic doses will reduce the risk of experiencing side effects. Clinical doses range from 250-1000 mg/dose and subjects will only be taking a maximum dose of 30 mg/day. Common side effects: tingling, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, dizziness, lightheadedness, or increased urination. Uncommon side effects: transient myopia, sensitivity to light, hives, headache, and glucose or blood in urine.   c. Device complications/malfunctions

Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_884771] device (Medoc) is FDA-approved and is inspected on a routine schedule established by [CONTACT_656742].  d. Psychosocial (non-medical) risks 1. Morphine- feelings of euphoria or dysphoria, dependence, and addiction. 2. Duloxetine- worsening depression and emergence of suicidality.   e. Radiation risks Not applicable.   VIII. Potential Benefits a. Potential benefits to participating individuals Study subjects randomized into the medication groups taking morphine + placebo, morphine + duloxetine or placebo + duloxetine may have pain relief from the study medication.  b. Potential benefits to society We expect for this study to yield important data regarding the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of adding an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_656685].  Positive outcomes will help improve the overall effectiveness of clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_656712].    IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE a. Independent monitoring of source data The PI, study staff and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the validity and integrity of the data and adherence to the IRB-approved protocol. The department statistician will also monitor the source data and help with the data analysis upon request. The study staff will review the accuracy and completeness of study documents, source documents and informed consent on a weekly basis after data is collected. Any issues are immediately reported to the PI, as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_656713]. The PI, co-investigators and study staff also meet on a monthly basis to review adherence to the protocol and any other matters regarding the study. The DSMB meetings will take place annually or more often as needed.  DSMB meeting minutes will be provided upon request.  b. Safety monitoring A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be formed to monitor the study progress.  The Board will consist of (3-5) members with experiences in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], pain management, regulatory oversight, and patient safety.  These members are not associated with this research project and thus will work independently of the PI.  They are qualified to review the patient safety data generated by [CONTACT_656743].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_656714]. Subjects will be discontinued from the study if, during the study, they develop profound sedation, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, or symptoms of serotonin syndrome. Cumulative Minor Deviation and Adverse Event logs will be submitted at continuing review if there are events to report. A VAS pain score greater than 6 would also trigger withdrawal from the study. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be scored based on the user manual to monitor reports of mood changes, depression, and suicidal ideation.  If a subject scores within the moderate 
P.I. Jianren Mao, M.D., Ph.D.  
Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_884772] to the ED, Urgent Care Clinic, or PCP will be taken following this evaluation.  MGH Acute Psychiatric Services (APS) will be informed about this study and the possibility that such subjects may be presented to the APS. Subjects who cannot tolerate the study drugs or are noncompliant will be safely withdrawn from the study.  Up to three visits will be scheduled to provide the subject with a medication taper schedule and to collect any unused study medication.  A study physician will be present, and visits may include additional study procedures (i.e. QST) at the discretion of the PI. Subjects will fill out questionnaires regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]/withdrawal.  Study physicians will be paged immediately if a subject scores within the moderate to severe dependence/withdrawal categories or if a subject has symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] (e.g., yawning, tearing, agitation, diarrhea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).   The study physician will contact [CONTACT_423]’s treating physician to manage the withdrawal such as using clonidine.  If the withdrawal symptoms are severe and urgent, the subject will be directed to the local emergency department. The study physician will contact [CONTACT_656744]’s condition including the history of participating in this study to facilitate the management. Additional information, advice or guidance can be provided by a study physician at the subject’s request. A study physician will be available 24/7 by [CONTACT_656745] (e.g. side effects, adverse events, study medication instructions, etc.).  If necessary, the subject will be referred for further evaluation and treatment including referral to emergency room visits.  Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others including adverse events will be reported to the PHRC in accordance with PHRC unanticipated problems including adverse events reporting guidelines.Any mild or moderate events will be reported to the PHRC and NIH in a progress report at the annual continuing review.

This study is designed to compare the accuracy of a noninvasive measuremen t of oxygen  saturation compared to 
reference values obtained by a laboratory blood gas analyzer.  Arterial blood samples will be collected from 
healthy adult subjects while undergoing a desaturation procedur e wherein the concentration of oxygen inhaled is 
slowly reduced until the subject’s arterial oxygen concentratio n is approximately 70%.  The subject will then be 
returned to inhaling room air.

 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
 This document is a protocol for a clinical research study spons ored by [CONTACT_138479].  The study will be 
conducted in compliance with all stipulations of this protocol,  the conditions of IRB approval, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR 
Part 56, 21 CFR Part 812, ISO-[ZIP_CODE], and International Conferen ce on Harmonisation E6 Good Clinical Practice (ICH 
GCP). 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.  Appr oval of both the protocol and the consent form must 
be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by 
[CONTACT_3484].   
1. PURPOSE 
The objective of this study is to compare the noninvasive oxyge n saturation (SpO
2) performance of the Masimo 
noninvasive INVSENSOR00006 sensor against an arterial blood sam ple analyzed by a laboratory CO-oximeter 
reference instrument.  Data using the noninvasive devices will be collected from healthy volunteers undergoing a 
desaturation procedure. 
This is a nonrandomized single arm study wherein all subjects a re enrolled into the experimental arm and receive 
the INVSENSOR00006 sensor on one or more fingers.  Desaturation  will be conducted by [CONTACT_531610] a controlled manner to obtain noninvasive oxygen saturation readings, SpO 2, 
at various levels.  Reference blood samples will be repeatedly collected from the subject and analyzed using a 
standard laboratory CO-oximeter.  The performance of the sensor s will be calculated using Accuracy root mean 
square (A RMS) analysis of the SpO 2 values and the reference CO-oximeter values.   
Outcome Measure:  
Performance of the sensors will be determined by [CONTACT_531611] 
(SpO 2) of the pulse oximeter sensors to the arterial oxygen saturati on (SaO2) value obtained from a reference blood 
sample and calculating the A RMS value. 
2. BACKGROUND 
Masimo Corporation develops non-invasive medical technologies.  These devices have applications in the operating 
room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency transport v ehicles, as well as physician’s offices. 
 An invasive blood sample analyzed by a CO-oximeter reference in strument gives the best measure of arterial oxygen 
concentration as well as other blood solutes, but cannot  measu re these parameters continuously and requires skin 
puncture, arterial line placement and subsequent risk of infect ion, hematoma, and other physiological damage.  
Masimo SET and Masimo Rainbow technologies allow real-time, non -invasive monitoring of oxygen saturation (and 
other blood solutes) and has the potential to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the cost of care and risks to 
both patients and clinicians associated with arterial and venou s punctures. 
2.1. Technology Background 
 Pulse oximetry is governed by [CONTACT_371330]: 
x Oxyhemoglobin (oxygenated blood) and deoxyhemoglobin (non-oxyge nated blood) differ in their 
absorption of red and infrared light (spectrophotometry).  
x The amount of arterial blood in tissue changes with arterial pu lses (photoplethysmography).  Therefore, 
the amount of light absorbed by [CONTACT_531612].

All Rights Reserved CO-022095 
 x The CO-Oximeter utilizes a sensor with various light-emitting d iodes (LEDs) that pass light through the 
site to a photodiode (detector).  See figure below.   
 
 
x Signal data is obtained by [CONTACT_531613] a capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996] (for example, 
a fingertip, a hand, a foot) and measuring changes in light abs orption during the blood pulsatile cycle.  
The maximum radiant power of the strongest light is limited to ≤ 25mW.  The detector receives the light, 
converts it into an electronic signal and sends it to the Masim o hardware (e.g. Rad-57, Radical-7) for 
calculation.  Once the oximeter receives the signal from the se nsor, it utilizes Masimo SET signal 
extraction technology for calculation of the patient’s function al oxygen saturation, pulse rate and other 
blood parameters. 
2.2. Study Devices 
Investigational sensor : INVSENSOR00006 
The INVSENSOR00006 sensor is a modification to Masimo’s rainbow  line of sensors.  It utilizes 4 LED 
wavelengths instead of 8 and requires a different calibration c urve to measure SpO 2.  This study will validate 
that the 4 LED design meets the accuracy requirements for SpO 2 (A RMS ≤ 2 % SpO 2) when compared to 
laboratory reference CO-oximeter SaO 2 values. 
 
FDA Cleared Sensors and Devices: 
Masimo Root Patient Monitoring Platform: Root is a patient moni toring and connectivity platform that 
offers rainbow® and Masimo SET® measurements with other parameters in an integrated platform. With 
docking capabilities for the Radical-7® handheld monitor and multiple networking/connectivity options,  Root 
integrates multiple streams of data into one display monitor.  
Masimo Radical-7 Pulse Oximeter: The Masimo Radical-7 pulse oxi meter is a noninvasive monitoring 
platform featuring Masimo SET Measure-through Motion and Low Pe rfusion™ pulse oximetry with the 
option to measure multiple additional blood constituents and ph ysiologic parameters.

13. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
13.1. Benefits: There will be no benefit to the subject.  Other possi ble benefits would be to society as a 
whole.  Evaluation of the accuracy of this new device could ena ble healthcare workers to more 
appropriately treat potentially life threatening conditions. 
13.2. Device Risks: The noninvasive devices used in this study are si milar in technology and design to 
some commercially available pulse oximeters and other non-invas ive devices and hence have the 
same risks.  Pulse oximeters and other non-invasive devices are  commonly used and are considered 
to be minimal risk.  There is an extremely small risk of damage  to the subject’s fingers, or other 
locations where sensors are placed, from the device including t emporary skin irritation or 
discomfort associated with exposure to the sensor as well as po tential temporary mechanical 
irritation or discomfort.  There is a remote, yet possible, ris k of a burn from the sensor. In the case of 
a sensor burn there is the potential for permanent skin damage (scar/discoloration).

 1 P rotocol Summary   
DESIGN  T ESICO (Therapeutics for Severely Ill Inpatients with COVID -19) is a master 
protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational agents aimed at 
improving outcomes for patients with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_475712] -
19. The focus in this master protocol, a sister protocol t o the TICO master 
protocol, is on patients with critical respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (i.e., those receiving  high-
flow nasal cannula, non -invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation  or 
ECMO  to treat acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_475713] -CoV-2 
pneumonia ). 
Trials within this protocol will be adaptive, randomized,  blinded and initially 
placebo- controlled.  Participants  will receive standard of care (SOC) treatment  as 
part of this pr otocol . If an investigational agent shows superiority over placebo, 
SOC for the study of future investigational agents may  be modified accordingly.  
The international trial s within this protocol  will be conducted in up to several 
hundred  clinical sites.  Participating sites are affiliated with networks funded by 
[CONTACT_475783]  (NIH)  and the US Department of 
Veterans Affairs . 
The protocol is for a phase III randomized, blinded, controlled platform trial that allows investigational agents to be added and dropped during the course of the 
study for efficient testing of new agents against control within the same trial infrastructure. When more than one agent is being tested concurrently, participants may be randomly allocated across agents (as well as between the agent and its placebo) so the same control group can be shared, when feasible. In some situations, a factorial design may be used to study multiple agents . 
The primary endpoint is a 6- category ordinal outcome that assesses the recovery 
status of the patient at Day 90. The categories of the ordinal outcome, from best to worst, start with 3 categories of “recovery” defined by [CONTACT_475784], followed by 3 categories for “not recovered” defined as a) discharged but not to home or at home but still requiring continued new supplemental oxygen, b) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475714], and c) death at day 90. The definition of home will be operationalized as the level 
of residence or facility where the participant was residing prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475715].   
DURATION  Participants will be followed for [ADDRESS_610160] secondary endpoints. Selected secondary endpoints will be 
measured at 180 days . 
SAMPLE SIZE This Phase  III trial is planned to provide 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.5 
for improvement in recovery  status at Day 90 for an investigational agent versus 
placebo with use of the ordinal outcome. The planned sample size is  640 
participants  (320 per group) for  each investigational agent / placebo. Sample size 
may be re- estimated before enrollment is complete based on an assessment of

MONITORING An independent DSMB will review interim safety and efficacy data at least 
monthly . Pre-specified guidelines  will be established to recommend early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_475717] . The DSMB may 
recommend discontinuation of an investigational agent if the risks are judged to 
outweigh the benefits .

 2 Introduction 
2.1 Study rationale  
COVID -19 is a respi[INVESTIGATOR_19538] a novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2). While most 
cases are mild or asymptomatic, progressive disease can result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requirement 
for mechanical ventilation, and substantial morbidity and mortality.[ADDRESS_610162] termed Acute 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_475718] (ARDS), have extremely high morbidity and mortality. Novel 
treatments for these patients are an urgent clinical and public health need. (We use the term ARDS interchangeably with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_475719].)  
Several clinical trials utilizing novel drugs and repurposing older agents have been implemented to investigate the treatment of adults hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475720] -
19 (see section  2.2.6). Standard- of-care is hence rapi[INVESTIGATOR_92311] (see A ppendix I  for current 
recommendations).   
2.2 Background 
2.2.1  SARS -CoV-2 Infection and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID -19) 
In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. A novel coronavirus was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_475721] -CoV-2, and the illness caused by [CONTACT_30096] -CoV-[ADDRESS_610163] comorbidities,7 may progress to 
severe disease requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], mechanical ventilation in intensive care units, and death. As of 5 October 2020, less than seven months following the declaration of a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO), there have been more than 35 million cases diagnosed and more than 1 million deaths worldwide.
1 Over 300,000 cas es 
continue to be reported daily.5  
2.2.2  Natural history of COVID -19 
SARS- CoV-2 has a median incubation  period of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2- 7 days)8 
and the mean serial interval defined as the time duration between a primary case- patient 
(infector) having sym ptom onset and a secondary case- patient (infectee) having symptom 
onset for COVID -19 was calculated as 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.53– 4.39) days.[ADDRESS_610164] with cough, sore throat and malaise. Fev er is 
present in approximately 44- 98% of cases. Notably, persons with COVID -19 often 
experience loss of smell and taste.10  
 Complications of COVID -19 illness include cytopenias (lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and 
anemia), and acute cardiac events ( elevated troponin, changes on electrocardiogram), 
vasopressor -dependent shock, acute kidney injury and dialysis -dependent renal failure, liver

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610165] patients (approximately 80%) symptoms resolve without the need for intervention within five to seven days of symptom onset up to a maximum of 14 days. However, approximately 20% of patients show signs of clinical disease progression, most notably pneumonia, around day 3 to 8 following symptom onset. Other manifestations of disease progression include thrombotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_475722] (MI). This resembles the documented 6- 8 fold excess risk of thrombosis w hen patients are infected with 
influenza virus.
11  
A proportion of those who progress then further deteriorate, including with the development of ARDS around 1- 5 days after onset of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].
6,12-14  Acute kidney injury 
necessitating dialysis  and failure of other organs may also occur at this severe stage of 
disease.  
Of the nearly 1,099 persons described in the Wuhan cohort, 16% had severe disease at presentation; 67 persons (6%) reached a composite primary endpoint of intensive care admission , mechanical ventilation or death.
9,15 As described below, outcomes for those 
requiring mechanical ventilation and with other manifestations of end- organ failure are poor, 
and treatments for such patients are critically needed. 
 
In this protocol, we aim to enroll patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475723] -
19, with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], defined as the use of high -flow nasal cannula, non -
invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation  or ECMO  (extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation ). 
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_610166] hit by [CONTACT_4113] -19, 88% required mechanical ventilation and 11% noninvasive 
ventilation.
14 The ICU mortality  rate was 26%. Of 1,043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) 
had at least 1 comorbidity, 509 (49%) had hypertension, and 21% had cardiovascular disease. Younger patients (≤63 years) compared to older patients, had lower ICU mortality and higher rates of  discharge from ICU. The median length of stay in the ICU was  9 days, though 58% 
remained in ICU at time of report.
16 In the [LOCATION_008], of the 4,078 COVID -19 patients 
admitted into critical care with reported outcomes, 50.7% died in ICU; those requiring advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_475724].

 estimates among patients with COVID -19-associated ARDS range from 30– 45%. These 
mortality estimates underline the importance of testing and implementing new effective 
treatments for these critically ill patients . 
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_610167] before and early after symptom onset.17 Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding from the 
pharynx gradually wanes as symptoms resolve, but viral RNA is still detectable weeks after 
symptom resolution.18-20 Median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in survivors (longest 
37 days), but SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_610168] severe stage of

viral loads were higher on admission and throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475725],[ADDRESS_610169], or possibly may contribute adversely to disease severity is currently unclear. In severe cases this decline in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes is also associated with an increase in activated CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, 
increases in key proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and increases in 
natural killer (NK) cells.

clarify this  question .32,33 
In addition, cohorts of patien ts with ARDS before COVID -19 (a physiology that is likely highly 
relevant to patients with COVID -19-associated ARDS) identify risks of ventilator -associated 
injury, immune depletion and associated risk of secondary infection, encephalopathy and delirium, d ysfunctional repair mechanisms, oxidative stress, NETosis, surfactant dysfunction,

 microvascular thrombosis and shunting, myocardial suppression, and multiple other insults, 
which together contribute to the high morbidity and mortality in ARDS.  One recent study 
provided detailed information on COVID -19 ARDS34 and a recent review considers features of 
classical ARDS and selected issues related to COVID -19 ARDS .35 
Phenotypic variability of ARDS is also well described in multiple cohorts, especially w ith sorting 
into inflammatory and pauci -inflammatory phenotypes.36 While COVID- 19 has a single 
underlying cause (SARS -CoV-2 infection), phenotypic variability has also been observed in 
COVID -19.34,35,[ADDRESS_610171] SARS -CoV-2; 
immune modulators especially in patients with advanced disease; drugs to reduce 
inflammation , including corticosteroids, and modifiers of other pathophysiological pathways 
implicated in disease progression, including potentially anticoagulants and anti -platelet agents.  
As results of randomized trials for these and other treatments become available and treatment 
guidelines are updated, standard of care (SOC) for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19 will 
change.  This may influence the background treatment recommended (or required) by [CONTACT_475785]/or second line or supportive care treatments recommended by [CONTACT_760].  To 
accommodate this fast -moving field  Appendix I  (which outlines the SOC to be recommended in 
addition to investigational agent or matched plac ebo) will be regularly updated.  
Of note, whereas evidence support s use of the interventions outlined in Appendix I , the most 
optimal approach to applying these interventions remains uncertain, and is the subject of ongoing comparative effectiveness trials.     
2.3 Investigational Agents  
Accelerating COVID -19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines ( ACTIV ) has formed an 
overarching “trial oversight committee (TOC)” for both ACTIV -2 (a parallel study assessing 
COVID -19 therapeutics in outpatients) and ACTIV -3 (the TICO  master protocol  and this 
paired TESICO master protocol ). The TOC  (and the agent selection committee) will select 
agents for study in the three  protocols . Members of the protocol team (non -voting) and NI H 
are members of this committee. This committee reviews data for investigational agent s and 
considers a number of factors  relevant to the likely efficacy and safety of candidates for 
inclusion in the relevant protocols .

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610172] of this master protocol – but not initially. It is also possible that one agent will be 
identified as effective and then incorporated as SOC (providing there is good safety data 
and adequate supply  of the agent ). 
 
Information on dosing, administration, supply and distribution, matching placebo, and any 
special considerations as far as inclusion/exclusion criteria and safety monitoring for each investigational agent  studied as part of this protocol is outlined in an appendix (see Appendix 
H), including known benefits and risk, justification for dosing, and administration. The appendix 
will also include whether any aspects of study procedures outlined in this master protocol will need to be deviated from.
 The informed consent will describe any risks associated with the 
investigational agent s.

described in an agent -specific  appendix and in the sample informed consent.  Other risk s 
include having blood drawn, intravenous ( IV) catheterization , and br each of confidentiality.   
Given the significant disease- related risks faced by [CONTACT_475786], there is felt to be a 
favorable risk/benefit profile, and significant risk acceptability.   
3.1.1  Risks of Drawing Blood and IV Catheterization 
Drawing blood may cause transient discomfort and, rarely,  fainting. Fainting is usually transient 
and managed by [CONTACT_475787]/her legs. Bruising at the blood 
collection sites may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_475788] a few minutes after the blood is taken. IV catheterization may cause insertion site 
pain, phlebitis, hematoma formation, and infusate extravasation; less frequent but significant complications include bloodstream and local infections. The use of aseptic (sterile) technique will make infection at the site of blood draw  or at catheter ization  less likely.

4 O utcomes  
This section describes the key outcome measures used in this p hase III protocol . The 
complete approach to measurement and evaluation of trial endpoints will be specified in the statistical analysis plan before unblinding.  
4.1 Primary and Secondary Outcomes to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety 
The primary endpoint is an ordinal outcome that assesses participant  recovery status at Day 
90. The primary ordinal endpoint  is referred to as  recovery . The outcome includes 6 
categories, consisting of 3 ranked categories  of the number of days  alive, at home, and not 
receiving new supplemental oxygen  at Day 90 (77 or more consecutive days, 49– 76 days, or 
1–48 days)  as well as an additional 3 categories for patients who are not recovered at Day 90: 
(1) discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475727], or home but receiving new 
supplemental oxygen, (2) still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475714], or (3) dead.  
Consistent with the TICO protocol  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , home is defined as the level of  residence 
or facility where the participant  was residing prior to onset of COVID -19 leading to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475728]. Residence or facility groupi[INVESTIGATOR_475729]: 1) Independent/community dwelling with or wi thout help, including house, apartment, 
undomiciled/homeless, shelter, or hotel; 2) Residential care facility (e.g., assisted living 
facility, group home, other non -medical institutional setting); 3) Other healthcare facility (e.g., 
skilled nursing facility, acute rehab facility); and 4) Long- term acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475730] 12 of 79Protocol ACTIV-3b, v3.0, 08Mar2022

 aimed at providing intensive, longer term acute care services, often for more than 28 days). 
Lower (less intensive) level of residence or facility will also be considered as home. By 
[CONTACT_108], “home” can not be a “short -term acute care”  facility . Participants previously residing 
in a “long -term acute care” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475731].  
Since some patients will be receiv ing supplemental oxygen before their COVID -19 illness , we 
define new supplemental ox ygen as any supplemental oxygen in participants  who were not 
receiving supplemental oxygen before their COVID -19 illness or an increase in supplemental 
oxygen above pre-COVID -19 baseline among patients who were receiving supplemental 
oxygen before their COVID -19. 
The “last -off” method for assessing recovery will be used, as has been customary in the use of 
similar ordinal endpoints in ARDS trials  for decades . Accordin g to the “last -off” method, periods 
of recovery that are followed by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_134577]-admission , change from home to a higher level of 
care,  or receipt of new  supplemental oxygen will not be counted toward the number  of days of 
recovery. In other words, only days between the last time the patient entered a recovered state 
(return ed home, free of new supplemental oxygen ), and D ay 90 are counted as days of 
recovery. The categories of the primary endpoint are displayed in Table 1.

rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_475734].  
The primary outcome is intended to identify relevant efficacy among investigational agents  
using an endpoint that is patient -centered, clinically relevant, and appropriately efficient .  
Whereas mortality may be the most important ultimate outcome, the sample size to detect a 
plausible treatment effect for such an outcome would be much larger than outl ined in this 
protocol . It was determined that use of a mortality -only endpoint would unduly increase the 
amount of time and resources necessary to make a determination of efficacy  and was thus not 
feasible in current pandemic circumstances . Importantly, mortality was not considered to be 
the only relevant measure of efficacy in COVID -19—among survivors, the duration of recovery  
at Day 90, which also reflects length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  is also an important benchmark . This 
position is consistent with decades of work in ARDS trials.  Notably, while data specific to 
COVID -[ADDRESS_610178] category of the primary endpoint instead of time to death given the 90 day follow -up period. Time to death is a secondary endpoint.  
4.1.2  Secondary outcomes  
In addition to the primary endpoint, several secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed.  
These endpoints will be assessed for all participants enrolled.  
1. All-cause mortality through Day 90, dichotomous as well as time to death  
 
2. (a) Composite endpoint that considers the number of days at home off new supplemental 
oxygen and the time to death as well as the other categories of the primary ordinal outcome;  
(b) a dichotomous composite endpoint of alive, at home,  and off  new supplemental  oxygen  
at Day 90;  
(c) a three- category ordinal endpoint, measured at Day 90, with the following categories : 
recovered ( alive, at home,  and off  new supplemental oxygen ), alive and not recovered, and 
dead.  
3. Time from randomization to recovery defined as alive, at home, and off oxygen  (treating 
death as a competing risk) .

4.1.3  Rationale for secondary outcomes 
The main secondary outcomes for the TESICO trial are constituents of the primary outcome 
(mortality, time to death, number of days home off oxygen) or closely related to them (days 
alive outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ). In addition, given the evolving information about the effects of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_610179] of a COVID -19 therapeutic agent. In 
addition, the importance of understanding COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (and supporting potential 
meta -analyses) across the range of therapeutic trials mandates collection of outcomes relevant 
to the calculation of endpoints from other trials. The rationale for the safety outcomes collected is presented in  Section  10. If a specific secondary outcome is to be added for a given 
investigational agent, that additional outcome will be specified in the corresponding Appendix 
H. 
5 Objectives 
5.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this  protocol  is to determine whether investigational agents are safe 
and superior to control ( initially and primarily  placebo) when given with SOC  for the primary 
endpoint of recovery (based on a 6- category ordinal outcome) evaluated at  90 days after 
randomization.

 SOC may be modified ( updated based on data from this or other trials)  during the course of 
evaluating different investigational agents with this master protocol.  SOC may also be studied 
in this master protocol along with investigational agents if data from trials indicate that efficacy 
is uncertain for this target population of patients with COVID -19 ARDS . 
5.2 Secondary Objectives 
Four key secondary objectives are to compare each investigational agent with control  for: 
1. Time to death through Day 90  
2. A composite endpoint that considers the number of days at home off new supplem ental 
oxygen and the time to death as well as the other categories of the primary ordinal 
outcome,  
3. Time to recovery defined as alive, at home, and off new supplemental oxygen ,  
4. A three -category ordinal outcome, measured at Day 90, with the following categories : 
recovered (alive, at home, and off new supplemental oxygen), alive and not recovered, 
and dead.  
 
Other secondary obj ectives are to compare each investigational agent with control  for the 
secondary outcomes listed in section  4. 
In addition, t he primary ordinal endpoint of recovery will be evaluat ed for subgroups defined by 
[CONTACT_475792] : 
• Receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation  or ECMO  
• Age 
• Biological sex  
• Race/ethnicity  
• Type of r esidence/facility  (home)  
• Body mass index ( BMI) 
• History of chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hepatic 
impairment, or cancer)  
• Geographic location  
• Duration of symptoms prior to enrollment  
• Concomitant treatments (including other randomized treatments) at enrollment  
• SARS- CoV-2 vaccination status at baseline 
• Disease progression r isk score (defined using pooled treatment groups with the 
following baseline predictors of the primary outcome (recovery  evaluated at 90 days ): 
age, biological sex , duration of symptoms, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation  or 
ECMO  vs. neither , and presence of chronic health conditions.  
6 Study Design  
TESICO (Therapeutics for  Severely Ill  Inpatients with COVID -19) is a master protocol to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents  for COVID -19 ARDS . Master 
protocols can be a more efficient approach to the evaluation of multiple experimental 
interventions for a single disease such as COVID -19 in a continuous manner .

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610180] placebo within the same trial infrastructure.  When more 
than one agent is being tested concurrently, participants wi ll be randomized across agents, as 
well as to agent/ control . This general approach  will allow rapid testing of multiple agents  as the 
pooling of controls across agents requires fewer patients to be randomized to the matched 
control arm of each agent .  Howe ver, this will only occur when feasible and when multiple 
agents are available to be tested at the same time.  If an investigational agent shows 
superiority over placebo + SOC as initially defined, SOC for future investigational treatment 
evaluations will be modified accordingly.  
In some cases, more than one dose of an  investigational agent will be studied.  For such 
agents,  specific details of the dose selection will be outlined in the relevant Appendix H .  
6.1 Randomization and Stratification  
Patients will be equally allocated to each investigational agent + SOC or to placebo + SOC.  
For example, for a study of a single investigational agent , participants will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to the investigational agent  + SOC or to placebo + SOC.  If a participant is eligible for  
two investigational agents, the allocation will be 1:1:1 to investigational agent A + SOC, agent B + SOC, or placebo + SOC.  Because the two investigational agents (A and B) may require different placebos (for example, when infusion volumes or route of administration differ), the 
1:1:1 allocation ratio will be achieved through a two- step randomization procedure: in step 1, 
the participant is randomized 2:1 to “active” versus “placebo”; in step 2, the participant is 
randomized 1:1 to A versus B.   With k agents, this can be viewed as an initial k:1 allocation to 
“active ” versus “ placebo”,  followed by a second, even allocation to one of the available agents 
(for example, if a participant was allocated to “placebo” in step 1, then the step 2 allocation will 
be 1:1 to “ agent -specific  placebo for A” versus “ agent -specific placebo for B” ).  Sites will be 
informed of the specific investigational agent/placebo (e.g., A or B) to which the participant was randomized (see section  6.2) but not whether the patient is receiving active agent versus 
placebo. For the analysis, the concurrent agent -specific placebo groups will be pooled, 
resulting in a 1:1 allocation ratio for comparing each investigational agent versus the (pooled) 
placebo group.  
If investigational agents are added or dropped, the allocation ratio to active versus placebo will 
be appropriately modified,  and overall sample size will be recalculated as appropriate.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_475793]  (several clinical sites may share one 
study site pharmacy ) and receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation  or ECMO (vs. neither) at 
entry . Within each randomization stratum, mass -weighted urn randomi zation
[ADDRESS_610181] different contraindications, consideration will be given to allowing participants to enter with

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610182] its control arm.  The c ontrol arm 
consists of all participants who were “at risk” for being randomized to the investigational agent 
but were randomized to a control group instead. This concept is relevant when the 
randomization includes investigational agents with different eligibility criteria or introduction into 
the platform trial at different time points. Formal randomization includes a matched placebo group for each agent, and the placebo groups will be pooled across agents, but only participants who (1) were eligible for the investigational agent under consideration, and (2) 
were randomized contemporaneously and at participating sites will be included in the cont rol 
group for a given agent . 
The default randomization allocation to agent (or its placebo) for which a participant is eligible 
is as outlined above. However, in some circumstances this allocation ratio may be changed by 
[CONTACT_941] (blinded) protocol leadership based on an overall assessment of how the master protocol 
framework is able to produce relevant and novel findings most effectively.  In addition, some 
agents may undergo factorial randomization with other agents. Such details will be specified in the relev ant agent -specific appendix.
 
6.2 Blinding  
Investigational agents or placebo (as necessary)  will be prepared by a pharmacist who is not 
blinded to the treatment assignment.  All other study staff, including those at sites, and those in 
roles spanning multiple sites or spanning the protocol as a whole, will be blinded unless 
otherwise specified herein.   
For investigational agents infused, blinding of the participant and clinical staff may be achieved 
by [CONTACT_1299] a colored sleeve over the infusion bags used for  investigational  agent s and 
placebos. Placebo will consist of an isotonic c rystalloid , referred to as an isotonic saline 
solution .  
When more than one investigational agent is available for randomization, the clinical staff will be informed to which investigational agent/placebo the participant was randomly assigned for 
infusion, but they will remain blinded to whether the random assignment was to the active 
investigational agent or matching placebo.  
If the blind is broken , whether by [CONTACT_21317], or  for safety reasons, this will be recorded,  and the 
protocol chair will be notified of the event . In that situation, every attempt will be made to 
minimize the number of people unblinded.  Specific unblinding procedures and instructions are 
found in the PIM. 
6.3 Sample size assumptions 
All sample size calculations are aimed at pairwise comparisons between a given 
investigational agent and its control arm.   The following assumptions were made in estimating 
the required sample size for this phase III trial.

d. The “last -off” method ( for return to home and liberation from new supplemental oxygen) 
is used to calculate days of recovery  among those who are recovered on Day 90.  
e. Approximately 80% of patients will enter the trial on high -flow nasal oxygen, while 
approximately 20% will enter with non- invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation  or 
ECMO . Control -group event rates for these patients are based on findings from ACTT -
1, the Intermountain Prospective COVID Registry (IPOC), ISARIC, and other data sources. This includes estimates of the percentage of patients in each category of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (i.e., high flow nasal oxygen , non-invasive ventilation , invasive 
mechanical ventilation  or ECMO ) at baseline.
[ADDRESS_610184] month after randomization; based on ACTT -
1 and PETAL  Network  data, we estimate 25% will be discharged to their home and stay 
home for 14 days by [CONTACT_4475] 28 following randomizati on; half of these patients will be 
discharged to their home on oxygen; and most will receive oxygen for 3- 4 weeks. Thus, 
the category 1 percentage is approximately 12% considering re- initiation of home 
oxygen and re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
g. Categories 2 and 3 are wider and also consider  home oxygen re- initiation and re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
h. Three  categories of time at home off oxygen were considered because an intervention 
that shortened time on new supplemental oxygen  and also decreased mortality was 
considered clinically relevant.  
i. Based on data from PETAL Network and Intermountain  Healthcare,  33% of participants 
will die by [CONTACT_2006] 90.  A single category is used for death at Day 90 instead of time of 
death  given the target population and planned follow -up. 
j. At Day 90 < 10% of patients will be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; and about 10% will be on oxygen or not at home. 
k. With type 1 error of 0.05 (2- sided) and 80% power to detect the OR of 1.5, sample size 
is 602. This is increased to 640 (320 in each group) to allow for a small percentage of 
patients who withdraw consent or are lost to follow -up before Day 90. 
  
The estimated control and treatment arm distribution of endpoint categories used to calculate sample size and power is displayed in Table 2.

data will be unblinded to allow expeditious reporting of primary results. In addition, all participants randomized will be followed through 180 days  following randomization for 
collection of study data ( Appendix B  and section  9.1 for details).  
6.5 Approach to Intercurrent Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_475740]- enrollment  
In general, the study will take a pragmatic approach to the use of intercurrent, concomitant medications.  Sponsor  and/or protocol leadership may, based upon convincing new evidence, 
act in the interest of participant  protection , and in avoidance of  confounding, to 
exclude/ disallow use of any specific concomitant therapy found to be reasonably 
contraindicated for a well -defined portion of the study population  (see Appendix I ). Such a 
determination may be made, communicated, and implemented by a Protocol Clarification 
Memo until it is reasonable to amend the protocol  for other reasons .   
Coenrollment in other trials will only be allowed where a coenrolling trial has been approved by [CONTACT_475794] .  
The planned analyses are by [CONTACT_118067]  (or modifi ed intention to treat as noted) . All 
participants will be compared throughout follow -up, irrespective of use of concomitant 
treatments  or co- enrollment in other trials . Concomitant treatments will be recorded at 
baseline, daily through Day 7 , and on Days 14 (which will reference Days 8– 14), and 28.

47 The target population of TESICO are patients with SARS -CoV-2 pulmonary 
involvement severe enough to cause acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_475742] (whether invasive or noninvasive). The TESI CO target population is thus a subset of “critical COVID -19,” as it is focused on 
hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_61491] -19 pneumonia as the critical organ failure.  The 
TESICO target population is also a subset of COVID -19 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], since it  is restricted 
to those with hypoxemia who are receiving advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. Based on unpublished data from a national and a regional cohort of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610191]  
Investigational agents and SOC  treatment to be used are described in Appendices H  and I, 
respectively.  
9 S tudy Assessments and Procedures 
9.1 Screening/Baseline and Follow -up Assessments 
Data collection at each visit is outline d below and summarized in  Appendix B . Day 0 refers to 
the day on which randomization occurs and on which the investigational agent/placebo is first 
administered.  Screening and randomization can be done in the same session.   The term 
“baseline” refers to data that are collected prior to randomization.  
9.1.1  Screening/Baseline Assessments 
After obtaining informed consent,  the following assessments are performed within [ADDRESS_610192]  baseline data:  
• Documentation of  laboratory diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 infection in the appropriate 
timeframe  
 
• A focused medical history , including the following information:  
 Demographics including age, gender , and type residence or facility prior to 
current illness (i.e. “home”)  
 Day of onset of COVID -19 signs and symptoms  
 History of chronic and current medical conditions, including targeted conditions 
for outcome analysis  
 Targeted concomitant medications  and SARS- CoV-2 vaccine receipt or  trial 
participation  
 • A focused physical examination  including vital signs  (at least heart rate, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and oxygen saturation) , height and 
weight , baseline degree of oxygen supplementation/respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]  
 • Blood draw for local laboratory evaluations:  
 White blood cell count  
 Hemoglobin  
 Platelets  
 Lymphocyte and neutrophil counts  
 Ferritin  
 C- reactive protein   
 Basic metabolic panel  
 Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) 
 Total bilirubin  
 INR

 • Plasma and serum specimens for future related research (four 1.0 mL aliquots of serum and 
four 1.0 mL aliquots of plasma). Two [ADDRESS_610193] and one EDTA, of blood (18 mL 
total) will be drawn in order obtain 8 aliquots.  This includes antibody status and viral antigen, 
among other assays.  
• A mid -turbinate nasal swab for SARS -CoV-2 
• Among those who provide consent for host genetics, whole blood will be collected and stored for RNA (one 2.5mL PAXgene tube) and DNA (one 9mL EDTA tube to produce six 1-
mL aliquots) extraction  
• Contact [CONTACT_8972] (phone, e- mail or other types of contact) for the participant and at least two 
close relatives /friends , to ensure reliable data collection during follow -up in the trial.   
• Urine or serum pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential  who do not already have 
evidence of pregnancy  
In some cases, i t may not be possible to draw blood for local laboratory assessments and 
storage prior to the time of randomization.  In these cases, the blood draw can be performed after the time of randomization but before the infusion  of the blinded investigational 
agent/placebo. 
The overall eligibility of the patient for the study will be assessed once all screening information 
is available. The screening process can be suspended prior to complet ion of the assessment 
at any time if exclusions are identified by [CONTACT_3476].  
Participants who qualify will be randomized within 24 hours  of consent  and given the infusion  
of the blinde d investigational agent /placebo. Immediately prior to randomization, receipt of 
high- flow nasal cannula, non -invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation , or ECMO  by 
[CONTACT_475797].  
On days of study drug administration , before and during study drug administration , the 
following data will be collected, and reported on appropriate case report forms  as applicable: 
• Adverse event s of any grade severity present prior to the infusion  (Day 0 only)  
• Start and stop times of the infusion of the investigational agent /placebo 
• Doses of study drug 
• Infusion- related reactions  to the investigational agent/placebo 
• New a dverse events  of any grade severity during and up to 2 hours after the infusion  
• On Days 0, 1, and 2, a blood draw  for local laboratory evaluations  
 
The details of m onitoring during and immediately after the infusion will be specified in the 
agent -specific appendices. Participants who experience AEs during or immediately after the 
infusion should be followed closely u ntil the resolution of the AE.   
9.1.2  Follow -up Assessments 
Participants will be followed through 180 days  following randomization for collection of study 
data ( Appendix B ). Relevant c linical data will be collected on Days 0–7 , 14, 28,  42, 60, 75, 90, 
and 180. These data will include discharge status,  and interim changes in medical history 
(targeted to components of primary  and secondary endpoints) . Concomitant medication s will 
be collected on  Days 0-7, D ay 14 (retrospectively for Days 8- 14), and on Day 28, clinical (i.e.,

and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475745] 180 days . 
Components necessary to determine the ordinal WHO/NIH ordinal outcome and the TICO 
Pulmonary endpoint will be collected to allow the computation of the ordinal outcome for every 
day through Day 14 and on Day 28. On Days 14 and 28 AEs of any grade severity will also be 
collected.  
At Day 3 and Day 5 for all participants  still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] , plasma and serum specimens for 
central testing for SARS -CoV-2 antibody determination, viral antigen,  and storage (four 1.0 mL 
aliquots of serum and four 1.0 mL aliquots of plasma) will be obtained for futu re related 
research. Two [ADDRESS_610194] and EDTA, of blood (18 mL total) will be drawn in order obtain the [ADDRESS_610195] genetics, a whole blood 
specimen for RNA extraction will be collected ( suffic ient for one 2.5 mL PAXgene tube).  
At the time of discharge, t he residence/place of living to which the participant was discharged 
and whether it was the type of residence (i.e. “home”) occupi[INVESTIGATOR_475746] -
19 symptoms will be ascertained.   All changes in this status (e.g., re- admission to another 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475747]) will be collected at approximately 2- week intervals , 
starting with the day 14 visit, to determine the time of return  “home”  and time of liber ation from 
new supplemental oxygen  (as well as readmissions or resumption of new supplemental 
oxygen) . Entry into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475748].  
For visits on Day s 7, 14, 42, 60, 75, 90, and 180,  contact [CONTACT_475798]. However, other information will be gathered, as outlined in Appendix B . At Day 90 and Day 180, the EQ-5D-5L will be administered by 
[CONTACT_756], with a dditional patient -reported outcomes (MRC Dyspnea, PROMIS fatigue, 
CONNECTS Recovery) also collected by [CONTACT_57786] 90 and Day 180. Safety data 
collection and reporting are described further in Section  10.  
9.1.3  Stored Samples and Future Research  
The plasma, mid -turbinate,  and serum specimens collected as outlined above will be stored at 
a central specimen repository in the US.  In addition to the specified testing to be done per protocol  (collected at baseline and Day 3 for all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475749] 5 
among participants still in the ICU on D ay 5), the specimens will be available for later use in 
research concerning COVID -19, SARS- CoV-2, and the impact of the study treatment. The 
whole blood specimens for RNA and DNA extraction from those participants who provided consent for host genetics will also be stored at the same central specimen repository in the US. Proposed research utilizing these specimens will be reviewed an d approved by [CONTACT_475799]. Results of 
research tests on individual specimens will not be provided to participants or their clinicians. 
Aggregate research results will be made available.

Therapeutics for  Severely Ill  Inpatients with CO VID-19 (T ESICO)  Master Protocol  
Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610196] safety monitoring through Day 90 plus c ollection and reporting of 
serious and/or high -grade events thought to be at least possibly related to the investigational 
agent for the duration of participation. If agents with longer half -lives or a likelihood of 
demonstrating effects that may potentially manifest with substantial delay  are included , a 
longer duration of broad safety monitoring will be employed for those agents. D etails of such 
additional safety monitoring will be specified in the corresponding agent -specific Appendix H . 
Second, patients with ARDS may each be reasonably anticipated to experience multiple 
serious adverse events regardless of any study procedures. Therefore, c ertain reasonably 
anticipated s erious adverse events will be collected as study outcomes  (these are termed 
protocol -specified exempt serious events  (PSESEs) ; see Section  10.2.3) , and will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_475800].   
Safety  events and PSESEs will be monitored to ensure real -time participant protection through 
frequen t unblinded DSMB review.  The DSMB will review unblinded safety reports on an at 
least monthly  basis.   
The safety evaluation of the study intervention includes several components, all of which will 
be regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_8030]. For this protocol, the term “ study 
intervention” refers to the investigational agent or placebo, and to any study provided SOC 
treatment(s).  
Infusion- related reactions are only collected for the blinded investigational agent /placebo. A ll 
other AEs are collected for the study intervention (either the blinded investigational 
agent/placebo or any study provided SOC treatment).  
Events will be reported to regulators and IRBs/ethics committees  as appropriate/required. 
Adver se events, infusion reactions and unanticipated problems will be regularly reviewed by 
[CONTACT_4318].  
The following information will be collected on electronic case report forms , and will be regularly 
reviewed by [CONTACT_4318], to evaluate and help ensure safety:  
• Infusion- related reactions during and within [ADDRESS_610197] -infusio n of the investigational 
agent/placebo. 
• Clinical adverse events of grade 3 and 4 through study day 28 (isolated laboratory 
abnormalities that are not  associated with signs or symptoms are not collected) . 
• Protocol -specified exempt serious events  (see section  10.2.3) through Day 90.

 10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a study participant, including any 
abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with their participation in research, whether or not considered related to the research.  If a diagnosis is clinically evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis, 
rather than the individual signs and symptoms or lab abnormalities, will be recorded as the AE.   
In Appendix H  details are outlined for each investigational agent under study of the following: 
specific AEs observed to be possibly associated with the agent in question, and how to monitor for, clinically handle and report such AEs, should they arise.   
10.1.2 Criteria for Serious ness 
Events  are serious if they lead to one of the following outcomes :  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of t he ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• Congenital abnormalities/birth defects  
• Other important medical events that may jeopardize the participant and/or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
10.1.3 Unanticipated Problems  
An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is any incident, experience or outcome that is:  
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to:  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the population being studied; and 
2. Possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and 
3. Places study participants or others at a greater risk of harm (in cluding physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized per the 
Investigator’s Brochure(s) (IBs) .  
Furthermore, a UP could be an expected event that occurs at a greater frequency than would 
be expected based on cu rrent knowledge of the disease and treatment under study.  The 
DSMB providing oversight to the study may make such an assessment based on an aggregate analysis of events.

 DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events  (also known as 
the DAIDS AE Grading Table; see Appendix D  for the URL).  
For specific events that are not included in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, the generic scale in 
Table 4 is to be used. Given the unique nature of the target population for this trial, 
hypotension will be graded according to the scale in Table 5 rather than the default DAIDS AE 
Grading Table.

* Guidance provides suggested seriousness alignment with AE grade but does not overrule investigator 
judgment. In particular, the presence of critical illness influences the threshold for considering a given hypotension AE ‘life -threatening’ or an ‘important medical event.’ Evaluation of other factors, including 
the intensity of intervention required and the event’s impact on the patient, are required to determine 
event seriousness.  
 
10.1.5 Causality 
Causality refers to the likelihood that the event is related to the study intervention.  It will be 
assessed for SAEs and UPs.  This assessment will be made for both the blinded investigation al agent /placebo and any study -supplied SOC treatment  using the f ollowing 
guidelines:  
• Reasonable possibility :  There is a clear temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and the event onset, and the event is known to occur with the study 
intervention or there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event.   
NOTE: Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the event.  
• No reasonable possibility :  There is no evidence suggesting that the study intervention 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or a more reasonable/likely  alternate etiology has been established.  
The causality assessment is based on available information at the time of the assessmen t of 
the event.  The investigator may revise these assessments as additional information becomes 
available.

 10.1.6 Expectedness 
Expectedness will be assessed for SAEs using the Reference Safety Information section of the 
IB(s) for the investigational agent (s) and any study -provided background therapy.  Additional 
details of expectedness for a given agent will be specified in the relevant agent -specific 
appendix . 
The expectedness assessment is based on available information at the time of the assessment of the event .  The investigator s and the sponsor may revise these assessments as additional 
information becomes available.  
10.2 Schedule for Reporting of Specific Events  
This section describes the schedule for reporting different types of safety outcomes on eCRFs  
as part of the protocol data collection plan.  It is recognized that in the care of study 
participants, more information may be collected and recorded in the participant’s medical record.  Th e information  collected in the medical record serves as source documentation of 
events (e.g., signs, symptoms, diagnoses) considered for reporting on eCRFs as part of 
protocol data collection.   
10.2.1 Infusion- related reactions 
Certain infusion- related signs/symptoms will be collected as protocol -specified exempt serious 
events  (see section  10.2.3) and will not be separately reported as adverse events.  
 
Adverse events that are  
(a) not protocol -specified exempt serious events , AND 
(b) are of grade 3 or 4 (whether new or as an increase in grade), AND 
(c) occur during or within  [ADDRESS_610202] infusion   
will be reported as adverse events  on an eCRF . 
 
10.2.2 Grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events on days of study drug administration, and 
Days 0–[ADDRESS_610203]-infusion of the investigational agent or matched placebo, on Days 0–[ADDRESS_610204] increased in grade compared to their 
pre-infusion level will be reported on eCRFs.  
 Adverse clinical events reaching Grade 3 or 4 severity level that occur between Days 7 and 28 
will be reported on an eCRF at the Day 14, and Day 28 visits. The date the event reached the 
indicated grade will be collected to permit time- to-event analyses. These reportable AEs 
should be assessed for SAE/UP reporting on the SAE eCRF or for protocol -specified exempt 
serious events  reporting on  the eCRF documenting the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779].

34 
 On Days 14 and 28, AEs of any grade that are present on the day of the visit will also be 
collected.  
 
10.2.3 Protocol -specified exempt serious events (PSESEs)  
Consistent with FDA guidance on protocol -specified serious adverse events, the TESICO trial 
will systematically collect certain adverse events that are expected to occur commonly in the 
target population even in the absence of study interventions . These events, termed protocol -
specified exempt serious events (PSESE s), are in general exempted from the usual expedited 
reporting requirements for SAEs. This approach is taken to avoid creating a ‘noisy’ safety oversight environment, obscuring genuine safety signals, and imposing potentially 
unmanageable burdens on clinic al/study staff, particularly in a pandemic critical care setting. 
Even as they are exempted from expedited reporting requirements, PSESEs will be reviewed 
regularly ( unblinded, by [CONTACT_2939]) by [CONTACT_475801].  
PSESEs  will NOT be reported as SAEs, even if they meet one or more of the criteria for 
seriousness, unless considered related to study intervention (blinded invest igational 
agent / placebo or study -supplied SOC treatment)  (see section  10.2.4) . These events may 
occur during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], lead to a re- admission, or occur in a later hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475751] -up.  
 The following are protocol -specified exempt serious events.   
• Death  
• Stroke  
• Meningitis  
• Encephalitis  
• Myelitis  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Myocarditis  
• Pericarditis  
• New onset of worsening of CHF (NYHA class 3 or 4)  
• Arterial or deep vein thromboembolic events  
• Renal dysfunction treated with  renal replacement therapy  
• Hepatic decompensation  
• Neurologic dysfunction, including acute delirium and transient ischemic events  
• Disseminated intravascular coagulation  
• Major bleeding events  
• Serious infections  
• Worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] 
• H ypotension treated with  vasopressor therapy  
• Atrial or ventricular arrhythmias

Consistent with this approach, sites will evaluate a potential adverse event to determine whether it is a PSESE:  
• If the event  is not a PSESE, it will be reported as an adverse event as outlined in  section  10 
of the protocol.  
• If the event is a PSESE, it will be evaluated for relatedness.  
o If the PSESE is related to study interventions  (either investigational agent or study -
supplied SOC therapy) , then the event will also be reported as an SAE. Thus, the event 
will be reported on both eCRFs,  the SAE eCRF and the PSESE e CRF.   
o If, however, the event is a PSESE and is not related to study interventions , then the 
event will be recorded on the PSESE eCRF  as a study endpoint  and not as an SAE .  
 
As noted earlier in this section, PSESEs are included in the unblinded safety reports reviewed 
by [CONTACT_475802] . 
 
10.2.4 Reportable SAEs  
Reportable SAEs for this study are:  
• Clinical S AEs which are not exempt from expedited reporting per the protocol -specified 
exempt serious event  list and associated rules ( 10.2.3); and  
• Any SAE related to the study intervention   
Deaths, life -threatening events, and other SAEs considered potentially related to the blinded 
investigational agent /placebo or study -supplied SOC treatment , that occur from the time of 
infusion of the study intervention through the Day [ADDRESS_610205] be recorded by [CONTACT_475803] 24 hours of site awareness. 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are reportable SAEs that are 
assessed as related to a study  intervention  and are unexpected per the Reference Safety 
Information of the IB for that intervention .  S[LOCATION_003]Rs are reported from the INSIGHT Safety 
Office to applicable regulators in an expedited f ashion.  S[LOCATION_003]Rs that result in death or are 
immediately life -threatening are reported to regulators within 7 calendar days of receipt.  All 
other S[LOCATION_003]Rs are reported to regulators within 15 calendar days. The INSIGHT Safety Office 
will generate a Safety Report for each S[LOCATION_003]R for distribution to investigators and other parties.  Investigators are responsible for submitting Safety Reports  to their overseeing IRB/EC

 SAEs are followed until the outcome of the SAE is known. If the outcome of an SAE is still 
unknown at the time of the final follow -up visit, the outcome will be entered in the database as 
“unknown.”  
10.2.5 Unanticipated Problems (UPs)  
UPs must be reported via the appropriate eCRF to the INSIGHT Safety Office no later than 7 
calendar days after site awareness of the event. Investigators are responsible for submitting UPs that are received from the sponsor to their overseeing IRB/EC.  Investigators must also comply with all reporting requirements of their overseeing IRB/EC.

Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
If an investigator learns that a male participant’s partner becomes pregnant while the male 
participant is in this study, the investigator is asked to attempt to obtain information on the 
pregnancy , including its outcome.  Information obtained on the status of the mother and child 
will be forwarded to the sponsor.  Whether such monitoring will be required is outlined in the 
agent -specific appendix.

If the study is temporarily halted or stopped for safety reasons, IRBs/ethics committees will be informed. The IND holder and sponsor, in collaboration with the protocol chair and the DSMB, 
will determine if it is safe to resume the study. The sponsor will notify the Site Investigators of this decision. The conditions for resumption of the study will be defined in this notification. The Site Investigators will notify their local IRBs/e thics committees of the decision to resume the 
study.

 11 Statistical Analyses and Monitoring Guidelines  
This section describes the analysis for primary and secondary outcomes stated in section 4. A 
more detailed statistical analys is plan  (SAP) will be  developed as a separate document.  The 
SAP for each investigational agent may be updated by [CONTACT_475805] a specific treatment comparison.    
All analyses will be intent to treat with comparisons to concurrent controls as described in 
section  6.3. It is anticipated that all study site pharmacies serving active sites will be 
randomizing all agents under study at any given time, but if this is not the case, comparisons 
will be restricted to the set of controls enrolled at study site pharmacies where the drug was 
available for randomization . Specifically, the control group for an investigational agent will 
consist of those participants who could have been randomized to the agent, but were randomized to a control group instead (i.e., randomized to the m atched control group of one of 
the agents included in the randomization). Agents will be compared to controls, but not to each other, unless explicitly specified in the analysis plan.  
All analyses will utilize 2 -sided tests with a 5% significance level  unless otherwise noted.   
11.1 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary ordinal outcome—recovery —assessed at Day [ADDRESS_610208], that assess 4 clinical states. The categories correspond to (1) the number of consecu tive days at home off oxygen ( 3 categories); (2) receiving oxygen at home or living  in a 
location other than home; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475752]; and (4) death . 
The percentage of patients in each category ( 6 total) will be compared at Day 90. The primary 
analysis will use a proportional odds model  to estimate a summary odds ratio (OR) for being in a better category in the investigational agent group compared with placebo;  an OR > 1.[ADDRESS_610209] a more favorable outcome for patients  randomized to the investigational agent vs. 
placebo.   
The proportional odds regression model will include a treatment indicator, and an indicator for 
receipt of mechanical ventilation or ECMO (vs. neither) at enrollment.  
A test for the proportional odds  assumption will be carried out.  Even if the proportional odds 
assumption is violated, the overall summary OR will be the basis for inference in the primary analysis, given the robustness of proportional odds regression to violation of the proportionality  
assumption . In order to further characterize the summary OR and any deviations from 
proportional odds,  separate ORs will be estimated for different dichotomized definitions of 
improvement formulated from the components of the ordinal outcome (e.g., alive versus dead, 
alive and out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475753], etc.)  
 
11.2 Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints , Safety Outcomes,  and Subgroups  
Four key secondary objectives  are to compare investigational agent with placebo for the 
following endpoints  
1. Time to death through Day 90.

 2. A composite endpoint that considers the number of days at home off new 
supplemental oxygen and the time to death as well as the other categories of the primary 
ordinal recovery outcome.  
3. Time to recovery defined as alive, at home, and off new supplemental oxygen.  
4. A three -category ordinal outcome, measured at Day 90, with the following categories: 
recovered (alive, at home, and off new supplemental oxygen), alive and not recovered, 
and dead.  
Time to death will be summarized using a log- rank test, stratified by [CONTACT_475806]. neither at randomization.  The hazard ratio (investigational 
agent vs control) will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, and the 
proportion of participants who died by [CONTACT_475807] (for example, Day 28 or Day 90) will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier estimates.  
The composite outcome will be summarized with a win ratio statistic that ranks patients by [CONTACT_475808] (instead of just survival status at Day 90), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51530] D ay 90, home on oxygen 
or not at home, and duration of time (in days instead of weekly intervals) at home off new 
supplemental oxygen. Matching on mechanical ventilation  (or ECMO) and a disease 
progress ion risk score  at entry will be used to estimate the win ratio statistic.  
The cumulative incidence functions for recovery (at home and off new supplemental oxygen) 
taking into account death as a competing risk will be estimated using the Aalen -Johansen 
method and compared using Gray’s test.  The recovery rate ratio will be estimated using a 
Fine-Gray regression model. The comparisons between treatment groups will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_475809]. n either at randomization.  Recovery is 
defined using the last -off method, as described in section 4.  
If there is evidence of benefit for an investigational agent versus placebo for the primary ordinal outcome, the comparison of the investigational agent with placebo for these three outcomes will help to inform the interpretation of the treatment effect.  
The primary safety outcome is a composite of grade 3 or 4 events, SAEs , PSESEs (see 
10.2.3), or death through Day 5, and tests for differences between treatment arms will be 
conducted with a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_475810] O at study entry , comparing the proportion of participants who had 
experienced any of these events by [CONTACT_2006] 5. Treatment differences for each of the components 
of this composite outcome will also be summarized. This composite safety outcome will also 
be assessed at Day 28. Time to event analysis will also be used to summarize this composite safety outcome. Proportions of participants who experienced any of these events will be 
compared using str atified Mantel Haenszel tests and logistic regression . SAEs and grade 3/4 
events will be classified by [CONTACT_475811] .  
Safety analyses also include infusion reactions collected during or within [ADDRESS_610210] for differences across arms.

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610211] will be analyzed using the same methods as 
described above for time to recovery. Readmissions will be summarized using methods for recurrent events (i.e. those who are readmitted will reenter the risk set).  
Clinical organ failure is a composite of many different organ -specific events, listed in section 
4.1.2, item 5.  This outcome will be summarized as part of both safety and efficacy analyses. 
The incidence of organ failure , serious infection  or death through Day [ADDRESS_610212] and Cox proportional hazards models.  In addition, 
specific components (e.g., cardiac and vascular dysfunction, or the composite of cardiovascular outc omes , thromboembolic events described in  section 4. 1.2, item 1 0, and 
worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) will be analyzed using time- to-event analyses under competing 
risks, as described above for the primary analysis. Proportions of participants who experienced organ failure, serious infection  or death will be summarized and compared between treatment 
arms  at fixed time points  using stratified Mantel Haenszel tests , overall and for specific organ 
dysfunctions. 
The impact of study arm on the primary efficacy (recovery) and safety outcomes ( primary 
composite safety endpoint, composite of grade 3 or 4 events, SAEs , PSESEs, and death  
through Day 5  and through Day 28, composite of SAEs, PSESEs, and death, and composite of 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_475754] 6 ) along with mortality will be assessed for 
subgroups defined by [CONTACT_7863], including demographics , baseline classification 
of “home” , duration of symptoms at enrollment, clinical history and presentation, and tests for 
homogeneity of the treatment effect across subgroups will be carried out. Additionally, 
subgroup analyses will be conducted for subgroups formed by a disease progression risk score at baseline. The construction of this risk scor e is described in section 5.2. Subgroup 
analyses will be interpreted with caution due to limited power and uncontrolled type I error.

follow -up period of 90 days for this target population, ful l follow -up for the primary and all 
secondary endpoints is considered important to evaluate the investigational agents to be studied. An exception to this guideline is if the DSMB believe there is clear and substantial 
evidence of a mortality benefit for an investigational agent  
11.3.1 Monitoring Guidelines for Interim Analyses 
Multiple  distinctive features of potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135297] -19-associated ARDS  contribute to 
the monitoring guidelines for interim analyses within the master protocol. (If a specific investigational agent requires an alternative approach to interim monitoring, those details will 
be specified in the relevant agent -specific appendix.)

Second, the primary endpoint of this trial requires 90 days of follow -up si nce the final 
classification of a patient’s recovery requires knowledge of their status on Day 90. While this duration of follow -up for the primary endpoint is essential for a patient -centered result at the 
conclusion of the trial, in the context of the anticipated rapid enrolment of the trial, this endpoint is infeasible to use for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_475755] .

Information about this study will be disseminated to health care workers  at enrolling sites.  
Prior to the initiation of the study at each clinical research site, the protocol, informed consen t 
form and any participant information materials will be submitted to and approved by a 
central/national IRB/EC and/or the site’s local IRB/EC  as required. Likewise, any future

The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki in its current version; 
the requirements of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as defined in Guidelines, EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU 536/2014) /EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) , and EU GCP 
Directive (2005/28/EC); International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements

study -related procedures.  Many of the patients approached for participation in this research 
protocol will often have limitations of decision -making abilities due to their critical illness. 
Hence, some patients will not be able to provide informed consent. For patients who are 
incapacitated, informed consent may be obtained from a legally -authorized representative 
(LAR). Because the investigational agents are intended to treat critical illness and the 
impairment of decisional capacity is intrinsic to the critical illness, t he use of LARs for 
consent is appropriate for this trial.  The use of consent from LARs will follow applicable 
legislation (e.g., in the [LOCATION_002], 45 CFR 46.116 and 45 CFR 46 102 ( i)). Capacity will 
be assessed according to local standards and policies.  Local standards and policies will also determine who is legally authorized to consent for an individual who is incapacitated. Should the individual regain capacity during the study, thei r direct reconsent should be 
obtained at the earliest feasible opportunity.  
Electronic consent  may be used when a validated and secure electronic system is in place 
to do so, if in compliance with national legislation and approved by [CONTACT_22846]/EC . 
Other methods of obtaining documentation of consent may be used when site staff are 
unable to be in direct contact [CONTACT_4490] a potential participant or a legally -authorized 
representative due to infection -control restrictions.  No matter how the participant’s  consent 
is obtained and documented, it is expected that consent will be preceded by [CONTACT_475813] (or their LAR) to have questions answered.  Sites should follow all a vailabl e local or national guidance on 
suitable methods for obtaining documentation of participant (or their LAR) consent.

We are asking you to join a research study about COVID -19.  It is your choice whether 
or not you want to join.  This form gives you information about the study that will help 
you make your choice.  You can discuss this information with your doctor or family or anyone else you would like before you make your choice.  Your choice will not affect the care you are getting for COVID -19. 
What is the research question we are trying to answer?  
We are studying two treatments  for COVID -19. We are asking you to join the study 
because you are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103182] -[ADDRESS_610221], we are studying an experimental medicine, aviptadil (also called VIP), supplied by [CONTACT_475817].  We are trying to find out if giving this experimental medicine can help sick 
people in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103182] -[ADDRESS_610222] injury. We think this experimental medicine may possibly  
help patients with COVID -19, and we think it will be safe, but we are not sure and so we 
are doing this study.   
Second, we are studying a drug called remdesivir (also called Veklury) supplied by [CONTACT_10866]. Remdesivir is approved in the [LOCATION_002]  and man y other countries  for the 
treatment for COVID -[ADDRESS_610223] to do if you decide to be in the study?

They will also check to see if you are able to get both of the drugs we are studying or just one of the drugs.  For example, if you are pregnant you 
will not be able to receive the aviptadil or matching placebo (inactive salt solution) but 
you will be able to receive the remdesivir or matching placebo.   
If you agree to be in the study, and you are able to get both treatments, we will assign you to one of four study groups.  This will be done by [CONTACT_17793] -- like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a

Aviptadil:  You will receive the Aviptadil study product (either the experimental medicine 
or the matching placebo) for three consecutive days starting on the day you join the study (study Day 0).  You will get it by [CONTACT_475818] (IV ) drip through a tube in your 
vein.  This is called an infusion.  The infusion will take about 12 hours on each day that 
it is given.   
Aviptadil is the only thing you may be given that is experimental.  It is NOT approved for 
use in people with COVID -19 by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) 
or any other regulatory body in the world.  It is approved in some countries outside the US for another condition but is given in a different way. Its use in the [LOCATION_002] is 
strictly limited to re search.  
Remdesivir:  You will receive the remdesivir study product (either the active medicine or

to [ADDRESS_610224] been shown in prior 
studies to help people survive COVID -19.  Steroids are available for other diseases in 
the [LOCATION_002], so your doctor will be using it “off -label,” which means that while 
there is not formal FDA approval for this use, your doctors think it is reasonable. It is 
likely that you would receive steroid medicine even if you were not  in the study.  
Any other medications or treatments you will be given will be what you would usually 
receive in this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475760]. There may be some additional procedures or testing done for study purposes.  We will describe these below.  
You will be in the study for [ADDRESS_610225] the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
We will swab your nose to see how much of the virus that causes COVID -19 is present. 
We will take blo od samples from you to better understand the body’s response to the 
infection.  Some of the blood may be used in future studies.  
To be in the remdesivir/placebo part of the study, you will need to agree to not have sex 
that could make you or a partner pregnant for seven days after you finish the remdesivir 
or placebo infusion.  This may involve not having sex at all (abstinence), or you may use 
effective contraception (hormonal contraception or barrier methods with spermicide) to 
avoid pregnancy.  Methods l ike rhythm, sympto -thermal or withdrawal are not effective 
for the purpose of the study.  You can ask the study team about this if you have 
questions or concerns.  
If you are pregnant , you cannot be in the aviptadil /placebo part of the study. You can 
still be in the  remdesivir /placebo part of the study . 
If you become pregnant during the study, please let your study team know as soon as possible.  We will ask to follow you until your pregnancy is over, to see if there were any problems that may have been caused by [CONTACT_475820].

PID: _______________________ • By [CONTACT_30112], you are giving us permission to contact [CONTACT_475823][INVESTIGATOR_475761]. 
We will contact [CONTACT_475824].   
• We will ask you to give us information about other people we can contact [CONTACT_475825][INVESTIGATOR_307], so we can find out how you are doing.   
 
We will send the information we collect to the University of Minnesota (UMN) in the US 
where it will be stored and analyzed.  In this information, only a code number, your year of birth, and a 3- letter code that the study staff chooses identifies you.   
The study staff here at this site are responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_475762].   
We will send the blood samples to a laboratory in the US for storage.  We will keep 
them for as long as we have the funding and space to do so, which we expect to be many years.  There is more information below about how we will use these samples.   
Why would you want to be in the study? 
If you get study drug, it is possible it may help you get better, or that you may get home 
faster, but we do not know that.   
It is important to remember that some people in this study will get inactive 
placebo and will n ot get study drug.  
By [CONTACT_55825], you will help doctors learn more about how to treat COVID -[ADDRESS_610228] if a treatment proves to 
be safe and is shown to be effective.  
Why would you NOT want to be in the study? 
Since only some people in this study will get study drug, you may not receive it.  Even if 
you do get study drug, it may not be useful, or it may have harmful side effects, so being 
in the study would not be of any direct help to you.   
What are the risks or side effects of the study treatments?  
All treatments have risks and may cause side effects.  These may happen to you from 
the study treatment.  
You may have an allergic reaction, including hives, trouble breathing, or other allergic 
responses. Allergic reactions like these are likely to be rare, but may be severe or 
life-threatening.

PID: _______________________ You will be monitored very closely while you are being given the in fusion of the study 
product (aviptadil or placebo) and for at least [ADDRESS_610229] these things 
done while you are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475763].  These discomforts and risks are no different from what you would experience if they were performed as part of your regular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475764] -19. 
 
What are the risks or side effects of Aviptadil?  
One effect of aviptadil is that it relaxes smooth muscle such as in your lungs, blood vessels, and intestines.  Relaxing this type of muscle opens up your airways so it is easier to breathe and get oxygen in to your body.   
 
The most common side effect of aviptadil infusion is decreased blood pressure. In early 
studies of very ill patients with lung injury, about 1 in 5 people (20%) had lower blood pressure during the infusion of aviptadil.  The decrease was u sually small and went 
away within [ADDRESS_610230] when the infusion is stopped.  
 
What are the risks o r side effects of Remdesivir?  
The most common side effects of remdesivir included abnormal liver function test 
results, abnormal blood clotting test results, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and headache. The abnormal liver function tests lasted longer than a few days in some people but went back to normal within a few weeks or less.  
Remdesivir might affect the way that other medications are processed by [CONTACT_39625].  They might stay in your body longer, or shorter, at higher or lower levels.  At the time 
this document was written, one person in another study had an increase in the level of a 
medication in their blood that was considered by [CONTACT_475826].  There did not appear to be any harm from this temporary change.  You can ask the study team more about this if you are concerned.

PID: _______________________ Some people may have some side effects after the infusion of remdesivir.  Other people 
may have no side effects.  
What are the risks and benefits of taking steroids?  
Steroids may cause your sodium (salt) and glucose (sugar) levels to rise in your 
blood. You may feel anxious while taking steroids.  You may be given steroids to treat your COVID -19 even if you do not join this study.   
 
What if you are pregnant or breastfeeding? 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you can still join this study , although you cannot 
participate in the aviptadil portion of the study.  However, we do not have any 
information about how either aviptadil or remdesivir  may affect your baby.  The risks to 
a pregnant woman or an unborn baby [CONTACT_475827].  Please take this into account as you make your decision about whether to join this study.  
Additional information:  
Here is some additional information about the study  that may help you make your 
choice about whether you want to be in the study.  
The NIH, an agency of the US Federal government, is paying for this study.   
We are required to comply with all rules and regulations for human research as well as 
the laws of each country where the study is taking place.   
This study is taking place in several countries.  We expect to enroll about [ADDRESS_610231].  
If you do not want to be in this study, you will still get the usual care to treat COVID -19.  
However, you cannot get Aviptadil because it is experimental.  
 
What are the costs to you?  
We will give you the study treatment at no cost.  We will pay for all clinic visits, lab work, 
and other tests that are part of this study.

Additional Consent for Genetic Testing on Stored Specimens  
WHY IS GENETIC TESTING BEING DONE? The study team would like your 
permission to collect a small amount of your blood and store them for researchers who 
will do genetic testing (testing on your gen es) and other related tests in the future. 
These tests will help us understand how the genetic makeup of people affects the COVID -19 virus and how it makes people sick.   
Any future research done on the blood collected for this study will be related to the 
COVID -19 virus for which you are being studied in this trial. 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING GENETIC TESTING?   
If you agree to take part in this study, three blood specimens will be collected 
along with other blood being drawn for the study, approximately 15 mL (about 1 tablespoon) in total. The blood will be taken with other laboratory test samples 
so you will not get an extra needle stick.  
HOW WILL YOUR BLOOD BE USED? Your blood will be used to learn more about the 
health problems that may be caused by [CONTACT_4113] -19.  This may include tests to better 
understand why some people have more severe complications (get sicker) than others and why medicines to prevent or treat these infections might work better in some people than in others.  
Researchers involved with this  blood collection project do not know yet exactly which 
tests will be done.  
You and your study doctor or nurse will not get any results from the tests done on your blood collected for this genomics study.  These tests will only be used for research and may not apply to your medical care.  
Your blood sample collected for this study will:  
• Become the property of INSIGHT.   
• Not be sold or used to make commercial products.   
• Not be tested for any specific research study unless the plan for using your blood 
is approved - based on scientific and ethical considerations - by [CONTACT_475845], the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and a special committee (an Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee) at the researcher’s institution .

HOW LONG WILL YOUR BLOOD BE KEPT?  
Your blood specimen will be stored as long as funding is available for storage and 
testing.  
[Alternative to Previous Paragraph for non- US Sites Only]  
Your blood specimen will be stored safely and securely at a special facility called a 
specimen repository.   The repository may be located in the [LOCATION_002].  This facility 
follows strict procedures so that only approved researchers can use the stored specimen for future testing.  The employees at this facility who will store and track your blood specimen will not have information that identifies you by [CONTACT_2300].  
 
Risks: There are few risks involved with your participation in this study.  Having your 
blood drawn may result in a little pain and slight bruising where the needle goes into 
your skin.  You may also feel lightheaded, bleed, develop a small blood clot where the needle goes into your skin, or faint.  Very rarely, your skin may get infected.  Another small but unlikely risk is the possibility of others finding out about your participation in 
this study.  
Benefits: You will not receive any direct benefit from your samples. Information 
obtained from the tests may provide useful information, to help other patients, about the 
causes, risks, and prevention of the COVID -19 virus.  
WHAT IF YOU DON’T WANT YOUR BLOOD FOR GENETIC TESTING STORED  ANY 
LONGER? If you sign the consent that your blood can be stored for research to be 
done at a later date you can change your mind at any time.  If you change your mind, 
you must write a letter to [insert the name [CONTACT_20632] ] at the [insert 
the name [CONTACT_475856]]  to let them know that you do not want your blood 
specimen collected for this study used for future research.  A sample letter will be given 
to you as a guide to help you express your request  in writing.  
When [insert the name [CONTACT_20632]]  receives your letter, the 
research staff will contact [CONTACT_475846].  A second copy of this consent will be given to you as proof that we received your request.  If we do not hear from you within [ADDRESS_610235] to

 H-1 Appendix H  Investigational Agent. 
 
This appendix w ill include the following information for each investigational agent studied. The 
rationale for studying the agent and the description and administration of the agent. Also, as 
appropriate, specific AEs observed to be possibly associated with the agent in question, and how to monitor for, clinically handle and report such AEs, should they arise. Changes in endpoint, SOC, inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, sample size estimation and approach to interim analyses and data analyses will also be inclu ded if appropriate for the investigation of 
the agent in question relative to what is stated in the master protocol. Finally, the text w ill also 
clarify whether the manufacturer of the investigational agent plans to pursue licensure in the countries where the trial will occur, should the investigational agent be demonstrated in the trial 
to have overall benefit. 
   Introduction/Rationale for studying the agent 
o Potential risks and benefits of agent 
o Motivation for agent selection with consideration of results from trials of other agents  
• Agent-specific eligibility criteria 
• Description of investigational agent 
o Administration and duration o Formulation and preparation o Supply, distribution, and accountability o Contraindicated medications o Precautionary medications 
• Clinical and l aboratory evaluations in addition to master protocol 
o Timing o Special instructions 
• Clinical man agement issues 
o Infusion-related reactions o Hypersensitivity 
• Pregnancy and breast-feeding considerations 
• Criteria for discontinuation of infusion 
• References

Version 3.0, [ADDRESS_610243] udies.   Dependin g on th e scientific 
questio
n, an e xperimenta l treatment will be co upled with o r compared t o a kn own effective 
treatment.  When such  known effective treatments ar e incorporat ed into both ar ms, they ar e 
called “backgroun d therapy”  or st andard of care (SOC).  In t his case, th e scientific question 
addressed is w hether a new t reatment added to an already  effective treatment i s superior  to 
the establish ed effective treatment al one.  
SOC m ay include general supportive care appropriate to the participant’s clinical status,  
and specific therapeutic agents,  and measures t o reduce risk  of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_610244] o f care ( SOC).  All participants will receive an investigationa l agent + 
SOC v s. placebo + SOC. 
Below, pr inciples for definin g SOC ar e provided, an d recommendations and guidance  on 
SOC ar e given. Whether an individual SOC t reatment i s provided by t he trial or not is base d 
on m ultiple factors,  including clinical and sci entific co nsiderations.  In some cases,  the 
decision to administer an SOC t reatment i s left entirely to the research participant’s primary 
medical t eam. 
I2. G uiding principl es for inclusi on of m easur es as part of SOC  
The SOC will be r egularly u pdated base d on r eview of the scientific l iteratur e and updated 
authoritativ e treatment gu idelines on this topic.  The standard for includin g one or m ore 
measures as SOC, includes a careful review of the existing literature and current 
guidelines (see Appendix D). As for therapeutic agents, those having been shown to be 
clinically effective in properly powered Phase III or Phase IV trials (i.e., high quality/level 1 
evidence) and with
 a reasonable safety profile will be considered by [CONTACT_475848], if rec
ommended by [CONTACT_475849]. This evaluation may 
also le ad 
to a statement that one or more agents are either not recommended or should 
not be used as part of SOC. As knowledge will likely continue to accumulate rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], the 
protocol leadership team may occasionally decide to include or exclude an intervention as 
part of SOC
 before it is recommended in at least one major treatment guideline. In such 
cases, the relevant literature that lead to the determination will be cited.

Therapeutics for Severely Ill Inpatients with COVID-19 (TESICO) Master Protocol  
Version 3.0, 08 March 2022  
I-2The use of a given SOC intervention may apply to all or to a subgroup of the participants in 
the master protocol based on available evidence – the subgroup may be defined based on severity of disease, a clinical or laboratory defined feature, or a clinically or laboratory defined contraindication for using the SOC treatment. An SOC agent may be mandated for participants (required for protocol entry); mandated where not contraindicated (participants may enter if that SOC is unsuitable, and not receive that SOC); or recommended subject to 
clinical discretion. SOC may be protocol-supplied where mandated.  
The master protocol acknowledges that there may be local variation in the clinical 
availability of one or more agents chosen to be part of mandated protocol-supplied SOC 
from site to site. While acknowledging risks of inadvertent coercion, the importance of the 
scientific question (how candidate agents perform against the background of the current 
SOC treatments) is a crucial, high-priority question. There is no possible way to answer the 
question of efficacy against the background of an already proven effective agent without 
providing the agent – if not readily available - within the trial.

patients.  It is an ticipat ed that t his master protocol m ay include a placebo- controlled 
investigation of remdesivir, p ossibly in a factoria l design, in t his p atient p opulation. Thus 
remdesi
vir is n ot co nsider ed SOC pr esently for this protocol: the protocol does n ot 
recommend r outine in itiation of remdesivir in this patient population (except potentially a s 
an investigational agent). For patients who have already i nitiated remdesivir by t he time of 
enrollment, this protocol m akes n o recommendation regardin g whether t o continue or 
discontinue remdesivir as part o f background therapy. (For p atients enrolling in a remdesivir 
randomization, see th e remdesivir appendix for f urther guidance  on receipt of r emdesivir 
prior t o randomization.) 
I3.2 Dexamethasone and Other Corticosteroids 
Based on the findings  of the RECOVERY trial,39 a meta-analysis of glucocorticoid trials,51 
and in line with
 NIH treatment guideline (Appendix D), it is recommended to consider 
initiation of corticosteroid t herapy i n participants with C OVID-[ADDRESS_610246] respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518]—the target population of t his m aster pr otocol. Corticosteroids m ay increase  the 
probab ility of reactivating la tent infections in cluding herpes viruses a nd tuberculosis,  
hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, secondary i nfections,  and may del ay clearance of SARS-
CoV
-2, bu t the balance  of evidence  favors gl ucocorticoid therapy. Treatment with a 
corti
costeroid is recommen ded for a total of 10 days,  using doses outlin ed in this table.

Study Design
In both the OSA and COPD Cohorts, this will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
2-period crossover study.  There will be [ADDRESS_300619] of the Screening Period and Baseline 
Period.  In the Randomization Phase subjects will be randomized i n treatment sequences A or B 
(OSA Cohort), or treatment sequences C or D (COPD Cohort) consisting of [ADDRESS_300620] 14 days, and a Follow -up Period 
of approximately 28days.  Approx imately 28days after the final study dose, there will be an end of 
study (EOS) Visit.
Prerandomization Phase: 
Screening Period
The Screening Period will begin no more than [ADDRESS_300621] of any screening procedures or assessments.  Subjects eligible for the COPD 
Cohort will then undergo screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_247150] 1 and Visit 2 (designated Visit 1A),

After at least 6 days of the initial Screening visit, (to allow subjects the opportunity to complete the 
sleep diary for at least 5 nights), subjects will return to the clinic for the second Screening Visit to 
undergo PSG.  For subjects being evaluated for the COPD Cohort, results of screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_247152].
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory.  
The mean habitual bedtime (MHB) will be calculated from the most recent [ADDRESS_300622]’s 
sleep diary.  This will be used to determine bedtime (“lights off”) . The PSG recording will begin at 
“lights off ”and will continue for 8 hours (until lights on).  The end of the 8 -hour PSG recording will 
be defined as waketime (“lights on”).  Subjects may leave the clinic after the investigator determines 
that it is safe for them to do so.
The PSG will be reviewed f or exclusion criteria related to OSA severity ( only mild for the OSA 
Cohort, and moderate to severe for the COPD Cohort), periodic limb movement disorder, and 
parasomnias.  The pulse oximetry recording will be reviewed for exclusion criteria related to oxy gen 
desaturation.
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will enter the Baseline Period.
Baseline Period
At the Baseline Period (1 day) eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic.  After completion of 
routine safety as sessments, inclu ding the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ),blood 
samples will be collected for the exploratory biomarker  analyses ,including potentially related to 
dementia , COPD, and OSA -related biomarkers and then subjects will enter the Randomization Pha se.  
Randomization Phase 
In the Randomization Phase subjects will be randomized in treatment sequences A or B (OSA 
Cohort), or treatment sequences C or D (COPD Cohort) consisting of 2 Treatment Periods, 8 nights 
duration each: lembor exant [ADDRESS_300623] 14 days.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adults ≥45 and <65 years, vs 
elderly ≥65 to 90 years).  A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized to ensure that, for e ach 
Cohort, 20 evaluable adult subjects and 10 evaluable elderly subjects complete the study.   Within 
each age stratum, subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio and 
enter Treatment Period 1.
Treatment Periods 1 and 2
Subjects will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory.  On Day 1, subjects will receive study drug 
immediately (within 5 minutes) before “lights off”.  The PSG recording will begin at “lights off” and 
will continue for 8 hours (until lights on).  The followi ng morning, a PK blood sample will be 
collected and vital signs assessed .  If SpO2 is <80% for ≥20% of TST during the first night of 
treatment, the subject must be early terminated. Continuing subjects will be provided with study 
medication to be administered for 6 consecutive nights at home and will be instructed to take the 
medication immediately (within 5 minutes) before bedtime and then subjects may lea ve the clinic 
after the inv estigator determines that it is safe for them to do so. 
On Day 5 (with a window of ±2 days to accommodate a weekend), the site will telephone the subject 
to assess adverse events (AEs) and record concomitant medications.  If any AE is clinically 
significa nt and requires follow -up, an Unscheduled Visit should be arranged as soon as possible.
Subjects will return to the clinic after 6 consecutive nights of administering study drug at home, 
subjects will return to the clinic and receive 8th  dose of study dru g at the sleep laboratory within 
5min before the lights off  and will remain overnig ht in the sleep laboratory.  A predose (trough) PK

After Treatment Period 1, there will be a washout interval of at leas t 14 days.  After the washout 
interval, subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment Period 2, which will follow the same schedule 
and procedures as did Treatment Period 1 , including re -review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and

from the clinic and enter the Follow -up Period.
At specified visits throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase, all subjects 
will undergo routine safety assessments, including 12 -lead ECG, physical examination, vital signs, 
weight, hematology, blood clinical chemistry analysis, urinalysis, reporting of AEs, and as sessment 
of suicidality.  At each clinic visit, subjects will also undergo a urine drug screen.
Follow -up Period
During the Follow -up Period (approximately 28days), subjects will not receive any treatment.  At the 
end of the Follow -up Period, subjects will return to the clinic for an EOS visit at which safety will be 
assessed. 
If subjects discontinue prematurely, they will undergo an Early Termination (ET) Visit and w ill then 
be followed for 28days, after which an EOS visit should be scheduled.
Number of Subjects
OSA Cohort : A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized in order to ensure that a total of 
30evaluable subjects complete the study (20 evaluable adult subjects [ ≥45 and <65 years] and 
10evaluable elderly subjects [ ≥65 to 90 years]).  Discontinued subjects may be replaced to ensure 
20adults and 10 elderly subjects complete both Treatment Periods. However, subjects who 
discontinue for a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR) cannot be replaced.
COPD Cohort : A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized in order to ensure that a total of 
30evaluable subjects complete the study (20 evaluable adult subjects ( ≥45 and <65 years) and

Trained PSG scorers will score PSG records in [ADDRESS_300631] criteria.  At 
Screening Visit 2, the PSG wil l be used to calculate AHI and PLMAI for evaluation of eligibility 
criteria.  Subsequent PSGs will be used to determine:
•AHI:  the number of apneas and hypopneas divided by [CONTACT_129003] (in minutes) and multiplied 
by 60 (min/hour) (ie, the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep), as 
defined by [CONTACT_247222] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_247169]/PD assessment)
•SpO2 level
•Desaturation: Decrease in the mean SpO2 of ≥3% (over the last 120 seconds) that lasts for at

Transmissive pulse oximetry is a noninvasiv e method for monitoring peripheral oxygen saturation 
(SpO2).  A sensor device is placed on a thin part of the subject’s body; in the present study, this will 
be a fingertip.  The device passes 2 wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector .  
This measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing determination of the 
absorbance caused by [CONTACT_247223], excluding venous blood, skin, bone, muscle ,
and fat.  The reading of oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_247224] (SaO2) from (invasive) analysis of arterial blood gas, but the two are
sufficiently correlated that pulse oximetry is valuable for measuring oxygen saturation in a clinical 
settin g, including in clinical trials.
Biomarker Assessments
Blood Biomarkers
Blood samples will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Assessment for the exploratory 
analyses of biomarkers potentially related to dementia , COPD, and OSA .
Pharmacogenomic Assessments
Not applicable 
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs; regular laboratory evaluation for 
hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and 
the perfo rmance of physical examinations.
C-SSRS
Suicidality will be assessed using the C -SSRS.  The C -SSRS assesses an individual’s degree of 
suicidality, including suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior .  
Bioanalytical Methods
Plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) will be measured using 
validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay method.

Analysis for the Primary Endpoint
OSA Cohort : Mean AHI will be analyzed on the PD analysis set using repeated measures analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA ), for Day [ADDRESS_300634] within sequence.  The 
following will be presented: Least square ( LS)means, difference in LS mean of lemborexant 10 mg 
compared to placebo, a 2-sided 90% CI (equivalent to a 1-sided upper 95% CI) for the true mean 
differ ence (lemborexant − placebo) in AHI.  If the upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI of the 
treatment difference of AHI is less than 5, this will provide evidence that the given dose of 
lemb orexant does not result in a clinically significant increase in AHI with moderate to severe OSA 
compared with placebo.   Further details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (revised per

Sample Size Rationale
OSA Cohort : A mean difference between treatments in AHI >5 is considered clinically meaningful
in studies of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_247170] ( Kryger , et al., 2007, Sun, et el., 2016).  
The within -subject variance is assumed to be 25.34 for AHI for adult subjects (Sun, et al., 2016) and 
30.41 for AHI for elderly subjects (where the elderly within -subject variance is estimated from adult 
data +20%, Mitterling, et al, 2015; Lee, et al, 2016).  Assuming the tr ue difference in AHI 
(lemborexant –placebo) on Day 8 is as high as 1.5, a total of 30 subjects completing the study 
(20adult, 10 elderly), provides 82% power that the upper bound of the 90% CI for the treatment

COPD Cohort :
A 2% decrease in mean SpO2 during TST is considered a clinically meaningful change.  For the 
primary hypothesis (mean SpO2 during TST on Day 8), assuming a true within subject variance of 
1.07% for mean SpO2, a total of 30 subjects completing the crossover study, and significance level 
alpha 0.05, there is 0.95 probabil ity that the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the 
true mean difference in mean SpO2 (LEM -placebo) on Day 8 would be greater than 2 percent points, 
if the true difference is 1 percent point.  The true difference could be as low as 1.23% and the study 
still would have had 80% power to support the hypothesis.

Lemborexant (LEM) (1R,2S) -2-{[(2,4 -dimethylpyrimidin-5- yl)oxy]methyl} -2-(3-
fluorophenyl) -N-(5-fluoropy ridin-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide), also known as E2006, is 
an orally -administered, novel compet itive dual orexin r eceptor antagoni st (DORA) that has 
been developed for the treatment of inso mnia and Irregular Sleep -Wake Rhyt hm Disorder 
(ISWRD).  
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a commo n sleep di sorder, characterized by  [CONTACT_247228]. Repetitive collapse of the airway leads to sleep fragmentation, hypoxemia,
hypercapnia, marked swings in intrathoracic pressure, and increased sympathet ic act ivity.  
Clinically, OSA is defined by [CONTACT_247229][INVESTIGATOR_008], loud snoring, witnessed apneas,
or awakenings due to gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_247171], in addit ion to at least 5 obstructive respi[INVESTIGATOR_247172] ( Epstein, et al., 2009 ). The frequency of apneas and hypopneic epi[INVESTIGATOR_247173] s leep is reported as an apnea hypopnea index ( AHI); this evaluat ion requires 
overnight polyso mnography (PSG). The International Classification o f Sleep Disorders 
(ICSD) ( American Academy o fSleep Medicine, 2014 ) defines the severit y of OSA 
according to the AHI: an AHI >5 to <15 is classed as mild, AHI ≥15 to <30 as moderate, 
and AHI ≥30 as severe.
Parti cularly relevant to the lemborexant program in inso mnia disorder is that OSA commonly 
coexists wi th insomnia; as many as 50% of subjects referred to a sleep clinic for sl eep apnea 
have inso mnia symptoms ( Krakow, et al., 2001). Also highly  relevant to the l emborexant 
programs in inso mnia disorder is the fact that the prevalence o f both OSA and inso mnia 
increases wit h increasing age. Regarding inso mnia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_247174] 50% of adults over the age of [ADDRESS_300656] som e form of chroni c sleep -related 
complaints ( Foley, et al ., 1995 ), which often manifest as complaint s of difficult y in falling 
asleep, and night -time awakenings ( Ford and Kamerow, 1989 ).
It has l ong been known that sleep is disturbed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmo nary 
disease (COPD). Insomnia is a comorbid condit ion in about 17% of patients with COPD. 
There are general concerns about administering sedative -hypn otics to pati ents wi th 
compromised respi[INVESTIGATOR_60324], since tradit ional sedat ive-hypnoti cs that bind to the

Lemborexant (LEM) is a novel competit ive dual orexin receptor antagonist that is approved
for the treatm ent of  insomnia by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA )and 
Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) andunder development for irregular 
sleep -wake rhy thm disorder.  The clinical development program established the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, and efficacy  (both short -and long -term) of LEM versus placebo in adult and 
elderly  subjects, including demonstration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_247180] y in healt hy volunteers and 
subjects wi th mild OSA (E2006 -A001 -102; Study 102).
7.[ADDRESS_300657] acebo -controlled, crossover study to ev aluate 
the respi [INVESTIGATOR_247180] y of LEM in adult and elderly  (≥65 to 90 y ears) healt hy subjects and 
adult and el derly  subjects wi th mild OSA.  In healthy adult and elderly subjects and subjects 
with mild OSA, com pared wi th placebo, LEM di d not decrease peripheral oxygen saturati on 
(SpO2) during total sleep time (TST) after a single dose of treatment, increase the proportion 
of subjects wi th at least 1 incident of desaturation (defined as SpO2 <90% for at least 
30seconds during TST compared to placebo, increas e the percentage of TST during which 
SpO2 was <90%; or increased the AHI after a single dose of treatment.  Study  102 concl uded 
LEM was well tolerated in healt hy adult and elderly subjects, as well as subjects with mild 
OSA.  The approved prescribing infor mation for LEM (Dayvigo®) states that: “In a study of 
patients w ith mild OSA ( AHI <15 events per hour of sleep), DAYVIGO did not increase the 
frequency of apneic events or cause oxygen desaturation. ”
7.3 Study Rationale
Per the DAYVIGO approval letter (20 Dec 2019) Eisai was tasked with specific 
Postmarket ing Requirements (PMR), including a request to conduct a randomized, 
doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled study  to eval uate the short -term respi [INVESTIGATOR_247180] y of LEM 
in subjects wi th moderate to severe OSA and in subjects wi th moderate to severe COPD
(PMR 3753 -1).  The fo llowing study  is proposed to fulfill this PMR .

Procedures/Assessments (Table 4).  
Subjects will be provided with study  medicati on to be administered for 6 consecut ive nights

bedtime.  Subjects will also be instructed on study restrict ions related to prohibited 
medicat ions/drugs, caffeine and alcoho l, and the prohibit ions regarding the use of continuous 
positive airway  pressure (CPAP) device or dental appliance.  If SpO2 <80% for ≥20% of 
TST during the first night of treatment, the subject must be early terminated. Subjects may  
leave the clinic after the invest igator determines that it is safe for them to do so. Subjects will 
be instructed to prompt ly contact [CONTACT_247233].

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
Dose Selection
The approved dose of LEM 10 mg was chosen based on the safet y and efficacy studies from 
the clinical development program.
Justification of the Endpoints
The primary  analysis in the OSA Cohort compares the mean AHI (assessed by  [CONTACT_63175]) on the 
final night of LEM dosing with the AHI on the final night of placebo dosing.  The AHI is the 
index by  [CONTACT_247234], i s used to categori ze the severit y of disea se, and is the 
standard primary endpo int in clinical studies of the safet y of drugs in patients with OSA; for 
example, this was used for LEM Study  102, suvorexant ( Sun, et al., 2016 ), ramelteon 
(Kryger, et al ., 2007 ),and eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] ( Rosenberg, et al., 2007 ).  Like the study  of 
suvorexant, Study  [ADDRESS_300662] reached steady  state.
The primary  analysis in the COPD Cohort compares mean SpO2 over total sleep time (TST) 
on the final night of LEM dosing with mean SpO2 during TST on the final night of placebo 
dosing.  Specifically , a 2% decrease in m ean SpO2 during TST is considered a clinically 
meaningful change.  SpO2 measures hypoxia, which can serve as a proxy  for hy pove ntilation 
during sleep ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_247186], 2014 ).  In the ramelteon study  of subjects wi th moderate to 
severe COPD ( Kryger, et al ., 2009 ), the mean SpO2 during TST at baseline was 92.6%, thus 
a 2% or greater decrease fro m 92% coul d resul t in hypoxia (SpO2 <90% ).  Of note, this was 
also used as the primary endpo int in the suvorexant study  (Sun, et al., 2015 ).
Justification of the sample size for the OSA cohort
In the suvorexant study , 26 subjects wi th mild to moderate OSA were studied; in Study  102, 
30subjects with mild OSA were evaluated.  This was acceptable to FDA and PMDA.  Thus, 
the proposed sample size for Study  113 OSA is 30 (Sun, et al., 2016 ).
Clinical Study  Protocol
Incorpo rating Amendment 01E2006 -A001 -113
Eisai
FINAL (V2.0):  [ADDRESS_300663] for studies of sleep agents (exclusio n of significant 
periodic limb mo vement di sorder or parasomnias; certain restrict ionson habitual bedt ime).  
Insomnia disorder is not specifically excluded unless subjects habitually sleep less than 
5.5hours.  The screening PSG will be key for inclusion, since subjects tend to sleep less well 
in a sleep l aboratory  than at hom e.  This is i mportant since the AHI tends to be higher during 
REM sl eep, which is m ore frequent during the second half of the night, the time when elderly  
poor sleepers tend to be awake.
Of note, CPAP and oral devices will be prohibited throughout the study .  The study requi res 
uncorrected values for AHI.  The pheno menon of “CPAP washout” has been reported, in 
which, fo llowing cessation of CPAP use, AHI increases gradually  over days or weeks 
(Vroegop, et al., 2015 ).  Al though the existence of this pheno menon is not univ ersally  
accepted, there is no doub t that day time sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_247187], and 
those patients with OSA will acco mmo date to the increased levels of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], but that 
takes time, and the duration varies among pat ients.  To avoid dosing wi th LEM (which m ay 
cause so mnolence during the day  in some subjects) against an unstable baseline of dayt ime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], Study  113 requi res that CPAP not be used fro m 2 weeks before the screening 
PSG until the end of the second treatment period.  This shoul d not i nterfere wi th the m edical  
care of OSA patients, or be a significant impediment to recruit ment; many pat ients do not 
tolerate CPAP, such that non -compliance rates are high, as stated above.  Further, the 
exclusio n criterion specifies that there must not be a requirement that subjects use CPAP 
during the study , thereby  [CONTACT_247235] a medical necessit y.  Whether 
subjects had been prescribed CPAP or other treatments for OSA in the past will be noted at 
Screening.
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for the COPD Cohort
The COPD cohort will include subjects with moderate to severe COPD and an AHI <15 
based on PSG.  A diagnosis o f mild OSA is permissible, as OSA is a co mmo n co-morbidity 
in patients with COPD, and high -level evidence for the be nefit of mild OSA treatment is 
sparse ( Gay, et al ., 2006 ).  Subjects will also be required to have a SpO2 during wakefulness 
greater than 90% (both supi[INVESTIGATOR_247188]), and a SpO2 during sleep ≥80% for at l east 75% of 
the recording period with no more than five cont inuous minutes less than 80% and with no 
SpO2 readings less than 70%.  These criteria are similar to the ramelteon study  in subjects 
with moderate to severe COPD ( Kryger, et al., 2009 ).  Subj ects who use continuous oxy gen 
therapy  (>16 hours per d ay) or who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator, the removal o f oxygen 
therapy  coul d affect the subject’s safet y or interfere wi th the study  assessments, are also 
excluded, which also aligns with prior respi[INVESTIGATOR_247180] y studi es in COPD.

Transmissive pulse oximetry  is a noninva sive method for monitoring SpO2.  A sensor device 
is placed on a thin part of the subject’s body; in the present study , this will be a fingertip.  
The device passes 2 wavelengths of light through the body  part to a photodetector.  This 
measures the changin g absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing determinat ion of the

withhol ding of study  drug, whether prescribed in the protocol o r not
All AEs observed during the study  will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the s tudy ICF through the l ast visit.  Subject who fail scre ening primarily due to 
AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposit ion 
CRF.  Seri ous AEs will be collected for [ADDRESS_300687] igator to re view the results of C-SSRS in all subjects and 
determine if any  resul t consti tutes an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether an iso lated suicidali ty rating scale response should be 
classified as an AE .  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].7 for a descript ion of the C -SSRS).
All AEs must be fo llowed for 28days after the subject’s last dose, or until reso lution, 
whichever comes first.  All serious adverse events ( SAEs )must be fo llowed to resol ution or,

AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definit ions are as fo llows:
Mild Discomf ort noti ced, but no disruption of normal daily  activi ty
Moderate Discomf ort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activi ty
Severe Incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to work or to perform normal daily  activity
The cri teria for assessing severit y are different than those used for seriousness ( see
Secti on9.[IP_ADDRESS] for the definit ion of an SAE).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
•Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent
•The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ionof study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
•Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
•The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event
•The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following questi on:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable

Clinical laboratory  tests during the study will be performed by  [CONTACT_42287] .  All bl ood 
and urine samples will be collected and sent to the central laboratory  on the day  of collection 
unless otherwise instructed.  In cases of a safet y concern, blood samples will be split (or
2samples drawn) to allow a local laboratory  analysis in addit ion to the central laboratory . 
Central laboratories will perform tests to qualify subjects for entry  into the study .  Laboratory  
certification as available will be included in the final clinical study  report for this study .
A laboratory  abnorm ality may meet the cri teria to qualify  as an AE as described in this 
protocol  (seeSecti on9.[IP_ADDRESS] ) and the CRF Co mplet ion Guidelines.  In these instances, the 
AE corresponding to the laboratory  abnorm ality will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF
(see Secti on [IP_ADDRESS].2 ).

Vital sign m easurements (i e, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] [per minute], body  temperature [in centigrade]), and weight (kg) 
will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4) by a 
validated m ethod.  Bl ood press ure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been 
sitting for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the same arm, 
preferably by  [CONTACT_3194].
When vital signs are to be obtained concurrently wit h PK or other blood samples, the v ital 
sign measurem ents will be performed before drawing blood samples in order to maximize the 
accuracy  of blood sam pling times while minimizing the potential effects of blood drawing on 
recordings obtained during safet y assessments.

OSA Cohort :
A mean difference between treatments in AHI >5 is considered clinically meaningful in 
studi es of  the respi [INVESTIGATOR_247201] ( Kryger, et al ., 2007 , Sun, et al.,
2016 ).  The within- subject variance is assumed to be 25.34 for AHI for adult subjects ( Sun, 
et al., 2016 ) and 30.41 for AHI for elderly subjects (where the elderly wit hin-subject variance 
is est imated from adult data +20%, Mitterling, et al, 2015 ; Lee, et al, 2016 ).  Assuming the 
true difference in AHI (lemborexant –placebo) on Day 8 is as high as 1.5, a total of 
30subjects complet ing the study (20 adult, 10 el derly ), provi des 82% power that the upper 
bound of the 90% CI for the treatment difference in AH I (lemborexant − placebo) on Day  8 
woul d be l ess than 5.

COPD Cohort :
A 2% decrease in mean SpO2 during TST is considered a clinically meaningful change.  For 
the primary  hypothesis (m ean SpO2 during TST on Day  8), assuming a true within subject 
variance of 1.07% for mean SpO2, a total of 30 subjects complet ing the crossover study, and 
significance l evel alpha 0.05, there is 0.95 probabilit y that the l ower bound of the 90% 
confidence interval for the true mean difference in mean SpO2 (LEM -placebo ) on Day  8 
woul d be greater than 2 percent points, if the true difference is 1 percent point.  The true 
difference could be as low as 1.23% and the study  still woul d have had 80% power to support

•Spi[INVESTIGATOR_247213] a regular basis
•Spi[INVESTIGATOR_247214] d produce hard copy  or have a digi tal display  of the expi[INVESTIGATOR_247215]
•The supervisor of the test nee ds training in optimal technique and qualit y performance
•Maximal pat ient effort in performing the test is required to avoid underestimat ion of 
values and hence errors in diagnosis and management 
Bronchodilat ion
•Possible dosage protocols are [ADDRESS_300722], 160 mcg short acting 
anticholinergic, or the two combined.  Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_247191] 1 Second (FEV 1) 
shoul d be measured [ADDRESS_300723] is given, or 30 to 
45minutes after a short acting ant icholinergi c or a combinat ion of both classes of 
drugs
Perform ance
•Spi[INVESTIGATOR_247216] d be perform ed using techniques that meet published standard
•The expi[INVESTIGATOR_47348]/time traces should be smooth and free from irregularit ies.  The 
pause between inspi[INVESTIGATOR_247217] d be <1 second
•The recording should go on long enough for a volume of plateau to be reached, which 
may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease
•Both forced vital capacit y (FVC) and FEV1 shoul d be the l argest value obtained fro m 
any of 3 technic ally satisfactory  curve and the FVC and FEV1 values in these 3 curves 
shoul d vary  by [INVESTIGATOR_8614] m ore than 5% or 150 m L, whichever is greater
•The FEV 1and FVC ratio should be taken fro m technically acceptable curve with the 
largest sum of FVC and FEV 1
Evaluat ion
•Spi[INVESTIGATOR_247218], height, sex ,and race
•The presence of postbronchodilator FEV 1/FVC<0.70 confirms the presence of airflow 
limitation

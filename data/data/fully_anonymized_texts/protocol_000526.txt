Various minor terminology updates 
throughout  Per Investigator feedback  the Altered 
Pancreaticobiliary Anatom y 
exclusion criterion was removed.  
Because Exalt is commercially 
available it can be used in patients 
with altered pancreaticobiliary 
anatomy  outside of this study, and 
this is not listed as a contraindication 
in the DFU. The intent of th is study  
is to eva luate the performance of 
Exalt Model D in ERCPs and other 
duodenoscope -based procedures.  
“Altered pancreaticobiliary anatomy” 
is not a contraindication for the use 
of Exalt in the approved DFU.  This 
exclusion criterion was originally 
included due to ques tions of how 
well Exalt would be able to navigate 
tortuous GI anatomy based on 
insertion shaft stiffness, however

In April -May 2019, 60 patients were prospectively enrolled in a consecutive ERCP case 
series using the Exalt ™ Model D Single -Use Duodenoscope.  The primary endpoint of this 
study was the ability to complete the ERCP or other duodenoscope -based procedure for the 
intended indication (s).  All 60 (100%)  ERCPs were completed, 58 (97%)  using the single -use 
duodenoscope only, and 2 (3%) with crossover to a reusable duodenoscope.  
2. Study Device Description  
The Exalt ™ Model D Single -Use Duodenoscope is a sterile, single -use endoscope that 
facilitates access to the duodenum, delivery of accessories, and live video when connected to 
an Exalt ™ Controller.  
The Exalt ™ Controller is an electronic device that:  
• Receives video signals from a [LOCATION_011] Scientific single -use endoscope,  
• Processes the video signals,  • Outputs video images to a video monitor, and  
• Outputs electrical signal(s) that interface with external image capture systems.  
The Controller also controls the light transmitted by [CONTACT_113630] -use endoscope to 
illuminate the area of interest within the anatomy. Buttons on the Controller’s front panel 
enable the user to control the brightness level of the light.  
To use the Controller, connect  it to a video monitor with a video cable and then connect a 
[LOCATION_011] Scientific single -use endoscope to the Controller. The Controller provides direct 
visualization during an endoscopic procedure.  
The Controller interfaces with external media capture equip ment via the Controller’s rear 
panel connectors. Image capture is initiated via a button on the [LOCATION_011] Scientific single -use 
endoscope. The Controller sends a signal to the video monitor notifying the user that an 
image capture has been initiated.  Directio ns for use for the Exalt ™ Model D Single -Use 
Duodenoscope  and Exalt ™ Controller  will be supplied separately to the investigational site 
in a regulatory binder. Investigators will use the device in accordance with the supplied directions and their institutional standard of care.

4. Investigator discretion  
 
6. Subject Accountability  
6.1. Point of Enrollment  
Subjects will be considered enrolled into the study at the time of the study- specific informed 
consent form (ICF) execution. Subjects who have signed informed consent but do not 
undergo the study procedure are considered screen failures. Screen failures will be recorded 
in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) by [CONTACT_113631].  
In the case it is determined that the subject failed to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria after the subject has agreed to participate in the study and has signed the informed consent, the study personnel will complete the Screening form and the End of Study form.  
6.2. Withdrawal  
Subjects will participate in the study voluntarily and may withdraw at any time without prejudice to further treatment. All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall be reported. If such withdrawal is due to problems related to  study device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject’s permis sion to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical study.   
 Applicable case report forms up to the point of subject withdrawal, including an End of 
Study form must be completed.  Unless the withdrawal is due to a Serious Adverse Event, additi onal subject data will not be collected after the point at which the subject has been 
withdrawn or withdraws consent from the study. Data collected up to the point of withdrawal may be used by [CONTACT_113632] . 
6.3. Lost to Follow -Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he/she fails to return for their scheduled 
follow -up visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_113633], at which point an End of Study form should be completed.   Before a 
participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last know n mailing address or local equivalent methods ).

  7.2.1. Strateg ies for Recruitment and Retention  
All patients under the care of a study investigator during the enrollment period of a  site will 
be considered for recruitment . 
7.3. Informed Consent  
Data collection and/or study procedure will not occur prior to the subject signing the ICF. 
Patients will be considered enrolled in the study once they sign the informed consent. Once a 
subject is considered enrolled in the study, baseline information may be obtained. 
7.4. Baseline  
Baseline information will include the following data points: age at time of consent, gender , 
and relevant medical history . 
7.5. Index Procedure  
During the i ndex procedure, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_113607]:  
start and stop times of procedure, scope information, whether certain types o f medicine were 
administered, and any activities completed or attempted during the procedure, regardless of original intent.  Any ensuing device events will be recorded and reported.  
After the ERCP procedure has been completed, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_113608] . 
7.6. 72 hour ( -1 day, + 2 days) and 30 day ( ± 3 days)  Assessments  
All enrolled s ubjects will be seen in person or evaluated via telephone to screen for any post -
procedure adverse events , and to evaluate the resolution of any previously noted adverse 
events  or sequelae, as applicable.  
7.7. Study Completion  
Subjects will be followed for 30 days ( ± 3 days) post index procedure. Subjects will continue 
to receive care from their doctor as they normal ly would. At study completion, an End of 
Study form will be completed, indicating whether the subject completed the study. If the last 
follow -up visit was not completed, the reason will be noted on the study completion form 
(e.g. subject withdrawn by [CONTACT_113634], subject withdrew consent, lost to follow -up, AE, 
death, etc.).  
7.8. Source Documents  
It is preferable that original source documents are maintained, when available. In lieu of original source documents, certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_113609].  A certified copy is 
a copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the original record that has been verified

9. Data Management  
9.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in  the Medidata Rave limited access se cure electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by [CONTACT_51580] . All changes 
made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review 
by [CONTACT_113635]. The associated R ave software and database have been 
designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of e lectronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_5760] (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature [CONTACT_113659] s 
of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_5732].  
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system for site response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving queries in the databa se. 
All access to the clinical database will be changed to “Read only” after all data is either “Hard Locked” or “Entry Locked”. Once acceptance of the final report or finalization of publications (as applicable) is received, final database storage and archiving activities can begin. Once all of the closeout activities are completed a request to IT is submitted to have the “Database Locked” or Decommissioned and all database access revoked.  
 
9.2. Data Retention

Please refer to the Instructions  for Use for an overview of anticipated (device) effects, and 
risks associated to the study device(s).  
15.2. Risks A ssociated with Partic ipation in the Clinical Study  
Risk associated with participation in the Clinical Study are similar to that of an ERCP with 
standard duodenoscope. Participation in the trial may be time consuming.  
15.3. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performing procedures in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365], adherence to subject selection  criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or fol low-ups and by [CONTACT_113646].  
15.4. Anticipated Benefits  
Recent literature has identified an outbreak with carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
(CRE).
3-[ADDRESS_126749] Duodenos cope, thereby [CONTACT_113647].    
15.5. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
Based on collected reports in literature to -date, the risk- to-benefit ratio is within reason for 
foreseeable risks. However, literature reports do not always capture all side effects. Observation and follow -up of patients is required as outlined in the protocol. 
16. Safety Reporting 
16.1. Reportable Events  by [CONTACT_113648] S ite to [LOCATION_011] Scientific  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to BSC any event which occurs in any of following categories:  
• All Non -Serious Adverse Events  
• All Serious Adverse Events  
• All Study Device Deficiencies

Page 28 of 40  
 
  • Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects/Un anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects  
• New findings/updates in rela tion to already reported events  
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms.  
If it is unclear whether or not  an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot 
be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency.  
Any reportable event , experienced by [CONTACT_113649] (as defined in study subject classification section), whether during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Underlying diseases  and chronic conditions  are not reported as AEs unless there is an 
increase in severity o r frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be 
recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of one (1) specific SAE (see 
Table 16- 1 for AE definitions).

- the event involves a body- site or an organ that cannot  be affected by [CONTACT_10398];  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_113651], when applicable;

met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
event.  
Possibly Related  
Ref:  MDCG 2020-
10/1 The relationship with the use of the study device or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are 
also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases w here relatedness cann ot be 
assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref:  MDCG 2020-
10/1 The relationship with the use of the  study  device  or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748],  
Causal Relationship  
Ref:  MDCG 2020-
10/1 The serious event is associated with the study device or comparator or with 
procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the  product category the device belongs to or 
of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with  study device use/application or 
procedures;  
- the event involves a body- site or organ that  
-the  study device or procedures are applied to;  
-the study device or procedures have an effect on;  
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known);  
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible);  
- other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clini cal condition 
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out; 
- harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
- the event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_113652], 
when applicable;  
- In or der to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met 
at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.

  [LOCATION_011] Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the 
investigative site’s IRB/EC/REB . Any modification requires acceptance from BSC prior to 
use of the form. The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have  IRB/EC/REB  approval prior to their use. Privacy language shall be included 
in the body of the form or as a separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall  at a minimum include the following steps, 
as well as any other steps required by [CONTACT_5751], rules, regulations and guidelines : 
• be conducted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_5704],  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s 
decisio n to participate throughout the clinical study, 
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate,  
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her  
legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the clinical study.
  
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_113654], rules, regulations and guidelines and by 
[CONTACT_1755]/ or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed 
consent process. I f a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed 
consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_5753] a copy of the signed and dated document  and any 
other written information must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by [CONTACT_113655] (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working da ys of 
learning of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC /REB ), as 
appropriate.  
If new information becomes available that can significantly a ffect a subject's future health 
and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or following annual review by [CONTACT_1201]/EC /REB . The new version of the ICF must be approved 
by [CONTACT_1201]/EC /REB . Acceptance by [CONTACT_113656]/Template 92120219_Rev/Ver G

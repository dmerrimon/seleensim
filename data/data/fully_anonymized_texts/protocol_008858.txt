(Amendment 3) 09-Apr-2019 1. Up to 3 additional cohorts may be added to 
Part 1 of the study. Cohort 1- 4 will proceed 
with a dose of HM15211 of 0.06 mg/kg body 
weight. 
Based on prediction from PK data for the second 
cohort, geometric mean weekly AUC 0-t will not 
exceed PK exposure limit determined in 
toxicology studies. Therefore, this protocol will 
be amended to enroll up to 3 additional cohorts 
to increase the dose of the study drug in 
increments. The increments will be determined 
at dose escalation meetings, up to a maximum of 
0.12 mg/kg. Cohort 1-4 will proceed with a dose 
of 0.06 mg/kg

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 Summary of 
Study Design  
 The study includes a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multiple -ascending dose study to investigate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of SC administration of HM15211  in 
approximately up to 72 (n=12/cohort) obese subjects with 
NAFLD .  
To assess the effect of multiple SC doses of HM15211 in obese 
subjects  on: 
1. Change in % liver fat, assessed by [CONTACT_9268]- PDFF in obese 
subjects with pre- existing % liver fat >10% (determined by 
[CONTACT_9268]-PDFF). 
The study will be conducted in up to 6 dosing cohorts that might 
partially overlap, enrolling 12  subjects per cohort. Subjects will be 
randomized to HM15211  or placebo in a ratio of 3:1 (9 on active, 
3 on placebo). 
Dose e scalation to the next dose will proceed based on safety and 
tolerability and available PK data . After 2- [ADDRESS_452977] 3/4 (n=9) active participating subjects of previous dose, 
safety and available blinded PK/PD data will be reviewed to 
decide on beginning the next cohort. If dose escalation is stopped, 
dose de -escalation may occur in additional cohorts, to further 
refine clinically relevant dose levels . 
Screening:  
A Screening Visit will be performed up to [ADDRESS_452978] 
dosing to identify subjects for the study.  All screening evaluations 
except MRI -PDFF will be performed.  
Only  eligible subjects will undergo an MRI-PDFF for the 
assessment of liver fat within 30 days of randomization. Subjects 
who meet the inclusion criteria of >10% liver fat will proceed with 
the study and will be invited for the In -house Period 1. 
For subjects in cohort 1-5 and up: Only eligible subjects will 
undergo an MRI/MRI-PDFF for the assessment of liver fat and 
visceral fat within 30 days of randomization. Subjects who meet 
the inclusion criteria of >10% liver fat will proceed with the study 
and will be invited for  the In-house Period 1. 
In-house Period 1: 
Day -2: Subjects will check in to the clinic in the morning on Day 
-2 for a 10-day In- house Period. They will receive standardized 
meals throughout their inpatient stay. Subjects will be connected 
to an ABPM system, and overnight measurements will be taken to 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd

Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 familiarize the subjects with the device. ABPM measurements will 
continue throughout Day 5. Only 24- hour monitoring data from 
Day -1 will be used for the baseline monitoring evaluation. 
Day -1: In the morning, subjects will be connected to a Holter 
ECG for 24 -hour measurements and will continue these until Day 
5. Only 24 -hour monitoring data from Day - 1 will be used for the 
baseline monitoring evaluation.  
Subjects will be randomized to a weekly SC injection of 
HM15211 or placebo.  
Day 1:  The active study drug or placebo, will be administered in 
the morning at approximately 08:00 h ours (t=0), SC into the 
abdominal wall  by [CONTACT_114007]. Measurements of vital 
signs, sampling for PK at pre-dose and 8 hours after dosing, and 
pre-dose sampling for laboratory parameters including 
incretins/metabolic hormones, lipid profiles and  particles, amino 
acid panel, inflammatory marker, glucose metabolism parameters, 
ketone bodies and evaluations for safety parameters will be

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 4.0 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background 
Excess weight has become an epi[INVESTIGATOR_363637] 1.9 
billion adults, of whom 650 million are obese, defined by a. BMI of ≥  30kg/m2. This 
represents about 13% of the world ’s adult population.1 
Obesity impacts many organ systems. One affected system is the cardiovascular system, 
with an increased prevalence of heart failure, hypertension and coronary heart disease. 
Obstructive sleep apnea and asthma are also common in the obese. Non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is on the rise 
and may soon become the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma globally. Psychosocial and psychiatric consequences of obesity are also increasing.
[ADDRESS_452989] been developed that co-target the glucagon and glucagon like peptide  
(GLP-1) receptors for obesity treatment.[ADDRESS_452990] added 
a gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) agonist to the combination, are under 
development in early phase clinical studies. 
HM15211 is a novel long-acting triple incretin agonist. It is a chemical conjugate of a 
chimeric peptide (GLP-1/Glucagon/GIP triple agonist; named TA15211) and human 
immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment (named HMC001) linked via a bifunctional Maleimide-Polyethylene glycol- Aldehyde (MAL-PEG-ALD) linker molecule.  
TA15211 is produced by [CONTACT_363662]15211 is controlled by 
[CONTACT_363663]-house specification. The HMC001 moiety was derived from the 
constant region of human immunoglobulin G4 fragment and produced in the transformed 
E. coli as an inclusion body. The inclusion body was purified after successive refolding 
and purification steps, and the quality of HMC001 was controlled by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-house 
specification. Human immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment (HMC001) was chosen as the 
stabilizing agent because it is the most prevalent blood protein and has an in vivo half-life 
of several weeks without effector functions including antibody dependent cellular toxicity 
(ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The linker is a 10 kDa 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) with bifunctional reactive groups (maleimide aldehyde 
reactive groups at individual ends, MAL-PEG-ALD). The conjugation of TA15211 and 
HMC001 is carried out through the formation of a thioether and amine bond between 
hetero-bifunctional MAL-PEG-ALD, Cys40 in TA15211, and the N-terminal amino acid in HMC001. 
HM15211 is a long-acting GLP-1/Glucagon/GIP triple agonist with an extended half-life 
through reduced renal clearance and possibly by [CONTACT_363664]. HM15211 showed triple-agonistic properties with potent glucagon activity in addition to balanced GLP-1 and GIP activity.  
According to series of in vivo pharmacologic studies, HM15211 can be an attractive 
treatment option for obese patients based on its potent body weight loss efficacy from 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 32 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 energy intake inhibition and energy expenditure enhancement. Glucagon activity 
provides potent body weight loss primarily from fat mass reduction as shown in efficacy 
studies in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Furthermore, GLP-1/GIP activities negate a 
possible hyperglycemic risk as demonstrated in intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) studies in normal and DIO mice.  
Above all, liver preferential distribution, and subsequent hepatic lipid metabolism 
improvement, renders HM15211 a suitable therapeutic option for NASH and hepatic 
fibrosis. Therefore, HM15211 is expected to have favorable therapeutic profiles in both obesity and NASH as well as convenience in its weekly clinical dosing regimen. 
For further informati on please refer to the Investigator’s brochure (IB).  
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study 
The aim of this multiple ascending dose study is to investigate safety and tolerability of 
the drug as well as the PK and PD profiles in obese subjects with NAFLD. Up to 6 
cohorts in obese subjects with NAFLD will compare HM15211 to placebo.  
Adverse effects observed in the ongoing single ascending dose study (HM-TRIA-101), 
include so far GI events of nausea and vomiting. The management of any cardiac event, 
dermatitis, cholelithiasis and GI events will follow a specific adverse event management 
plan as provided in section 17.0. 
Based on the pre-clinical data and the conducted single ascending dose study (HM-TRIA-
101), the intended potential target populations will ensure that a robust and relevant set of safety, PK and PD data can be generated. 
4.3 Summary of Pre-Clinical/Clinical Studies 
In vitro activity of HM15211 was evaluated using respective receptors, human GLP-1 
receptor (hGLP-1R), human glucagon receptor (hGlucagonR), and human GIP receptor 
(hGIPR). HM15211 showed dose-dependent activation of all three receptors with potent 
glucagon activity in addition to balanced GLP-[ADDRESS_452991] avoiding hyperglycemic risk.  
Further in vitro studies confirmed that since HM15211 includes an aglycosylated Fc 
moiety derived from human IgG4, there are minimal immune-mediated effector 
functions. In addition, due to Fc moiety, HM15211 retained pH-dependent FcRn binding 
property, which is essential for vascular endothelial recycling. 
In vivo pharmacology studies using obese mice showed that HM15211 enables potent 
body weight loss from both food intake inhibition and enhanced energy expenditure. The 
body weight loss was mainly from fat mass reduction, along with lowered serum lipid 
profile. Glucagon action increased energy expenditure and thus enhanced body weight 
loss; hyperglycemic risk by [CONTACT_363665]-1/GIP. 
In NASH-induced models, HM15211 effectively reduced hepatic triglycerides (TG), 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_452992] was observed in the safety pharmacology studies and in vitro human 
ether-a go-go related gene (hERG) channel assay.  
In pharmacokinetic studies, HM15211 exhibited a prolonged half-life (t½) after 
subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) dosing, which ranged from approximately 42.[ADDRESS_452993]. HM15211 is preferentially distributed in the 
liver, making HM15211 a favorable treatment option for dysfunction in lipid metabolism 
specifically in the liver. 
The toxicity studies of HM15211, repeat dose toxicity up to 4 weeks in rats and monkeys, 
and in vitro genotoxicity studies, were conducted. Local tolerance of HM15211 was 
investigated in 4-week repeated rat and monkey studies. Additional studies were 
conducted with HMC001 (inactive ingredient) in rat and monkey up to [ADDRESS_452994] GI adverse events were mild in severity; no cardiac or drug-related dermatologic 
adverse events have been noted up to this point. 
4.4 Rationale for Starting and Maximum Dose 
Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg were evaluated in the single dose HM-TRIA-101 study. The 
steady state weekly AUC (AUC
168SS) after multiple dosing can be approximated to the 
AUC inf after single dosing.  From the HM-TRIA-101 study, the maximum AUC inf after 
single dosing in the 0.12 mg/kg group was 126,281 ng*h/mL. In the 13 week rat 
toxicology study, the AUC 168 exposure during the 13th week was 297,000 ng*h/mL at the 
rat NOAEL dose of 0.4 mg/kg. At the highest proposed dose in this study, the ratio would 
be (297,000/126,281) = 2.4  
Moreover, clinical issues including skin lesions, gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea 
and vomiting) and an elevation in fasting plasma glucose are known to occur as

clinical signs and symptoms are easily monitored, and are reversible. 
4.5 Dose Escalation Algorithm 
The proposed dose escalation algorithm may include the following steps: 
Table 4-1 Treatment Allocation and Dose Escalation (NAFLD) 
Cohorts Number of Subjects Treatment Period 
Cohort 1 -1 N=9 HM15211 0.01 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -2 N=9 HM15211 0.02 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -3 N=9 HM15211 0.04 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -4 N=9 HM15211 0.06 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -5 N=9 HM15211 X mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -6 N=9 HM15211 0.12 mg/kg 
N=[ADDRESS_452995] will be randomized to HM [ZIP_CODE] or placebo according to the table above. 
The dose for the weekly dosing in cohort 1-1 will be 0.01 mg/kg, based on the body 
weight measured prior to the first dosing on Day -1. For dose calculation and rounding, 
please refer to the Operations Manual/Pharmacy Manual. 
After at least ¾ (n=9) of the subjects participating in one cohort have completed 2-4 
weeks of treatment (2 weeks of treatment is reached at Visit week 3), an interim data 
review meeting will be held which may include a dose escalation decision. Safety and 
available blinded PK and/or PD data will be reviewed, and predictions based on results 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 35 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 from the previous study and PK/PD data modelling will be used for a dose decision/ dose 
escalation decision for the subsequent cohort. The dose decision will be made by [CONTACT_429], medical monitor and the coordinating Principal Investigator. Dose escalation 
will not exceed a 2-fold increase. If there are no safety concerns, the next cohort may 
start and may partially overlap with the previous one. An additional data review meeting  
may be held at the end of the completed cohort.  The maximum dose for cohort 1-3 will not exceed 0.04 mg/kg. The dose for cohort 1-4 will be 0.06 mg/kg. The maximum dose 
for the study will not exceed 0.12 mg/kg. 
Following the dose escalation decision, the procedures for the subsequent cohorts will be 
identical to those described above. Therefore, all cohorts could be performed in parallel.   
The blind of the study will be maintained throughout. If dose escalation is stopped, dose 
de-escalation may occur for additional cohorts, to further refine the dose. 
Figure 4-1 Dose Escalation Schematic 
 
Optional adjustments 
Optional adjustments to the number of cohorts: If the first 3 cohorts do not provide sufficient data for the dose selection, optional cohorts 
may be added. The optional cohorts may proceed with a higher dose or a lower dose. If 
deemed appropriate, another cohort with the repetition of the same dose may be 
conducted. 
Optional adjustments to the study visits and sampling schedule: 
Depending on the safety and tolerability and/or on available PK/PD results of the first 
cohorts, additional study visits might be performed, or existing visit schedule or PK/PD sampling schedule may be adjusted/rescheduled for following cohorts.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 8.4 Dose Regimen 
The IPs, HM15211 or placebo will be administered after an ≥ [ADDRESS_453015], by 
[CONTACT_363676]. The products will be administered weekly 
by [CONTACT_20607] a lifted skin fold of the abdominal wall. The injection needle should 
be placed at a 45° to 90° angle and kept in the skin fold for 5-10 seconds. Aim is to dose 
at approximately the same clock time (eg, at approximately 08:00 h) for all subjects. The 
actual clock time of dosing is defined as t=0. The actual time of each dosing will be 
recorded in the source documents and on the eCRFs.  
Subjects who miss a dose by > [ADDRESS_453016] was 
symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic and whether the event accidental or intentional. 
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing Case Report Form. If the subject takes a 
dose of IP that exceeds protocol specifications and the subject is symptomatic, then the 
symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported.  
Should an overdose occur, the Investigator or designee should contact [CONTACT_45814] [ADDRESS_453017] randomization number via an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). The system will randomize in a 3:[ADDRESS_453018] completed the study 
(or until [ADDRESS_453019] completed the study). 
If a subject fails to start dosing, or if a subject can’t be randomized, the reason will be 
entered into the screening disposition page. The IWRS must be notified within [ADDRESS_453020] code can be broken by [CONTACT_1275], preferably after consultation with the medical monitor. Emergency code 
breaks can be performed using the IWRS, see section 8.7.  
As the study is single-blind, subjects and the clinical staff caring for the subjects are 
blinded to treatment. Staff involved in the data management, statistical analyses and staff 
from Pharmaceutical Services who are responsible for preparing the IP, will be 
unblinded. Unblinded staff will not be involved in the subjects’ care.

The Investigator will keep a Subject Screening and Enrollment Log at the investigational 
site. Subjects who have screen failed due to laboratory abnormalities may be allowed to 
re-screen once at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects who have screen failed due 
to out of window may be rescreened with CRO approval. A new screening number will be assigned. 
If subjects are fasting (only water for ≥10 hours), all screening laboratory assessments 
may be done on the same day. If subjects are not fasting, they will be invited to return for 
a second screening visit to complete any missing screening procedures. 
Subjects screening lab parameter and VCTE (CAP) will be evaluated to identify subjects 
who are likely to have a liver fat content of > 10% at MRI-PDFF. Depending on the 
outcome/results of these values, the subjects will proceed to MRI/MRI-PDFF or not. For 
further details on parameters and outcome for the determination to proceed to MRI-PDFF 
see the Operations Manual.

occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy) or post-
menopausal for >12 months. If females’ sterility or postmenopausal status is confirmed, 
no pregnancy testing is required during the study. The site will make an effort to retrieve medical records to document the sterility, however, the absence of records will not 
exclude the subject. In case that medical records cannot be obtained, serum pregnancy 
testing will be conducted at Screening, and urine pregnancy testing will be conducted 
throughout the study. Postmenopausal status will be confirmed through testing of FSH 
levels outside the normal range (as specified by [CONTACT_363679]) at screening for 
amenorrheic female subjects < [ADDRESS_453031] use highly effective contraceptive 
methods. Highly effective contraceptive methods are considered those with failure rate 
less than 1% undesired pregnancies per year, including hormonal intrauterine devices 
(coil), oral hormonal contraceptives, sexual abstinence, or a surgically sterilized partner. 
Oral hormonal contraceptives have to be taken at least [ADDRESS_453032] Follow-up Visit.  
During the course of the study, regular serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 
pregnancy tests will be performed for sterilized women, when medical records are not 
available. In addition to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at Screening, subjects also 
must have a negative urine hCG pregnancy test at check-in to in-house periods. 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_453033] be surgically sterile (at least 1-year post vasectomy), abstinent or if engaged 
in sexual relations of child-bearing potential, the subject and his partner must be using an 
acceptable contraceptive method from screening and for a period of [ADDRESS_453034] 
Follow-up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception are the use of condoms together 
with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. In addition, they must be advised not 
to donate sperm during this period. Male subjects must also encourage their female 
partner to use effective contraception. Effective contraceptive for the female partner 
includes surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], 
bilateral oophorectomy), hormonal contraception, intrauterine contraception/device, or 
barrier methods (female condom, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap) together with 
spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ suppository. The adequacy of other methods of 
contraception will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_079]. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_453035]’s responsibility.  
All reported pregnancies will be followed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy and 
pregnancy follow-up forms. The outcome, including any premature termination, will be 
reported to the Sponsor. An evaluation after the birth of the child may also be conducted. 
Pregnancy complications must be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious adverse event. 
9.1.11  ECG Procedure
  
All ECG’s throughout this study will be performed as standard triplicate 12-lead ECG ’s, 
except the ECG at Screening. ECG’s will be recorded after 5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. Only the Triplicate ECG’s  will be recorded at least 1 minute apart from each 
other, not exceeding a time period of 5 minutes for the completion of all three ECG’s.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 64 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 The Investigator (or designee) will interpret the ECG’s by [CONTACT_352428]: within normal limits, abnormal but not 
clinically significant, or abnormal with clinical significance. ECG’s are performed 
according to the Table 16-1. The following parameters will be recorded from the 
subject’s ECG trace: heart rate, QT interval, PR interval, QRS interval, R -R interval, and 
QTcF (corrected) using the Fridericia correction (QTcF = QT ÷ cube root of the R-R 
interval [where R-R is the duration of the entire cardiac cycle]). 
When ECGs are to be collected at the same time point as a blood collection, ECGs should 
be collected first to avoid any artificially increased heart rates due to the blood collection. 
The mean value of the [ADDRESS_453036]’s baseline for all post -dose comparisons. ECG measurements are to be 
collected during screening and on Day -2 and 77 before subjects are connected to the 
ABPM device. Additionally, ECG measurements are taken on Day 5 and Day 82, after 
ambulatory devices (Holter and ABPM) are removed. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs. If a machine-read QTc 
value is prolonged, repeat measurements may not be necessary if the Investigator’s interpretation determines that the QTc value is in the acceptable range. 
9.1.12  Check-in Procedure 
All subjects will check in to the clinic in the morning for the In-house Periods 1 and 2. 
Eligibility will be confirmed, and the following will be assessed: 
1. Positive alcohol breath test. 
2. Positive urine drug screen. 
3. Positive urine pregnancy test for WOCBP.  
4. Any use of prescription or non-prescription medicine other than the allowed 
concomitant medications within the last 12 hours. 
5. Any medical condition that could interfere with glucose metabolism, as judged by [CONTACT_3786]. 
Subjects who fulfill one or more of the stated criteria at check –in, will not be able to 
continue onto the treatment period. The treatment period will be rescheduled. Each 
treatment period may be rescheduled no more than twice. After that, the subject will be 
excluded from the study. Replacement of subjects for the dosing period may be permitted 
to enroll sufficient subjects into the study after discussion with Sponsor and Investigator. 
9.1.13  Standardized Meals 
During in-house period, subjects will receive standardized meals. The standardized 
weight maintaining meals will be provided using estimated BMR× activity factor of 1.[ADDRESS_453037]-dose assessment period will start in the morning of Day 1. Measurements will 
be taken hourly up to 14 hours and then 2-hourly until 24 hours every day (for every 24-hour period), until the morning of Day 5.  
Additionally, subjects will be connected to the ABPM system again on Day 77. Blood 
pressure measurements will be started overnight on Day [ADDRESS_453038]-dose assessment period will start in the morning of Day 78. Measurements will 
be taken hourly up to 14 hours and then 2-hourly until 24 hours every day (for every 24-
hour period), until the morning of Day 82. 
Time points stated in the Table 16-[ADDRESS_453039], after determination of the patient’s non -dominant arm circumference. Subject’s 
bedtime and awakening will be recorded to divide the downloaded data into diurnal and 
nocturnal values. Depending on available PK and safety data, timepoints for 
measurements may be adjusted for the following cohorts. 
Specifications about the ABPM model will be described in the Operations Manual and 
ABPM Procedure Manual, as well as detailed instructions of blood pressure frequency, 
data management and medical review.  
9.1.15  Holter Monitoring 
24-hour heart rate activity will be continuously recorded with an ambulatory Holter 
monitoring system (eg, Mortara surveyor). Holter electrodes (12 lead, 3-channel 
placement) will be placed to the subject’s chest and will be attached to a small recording 
monitor. The Holter monitor will be carried in a pocket or small pouch. Subject’s 
activities or exercises will be recorded while wearing the monitor. 
Specifications about the Holter model will be described in the Operations Manual and 
Holter Procedure Manual, as well as detailed instructions of data management and medical review.

Blood for PK analysis of the study drugs will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the Table 16-1 Schedule of Events and follow the PK sampling schedule Table 9-3 . One 
2-mL sample per scheduled time point will be collected to provide a minimum of 500 μL 
of serum for PK measurements and 500 μL of serum as a secondary back-up sample. 
Instructions for sample processing and shipment will be provided in the PK Sample and 
Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_335]. Pre-dose sampling will be taken within 10 minutes before dosing. 
Dosing should occur at approximately 08:00 h on every dosing day. The actual time of 
PK sampling should not deviate from the nominal time by [CONTACT_726] ± 5 minutes during 
the Inpatient Period, and by [CONTACT_726] ± 2 days for the Elimination Period and Follow-up 
Visit. If Visit during elimination period or follow-up visits will be performed on a 
different day, the time point for the sampling will still be in the morning, preferably at the 
same time (at approximately 08:00h). The actual time of dosing, actual sampling dates 
and times should be recorded.

Magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) deems as a 
noninvasive, quantitative, and accurate measure of liver fat content/ hepatic steatosis 
grade in this study to identify the study population and assess the treatment response in 
subjects with NAFLD. For subjects in cohort 1-5 and up, the assessment of visceral fat 
will also be assessed via MRI imaging at Screening, during week 8 and week 12, together with the MRI-PDFF assessment. 
MRI-PDFF will be performed using a standardized imaging acquisition calibration 
protocol and the results a will be determined by [CONTACT_363680] (as baseline 
value) and during week 8 (close to Day 57 as possible, but prior to dosing on Day 57), 
and week 12 (close to Day 85 as possible, but after ABPM and Holter are disconnected 
on Day 82; but prior to the PK sampling on Day 85). 
For details please see the Operations Manual. 
9.1.19  VCTE 
One-dimensional vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) assessed via eg, 
FibroScan (EchoSens
™, Paris, [LOCATION_009]) will be used in this study. 
At Screening, subjects will be examined with the FibroScan to assess the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in order to qualify for the inclusion in the study. 
For subjects participating in cohort 1-4 and up, FibroScan assessments will be performed 
on Day 85 to assess a change from baseline in CAP and LSM. 
It is a device, that uses non-invasive, one-dimensional vibration controlled transient 
elastography (VCTE). The device generates a low-frequency shear wave from a probe 
applied to the subject’s  skin between the ribs. The speed of the wave spread is then 
measured between two points within the liver to allow the livers stiffness to be

exposure)  
For the irritation assessment, all irritation events will be documented as AEs. The 
diameter of the affected area will be measured with a paper measuring tape in centimeter 
(cm) and the condition of the injection site will be recorded. Digital photography will be 
used to document all positive injection site reactions. In case of clinically significant 
injection site reactions, subjects may undergo a dermatological consultation and/or 
cutaneous biopsies for further histological examination of the injection site reaction. 
Biopsies will be performed using a 4-mm punch biopsy centered on the injection site. 
The biopsy area will be anesthetized with lidocaine prior to the biopsy. Wound closure 
will be performed with Steristrips. If stitches are necessary to close the punch area, they 
will be removed approximately 2 weeks later. The time between injection and biopsy will 
be recorded. Microscopic and histological examination of the punch biopsies will be 
performed at a qualified lab.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any undesirable and unintended medical event occurring to a subject in a 
clinical study, whether or not related to the study products. This includes events from the 
first study related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post 
treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be 
recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening: 
• Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned 
has worsened from the first study related activity after the subject has signed the 
informed consent 
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures 
• Pre-existing events that has not worsened in intensity or frequency from baseline 
10.1.2  Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) 
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any clinically significant event not 
present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in either 
intensity or frequency after exposure to study drug. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_453047] (AESI) 
AEs of special interest (AESI) are selected, non-serious adverse events. They will be 
reported to the sponsor within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, using SAE report 
form.   
AESIs in this study include the following: 
x Necrolytic migratory erythema 
x Cholelithiasis 
x Pancreatitis 
10.1.4  Clinical Laboratory Event 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that suggests 
a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management, 
(i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of study product, more frequent follow-up, or diagnostic investigation). 
A laboratory re-test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value is not considered 
an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, 
evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention. 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 72 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 10.1.5  Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the 
drug caused the event. 
10.1.6  Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction is defined as a subset of any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND 
safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lower degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
Reasonable possibility is given if: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure 
• One or more occurrences of an event, that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group. 
10.1.7  Unexpected Adverse Event/ Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that is not listed in the Investigator Brochure, as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation, or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
10.1.8  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/ Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening. 
x The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 73 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
5. Leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6. Is an important medical event that satisfies any of the following: 
x May require intervention to prevent items [ADDRESS_453048] to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
10.1.9  Life-Threatening Adverse Event/Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction 
A life-threatening AE/life-threatening suspected adverse reaction, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, places the patient or suspect at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
The determination of whether an AE is life threatening can be based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58901]. If either, the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event is 
serious or life threatening, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_363682] (21 CFR 312.32(a) and 312.32(c)(1)). 
10.2 Severity of AEs 
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows: 
Mild: The event is transient, easily tolerated by [CONTACT_363683]’s daily activities . 
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s 
usual daily activities. 
Severe: The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with 
the subject’s usual activities.  
10.3 Relationship to Study Treatment 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug(s) will be assessed by [CONTACT_97728]-Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions: 
1= Related : 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., 
disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). 
 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the investigational product 
administration and represents a known reaction to the drug under study or other drugs in 
its class or is predicted by [CONTACT_363684]. 
 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_453049] and/or recurs with 
rechallenge, if applicable. 
 
If a relationship to an AE is not assessable, it should be recorded as Related. 
 
2 = Not Related : 
The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from investigational product 
administration or can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other 
factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
10.4 Procedures 
10.4.1  Collection and Recording of AEs 
Collection of all AEs (serious AEs and non-serious AEs) will commence from the time 
the subject signs the informed consent to participate in the study until the post-treatment 
follow-up visit. Throughout the in-house treatment period and outpatient visits, the 
Investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. In order to avoid bias 
in eliciting AEs, a non-specific question, such as “How have you been feeling since your 
last visit?” may be asked. Subjects may repo rt AEs occurring at any other time during the 
study. 
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study 
medication or not, must be monitored and given appropriate medical treatment at the 
discretion and judgement of the Investigator until the symptoms subside and any 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is 
a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. All AEs will be documented in the 
AE page of the CRF, whether or not the Investigator concludes that the event is related to 
the drug treatment. The event term, start and stop dates, severity, action taken with study 
drug and outcome, will be documented, along with the Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_363646].  
10.4.2  Collection and Reporting of SAEs and AESIs 
When an SAE and AESI occur, it should be reported according to the following 
procedure: 
An SAE form must be completed immediately or within [ADDRESS_453050] identification numb er, Investigator’s name, name [CONTACT_363699] a causality assessment. 
In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs 
and AESIs (regardless of their relationship to study drug) should be reported to the 
Sponsor or a designated qualified vendor within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first 
knowledge of the  event.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_453051]’s follow -up period. An Initial Serious Adverse 
Event Form should be completed, and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor or 
designated qualified vendor. 
All serious and unexpected adverse event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR 312.32 for 
IND drugs and 21 CFR 314.80 for marketed drugs (15-day alerts). The Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) and all Investigators will be notified of the alert reports per FDA 
regulations. 
10.[ADDRESS_453052] the subjects.  
In case any drug related AEs occur, they will be managed according to the AE guidance 
document in section 17.0. 
Procedure related AEs: 
The study procedures involve the use of adhesive to secure the placement medical 
equipment. The adhesive may cause an allergic reaction, redness, swelling or itching 
when in contact [CONTACT_8124]. 
Subjects will participate in several blood draws throughout the course of the study which 
have the potential to cause a venous line-vasovagal response, bruising, tenderness, and rarely infection. 
10.6 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
All AEs should be followed up and subjects will be rendered appropriate medical care 
and treatment at the discretion of the Investigator until resolution or until the Investigator 
and Sponsor concludes that “further follow -up is not necessary”. If the AE has not 
resolved by [CONTACT_7620]-treatment follow-up visit, the stop date will be recorded as 
“ongoing.”  
All SAEs and AESIs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the 
event or until the Investigator and Sponsor judge that further follow-up is not necessary. 
If information is not available at the time of the first report and becomes available later, 
the Investigator should complete a follow-up SAE form at the earliest possible or provide 
other written documentation and fax it immediately within 24 hours of receipt of 
information to the Sponsor or designee. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_363647] (e.g., ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent accordingly. 
All other non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is 
“recovering” (for chronic conditions), or “recovered” , or until the end of the post-
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page [ADDRESS_453053], and until all queries 
related to these AE’s have been resolved.  
10.6.1  Safety Reporting to IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or designated qualified vendor will be responsible for reporting all 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other applicable 
SAEs to regulatory authorities, Investigators, and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in 
accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted.  
Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the Sponsor or 
Sponsor ’s designee, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_453054] a copy of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC 
in accordance with national regulations.  
Reporting responsibilities of Investigator under 21 CFR 312.64(b) and Sponsor under 21 
CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i) for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions will be 
followed.

Clinical Data Management (CDM), is the responsibility of ProSciento. With permission 
of the Sponsor, CDM may be delegated under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities 
to a qualified vendor of ProSciento.  
11.1 Data Management 
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the Data 
Management Plan (DMP). 
AEs and medical history will be coded using the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Concomitant medications will be coded 
using the World Health Organization (WHO) WHODrug Global.  
Unique numbers will identify the subject and the biological material obtained from the 
subject. Appropriate measures such as encryption or deletion will be enforced to protect 
the identity of human subjects in all presentations and publications as required by 
[CONTACT_5737]/regional/national requirements. 
Data from screening failures will be entered into the database. 
Laboratory data from the central laboratory will be electronically transferred to 
ProSciento for database reconciliation purposes. The electronic laboratory data will be 
considered source data. In cases where sensitive non-PK laboratory data is transferred via non-secure electronic networks, data will be encrypted during transfer. 
The laboratory will provide one copy of the laboratory reports to the CRU staff. The staff 
will receive all laboratory data electronically or based on FAX reports directly from the 
laboratory. An Investigator must review, evaluate, sign and date the laboratory print-outs 
upon receipt. The signed print-out of the laboratory reports are source data. 
All other results, including PK, PD data, and laboratory tests will be transferred 
electronically to the responsible Data Management Unit.  
11.2 CRFs (Electronic) 
11.2.1  Clinical Data Management Workflow 
Electronic CRFs will be developed by [CONTACT_363685], in collaboration with the 
clinical study team at ProSciento and statistician. CDM will document the process 
workflow in the DMP. After data entry, monitor(s) will source data verify (SDV) the 
eCRFs against the source documents. Queries may be issued to clarify the data entered. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_363648], all queries 
have been resolved and all external data has been reconciled with the eCRF data. If 
corrections and/or resolution of queries are required after PI [INVESTIGATOR_352379], those eCRFs

12.2.3  Analysis of the Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
The planned analyses will be described in more detail in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP). 
The serum pharmacokinetic (PK) concentration profiles will be graphically presented.  
The PK endpoints will be derived from the individual serum HM [ZIP_CODE] profiles during 
the elimination phase using the non-compartmental models. C trough will be derived from 
the pre-dosing PK samples on Day 78. The PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_2715].  
12.2.4  Analysis of the Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
All PD parameters including but not limited to MRI-PDFF will be summarized using 
appropriate descriptive statistics (e.g., n, mean or geometric mean, CV, min, median, 
max) by [CONTACT_363689]. The placebo group will be pooled across 
cohorts in the summary tables.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 Grading* Management 
G1: Asymptomatic abnormal cardiac biomarker 
testing, including abnormal ECG  All grades warrant workup and intervention 
given potential for cardiac compromise 
 
Please consider the following:  
• Hold therapy and permanently discontinue 
after G1  
• Management of cardiac symptoms according to 
ACC/AHA guidelines  
• Transfer patient to the emergency room at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_363654] > G1  
• Cardiology consultation  G2: Mild symptoms consistent with 
cardiotoxicity with or without abnormal cardiac 
biomarkers  
G3: Moderate symptoms consistent with 
cardiotoxicity and/or clinically significant 
abnormal cardiac biomarkers 
G4: Moderate to severe decompensation, 
intravenous medication or intervention 
required, life threatening conditions   
Qualifying Statement: Treatment recommendations are based on local standards of care and the 
life- threatening nature of cardiovascular complications. Holding therapy is recommended for 
complication grades greater than G2. The appropriateness of rechallenging remains unknown.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 2. Rash/Inflammatory Dermatitis and Other Skin Disorders 
Definitions:  
x Erythema multiforme major and minor (a targetoid reaction in the skin and mucous 
membranes usually triggered by [CONTACT_79422], such as Herpes Simplex Viruses, but can be associated with an immune-related drug eruption and if progresses to EM major, 
it can be a harbinger of SCAR, such as SJS)  
x Lichenoid (resembling the flat-topped, polygonal and sometimes scaly or 
hypertrophic lesions of lichen planus)  
x Eczematous (Inflammatory dermatitis characterized by [CONTACT_108135], erythematous, scaly or crusted papules or plaques on the skin, which is vulnerable to superinfection) 
x  Psoriasiform (resembling the well-demarcated, erythematous and scaly papules and plaques of psoriasis)  
x Morbilliform (a non-pustular, non-bullous measles-like exanthematous rash of the 
skin often referred to as “maculopapular” and without systemic symptoms or lab 
abnormalities, excluding occasional isolated peripheral eosinophilia  
x Palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) (hand-foot syndrome) (redness, 
numbness/burning/itching and superficial desquamation of the palms and soles)  
x Neutrophilic dermatoses (e.g. sweet’s syndrome)  
x Others 
 
Diagnostic Workup for Skin Disorders above and Others Considered to be Possibly 
IP-related: 
• Pertinent history and physical exam 
• Rule out any other etiology of the skin problem, such as an infection, an effect of 
another drug or a skin condition linked to another systemic disease or unrelated primary 
skin disorder 
• If needed, a biological checkup including a blood cell count, liver and kidney tests 
• Directed serologic studies if an autoimmune condition is suspected, such as lupus or 
dermatomyositis: a screening antinuclear antibody test, SSA/Anti-Ro, SS-B/Anti-La if 
predominantly photodistributed/photosensitivity, anti-histone, ds-DNA and other 
relevant serologies. Consider expanding serologic studies or diagnostic work up if other 
autoimmune conditions are considered based on signs, symptoms. 
• Dermatology consultation with skin biopsy 
• Consider clinical monitoring with use of serial clinical photography, if IRB approved 
and subject has consented

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 • Review full list of patient medications to rule out other drug-induced cause for 
photosensitivity 
Grading 
Grading according to CTCAE criteri a is a 
challenge for skin. Instead, severity may be 
based on BSA, tolerability, morbidity, and 
duration.  Management 
G1: Symptoms do not affect the quality of life 
or controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_107923]/or oral 
antipruritic  • Consider continuing therapy for mild localized 
reaction, e.g., injection site erythema  
• Consider treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_363655]/or mild -moderate potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_030]  
• Counsel patients to avoid skin irritants and sun 
exposure  
G2: Inflammatory reaction that affects quality 
of life and requires intervention based on 
diagnosis.  • Dermatology consultation with possible biopsy 
• Consider holding therapy and monitor weekly 
for improvement. If not resolved, interrupt 
treatment until skin AE has reverted to grade 1 
• Consider initiating prednisone (or equivalent) at
 
dosing 1 mg/kg tapering over at 4 weeks  
In addition, treat with topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669], oral 
antihistamines and medium -to-high potency 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_80114]  
G3: As grade 2 but with failure to respond to 
indicated interventions for a grade 2 dermatitis.  • Hold therapy and consult with dermatology to 
determine appropriateness of resuming  
• Treat with topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669], oral 
antihistamines and high potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]
 
• Initiate oral prednisone or equ ivalent  
(0.5-1 mg/kg/day) tapering over at least 4 weeks 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 108 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 G4: All severe rashes not manageable with prior 
intervention  • Immediate hold therapy and consult 
dermatology to determine appropriateness of resuming therapy upon resolution of skin 
toxicity and once corticosteroids are reduced to 
prednisone (or equivalent) 10mg or less.
 
• Systemic steroids: IV (methyl)prednisolone (or 
equivalent) dosed at 1 –2mg/kg with slow 
tapering when the toxicity resolves  
• Monitor closely for progression to Severe 
Cutaneous Adve rse Reaction 
• Should admit patient immediately with an 
urgent  
consult by [CONTACT_363696]., Ltd

Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 3. Gallstones (Cholelithiasis), Biliary Cholic or Cholecystitis 
Definition: 
Asymptomatic gallstones/ asymptomatic common bile duct stones: Stones that are found 
incidentally, as a result of imaging investigations unrelated to gallstone disease in people 
who have been completely symptom free for at least 12 months before diagnosis. 
Symptomatic gallstones/ symptomatic common bile duct stones: Stones found on 
gallbladder imaging, regardless of whether symptoms are being experienced currently or 
whether they occurred sometime in the 12 months before diagnosis. 
When should symptomatic gallbladder stones be suspected? 
The characteristic symptoms of gallbladder stones, i.e. epi[INVESTIGATOR_363656] 15-30 minutes with 
radiation to the right back or shoulder and a positive reaction to analgesics, should be 
identified by [CONTACT_44059] 
 
• Diagnostic Workup for Symptoms Suggestive of Gallstone-related Disorders: 
• Liver function tests and ultrasound for suspected gallstone disease, and for individuals 
with abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms that have been unresponsive to previous management. 
• Consider magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) if ultrasound has not detected common bile duct stones but the: 
✓ bile duct is dilated and/or 
✓ liver function test results are abnormal. 
• Consider endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if MRCP does not allow a diagnosis to be made. 
• Consider holding therapy and consulting gastroenterology. 
• Refer people for further investigations if conditions other than gallstone disease are suspected.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 4. Gastrointestinal Events 
Definition: Nausea and vomiting are anticipated adverse events with this protocol.  
The initial assessment needs to include consideration of other differentials including 
pancreatitis and cholelithiasis.  Laboratory assessments of amylase, lipase and liver 
function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) or imaging (ultrasound, CT or MRI) should be considered and pursued if indicated.  
 
Severity of symptoms should be assessed as following: 
Grading 
(Not associated with CTCAE grading system) Management 
G1: Mild symptoms that do not interfere with 
quality of life  • No intervention 
G2: Mild to moderate symptoms that may need 
intervention based on Investigator.  • Patient observation 
• Consider initiating antiemetic medication  
G3: Moderate to severe symptoms that need 
medical intervention.  
 
 
 • Hold therapy; resume therapy only if 
symptoms are fully resolved  
• Treat with antiemetic medication as indicated 
• Treat with IV fluid  
• Treat with parenteral nutrition if no oral intake 
sustained beyond 7 days  
G4: Life-threatening symptoms  • Immediately discontinue therapy  
• Systemic IV fluids  
• Treat with antiemetic medication as indicated 
• Treat with parenteral nutrition  
• Should admit patient immediately with an 
urgent  consult

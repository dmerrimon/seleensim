Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  [ADDRESS_1076005] a multi center, randomized, masked, placebo -controlled trial 
within the Neonatal Research Network (N RN). This trial will  evaluate the effects of a 7-day 
course of hydrocortisone therapy on short -term morbidity, cardiovascular function, long-term 
neurodevelopment , and mortality  in critically ill, term and late preterm infants diagnosed with 
cardiovascular insufficiency as defined by a need for inotr ope therapy in the first 72 hours of 
age.  
2. Statement of the Problem  
Cardiovascular insufficiency is common and  potentially life -threatening in critically ill term and 
late preterm newborns admitted to the newborn intensive care unit (NICU)  in the first few days 
of age. Cardiovascular insufficiency occurs when there is inadequate blood flow to meet the 
needs of metabolism and often presents as low blood pressure, poor capi[INVESTIGATOR_39093], low urine 
output , or metabolic acidosis. Critically ill infants with these signs often receive fluid boluses or 
inotropes and, increasingly, steroids to improve systemic blood flow. Yet, f or the majority of 
infants, the etiology of cardiovascular insufficiency in the fir st few days of life is unclear.  
Emerging evidence suggests that a frequent etiology of cardiovascular instability or insufficiency 
in ill adult and some pediatric populations may be relative adrenal insufficiency , an inadequate 
cortisol response to acute stress or illness .1-[ADDRESS_1076006] low endogenous concentrations of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and have normal response s to exogenous ACTH.[ADDRESS_1076007] documented improved cardiovascular  
stability following glucocorticoid treatment in hypotensive term infants,13-17 no randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effects of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular function, 
short -term outcomes , or long -term neurodevelopment in critically ill term or late preterm infants  
with cardiovascular insufficiency . It is urgent that research is advanced in this area because, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_782378] -designed studies, there is an increasing use of glucocorticoid therapy for 
hypotension in t his population. This study aims to determine , through optimal study design, the 
efficacy and consequences of glucocorticoid therapy in critically ill term and late preterm infants .  
3. Hypothes is 
We hypothesize that therapy with hydrocor tisone will ameliorate the  clinical syndrome  of 
cardiovascular insufficiency syndrome seen in many critically ill term and late preterm infants, 
thereby [CONTACT_782402] - and long-term morbidity  and mortality.  
4. Specific Aim s 
Goal of study.  Although short term use of hydrocortisone is believed to be safe  (see Table 1), 
evidence  is limited  to support its use in treating hypotension in the critically ill term and late 
preterm infant. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_782379], many infants are increasingly receiving 
glucocorticoids  for cardiovascular insufficiency —13.1% of intubated and mechanically 
ventilated infants in our own preliminary observati onal NRN  data and 13.5% in a recent report of 
infants with meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1518].[ADDRESS_1076008] 72 postnatal hours. Our 
Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  4 of  24 
 
 
goal is  to determine if hydrocortisone  treatment improves cardiovascular function, ameliorates 
other short -term outcomes, and increases survival without neurodevelopmental impairment.  
Specific aims  of this multicenter, randomized, masked, placebo -controlled trial within the NRN  
are: 
a. Compare  the incidence of  death or neurodevelopmental impairment  at 22-[ADDRESS_1076009] shorter stays in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
c. Compare adverse events (defined below) between infants treated with hydrocortisone 
vs. placebo. We hypothesize  that adverse events will not occur at a higher rate in those 
receiving hydrocortisone compared to placebo.  
d. Compare measures of cardiovascular sufficiency between those infants on 
hydrocortisone vs. placebo as measured by [CONTACT_094] - and post -study drug differ ences in 
blood pressure , the duration and dose of inotropes received , and the presence of 
metabolic acidosis and oliguria . We hypothesize  that infants treated with hydrocortisone 
vs. placebo will have higher blood pressures, receive a lower total dose of i notropes , 
and/or receive inotropes for a shorter period of time and have less metabolic acidosis 
and oliguria.

5. Rationale/Justification  
There has never been a randomized controlled trial of hydrocortisone for the treatment of 
cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm newborn infants in the first few 
days of life.  No studies have examined the  long-term effects of hydrocortisone given for the 
purposes of improving cardiovascular stability.  This RCT is urgently needed because the use of 
steroids is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_782381] (see also section 6b, Preliminary Studies , below ).18,[ADDRESS_1076012] experience in formulating, 
managing, and editing this database. In addition, the NRN has a n established  follow -up program 
with successful tracking of patients  and high follow -up rates, standardized assessments 
conducted by [CONTACT_782403] , and comprehensive  data management.  
6a. Background /Previous Studies  
Incidence of cardiovascular insufficiency . Cardiovascular insufficiency is a frequent 
occurrence in the critically ill term and late preterm infant admitted to the NICU. Previous studies 
on cardiovascular insufficiency have used hypotension as a proxy measure  of insufficiency , 
rather than other sig ns of cardiovascular insufficiency.16,20-[ADDRESS_1076013] 
appropriate measure as many neonatal clinicians do not use blood press ure to determine 
initiation of therapy (see section 6b, Preliminary Studies , below ). If hypotension is defined 
Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  6 of  24 
 
 
pragmatically as the receipt of therapy for the diagnosis, one retrospective study of 1011 
mechanically  ventilated, ≥34 week neonates admitted to a NICU reported that 60% received 
volume expanders and 35% received vasopressors.24  
Consequences of cardiovascular insufficiency . The consequences of cardiovascular 
insufficiency are the result of end organ injury or damage. In extremely preterm infants, 
hypotension has been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage  (IVH) , periventricular 
leukomalacia  (PVL) , cerebral palsy, hearing  loss, and neurodevelopmental impairment.25-27 It is 
difficult to differentiate the consequences of hypotension itself from the treatment , as treated 
blood pressure vs. untreated low blood pressure may be associated with adverse outcomes in 
retrospective, multiple regression analyses.28,29  
Although less is known about the  critically ill term or late preterm infant,  there are reports of 
increased neurological events (seizures, brain atrophy, intracranial hemorrhage , or stroke) and 
chronic lung disease in association with the use of vasopressors  (inotropes) .[ADDRESS_1076014] reported a higher incidence of death in ill newborn infants who received vasopressors 
compared to those who did not (68.2% vs. 15.7%).[ADDRESS_1076015] been 
due to the underlying disease, inadequate  perfusion, vasopressor (inotrope) therapy , or other 
factors. It will remain difficult to sort out the contributions of these factors; however, a 
randomized, placebo -controlled trial is the best strategy to determine the efficacy and 
consequences of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782382].  
Adrenal insufficiency as e tiology of cardiovascular insufficiency . The etiology of 
hypotension  or cardiovascular insufficiency in the acutely ill newborn is, in most cases, unknown  
at the time of treatment . Proposed mechanisms include hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, 
abnormal regulation of peripheral vascular tone, pulmonary hypertension with resultant 
decreased left ventricular preload, and maladaptation to transition after birth.[ADDRESS_1076016] suggested relative adrenal insufficiency as an etio logy of hypotension in other critically ill 
populations of  adults and children.2,31-34 Adrenal insufficiency occurs when there is insufficient 
cortisol release from the adrenal cortex, especially in response to severe illness and stress. The 
adrenal gland releases cortisol in response to ACTH . ACTH  is produced in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304] , 
which is stimulated by [CONTACT_621339] -releasing hormone (CRH) that is made in the 
hypothalamus. The integrity and activation of the hypoth alamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis is 
essential to general adaptation to illness and stress . The HPA axis  is responsible for the 
maintenance of cellular and organ homeostasis. In response to acute stress or critical illness, 
cortisol concentrations should  increase substantially. Recent guidelines for adults with critical 
illness have suggested that random cortisol values <10 mcg/dl or delta cortisol values <9 mcg/dl 
after cosyntropin is associated with cardiovascular insufficiency and mortality and should be 
considered evidence of relative adrenal insufficiency.4-6,8,33,[ADDRESS_1076017] that 
insufficient adrenal function in the face of illness may play a role in the etiology of hypotension 
or cardiovascula r insufficiency in the term and late preterm critically ill newborn infant.  
We postulate that the newborn is uniquely susceptible to adrenal insufficiency  due to shifts 
in hormone production during transition to extra -uterine life. CRH is produced in incr easing 
concentrations by [CONTACT_782404], resulting in maternal and fetal serum CRH 
Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  7 of  24 
 
 
concentrations at term that are much higher than at any other time in life.38 Placental CRH 
stimulates cortisol producti on in the fetal adrenal gland. At birth, the very high concentration of 
CRH from the p lacenta is suddenly withdrawn. We hypothesize that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_782383] —who has previously been exposed to s uch high concentrations of CRH —is 
transiently refractory to the lower concentrations of CRH produced by [CONTACT_234125], and 
may not be able to increase ACTH to stimulate the adrenal gland f or several days after delivery.  
If the newborn is well, this brief refractory period is well  tolerated; however, if the infant is 
seriously ill, a state of relative adrenal insufficiency and c ardiovascular compromise, inc luding 
hypotension, may ensue. Our preliminary investigations have documented low cortisol and 
ACTH values in ill hypotensive newborns, but normal responses to exogenous ACTH, 
consistent with adrenal insufficiency secondary to HPA axis dysfunction upstream from the 
adrenal gland and poor adaptation to extra -uterine life.12  
Glucocorticoid therapy for cardiovascular insufficiency . If relative adrenal insufficiency 
underlies the hypotension or cardiovascular insufficiency seen in many critically ill newborn 
infants, the appropriate therapy for this condition is not symptomatic treatment with volume 
expansion and inotropes, but glucoc orticoid  therapy  in doses designed to mimic serum 
concentrations seen in critical illness. This approach is different than the goal of anti -
inflammatory dosing of steroids (hydrocortisone or dexamethasone) used in preterm infants for 
the prevention of bron chopulmonary dysplasia. Glucocorticoids  for the purpose of physiologic 
replacement in shock has shown to  improve outcomes in adult critically ill patients, including a 
reduction in the duration of inotrope administration and, in some studies, reduced morta lity.4,[ADDRESS_1076018] sh own 
an improvement in blood pressure.20,21 Glucocorticoid administration for hypotension has not 
been associated with any adverse events in the small  cohort or case studies in the term 
newborn population14-16 and has not been shown to be an independent risk factor for adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcomes.39 
Hydrocortisone dosing . High-dose corticosteroid administration has shown no benefit and 
possible harm  in critically ill adult patients with acute lung i njury, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086]  (ARDS) , and septic shock .[ADDRESS_1076019] on short -term mortality, ventilation -free days, length of intensive care 
unit stay, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome score s, lung injury scores , and shock reversal 
without increasing significant adverse events .5,6,40 Relative  adrenal insufficiency  in ill adult s—or 
more recently  deemed “ critical illness -related cortico steroid insufficiency ”—is defined by 
[CONTACT_782405] (norepi[INVESTIGATOR_782384]  >0.05 to 0.1 
mcg/kg/min ) or having persistent ARDS for >48 hours . In these adult patients , a course of 
hydrocortisone at a dose of 200–350 mg/day  (stress doses)  is recommended , which is 
equivalent to at least 3 mg/k/da y. The duration should be for at least 7 days  because r apid 
steroid  tapers (2–6 days ) have  been associated wi th rebound inflammation , increased 
inflammatory mediators , and a need to reintroduc e vasopressor age nts and mechanical 
ventilation .41,42 The definition of relative adrenal insufficiency  in adults  is a random cortisol level 
below 1 0 or 15 mcg/dl in acutely ill patients. To achieve cortisol levels of 15–20 mcg/l , a dose of 
about 0.6 mg/kg/dose q 6  hours (~2 .4 mg/kg/day) would need to be given.43 
Hydrocortisone dosing in  infants . Pharmacokinetic data in term and late preterm infants are 
limited . In 1962, Reynolds , et al, reported pharmacokinetics in five term infants after a bolus of 5  
mg/kg hydrocortisone.44 Serum concentrations were evaluated with two assay methods (Porter -
Silber chromogen values and chromatography with isotope dilution),  which showed similar 
results. Mean peak serum concentration (30 –80 minutes after dose) was 557  mcg/dl, and me an 
serum half -life was just under 4 hours (range 2.4 –7.1 hours). This half -life is much longer than in 
Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  8 of  24 
 
 
adults, where elimination half -life has been reported to be 2  0.3 hours.45 Extrapolating, a dose 
of 0.5 mg /kg would give a peak cortisol level of approximately 50 mcg/dl or a level of about 18 
mcg/dl after 6 hours.  
Doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day  in preterm infants have  been shown to significantly increase  blood 
pressure .[ADDRESS_1076020] used variable dosing (2–3 mg/kg/day ), and all have shown  an increase in  blood pressure, 
a decrease in volume and in otrope requirement , and a decrease in heart rate without increases 
in adverse events (see Table 1). 
Considering the likely longer T1/[ADDRESS_1076021], a dose of 1 
mg/kg/dose load followed by 0.5  mg/kg q [ADDRESS_1076022] recently , within the multi center NRN.  
To determine the incidence of low cortisol values in infants receiving vasopressors , as evidence 
of cardiovascular insufficiency , we performed a retrospective cohort study  of infants ≥35 
weeks gestational age (GA) and who were mechanically ventilated, received vasopressor 
therapy, and had a cortisol concentration obtained for evaluation of vasopressor -resistant 
hypotension. We found that a significant number (56%) of hypotensive critically ill infants  
had cortisol value s <15 mcg/dl, a value considered to be suggestive of relative adrenal 
insufficiency .35 Treatment with  hydrocort isone in this population resulted in improved 
hemodynamic function, as evidenced by [CONTACT_782406], decreased dopamine support , 
and fewer fluid boluses.    
In a subsequent prospective observational study, we enrolled a cohort of mechanically 
ventilate d infants ≥35 w eeks gestation and <6 days old. Twenty -six of the 35 ill infants ( 74%) 
had cortisol levels  <15 mcg/dl. However, all ACTH -stimulated cortisol values were > 18 mcg/dl. 
We performed ACTH measurements in 10 infants; the median ACTH concentration was 12  
pg/ml . There was  no correlation between severity of illness scores and any cortisol value 
(baseline, stimulated , or rise). The results confirmed that the majority  of critically ill newborns 
had an inadequate  cortisol response to acute illness.  Cortisol values did not increase 
with severity of illness , again suggesting relative adrenal insufficiency. However, these 
infants did respond appropriately to ACTH stimulati on, despi[INVESTIGATOR_782385] .11,[ADDRESS_1076023] needed to better characterize the study population . 
In 2009, we conducted a time -limited, prospective, multicenter (16 centers), observational 
study to determine  the incidence, managem ent, and short -term outcomes of newborn 
infants  who were intubated and mechanically  ventilated at less than 72 hours postnatal age, 
≥34 weeks gestation , and admitted to NRN  Centers . A total of 816 infants were studied.  The 
incidence  of cardiovascular insuffi ciency was determined by [CONTACT_782407] 2 below.

Reasons for initiating therapy . Sixty -two percent of these mechanically ventilated infants 
received treatment for c ardiovascular insufficiency . The trigger for receiving therapy included 
low blood pressures , but low blood pressure was not the only trigger. In fact, 42% of the infants 
who received therapy (fluid, inotropes , or steroids) did not have cardiovascular insufficiency  as 
defined by [CONTACT_782408]  < postmenstrual age ( PMA ) in weeks . Many 
infants had blood pressures within normal limits for age48 at the time th erapy was initiated 
(Table 3).  Of those who received fluid boluses, 60% did not have a  low blood pressure as 
defined by a mean blood pressure less than PMA in weeks at the time of initiation of the bolus 
(Table 4). When examined for “reasons” that clinicians initiated fluid boluses, inotropes , or 
steroids , 42–77% received  one of these  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782386] o ther reasons

7.  Method s/Procedures  
a. Study Design  
The study will be a randomized,  multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial.  
Patients  will be enrolled and randomized in a variable block design, 1:1 ratio of 
hydrocortisone or placebo.  
b. Study Population  
Inclusion criteria:  Eligible infants will be  ≥34 weeks gestation who are —  
 Intubated and mechanically ventilated for a minimum of 2 hour s before 72 hours 
postnatal age    
 Admitted to  a NRN NICU before 48 hours postnatal age.   
Information will be collected on maternal and infant demographics including antenatal 
steroids. Data will also be collected on eligible infants who are not enrolled  on the 
screening  and eligibility form  including gestational ag e, outborn/inborn status , and 
reason for not enrolling . 
The exclusion criteria include those infants with cardiovascular insufficiency which is 
likely not due to relative adrenal insufficiency . 
 Exclusion criteria : 
 Attending physician refusal    
 No parent/guardian consent  
 Infants r eceiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  
 Infants who are intubated for the sole pu rpose of an anticipated surgery  or airway 
anomalies  
 Infants for whom treatment will be limited based on poor prognosis   
 Receiving dexamethasone  or hydrocortisone  
 Receiving ibuprofen or indomethaci n 
 
Infants will be excluded if there is a k nown diagnosis at the time enrollment of—  
 Congenital heart disease  not including  
atrial septum defect, ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus  
 Hypotension thought to result from specific, immediately remediable factors 
including placental hemorrhage, acute hemorrhage , or tension pneumothora x 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_782387]  
 Chromosomal disorder  
 Hypertension in the absence of inotrope therapy as defined by a mean arteri al 
blood pressure >95th percentile for postmenstrual age in weeks48  
 Receipt of therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy

 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  12 of  24 
 
 
 Abdominal wall defects , such as gastroschisis or omphalocele  
 Major renal anomalies  requiring dialysis.  
 
 Infants diagnosed with pi[INVESTIGATOR_782388]. All other infants in whom  study 
drug is discontinued, including those treated with ECMO aft er enrollment  will remain in 
the analysis according to the intention –to- treat principle . 
Timing of consent . Parents/guardians of infants who meet inclusion  criteria and who do 
not have any of the exclusion criteria  may be approached for consent for enrollment into 
the study , regardless of any blood pressure values or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782389] . Infants  ideally would be enrolled  and randomized to study 
drug within 24 hours  of intubation a nd receipt of inotropes (up to max of 96 hours of 
age).  For transported infants, parents will be contact[CONTACT_782410]. 
Enrolling infants as soon as possible will allow more time for discussion with parents, 
enrollment, randomization , and receipt of study drug.  
c. Study Interventio n 
Randomization criterion . Decision of the clinical care team to treat with  an inotrope 
(dopamine, dobutamine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] , or norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within the first 72 hours of life,  
at a minimum dose of  5 mcg/kg /min ( epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0. 01 mcg/kg/min) , will  be the trigger fo r 
randomization to study drug. Blood pressure will not be a criterion for randomization. 
Low dose dopamine  (<5mcg/kg/min) initiated for low urine output does not qualify for 
randomization. Low blood  pressure did not correlate with interventions for cardiovascul ar 
insufficiency in our multi center NRN observational study  (see section 6b, Preliminary 
Studies , above ). However , receipt of inotrope support was associated with significantly 
worse outcomes, including a mortal ity rate of almost 16% vs. 4%. Therefore, this is a 
reasonable clinical indicator of adverse outcomes.  
Randomization method. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_782411] a 
randomly permuted block randomization algorithm devised by [CONTACT_782412] . A centralized secure, password -protected web -based 
(Hatteras Clinical DMS) randomization process will be used to allocate  infants  to either 
hydrocortisone or placebo. The medication will be reconstituted by [CONTACT_32335] , and 
caregivers will remain blinded. Placebo will be normal saline and will be given in equal 
volume to a hydrocortisone dose and delivered at same rate.  
Study Drug . Enrolled infants who receive inotrope therapy before 72 hours postnatal 
age will be randomized to receive 7 days of  hydrocortisone (hydrocortisone sodium 
succinate, plain; will not have benzyl alcohol) given through intravenous line, po if no line 
or by [CONTACT_80626] (I.M.) (if no intravenous line  and infant is  NPO ) or 7 days of 
intravenous , po or I.M.  placebo  (normal saline in equal volume). Hydrocortisone 
dosing will be 2.5 mg/kg/day on day 1 , 2 mg/kg/day on days 2 and 3 , 1 mg/k/ day on 
days 4 and 5 , then 0.5  mg/kg/day on days 6 and  7. 
 1 mg/kg loading dose x 1  
 0.5 mg/kg q 6 hours x 1 2 doses   
 0.5 mg/kg q 12 hours x 4 doses   
 0.5 mg/kg q day x [ADDRESS_1076026] 3 days, to avoid possible  
rebound hypotension and in consideration of possible down -regulation of g lucocorticoid

receptors by [CONTACT_782413].40,49 Therapy with active drug or placebo  
should be instituted  ideally  within 12-24 hours of initiation of inotrope therapy. All other 
treatments will be at the discretion of the clinical care team. This real -world management 
design will increase generalizability of study results and improve compliance with study 
procedures.  
Rationale for hydrocortisone dosing:  see section 6, Background, for rationale  on dosing .   
Laboratory . One blood sample (1ml) for a cortisol level will be obtained within 4 hours 
prior to initiation of study drug  for each enrolled patient . The sample of blood from each 
center will be labeled study patient ID and shipped to a central laboratory (The University 
of New Mexico CTSC Research Lab)  in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The cortisol levels 
will be measured by [CONTACT_941] I MMULITE 1000 cortisol procedure  (chemiluminescent system) .  
Blood for cortisol levels is not mandatory for study if parents wish to decline blood draw 
for this timed study lab. Cortisol levels obtained by [CONTACT_782414]. The relationship between c ortisol concentrations  and response to 
hydrocortisone, severity of illness and outcomes will be analyzed.    
The literature shows conflicting  results on the value of cortisol concentr ations in 
determining therapy. Infants often respond to glucocorticoids regardless of cortisol 
levels. While we found that infants with cortisol values <15 mcg/dl had positive 
responses to hydrocortisone in a small retrospe ctive study,[ADDRESS_1076027] the severity of illness, need for cardiovascular support , 
or the response to treatment.10,14,50 
Echocardiograms. If an echocardiogram is ordered by [CONTACT_6098],  the clinical 
report will be  labeled with patient ID  and will be sent to the NRN Data Coordinating 
Center at RTI . The following measurement s will be collected  if available : shortening 
fraction, ejection fraction presence of ductus and diameter, Left atrium to aortic ratio, 
presence of diastolic  retrograde flow in descending aorta, velocity in left pulmonary 
artery, pressure gradien t across PDA  and shunt direction , tricuspid regurgitation, right 
ventricular function, evidence of pulmonary hypertension,  atrial and ventricular 
dimensions, isovolumic relaxation and contraction times, presence of any defects  and 
myocardial performance indices  if available  (some institutions do not have equipment to 
determine indices like wall stress ).  
 
Concurrent medications . All concurrent medications  just prior and during the course of 
study drug administration will be recorded  including dopamine, dobutamine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], milrinone, vasopressin, sedatives (i.e. morphine, fentanyl, versed ), any 
steroids, respi[INVESTIGATOR_107110] (i.e . inhaled nitric oxide,  surfactant ), neuromuscular 
blockers and prostaglandins . Inotrope  duration  and dosing (maximum drip doses) will be 
specifically collected for ev aluation of study drug effect  in addition to collecting total fluid 
volume received . Inotropes and v olume expanders may be given as directed by [CONTACT_782415].  Once p atients are enrolled in the study , they  will not be allo wed to receive 
dexamethasone or indomethacin/ibuprofen while on study drug. Dexamethasone is an 
extremely potent glucocorticoid, and risks of using the two steroids at the same time  are 
unknown . The concurrent use of dexamethasone for airway edema will not be allowed. 
The combined use of a glucocorticoid and indomethacin is associated with spontaneous 
intestinal perforation in  very preterm newborn s. Although our study population shou ld not 
be at risk of this complication, it seems prudent to avoid this combination therapy.  
Initiation of indomethacin or ibuprofen  or any anti -hypertensive medication will result in

discontinuation of study drug. Data collection will continue and a ll ana lysis will be 
intention to treat.  
Open -label hydrocortisone  will be d iscouraged . If the attending physician feels that it 
is necessary to administer open -label hydrocortisone for vasopressor (inotrope) -resistant  
hypotension, we will first encourage maximum  vasopressor (inotrope) therapy, to include  
at least a dopamine dose of 10 mcg/kg/min and a second drug at a dose of at least 10 
mcg/kg/min of dobutamine or 0. 1 mcg/kg/min of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. We will recommend dosing 
of hydrocortisone  as outlined in this proto col. The max total daily dose that any infant 
would receive if open -label hydrocortisone were used would be 5  mg/kg/day. Some 
small studies have used up to 5 -7 mg/kg/day without adverse events .15,51,[ADDRESS_1076028] 
therapy.  10,14,51 Data collection will continue, and all analyses will be intention to treat. 
d.  Primary  & Secondary  Outcome s 
Primary Outcome.  The primary outcome will be death or neurodevelopmental 
impairment  at 22-26 months. Neurodevelopmental impairment will be defined as any of 
the following deficits: a cognitive , language or motor  score less than 1  SD below the 
mean on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III (BSID), gross motor functional  
(GMF)  level ≥1, visual impairment or blindness  in any eye , hearing impairment , or 
seizure disorder. The disability can be mild, moderate, or severe and will b e defined as 
per the NRN standard definitions at the time of assessment  (general definitions are listed  
in Table 7 ). Assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_782416]. From previous NRN trials, we anticipate a follow -
up rate of 90%. At the time of follow -up, a medical history will be obtained ; growth 
parameters and a BSID -III neurological and vision examination will be performed.

proposed to study. Based on previous data, the incidence  of death or any 
neurodevelopmental impairment (permanent hearing loss, blindness, moderate or 
severe cerebral palsy  or Bayley MDI or PDI scores <70) was 32% in a similar population 
of critically ill newborn infants with respi[INVESTIGATOR_782393] , but excluding congenital diaphragmatic hernia defects .39 Based on 4 
additional  studies in similar populations of term and late preterm infants with respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518], the average incidence of death or any neurodevelopmental impairment was 30%. 
54,55,56,[ADDRESS_1076032] bee n 
higher.  
 The trial is powered at 80% to detect a reduction in the primary outcome of death or 
any neurodevelopment impairment at 22-26 months from 30% to 20%, for a relative risk 
reduction of 33%, and a relative risk of 0.67, using a two tailed test wit h 5% Type I error. 
Allowing for 10% attrition, the required sample size for this scenario is 646 (Table 10). 
This sample size will also provide >80% power to detect treatment differences in 
important secondary outcomes of days in the NICU, intubated and on  a ventilator and 
hours on inotropes  without adjusting for multiple comparisons (Table 11).”

Because of the lack of data on outcomes in this population with which to ascertain power 
calculations with high confidence, the overall  event rate of any NDI or death in this 
population will be calculated  either:  [ADDRESS_1076033] patient is evaluated at 22-26

using Fisher’s exact or c hi-square tests for categor ical factors and t tests or non -
parametric tests for continuous outcomes . Dichotomous outcomes  including the primary 
outcome  will be compared between the hydrocortisone -treated gro up and control group s 
while adjusting for NRN center  differences  using robust Poisson regression, so that 
adjusted relative risk estimates of the treatment effect can be obtained . For continuous 
outcomes, n on-normally distributed data may be log -transformed prior to analysis. 
Secondary analyses may be performed  adjusting for gestational age or other critical 
baseline covariates that may be imbalanced across the two treatment groups, in addition 
to center. Short -term continuous outcomes will  be compared between those receiving 
hydrocortis one and those on placebo using linear regression adjusting for NRN center  
and other critical baseline covariates that may be imbalanced .  
 
g. Available Population  
With all NRN C enters enrolling into the observational study  (which  also excluded those 
with major congenital heart disease, acute hypotension resulting directly from known 
acute maternal and/or fetal hemorrhage within 24 hours prior to delivery, pi[INVESTIGATOR_782394], congenital adrenal hyperplas ia, or known chromosomal disorder ), ~100-115 
mechanically ventilated infants in this gestational age range are admitted to NRN  
Centers each month  and 25% of these received inotropes  (21% if exclude 
encephalopathy, CDH, and o mphalo cele and those who receive cooling  for HIE ). We , 
therefore , anticipate ~[ADDRESS_1076036] HIE will be ineligible for this study.  
h. Estimated Recruitment Time  
With 60% consent , 48 months would be needed to enrollment  goal. Anticipating delays 
in startup and missed infants, study enrollment should be completed in a little over four  
years .  
8. Risks and Benefits  
Short -term adverse events . The following will be reported within 72 hours of diagnosis  and 24 
hours of discovery :  
 Mortality . No study of hydrocortisone therapy in newborns or in other critically ill 
populations has shown an increase risk in mortality, and some have shown decreased 
risk of death.11,12 This study population is at high risk of death from the underlying 
diseases (1.2 %–11%).18,39   
 Late-onset (≥ 5 days) culture -confirmed infection . Recent large randomized controlled 
trials in adults and preterm newborn infants showed no increased risk of infection from 
7–14 days of glucocorticoid treatment .2,5 However, culture -proven late onset infection will 
be tracked and reported. Early and late onset culture -proven infection in this population 
is 1.4% and 4.2% respectively (Vermont Oxford Network 2009). A nticipated incidence 
<4.2%. 
 Gastrointestinal perforation . In contrast to the extremely low birth  weight infant where the 
incidence of spon taneous intestinal perforation is 4%, this patient population is 
Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  18 of  24 
 
 
developmentally more mature and should not be at risk for this event, particularly since 
these patients  will not be simultaneously exposed to indomethacin.14  
 Hypertension . These infants are often on inotropes , which often cause high blood 
pressure by [CONTACT_1029]. Glu cocorticoids’ actions are to increase blood  pressure. It is 
unknown if the combination of these two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782395] a higher occurrence of 
hypertension. This will be tracked by [CONTACT_782420] 12 -hour periods in  which 
the blood pressure was higher than 95thpercentile  for weight and age  and the receipt of 
any antihypertensive medication .48 Incidence is unknown.  
 Hyperglycemia . Higher dose glucocorticoids can raise blood glucose levels acutely and 
for short periods of time (hours),  without long -term consequences. No study to date has 
shown a need for insulin secondary to glucocorticoid administration for the treatment of 
hypotension. Data on t he use of insulin will be collected if administered during the study 
drug time  and when glucose is >180mg /dl on at least two determinations at least 6 hours 
apart .14 Anticipated incidence <1%.  
Other Potential issues  
 Adrenal suppression . Even in the most premature infants, this brief period of therapy has 
not previously been associated with adrenal suppression .58 If any infant shows signs 
consistent with adrenal insufficiency after discontinuation of the study drug (hypotension, 
oliguria, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), a blood sample can be sent for cortisol and 
therapy with hydrocortisone reinstituted if deemed nece ssary by [CONTACT_192942].  
 Neurodevelopmental deficits . The neurodevelopment al benefits or risks of using 
hydrocortisone for the treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency is unknown. This RCT 
will be an important addition to the literature regarding  long-term risks/benefits of this 
therapy .[ADDRESS_1076037] this proposed study population; however, our study design will enable 
us to evaluate that issue.  
 Persistent hypotension . Infants will be treated in the routine manner by [CONTACT_782421] -world design . Open -label 
hydrocortisone is discouraged but if given, the recommended plan is listed in the 
methods section  above . Data on infants who receive open -label hydrocortisone will  be

a. Adverse events to be monitored  
Adverse events to be monitored will be  those previously associated with 
glucocorticoid therapy, including  hyperglycemia, hypertension and gastrointestinal 
perforation.  Any infant who develops new, sustained hyperglycemia (>180mg/dl on at 
least two determinations at least 6 hours apart  or receiving insulin ) or new, sustained 
hypertension (mean arteria l pressure >95th percentile for age on four serial 
determinations over at least 12 hours  or receiving antihypertensive ) may have study 
drug held or discontinued if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_557178], there is no 
plausible alternative explanatio n for these findings (such as new thrombus). Not enrolling 
very preterm infants and excluding infants receiving indomethacin/ibuprofen should 
minimize the possibility for spontaneous GI perforation . These s hort term adverse events 
as defined here, should be reported within 24 hours of discovery to PI.  
Hydrocortisone treatment of cardiovascular insufficiency in term and late preterm infants:  A randomized controlled trial   
 Eunice  Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network  [ADDRESS_1076038] not reported these signs after discontinuation of a 
tapering course of the drug.  
Patients who develop hypotension and oliguria (shock) significant enough in the 
judgment of the attending neonat ologist to require support with volume and/or 
vasopressors may have a clinically indicated blood sample drawn for cortisol and may 
be restarted on hydrocortisone or other therapy for shock at the discretion of the clinical 
attending. Open -label hydrocortis one should be given at a test dose of 1mg/kg, with 
continuation of the therapy based on clinical response to the first dose. Persistent 
hypotension despi[INVESTIGATOR_782396].  Open -label hydrocortisone use will be 
considered a protocol deviation and it will be reported to DSMC if this deviation occurs in 
more than 20% of those enrolled.  
Serious adverse events to be reported to NICHD within [ADDRESS_1076039] as possible as to the 
cause of the perforation (NEC, spontaneous, other).  
b. Interim safety monitoring   
The DSMC will compare the incidence of death and a composite of serious adverse 
events including death, late onset sepsis, intestinal perforation, and hyperglycemia 
requiring insulin between the two treatment arms after every 100th infant reaches status 
(death, discharge, transfer or 60 days of age). Since  646 infants are to be enrolled in this 
trial, this will involve  interim looks  approximately once every 9 months, or after the 
enrollment of every additional 160 infants, giving a Pocock boundary of  2.413 , with a 
corresponding significance level of p<0.015 8 (Pocock, 1977). Such reports will be 
forwarded to the Chair of the DSMC when there is any suggestion of a trend towards a 
difference between the two treatment arms emerging. They will also be made available 
to the full DSMC at their scheduled meetings af ter 50% and 75% of the trial infants  reach 
status as defined by [CONTACT_782422] B. Interim efficacy analysis  using O’Brien -Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782397] 50% of primary outcome data is 
available .

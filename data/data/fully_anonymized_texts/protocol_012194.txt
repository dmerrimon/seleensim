1. Research Questions(s):   Does Intraoperative Ketamine improve quality of 
recovery after laparoscopic gastric reduction sur gery?  
2. Hypotheses:   Intraoperative ketamine will improve postoperative quality of 
recovery after laparoscopic gastric reduction.   
 
Research significance:  
 Background:   
  Laparoscopic surgery for gastric reduction is frequently associated with high levels of postoperative pain.

intraoperative ketamine on postoperative quality of recovery after gastric reduction

 surgery. We hypothesize that subjects receiving ketamine will have a greater global 
quality of recovery score than the ones receiving saline (placebo group) . We also seek to 
determine if intraoperative ketamine would decrease the incidence of postoper ative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_290724].  
 
Investigational Plan 
 
Study design:  Randomized, double blinded placebo controlled clinical trial 
 Methods:  
 
1. Primary outcome: QoR -40 at 24 hours
6 
2. Size of study groups(s):    
It would be required to have 36 patients per group in order to achieve 80% power 
to detect a [ADDRESS_354740] deviation of 15. To compensate for drop-outs or loss to follow-up, 80 patients will be recruited and randomized. 
3. Secondary outcomes:  
Postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_290725] (Hours) 
4. Patient entry, exclusion and dropout criteria:  
Entry: Age 18 -64, surgery: laparoscopic gastric reduction (gastric sleeve or 
gastric by[CONTACT_6476]), ASA I,  II, III; BMI >35kg/m
2, Fluent in English   
Exclusion:  History of allergy to protocol medications, History of chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942], pregnant patients. 
5. Drop out:  Conversion to an open surgical route, patient or surgeon request. 
 
6. Protocol specific methods:  Patients will be recruited on the day of surgery. 
Informed consent will be signed. Participant will complete the preoperative QoR -
40 questionnaire (appendix 1) along with the Stop-BANG questionnaire 
(appendix 2).  All medication except for propofol will be dosed based on the 
adjusted body weight ( ABW= Ideal body weight (IBW) + [0.4 X (actual body 
weight – IBW)]8 Patients will be randomized using a computer generated table of 
random number to 2 groups: Group K (ketamine) will receive 0.5mg /kg  of 
ketam ine bolus followed by [CONTACT_60801]  0.5 mg/kg/hour of ketamine 
throughout the intraoperative period. Group P (placebo) will receive the same 
amount of saline. The inve stigators will be blinded to study drug. The medication 
will be prepared by  [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_17399] l pharmac y and is not involved with the case or 
data collection . 
 Subjects will be premedicated with midazolam (0.02 -0.04 mg/kg IV 
preoperatively. Routine ASA monitors will be applied. Anesthesia will be induced with remifentanil infusion started at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute titrated to keep blood pressure within 20% of the baseline and propofol 1.5 -2.5 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with succinylcholine (1 -2 mg /kg). Anesthesia will 
M. Yilmaz, M.D.    Page 4 of 14    
 
IRB #  STU00081191      
 be maintained with sevoflurane titrated to a bispectral index (BI S) between 40-60, 
remifentanil infusion started at 0.1mcg/kg/min titrated to keep blood pressure 
within 20 % of baseline values, and neuromuscular blockade will be maintained with rocuronium that will be administered at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Upon termination of the surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade will be antagonized with a combination of neostigmine 0.05mg/kg (to a maximum dose of 5mg) and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg . Remifentanil will be discontinued at the time of the removal of the laparoscope from the abdomen and hydromorphone 10 mcg/kg IV will be administered. Ondansetron 4 mg IV and dexamethasone 4 mg IV will be administered to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Study drug will be discontinued at the end of the surgica l procedure as the dressings are being 
placed . Normothermia will be maintained intraoperatively using a forced air 
warm ing blanket  (Bairhugger, Arizant healthcare INC, Eden Prairie, MN).  
Subjects will receive IV Hydromorphone in divided doses as needed to achieve a verbal rating score for pain <4 out of 10 starting in the operating room following  
extubation and in PACU.  Metoclopramide (10 mg IV) will be used as rescue antiemetic. Patient-controlled analgesia, programmed to deliver 0.2 mg of hydromorphone every 10 minutes, will be instituted before the patient is discharged from  the PACU.   Before PACU discharge, the LSD ARCI  
questionnaire
7 (appendix 3) w ill be completed by [CONTACT_290729]. Ketorolac 30 mg every 6 hours for 24 hours will be 
started when admitted to patient room. SpO2 will be monitored continuously for 24 hours after discharge from PACU. At 24 hours after surgery patients will complete the QoR -40  (appendix 1) instrument.

Risks/Benefits:  Participants may not have any direct benefit from taking part in this 
study.  Taking part in this study may help us determine whether the study drug increases 24 hour quality of recovery and decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_290726] 24 hours of the surgery.  
  
Side effects of ketamine  
The common side effects of the study drug ketamine include:  
 
Most Fr equent:  
Delirium 
Hallucinations  
Mood changes Nightmares  
Tachyarrhythmia  
Tonic- Clonic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_290727] : 
Bradycardia  
Hypotension

IRB #  STU00081191      
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_290728]:  
Anaphylaxis  
Anorexia  Conduction disorder of the heat Diplopia  Injection site  
Laryngismus  
Nausea  
Nystagmus  
Obstructive pulmonary disease Skin inflammation  
Skin rash  
Normal Saline (placebo):  
Hypernatremia  
 These side effects are uncommon with the lower dose range used in this study.  There is a risk of loss of confidentiality even though there are strict measures in place to prevent occurrence. Answering some of the questionnaires or surveys may make subject feel uncomfortable. The subject  may skip to the next question if the question 
upsets them . There is a very slight risk of skin irritation from the pulse oximeter 
(Konica Minolta).   Confidentiality:  Subjects’ identity will be guarded by [CONTACT_20526] a numerical code 
which is only known by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_67880] . Data will 
be stored in department computer which is password protected. Each study subject will be assigned a study code number. The code will be used to link study data to patient identification (name) in a separate database. Subject data will be st ored on 
secure computers at Northwestern University. Data access will be password protected and only available to study investigators. The data forms will be de identified after the chart review prior to analysis. [ADDRESS_354741] manuscript completion the dat a both 
electronic and paper will be destroyed using current departmental approved methods of destruction.

Version No. PR-0001.04 CONFIDENTIAL     Page 7 of 88 each ALD403 group vs. placebo will be performed using a 5% 
two-sided alpha level.  Three hundred and fifty  subjects per 
group provides at least 90% power for the primary endpoint  
assuming a treatment effect of at least [ADDRESS_960322] deviation of 4 days or less.  For the key secondary 75% responder rate endpoints 90% power is achieved for the pair- wise 
comparisons, assuming a placebo responder rate of 20%, and an 
ALD403 rate of 31%. 
Statistical Analysis  Efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized wit h 
descriptive statistics.  
Statistical inferential testing of the primary  efficacy endpoint  and 
key secondary endpoints will be performed while  maintaining a 
study wide type- I error rate of two sided 5%.  The primary 
analyses  will test for a difference between the active treatment 
groups and placebo in Weeks 1-12, change in frequency of 
migraine days.  The primary analyses  will be based on ANCOVA 
model.    The migraine responder rates and percentage of subjects 
with a migraine on the day after dosing will be  tested with 
stratified Cochran  Mantel  Haenszel  (CMH) tests. The same 
stratification factors as used in randomization will be used to 
perform these tests.  Repeated measures will be used to test for the 
reduction in migraine prevalence from baseline to Week  4.  
The migraine days reported during the initial 28- days of 
screening will be used as baseline.  Following treatment, migraine data will be summarized and analyzed in 28 day intervals (e.g. Weeks 1 -4, 5-8, 9-12).  The change from baseline 
in migraine day s for a given 4- week interval will be the 
difference between migraine days in that interval and the migraine days during baseline.  The Week [ADDRESS_960323], will be the average of the change from baseline results from each  of the three intervals.  
A 75% responder, for a given 4- week interval, will be a subject 
with a ≥ 75% reduction in migraine days during that interval.  A 
75% responder over Weeks 1- [ADDRESS_960324] who achieves 
average reduction of ≥ 75% over this time  period based upon the 
Week [ADDRESS_960325] their missing data imputed.   
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  The concentrations of ALD403 will be measured in plasma from 
all ALD403 treated subjects using a validated assay method.  
The PK analysis of plasma will include determination of the free 
ALD403 concentrations at the following times:  Day 0 (within  1 
hour before dosing), immediately post-dose ( withi n 15 minutes of 
end of infusion), Weeks  2, 4, 8, 12 (within 1 hour before dosing), 
24, and 32.

ALD 403 is a  humanized anti -(calcitonin g ene-r elated peptide) (CGRP) monoclonal antibody 
(anti-CGRP) that is being developed by [CONTACT_169030], Inc. , for the prophylaxis of 
migraine.  
5.2. Background  
Migraine is a highly prevalent paroxysmal neurological disease characterized by [CONTACT_313402][INVESTIGATOR_706920], gastrointestinal, and sensory function.

of function.  However, approximately 2.5% of people with epi[INVESTIGATOR_313385], meaning they are experiencing migraine on greater 
than [ADDRESS_960342] 3 consecutive months.4  For  those with chronic migraine, the 
headaches are more intense; migraine-associated symptoms, more severe; and the disease- related 
impact and disability are much greater than observed for epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].5  In addition, chronic 
migraine is associated with more co -morbid diseases such as anxiety, depression, and non-
headache pain.6  
The pathophysiology of migraine is complex and incompletely understood.  Current models of migraine are based on a genetically determined hyper -excitable nervous system characterized by 
a lowered threshold to sensory activation and uniqueness in its sensory processing.
7  Interactions 
between this migraine nervous system and specific internal and external stimuli (migraine 
triggers) can result in activation of the trigeminovascular system (TVS).  Once activated the TVS

cervical nociceptors. The ensuing peripheral nociceptive stimuli synapse in the Trigeminal 
Nucleus Caudalis to ultimately create a state of central sensitization.8  Clinically, this process is 
observed as a fully developed attack of migraine.   
Central to this model of migraine is calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP).  CGRP is one of the 
most abundant peptides in the human body and is produced in both peripheral and central 
neurons.  It is abundant in trigeminal neurons and when released is involved in the vasodilation, 
inflammatory cascade, and pain transmission associated with migraine.   In both peripheral and 
central pain pathways CGRP is associated with pain transmission and neuronal sensitization.9 
Intravenous (IV) infusions of CGRP can cause a migraine- like headache in susceptible 
individuals with migraine.[ADDRESS_960343] the nervous system from generating migraine.  Acute treatments are used 
intermittently only as needed to stop an attack while preventative treatments are used on a 
sustained basis for periods of month to years. Acute treatment while generally quite effective can 
actually worsen the severity and frequency of migrain e when used too frequently, a condition 
called medication overuse headache (MOH).[ADDRESS_960344] been designed specifically for migraine.  These commonly include tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, and 
certain anticonvulsants.  It is estimated that 45% of adults with frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_706922] 12% of this population are currently using a migraine preventive.

ALD403 is a genetically engineered humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds 
to human-α-CGRP with an affinity of 1.5E-11 M and  human-β-CGRP with an affinity of 5.7E-
11 M.  
5.3.1. Summary  of Nonclinical Studies  
A nonclinical te sting program has been conducted supporting the use of ALD403 in clinical 
trials .  More detailed discussion is provided in the current version of the ALD403 Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
ALD403 is a genetically engineered humanized IgG1 antibody that binds to α- and β- forms of 
human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat CGRP. The amino acid sequence for α- and β- CGRP  is 
identical in cynomolgus monkeys and humans (data on file); therefore the  in vitro binding 
characteristics of cynomolgus monkey and human CGRP to ALD403 would be 
indistinguishable. Rat α-CGRP is one amino acid different from human α-CGRP and rat β- CGRP  
is 3 amino acids different from human β-CGRP. Based on comparable binding affinity and in 
vitro potency for rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human α- and β-CGRP, the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey were selected for nonclinical safety assessments . 
Pharmacodynamic activity by [CONTACT_169032]403 in the species selected for toxicological investigations 
(rats, rabbits, and monkeys) was confirmed in vivo by [CONTACT_706932]403 to inhibit CGRP- mediated neurogenic dermal vasodilation . 
In the single -dose nonclinical toxicology studies, the no- observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) 
for IV administration of ALD403 to rats and cynomolgus monkeys was 100 mg/ kg. 
Toxicological investigations  in rats  and monkeys indicated that repeated -dose IV of ALD403 at 
10, 30, or 100 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks was well tolerated , with no signs of adverse 
effects related to treatme nt. Under the conditions of these studi es, the no- observed -adverse-
effect -level (NOAEL) for once weekly IV administration of ALD403 to rats or monkeys for four 
weeks was 100 mg/kg. 
A chronic multiple -dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the 
potential effects b y ALD403 following 6-months administration via slow bolus injection once

19,600/6,160 μ g/mL; mean AUC  (0-2wk) of 1,610,000/904,000 μ g·h/mL for males/females, 
respectively).  
ALD403 is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal materials, and genotoxicity assessments have not been conducted. The carcinogenic potential for ALD403 has 
not been thoroughly investigated. The results of toxicological and clinical investigations to date 
with ALD403 have provided no indications of effects with the potential to support or induce the 
proliferation of malignant cells.  
Definitive  embryo -fetal development studies with ALD403 in rats and rabbits have been 
conducted.  T he administration of ALD403 by [CONTACT_33980] (slow bolus) injection to pregnant 
female rats on Days 6, [ADDRESS_960347] coitum, at 75 or 150 mg/kg/dose was well tolerated, and t here was no 
evidence of embryo -fetal mortality (embryolethality), alterations in growth (fetotoxicity),  or 
structural abnormalities ( teratogenicity) in either species.   
The local tolerance of ALD403 was assessed following repeated -(once weekly) dose studies in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys utilizing ALD403 administered IV. Following the end-of-
treatment,  no gros s or microscopic lesions were observed in the ALD403 injection sites excised 
from rats. In the injection sites obtained from cynomolgus monkeys, only procedure- related 
findings were observed and included  (in order of decreasing incidence) minimal and/or mild

This is  a parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of two infusions of 
ALD403 or placebo in patients with  chronic migraine.  Subjects who provide informed consent 
will be evaluated f or eligibility based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized 28-30 days after the screening visit and treated (first dose) 
on Day 0, within 8 days after the randomization visit. Treatment includes two infusions of 
ALD403 or placebo administered on Days 0 and 84 (Week 12).  Subjects will be followed for 20 
weeks after the final  dose for total study duration of approximately 36 weeks , including the 
screening period .

Version No. PR-0001.04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 88 Approximately 1050 subjects will be randomized and treated. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, 
and immunogenicity assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events 
presented in Section  2.   
7.3. Data Monitoring Committee  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) of qualified members will be formed to review trial data 
generated during the clinical trial. These members will not be otherwise affiliated with  the 
Sponsor, and will not be connected with management of the clinical trial.  
The primary focus of the DMC will be the safety of the clinical trial subjects. Based on the reviews and assessments of the data, the DMC will inform the Sponsor of any safety concerns 
and provide recommendations about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], modifying, or continuing the clinical trial. The 
DMC may also advise the Sponsor on the validity of continuing the trial and the scientific merit 
of the clinical trial.  The DMC is not tasked with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706923] .  
DMC reviews will be conducted periodically throughout the study as outlined in the DMC 
Charter . 
7.4. Methods to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
To minimize bias, this clinical trial is randomized, double-blinded,  and placebo controlled.  At 
the point of in fusion, there are no obvious differences between ALD403 and placebo, and there 
are no known ALD403- specific safety or tolerability signals that could potentially unblind 
subjects and clinical trial staff.  ALD403 is expected to have a fairly substantial impact on 
migraine frequency;  however, the placebo effect in migraine studies is also reasonabl y large . 
Therefore , reduction in migraines is insufficient to deduce treatment assignment.

Randomization will occur 28-[ADDRESS_960361]’s schedu le will not permit an on -site visit. Sites will 
complete randomization in IWRS , and the randomization assignment will be obtained by  [CONTACT_706934]’s unblinded pharmacist or designee.  Subjects will be randomized in equal ratios 
to one of the trea tment groups.  Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. 
Stratification will be by [CONTACT_706935]  (<17 days vs. ≥17 days)  and 
prophylactic medication use during the 3 months prior to screening ( prophylactic medication  use 
vs. no prophylactic medication use) .  
Prophylactic medication use for migraine will be determined at screening based upo n the

• Suicidal ideation with  intent, with or without a plan (i.e., ‘yes’ to suicidal ideation 
questions 4 or 5) or any suicidal behavior as determined by [CONTACT_941] C -SSRS.        
Subjects discontinued due to suicidal ideation and or suicidal behavior must be referred to a 
mental health specialist as specified in Section  11.1.9. 
Study treatment may  also be discontinued for the following reasons: 
• Adverse Event  
• Subject decision  
• Investigator decision  
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_194480] a subject discontinues study treatment due to a medical condition , Investigators must provide

discontinue the study without any further procedures. 
8.4.5. Replacement Policy  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the clinical trial after randomization will not be replaced , 
including subjects who withdraw between randomization and treatment.  However, the target 
sample size is based upon the number of subjects randomized and treated. 
8.4.6. Lost to Follow- Up 
If the subject fails to attend scheduled study visits or to respond to requests for follow-up, the 
clinical trial site will send a registered letter, at a minimum, to the subject requesting contact [CONTACT_313407].  All attempts to resume contact (including copi[INVESTIGATOR_313388]) will be included in the source

Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960364]   
ALD403 is an anti -(calcitonin gene- related peptide) humanized monoclonal antibody (anti-
CGRP mAb) that is being developed by [CONTACT_169030], Inc., for the prevention of 
migraine.   
ALD403 Injection, 100 mg/vial, is presented in 2-mL Type I glass vials as a single -use 
preservative- free sol ution for IV administration.  ALD403 is formulated at a concentration of 
100 mg/mL with a pH of 5.8.  Those subjects randomized to the ALD403 tr eatment group will 
receive an IV infusion of ALD403 Injection in 100 mL of 0.9% saline.   
9.2. Placebo  
Placebo will b e supplied as a single -use preservative- free solution in a 2- mL Type I glass vial 
formulated  with the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_706925]403, without the active ingredient. Those subjects 
randomized to placebo will receive  an IV infusion Placebo in 100 mL of 0.9% saline . 
9.3. Investigational Product  Dosing and Administration  
The pharmacist or designee responsible for receiving, storing, preparing  and dispensing ALD403 
and placebo IV infusions will be unblinded and will not be responsible for other aspects of the 
clinical trial where blinding is necessary. Dosing must occur within 8 days after  randomization. 
Doses of ALD403 or placebo ( total volume of 100 mL) will be administered IV over a period of 
30 (+15) minutes  on Day 0 and Week 12 (Day 84 ±3 days) by [CONTACT_706936] (infusions may be administered for a total duration of up to 1 hour, if needed, in the 
judgement of the Investigator).  
If the subject experiences a headache or migraine on dosing day  and has no other clinically 
significant findings on Day 0, dosing may occur if it does not compromise the safety of the 
subject in the judgment of the Investigator.  The Medical Monitor may be consulted as needed.  
Subjects must remain in the care facilit y and be monitored by [CONTACT_313410] [ADDRESS_960365] ed to stay longer than 2 hours after dosing should the investigator 
determine this  is clinically warranted  (e.g., subjects should be observed until all AEs are resolved

the source record.  
Further instructions on preparation and procedures associated with administering the IV can be 
found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.3.1. Packaging and Labeling 
Before the shipment to the investigative sites, Investigational Product (IP)  will be labeled with 
information required by [CONTACT_17513], such as a statement that it is limited to 
investigational use. Investigational Product to be administered to the subject will be labeled  by

This clinical trial is double-blinded , meaning the subjects and site personnel are blinded to 
treatment assignme nt, except for  the clinical trial site’s unblinded pharmacist or designee. The 
study site must have a written plan in place to ensure blinding is adequately maintained for the 
study.  If the blind is broken, the date, time , and reason must be recorded. The blind should only 
be broken for reasons in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical to the 
management of subject safety . The P rincipal Investigator will report any cases of unblinding to 
the S ponsor within [ADDRESS_960366] /Placebo  will be stored at a central depot  or at the clinical site at -20°C

for [ADDRESS_960370]  3 months prior to screening and there are no alterations to their regimen 
through Week 24.  In general, changes to prophylactic headache medications during the trial are 
not allowed through Week 24.  At the discretion of the Investigator, on a case by [CONTACT_342643] e basis, 
changes to the regimen that might be clinically warranted may be made prior to Week 24 after consulting with the Medical Monitor and obtaining approval. 
Sites are required to indicate if a medication is used for prophylaxis purposes or if it is us ed for 
the acute treatment of migraines. The Investigator should reevaluate the patient’s risk factors 
relative to the prescribing information for both prophylactic and acute treatments that the patient is using, and judge that the use of these medications continues to be considered safe. 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960371] an onsite randomization visit; however, a phone visit is 
acceptable in cases where the subject’s schedule will not permit an onsite visit.   
All subjects will be randomized via the IWRS (Interactive Web Response System) after the following :   
• Eligibility has been approved by [CONTACT_1689] 
• Review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject continue s to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.

collected  in source records and in the CRF.   
10.2.3. Medical History  
Significant historic and current medical conditions or illnesses, allergies to medications, and 
prior surgical interventions will be recorded in the source records and in the CRF.  Symptoms 
that are ongoing at the time of informed consent will be c onsidered medical history. 
Migraine history will also be collected in the source records and the CRF, including age at  
diagnosis of chronic migraine as well as other details of the subjects’ history with migraine.   If 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960372]’s related medical history and 
review of systems are negative.  For all other visits that call for a physical examination, the body 
systems examined will be at the discretion of the Investigator.   
Each physical examination will include weight measurement.  Height will be measured at 
screening only.  
Abnormal physical examination findings at the screening visit will be recorded as medical 
history.  Any new or worsening physical examination finding identified after informed conse nt 
will be considered an AE. 
10.2.5. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure (BP)  and pulse, will be measure d at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments in Section  2. 
When measuring vital signs, the subject should be seated comfortably, with back supported and 
rested for [ADDRESS_960373] 80% around the arm.  The center of the bladder should be in line with the brachial artery so 
as to allow the stethoscope diaphragm clear access to the brachial artery.  Site staff and subject 
should refrain from talking during the reading.

11.1. Adverse Events  
11.1.1. Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investig ation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tem porally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. (ICH E6) 
11.1.2. Assessment of Adverse Event s 
The Investigator is required to monitor the occurrence of adverse events for each subject from 
the time of informed consent through the course of the clinical trial.  Adverse events may be 
reported by [CONTACT_423], reported by a caregiver, or reported by [CONTACT_706941]-ended questioning, through physical examination, laboratory 
test, documentation in medical records, or by [CONTACT_11174].  Adverse events include: 
• Any new undesirable medical experience or an unfavorable and unintended change of an 
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related 
to the Investigational Product. 
• Any abnormal assessment or laboratory findings considered by [CONTACT_313417] .  Clinically significant f indings include but are not limited to those 
that lead to discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic 
intervention, or require a change in subject management . 
A new  or worsening of a pre -existing or chronic condition is considered an adverse event and 
must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed 
consent into the clinical trial, will not be considered an adverse event unless the condition 
worsen s.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE eCRF.   
Pre-existing medical conditions of clinical significance must be included in the subject’ s medical 
history and recorded on the medical history eCRF page.  
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960378] 
to the following; seriousness, severity, and relationship to Investigational Product, as outlined 
below. 
Seriousness  
An adverse event or suspected  adverse event is considered serious if in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in; 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening (this means that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169016] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition ( 21 CFR 
312.32(a ) and ICH E2A) . 
Of note:  
• A social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643]-admissions not due to an acute medical issue) is not considered an SAE  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a greater than 24 hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
Severity  
The severity of an AE will be graded as follows: 
• Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -011  
Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
31-Aug-2017 
 
Version No. PR-0001.04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 88 • Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL ). 
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL.  
• Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade [ADDRESS_960379] 
The Investigator is required to assess the causality/relationship between each AE and the 
Investigational Product as not related or related and record the assessment on the source 
documents and in the eCRF AE page. Medical judgment should be used to determ ine the likely 
relationship of the AE to the Investigational Product considering all relevant factors including (but not limited to) relevant history, concomitant medical condition and concomitant 
medications.  Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, biologic 
plausibility, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or 
absence) of a more likely cause.   
Not Related:  It is plausible that the AE has an etiology other than the Investigational 
Product (e.g., pre-existing condition, underlying disease, concomitant medical condition, or concomitant medication).  
Related:  The AE cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
concomitant medical condition or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and a temporal relationship 
exists between the event onset and administration of the Investigational Product.  
11.1.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Event reporting will extend from time of informed consent until completion of the final visit. Serious adverse events occurring  after the end of th e clinical trial must be reported if the 
Investigator considers there to be a causal relationship with the Investigational Product.  
SAE Notification Form should be used to report any related  SAEs which occur after the end of 
the clinical trial.

Version No. PR-0001.04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 88 Adverse events (AEs) should be recorded on the AE eCRF, whether believed by [CONTACT_706942].  
AE reporting should contain: 
• A brief description of the event 
• Date of onset  
• Date of reso lution  
• Severity  
• Actions taken or treatment required  
• Relationship to Investigational Product  
• Outcome  
• Whether the event is considered serious 
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis into a single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] .” 
Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by [CONTACT_706943], unless it is associated with a clinical syndrome that has already

All SAEs tha t occur during the period of observation, whether considered to be related to the 
Investigational Product or not, must be reported within [ADDRESS_960380] be 
recorded in the source document.  To report the SAE, complete the eCRF AE page and indicate the reason for seriousness.  The minimum information required for an initial report is:

• Seriousness criteria  
• Relationship assessment  
After receipt of the initial report, the Medical Monitor or designee will review the information 
and, if necessary, contact [CONTACT_169049].  The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for information processing and reporting in 
accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
The Sponsor will determine if an SAE requires expedited reporting to regulatory agencies.  The 
clinical trial site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their EC/IRB according 
to the institution’s EC/IRB reporting requirements and i n accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements. 
Should the EDC System not be available, serious adverse events must be reported on the paper 
SAE Notification Form. Additional details can be found in the Site Manual .  This does not 
replace t he EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system once the 
system returns  to normal function. 
11.1.5. Unexpected and Related Serious Adverse Events  
Unexpected SAEs are those which:  
• Are not previously reported as associated with ALD403, as refe renced in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
• May be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an AE listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, but differ from the event due to greater severity, frequency or 
specificity.  
The Sponsor or designee will report, to the appropriate regulatory authorities according to local and regulatory requirements, unexpected SAEs which are considered related to ALD403 
(suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).  The clinical trial site personnel are 
responsible for reporting these events to their EC/IRB in accordance with applicable local and 
regulatory requirements.

In the event that a female subject becomes pregnant following administration of Investigational 
Product or may have been pregnant at the time of Investigational Product exposure, or the 
partner of a male subject  becomes pregnant following administration of Investigational P roduct, 
the pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor within five business days of the Investiga tor 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy information will be reported to the Sponsor using 
the Exposure In- Utero Forms  in EDC .  An Exposure In-Utero Notification Form should be used 
to report a pregnancy that occurs within [ADDRESS_960382] or congenital anomaly or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169017].  
Every attempt should be made to follow a pregnancy to conclusion.   
Follow-up information is to be collected by [CONTACT_169050] : 
• The course of the pregnancy including perinatal and neonatal outcome, premature 
termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage  
• Offspring information including birth weight and birth defects (if any)

term headache will encompass both headaches and migraine headaches.  The migraine and 
headache endpoints will be summarized in 4-week  intervals .  Specifically, migraine and 
headache endpoints will be summarized for the 4- week intervals : Week s 1-4, 5-8, 9-12,…21-24, 
the 12-week intervals : Weeks  1-12, 13-24, and the 24- week interval: Weeks 1 -24. 
Migraine Day  
A migraine day is defined as any day with a headache that meets the chronic migraine definition 
as outlined in the International Headache Society (IHS)  International Classification of Headache 
Disorders (ICHD, 3rd edition, beta version 2013), Section 1.[ADDRESS_960387] be present for a headache to be 
considered a migraine.  These characteristics define a migraine as a self -reported headache that :

a. Nausea and/or vomiting 
b. Photophobia and phonophobia 
Frequency, Change and Percent Change of Migraine Days /Headache Days  
The frequency of migraine days is the number of migraine days within four week intervals and 
the average four week frequency in twelve and twenty- four week intervals.  Change from 
baseline is the difference in frequency between baseline and the counts within these four week 
intervals.  The 12 and 24 week change is the difference in the frequency between baseline and 
the average of the, 4 week intervals.  The percent change is 100 times the ratio of the change and the baseline frequency.  Similar measures will be produced based upon headache frequency . 
Migraine/Headache Respo nder Rate 
Three responder rates  will be utilized : 50%, 75% and 100%.  A responder is a subject who 
achieves a ≥50% reduction, ≥75% reduction, or 100% reduction in migraine days, respectively. These reductions will be evaluated by [CONTACT_706945]. The same analyses will be conducted for headache 
days.  
Results from these four week intervals will be combined to produce 12 and 24 week responder 
endpoints.  T he Weeks 1 -4, 5-8, and 9- 12 change from baseline measures are averaged , and the 
average value is compared to baseline. A percent change from baseline is determined, which is used to determine the responder status.  A 75% migraine responder will be a subject who 
achieves the specified percent  reduction in migraine days within these intervals based upon the 
average change from baseline measures.  A 50% migraine responder will be similarly defined.   
A 100% migraine responder rate over Weeks 1-12, 13-24 and 1-24 is the average of the 100% 
responder rate for four week intervals that make up these intervals.  Hence, the 100% migraine 
responder rate over weeks 1 -12 is the average of the 100% migraine responder r ates in Weeks [ADDRESS_960390] migraine after dosing will be analyzed based upon the migraine data entered 
into the eDiary.   
Migraine Hours/Headache Hours 
Migraine hours are the sum of the duration of migraines within four week intervals, and the 
average four week duration within 12 and 24 week intervals.  Headache hours are similarly 
defined but include all headaches. Subjects with no migraines/headaches wi ll have a duration of 
zero.  
Acute Medication Usage 
The percent of migraines and headaches with acute medication use will be summarized.  Subjects with no migraines/headaches will be included with a rate of zero.  
Acute Migraine Medication Usage 
The number of days that subjects used acute migraine medication (i.e. triptan or ergotamine ) will 
be summarized in 4, 12, and 24 week intervals.  The 12 and 24 week results will be the average of the individual 4 week results that make up those wider intervals (e.g. the secondary endpoint 
of Weeks 1 -12 will be the average of the Weeks 1 -4, 5-8, and 9-12 results).  The change from 
baseline for these measures will be the difference between the post baseline interval and baseline.   
Percentage of subjects with a migraine on the day after dosing The percent of subjects with a migraine on the day after dosing will be summarized   
Reduction in migraine prevalence from baseline to Week 4 The average percent of subjects with a migraine on any given day during baseline and  the 
equivalent average rate over Week s 1, 2, 3 and 4 will be evaluated for the active and the control 
arms .   
Migraine/Headache Severity 
Headache severity will be collected on a 3 point scale: mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain.  
Subjects with no migraines/headaches will be concerned as having zero percent of severe pain

EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a d escriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five 
dimensions/questions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) 
each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no 
problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within  a 
particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D- 5L additionally includes a VAS scale.  Each item will 
be summarized separately.

Version No. PR-0001.04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 88 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Decision Rule  
A multiplicity  procedure will be used to account for multiplicity of dose levels for the primary 
endpoint and the key secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300 mg vs placebo 
comparison for the primary endpoint .  If this is significant, testing will continue to key secondary 
endpoints for 300 mg.  The procedure will then move on to the 100 mg group for the primary 
endpoint and subsequently the secondary endpoints.  Statistical testing will be conducted to 
maintain study wide two -sided 5% alpha level.   
13.2. Sample Size  
The planned sample size for this study is 1050 randomized and treated subjects.  These subjects 
will be allocated into 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_960396] 
90% power for the primary endpoint for each comparison assuming a treatment effect of at least 
[ADDRESS_960397] deviation of 4 days or less.  For the key secondary 75% responder 
rate endpoints 90% power is achieved for the pair -wise comparisons, assuming a pl acebo 
responder rate of 20%, and an  ALD403 rate of 31%.   These sample size calculations have been 
performed using Pass [ADDRESS_960398] occurred on or after the intake of

Version No. PR-0001.04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 88 trial medication, except if an incomplete date ( e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that the 
event started prior to treatment.  
Subjects who do not complete the eDiary daily will have missing data. It is expected that most 
missing eDiary  data will be sporadic.  If the eDiary has been completed at least 21 days in a 28 
day interval, then normalization will be used. The results will be normalized to 28 days by 
[CONTACT_169053] (i.e. if a subject does not 
complete the eD iary on [ADDRESS_960399] completed the eD iary on 82% of the days and the 
normalized results  will be the observed results  times 1.22).  If the eDiary has been completed on 
less than 21 days in the 28 day interval then the results for the 28 day interval will be a weighted function of the observed data for the current four week interval and the results from the previous 
interval.  The weights will be proportional to  how many days the eD iary was completed and will 
provide greater weight to the results from the current interval as the eDiary completion rate 
increases.  Specifically, the results will be derived as  
28�𝑊𝑊𝑋𝑋
𝑐𝑐+(1−𝑊𝑊)𝑋𝑋𝑝𝑝�, 
where W is the days the eD iary was completed/20, Xc is the available average daily results for the 
current interval and Xp are the average daily results for the previous interval.  
13.3.3. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations to be analyzed are as follows: 
Full Analysis Population: Randomized subjects who received Investigational Product /placebo . 
Subjects will be summarized within the treatment group to which  they were randomized. This 
population will be used for efficacy analyses. 
Safety Population: Includes all s ubjects who received at least one dose of Investigational 
Product/placebo. Subjects will be summarized within the treatment group for which they actually 
received treatment. This population will be used for the safety analyses. 
13.4. Statistical Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency and percentage.   
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960400] received trial drug. 
Demographic, baseline characteristics, migraine history and concomitant medications  (coded by 
[CONTACT_169054]) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490]. 
13.4.2. Effica cy Analyses 
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  The migraine and headache 
endpoints will be summarized by 4, 12, and 24 week intervals with the remaining endpoints 
being summarized by [CONTACT_95839].  
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Hypothesis testing will be performed for the primary endpoint: change in  frequency of migraine 
days (Weeks 1 -12).  This endpoint will be calculated as outlined in Section  12.1.2 and will 
utilize the missing data rules provided in Section  13.3.2.  Summary statistics including 
confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be used to summarize the results for the 
primary endpoint.  Testing will also be employed. The hypothese s tested are 
Ho: ∆ plb = ∆ 403  H a: ∆ plb ≠ ∆ 403 
where ∆403 is the change in migraine days  for subjects in the ALD403 treatment arm and ∆ plb is 
similarly defined for the placebo subjects.  The change from baseline is expected to be negative as migraines are being reduced.  While the test outlined above is two sided, as is the alpha level 
used for this study (i.e. 5%), clinically relevant results require a larger reduction of migraines on the ALD403 arms.   
An ANCOVA model will be used  to test for a difference between treatment arms.  This model 
will include the change from baseline measure as the response variable.  Treatment and the 
stratification variables: baseline migraine days (continuous predictor) and prophylactic 
medication use (use vs. no us e) will be the independent variables.   
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960401] migraine analysis will be descriptively 
summarized based upon Kaplan- Meier methods.    
The missing data rules  provided in Section  13.3.2 will be used for the key secondary endpoints, 
except for the percentage (prevalence) of subjects with a migraine  on the day after dosing 
endpoint.  Subjects who did not complete the eD iary on the day following dosing will be 
included in the prevalence rate calculation based upon their Week [ADDRESS_960402] a migraine will be included as a 0, and subjects who 
did not complete the eD iary will be included with a value between 0 and 1 equal to their 
prevalence rate in Weeks 1 -4 (i.e. the number of Week s 1-4 migraine days divided by 28).   
The reduction in migraine prevalence from baseline to Week 4 endpoint will be difference in 
daily prevalence rates between Week 1 and baseline, Week 2 and baseline, and so on.  The 
baseline daily prevalence will be calculated as the number of migraine days in baseline divided 
by 28.  The Week 1 daily prevalence will be the number of migraine days in Week 1 divided by 7, with a similar definition for Weeks 2, 3, and 4.  The same missing data approach for the day 
after dosing endpoint will be used for these weekly measures (i.e. any day the subject does not 
complete the diary will be assigned a value equal to the Weeks 1 -4 prevalence rate).  The 
treatment effect  will be evaluated usi ng a repeated -measures approach .
16  The model will specify 
an unstructured variance/covariance matrix and include the treatment group, visit, baseline value 
of the outcome variable and treatment group- by-visit interaction. The Kenward- Roger 
approximation will be used to estimate the degrees of freedom.  Pharmacokinetic Analys es

set to zero. In the log- scaled figures, concentrations below the LLOQ will be imputed as 
LLOQ/2.   Population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed on the results for ALD403 
concentrations obtained during this study in combination with the results from other studies of 
ALD403 in normal subjects and migraine patients.  
13.4.4. Safety Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
The incidence of all AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_82153]. These AEs will be classified  by 
[CONTACT_223264] 
(MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than 1 AE that was coded to the 
same preferred term/system organ class, the subjec t will be counte d only once for that specific 
preferred  term/system organ class . Events recorded between the time the informed consent is 
signed and the first Investigational Product administration will be listed.  
An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation, will be presented. For AEs presented by [CONTACT_926], the worst severity during the 
clinical trial will be presented for each subject.  
The subject incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_310185] d preferred term.

[IP_ADDRESS]. C-SSRS 
The C -SSRS assesses lifetime suicidality during an initial baseline evaluation, and then monitors 
suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior at subsequent follow- up assessments.   Four constructs are 
measured.  The first and second are the severity and intensity of ideation, rated on a 5-point ordinal scale.  The third is the behavior subscale, which is rated on a nominal scale and the fourth 
is the lethality  subscale, which assesses actual attempts.   These results will be reported at 
baseline and post baseline.  Results for individual time points  will be provided in a listing.

Investigator will be further informed of responsibilities and the procedures for ensuring adequate 
and correct documentation. 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical trial for each clinical 
trial subject . All information recorded on the CRFs for this clinical trial must be consistent with 
the subjects’ source documentation ( i.e., medical records).  
14.2. Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by [CONTACT_6231], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_119251]-investigator agrees to maintain adequate case histories for the patients treated as part of the 
research under this protocol. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]- investigator agrees to maintain 
accurate eCRFs and source docu mentation as part of the case histories. These source documents 
include , but are not limited to,  laboratory reports and original ECGs.  
14.3. Study Documentation  
Source document is defined as any hand written or computer generated document that contains 
medical information or test results that have been collected for or are in support of the protocol 
specifications, e.g., clinical laboratory reports, clinic notes, drug disbursement log, subject sign in sheets, subject completed questionnaires if applicable, telephone logs, ECGs, etc. All draft, 
preliminary and pre-final iterations of a final report are also considered to be source documents, 
e.g., faxed laboratory reports and hard copy laboratory reports, faxed initial results and hard

14.6. Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this clinical trial protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_706947]403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_960406] (or his/her legally authorized representative) according to the regulatory and legal 
requirements of the participating country. The consent forms must be dated and retained by [CONTACT_169059]. The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical trial until valid consent has been obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the CRF. Each 
subject will receive a fully -signed copy of each consent form that he/she signs for the clinical 
trial. 
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_169060] , and signed by [CONTACT_169061]. If subject or subject’s partner , becomes  pregnant 
during their  participation in the trial, a separate pregnancy  informed consent form will be 
obtained, to follow the pregnancy, any complications, and the health of the baby.  The pregnancy consent should be obtained at the time the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.  
14.8. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the clinical trial, the clinical trial protocol and/or other relevant documents 
will be approved by [CONTACT_107650] , in accordance with local legal requirements. The 
Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject 
is enrolled in the clinical trial. 
The procedures outlined in the protocol and e CRFs  will be carefully reviewed by [CONTACT_706948].  
No deviations from the protocol should be made except in emergency situations where 
alternative treatment is necessary for the protection, proper care and well -being  of subjects.

Sample 
Size The planned sample size for this study is 800 randomized and 
treated subjects.  These su bjects will be allocated into 
4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.  Pair- wise testing of each 
ALD403 group vs. placebo will be performed. Testing will be 
at the 5% alpha level. Two hundred subjects per group 
provides at least 95% power for the change from baseline test s 
individually assuming  a treatment effect of at least [ADDRESS_197240] deviation of 2.7 days or less.  For the key secondary 75% responder rate endpoints 95% power is achieved for the pair -wise comparisons, the 75% responder 
rates are 24% for placebo and 42% for ALD403. 
Statistical Analysis  The primary  periods for efficacy and safety for this study  are 
through Week 12 and 24, respectively.   The primary efficacy

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 104 evaluations will encompass results from Weeks 1 -12.  
Following Week 24, the study will continue so that long term 
safety data can be captured.  The efficacy analyses are based 
upon migraine days.  A migraine day is defined as any day with a migraine or probable migraine as outlined in the I HS 
classification IC HD-II. (migraine without aura, Section 1.1
11). 
Specifically, a migraine is defined as a self -reported headache 
which  meets each of the following conditions:  
1) lasted 4 to 72 hours
2) had at least 2 of the following: unilateral location ,
pulsating qual
ity, m oderate or severe pain intensity
and/or aggravation by [CONTACT_169029] , and
3) had at least 1 of the following: nausea and/or
vomiting  and/or photophobi
a and phonophobia.
A probable migraine is defined as a headache that meets only 
2 of the 3 criter
ia listed above.  The migraine days reported 
during the initial 28 -days following screening will be used as 
baseline. Following treatment, migraine data will be 
summarized and analyzed in 4 week intervals, 12 week 
intervals  and a 24 week interval .  A 75% responder for a given 
four week interval will be a subject with at least a 75% 
reduction in migraine days during that interval.  A 75% 
responder over a [ADDRESS_197241] who achieves an average reduction  of 75% o ver the twelve weeks.  
The 50% and 100% responder rates are similarly defined.  The

descriptive statistics.  Testing of the  key secondary responder 
rate endpoints and the primary Weeks 1 -12, change from 
baseline in migraine day endpoint will be performed.  The 
testing of the primary endpoint will be with an ANCOVA.

ALD 403 is a  humanized anti -(calcitonin g ene-r elated peptide) (CGRP) monoclonal antibody 
(anti-CGRP) that is being developed by [CONTACT_169030], Inc. for the prophylaxis of 
migraine.  
5.2 Background 
According to the International Classification of Headache Disorder, migraine is a common 
disabling primary headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours. Migraine 
headaches range from moderate to very severe and are debilitating. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_169004] 17 
percent of women and 6 percent of men.  Migraine frequency is divided into epi[INVESTIGATOR_169005] e pi[INVESTIGATOR_169006]  <15 migraine days and chronic migraine by ≥[ADDRESS_197253] work time and diminished productivity from 
migraine costs American employers $225.8 billion. Forty percent of adults with epi[INVESTIGATOR_169007]; yet, 
only about 12 percent of adults with migraines take preventive medication. This is largely due to 
poor tolerability and/or lack of efficacy of currently marketed drugs for the prevention of 
migraine. There is therefore a need for new therapeutic alternatives
1. 
CGRP is a member of the calcitonin  fami ly of peptides , which in humans exists in two forms, α-
CGRP and β-CGR
P. α- CGRP is a 37 -amino acid  peptide and is formed from the alternative 
splicing of the 
calcitonin/CGRP gene located on chromosome 11. The less -studied β- CGRP 
differs i
n three amino acids (in humans) and is encoded in a separate gene in the same vicinity of 
the genome. 
CGRP is one of the most abundant peptides produced in both peripheral and central neurons . It is 
the most potent pept
ide vasodilator  and can function in the transmission of pain. In the spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232], the function a
nd expression of CGRP may differ depending on the location of synthesis. 
CGRP is derived mainly from the cell bodies of motor neurons when synthesized in the ventral 
horn of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_169008].

ion of the nociceptive  state, both of which may contribute to the 
mechanism of migraine . 3, 4 
During migraine attacks, there is an increase i n the plasma levels of C GRP in the external jugular 
vein. 5 In addition, intravenous (IV) infusion of CGRP causes migraine and headache in patients 
with migraine, suggesting that the increase in CGRP observed during spontaneous migraine attacks plays a cau sative role .

CGRP is thought to play an important role in migraine by [CONTACT_162155], thereby [CONTACT_169031] (CNS) .4, [ADDRESS_197255] 
ALD403 is a genetically engineered humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds to human-α-CGRP with an affinity of 1.5E-11 M and  human-β-CGRP with an affinity of 
5.7E-11 M.  
5.3.1 Summary  of Nonclinical Stu
 dies 
A nonclinical testing program has been conducted supporting the use of ALD403 in clinical 
trials . More detailed discussion i
s provided in the current version of the ALD403 Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 104 ALD403 is a genetically engineered humanized IgG1 antibody that binds to α- and β- forms of 
human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat CGRP. The amino acid sequence for α- and β- CGRP  is 
identical in cynomolgus monkeys and humans (data on file); therefore the  in vitro binding 
characteristics of cynomolgus monkey and human CGRP to ALD403 would be 
indistinguishable. Rat α-CGRP is one amino acid different from human α-CGRP and rat β- CGRP  
is 3 amino acids different from human β-CGRP. Based on comparable binding affinity and in vitro potency for rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human α- and β-CGRP, the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey were selected for nonclinical safety assessments . 
Pharmacodynamic activity by [CONTACT_169032]403 in the species selected for toxicological investigations 
(rats, rabbit
s, and monkeys) was confirmed in vivo by [CONTACT_169033]403 to inhibit CGRP-mediated neurogenic dermal vasodilation.  In rats, changes in dermal blood perfusion were measured using Laser Doppler, while in rabbits and monkeys a 
Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA) imaging system was utilized.  The parenteral 
administration of ALD403 inhibited increases in dermal blood perfusion induced by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_169009], and intravenous ALD403 administration in rabbits 
inhibited increased dermal blood perfusion secondary to intradermal β- CGRP challenge.  
The toxicokinetic profile for ALD403 has been evaluated follow ing singl
 e and once weekly 
repeated -dose IV administrations for four weeks in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and following 
administration once every two weeks for 6 -months in cynomolgus monkeys.  
The plasma concentration profiles for ALD403 following single or repeated- dose IV 
admini
strations in rats or cynomolgus monkeys were characterized by [CONTACT_169034]-
exponential decline. The plasma half -life for ALD403 ranged between 102-155 hours following 
single administration in rats, and 142 to 323 hours following single or multiple weekly administrations in cynomolgus monkeys. The distribution for ALD403 appeared limited to the 
vascular compartment, and the systemic exposure was dose proportional from 10 to 
150 mg/kg/dose. No gender differences were observed among any of the toxicokinetic parameters evaluated.  
In the single -dose nonclinica

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 104 Toxicological investigations  in rats  and monkeys indicated that repeated -dose IV administration 
of ALD403 at 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks was well tolerated , with no signs 
of adverse effects related to treatment. Under the conditions of these studies, the no- observed -
adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) for once weekly IV administration of ALD403 to rats or monkeys 
for four weeks was 100 mg/kg. 
A chronic multiple -dose toxicol ogy study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to evaluate the 
potential effects b y ALD403 following 6-months administration via slow bolus injection once 
every two weeks (a total of fourteen dosing occasions) at 0, 20, 50, or 150 mg/kg/dose followed 
by a three month recovery period in select animals.  The foll owing parameters were evaluated in t his study: c
 linical signs, body weights, food 
consumption, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, ophthalmology, 
electrocardiology, clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, 
and urinalysis), insulin analysis, flow cytometry parameters, toxicokinetic parameters and anti -
drug antibody (ADA) formation, gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations.  
Following the sixth dosing occasion on study day 71, one low-dose (20 mg/kg/dose) female 
animal exhib
ited an anaphylactoid -like reaction and died within approximately [ADDRESS_197256] -level (NOAEL).  
There were no ALD403- related clinic al signs or changes in  body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmology, electrocardiology, blood pressure, heart  rate, body temperature, clinical 
pathology, insulin, or flow cytometry parameters. There were no ALD403- related effects on 
organ weights or organ weight ratios. Additionally, there were no ALD403- related macr oscopic 
or microscopic changes . 
The presence of  ADA was confi rmed in 5/10 (50%) animals from the 20 mg/kg group, 5/10 
(50%) animals from the 50 mg/kg group, and 11/14 (79%) animals from the 150 mg/kg group. 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_197257] exposure. 
Administration of ALD403 via intravenous (slow bolus) injection once every 2 weeks for approximate ly 
6-months (for a total of 14 doses) did not result in any treatment -related effects 
upon the parameters evaluated in this study.  T he NOAEL for ALD403 following chronic 
administration in monkeys was considered to be 150 mg/kg/dose (Day 183 mean C max of 
19,600/6,160 μ g/mL; mean AUC  (0-2wk) of 1,610,000/904,000 μ g·h/mL for males/females, 
respectively).  
ALD403 is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal materials, and genotoxicity
 assessments have not been conducted. The carcinogenic potential for ALD403 has 
not been thoroughly investigated. The results of toxicological and clinical investigations to date with ALD403 have provided no indications of effects with the potential to support or induce the 
proliferation of malignant cells . 
Range -finding embryo-fetal development studies with ALD403 have been completed  to suppor
 t 
the selection of dosages for use in definitive studies.   T he administration of ALD403 by 
[CONTACT_33980] (slow bolus) injection to pregnant female rats on Days 6, [ADDRESS_197258] coitum, at 75 or 
150 mg/kg/dose was well tolerated, and there was no evidence of embryo -fetal mortality 
(embryolethality ), alterations in growth (fetotoxicity), or structural abnormalities ( teratogenicity ) 
in either species.  The definitive embryo -fetal development studies with ALD403 in pregnant rats 
and rabbits are currently in  progress.   
The local tolerance of ALD403 was assessed following repeated -(once weekly ) dose studies in 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys utilizing ALD403 administered IV. Following the end-of-
treatment,  no gross or microscopic lesions were observed in the ALD403 injection sites excised 
from rats. In the injection sites obtained from cynomolgus monkeys, only procedure- related 
findings were observed and included  (in order of decreasing incidence) minimal and/or mild 
superficial perivascular infiltrates, fibroplasia/fibrosis, myointimal hyperplasia of the injected 
vein, hemorrhage, and sporadic observ ations in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_169010].

marked  suppression of capsaicin-induced skin blood flow at doses ranging from 30-1000 mg 
ALD403 given as a single intravenous infusion.   Prolonged suppression of capsaicin -induced 
skin blood flow for 12 weeks was observed following IV infusion of ≥ [ADDRESS_197259] (fourth) administration is C max = 110.2 µg/mL  and AUC  (0-12wk) =

mean C max and AUC (0-2Wk) systemic exposures, 19,600 µg/mL  in males and 6,160 µg/mL  in 
females , and 1,610,000 µg*hr/mL in males and 904,000 µg*hr/mL in females, respectively, 
observed in cynomolgus monkeys following a chronic 6-month evaluation of ALD403 
administered IV at the no -observed-adverse- effect -level (NOAEL) of 150 mg/kg once every 
2-weeks.
The high dose of [ADDRESS_197260] common  observed 
adverse events (>5%) with receiving ALD403 or placebo included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348], back pain, dizziness, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, and headache.  The majority of 
these adverse events were categorized as mild to moderate.  
Long term data with ALD403 is limited. 
•Healthy volunteer trials have included limited dosing, short duration of follow up and
have not include long term follow-up.
•Trials in migraine patients have also included limiting dosing.  These trials are currentlyongoi
ng and no new significant findings have been noted during the follow-up period to

The subjects randomized and dosed will continue the study for 56 weeks.  The se 56 weeks are 
divided i
nto two periods, i.e., a primary efficacy and safety period (Weeks 1 -24) and a long term 
safet y period (Weeks 25-56). Subjects will complete the eDiary daily through Week 48.   
Approximately 800 subjects will be randomized and treated. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, 
and immunogenicit
y assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events 
presented in Section 2.   
7.3 Data Monitoring Committee 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), which includes appropriately qualified members who are 
independent of the Sponsor, will be formed to consider safety data generated during the clinical 
trial. These members will be appointed externally by [CONTACT_1034], and will not be connected with 
management of the clinical trial.  
The primary focus of the DMC will be the safety experience of the clinical trial subjects. Based on the reviews a
nd assessments of the data, the DMC will inform the Sponsor of any safety 
concerns and provide recommendations about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], modifying, or continuing the clinical trial. The DMC may also advise the Sponsor on the validity of continuing the trial and the 
scientific merit of the clinical trial.  The DMC is not tasked with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_169012].  DMC analyses will be conducted per iodically through-out the study.

Alder BioPharmaceuticals , Inc., or designee, a statement that certifies the receipt and integrity of 
these supplies. A copy will be retained for the site clinical trial file.  
After completion of the clinical trial, the Investigator is responsible for either returning o r 
destroying  (if authorized by [CONTACT_2728]) all unused Investigational Product/P lacebo. The 
Invest igator must verify that no remaining supplies are in his/her possession. All used/partially 
used vials/IV bags will be destroyed onsite according to the site SOPs.  Where the Sponsor has

11 Assessment of Safety 
11.1 Adverse Events 
11.1.1 Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medica l occurren ce in a patient or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. (ICH E6) 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_197309], documentation in medical records, or by [CONTACT_11174].  Adverse events include: 
•Any new undesirable medical experience or an unfav orable and uninte
 nded change of an
existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related
to the Investigational Product.
•Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by [CONTACT_169046].  For example,  abnormal ECG or abnormal lab findings.
A new  or worsening of a pre -existi ng or chronic condition is considered an adverse event and 
must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed 
consent into the clinical trial, will not be considered an adverse event unless the condition 
worsens.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre-existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
Pre-existing medical conditions of clinical significance must be included in the subject’s medical 
history and r
ecorded on the medical history eCRF page.  
Each event recorded on the AE eCRF is required to be assessed by [CONTACT_169047]; se riousness, severity, and relationship to Investigational Product, as outlined 
below. 
Seriousness  
An adverse event or suspected  adverse event  is considered serious if in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in; 
•Death
•Is life -thre
atenin g (this mean s that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it
does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more
severe)

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 104 •Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169016]
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct
normal life
 functions.
•Congenital anomaly/ birth defect
•Importan
t medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening  or require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical
judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require medical or
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. ( 21 CFR
312.32(a ) and ICH E2A)
Severit
y 
The severity of an AE will be g raded as follows: 
oGrade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnosticobservations onl
y; intervention not indicated.
oGrade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;limiting age -app 
ropriate instrumenta l Activities of Daily Living (ADL ).
oGrade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threateni ng;
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting
self-care ADL.
oGrade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
oGrade [ADDRESS_197310] 
The Investigator is required to assess the causality/relationship between each AE and the 
Investigati
onal Product as not related or related and record the assessm ent on the source 
documents and in the eCRF AE page. Medical judgment should be used to determine the likely relationship of the AE to the Investigational Product considering all relevant factors including 
(but not limited to) relevant history, concomitant medical condition and concomitant 
medications.  Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, biologic

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 104 plausibility, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or 
absence) of a more likely cause.   
Not Related:  It is plausib le that the AE has an etiology other than the Investigational 
Product (e.g., pre-existing condition, underlying disease, concomitant medical condition, 
or concomitant medication).  
Related:  The AE cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinic al state, 
concomitant\medical condition or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and a temporal relationship 
exists between the event onset and administration of the Investigational Product.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_197311].  
SAE Notif ication Form should be used to report any related  SAEs which o ccur after the end of 
the clinical trial.   
Adverse events (AEs) should be recorded on the AE eCRF, whether believed by [CONTACT_169048] o
r not related to the Investigational Product.  
AE reporting should contain; 
•a brief description of the event,
•date of onset

•date of res
olution,
•severity,
•act
ions t
aken or treatment required,
•relations
hip to Investigational Product,
•outcome, and
•whethe

 event is considered serious.
Whenever possi
ble, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis into a
 single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be 
grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]”.

and, if necessa
ry, contact [CONTACT_169049].  The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for information processing and reporting in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee will determine if an SAE requires expedited reporting to regulatory agencies.  The 
clinical trial site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their 
EC/IRB according to the institution’s EC/IRB reporting requirements  and in accordance with 
applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
Should the EDC System not be available, serious adverse events must be reported on the paper SAE Notifica
tion Form. Additional details can be found in the Site Manual .  This does not 
replace the EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system once the 
system returns  to normal function.

Migraine Day 
A migraine day is defined as any day with a head ache that mee ts the migraine or probably 
migraine  characteristics as outlined in Section 7.  Specifically , a migraine is defined as a self -
reported headache which :

Frequency, Change and Percent Change of Migraine Days / Headache Days  
The frequency of migraine days is the number of migra ine days within four week intervals and 
the average four week frequency in twelve and twenty- four week intervals.  Change from 
baseline is the difference in frequency between baseline and the counts within these four week 
intervals.  The 12 and 24 week change is the difference in the frequency between baseline and 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -006

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 104 the average of the, 4 week intervals.  The percent change is 100 times the ratio of the change and 
the baseline frequency.  Similar measures will be produced based upon headache frequency . 
Migraine/ Headache Responder Rate 
Three responder rates  will be utilize d: 50%, 75% and 100%.  A responder is a subject who 
achieves a ≥ 50% reduction, ≥ 75% reduction, or 100% reduction in migraine days, respectively. 
These reductions will be evaluated by [CONTACT_169051] d ays to the 
migraine frequency in four week intervals.  
Results from these four week intervals will be combined to produce [ADDRESS_197320] who achieves the specified percent  reduction in 
migraine  headache d ays within these intervals based upon the averag e change from baseline 
measures .    
Migraine Hours / Headache Hours 
Migraine hours are the sum of the duration of migraines within four week intervals, and the 
average four w
eek duration within 12 and 24 week intervals.  Headache hours are similarly 
defined but include all headaches. Subjects with no migraines/headaches will have a duration of zero.  
Migraine Attack / Headache Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]

aine attack is defined as 1 continuously recorded migraine.  One a ttack may re sult in 
multiple migraine days.  Headache epi[INVESTIGATOR_169018].   
Migraine / Headache Severity 
Headache severity will be collected on a 3 point scale: mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain.

The number of days within 4 week intervals that subjects used acute migraine medication (i.e. 
triptan or e rgota
mine ) will be summarized in 4, 12 and 24 week intervals.  The 12 and 24 week 
results will be the average of the individual 4 week results that make up those wider intervals 
(e.g. the secondary endpoint of Weeks 1 -12 will be the average of the Weeks 1-4, 5- 8 and 
9-12 results).  The change from baseline for these measures will be the difference between thepost baseline interval and baseline.
Percentage of subjects with a migraine on the day after dosing The percent of subjects with a migraine on the day after first dose  will be summar
 ized.  
Time to First Migraine  
Time to the first migraine after dosing will be a nalyzed based upon the migraine data entered 
into the eDiary.   SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36 v2.0) The SF -[ADDRESS_197321] 4 weeks , see Appendix 15.3.  The eight sections measured 
are vitality

The EQ -5D- 5L is 
 a des criptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five 
dimensions/questions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) 
each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severity (no 
problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a 
particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ -5D-5L additionally includes a VAS sc ale.  Each item will 
be summarized separately.  
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_197322] (ASC -12) 
The ASC -12 includes 12 questions about the frequency of various allodynia symptoms in 
association wit
h headache attacks. For individuals with more than one type of headache, 
questions are directed to the “most severe type of headache.”  Each item is measured on a Likert 
type scale option with response categories: “Does not apply to me”, “never,” “rarely,” “less than 
half the time,” and “half the time or more, ” see Appendix  15.5.     ASC items were scored as 0 
(i.e., never, rarely, or does not apply to me), 1 (less than half the time), and 2 (half the time or 
more), yielding scores that ranged from 0 to 24.  In this study, if a single item is missing it will 
be scored as a zero.  If more than one item is missing the total score will be missing.  The

13 Statistical Considerations  
13.1 Decision Rule  
A serial  procedure will be used to account for multiplicity of dose level for the primary endpoint 
and the secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300 mg vs placebo comparison 
for the primary endpoint .  If this is significant, testing will continue to a subset of the key 
secondary endpoints for 300 mg (first the Weeks 1-4 75% responder endpoint, then the Weeks  1-12 75% responder endpoint, and then the Weeks 1 -12 50% responder endpoint).  The 
procedure will then move on to the primary endpoint for the 100 mg group and subsequently to the same subset of key secondary endpoints as tested for the 300 mg dose.  The procedure will 
then move on to the remaining key secondary endpoint for 300 mg and 100 mg (i.e., p ercentage 
of subjects with a migraine on the day after dosing ).  Only if all of these secondary endpoints

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 104 reach statistical significance will the 30 mg group be tested .  This testing algorithm is presented 
below. 
Statistical testing will be conducted at the 5% alpha level.  
13.2 Sample Size  
The planned sample size for this study is 800 randomized and treated subjects.  These subjects 
will be allocated into 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_197325] 95%

Summary statistics will be reported based upon observed data except for the diary data which

medication is incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of 
trial medication, except if an incomplete date ( e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that the 
event started prior to treatment.  
Subjects who do not complete the eDiary daily will have missing data. It is expected that most

Efficacy endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  The migraine and headache 
endpoints will be sum
marized by [CONTACT_66997] , twelve and twenty -four week intervals with the remaining 
endpoints being summarized by [CONTACT_95839].  
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Hypothesis testing will be performed for the primary endpoint: change from bas eline in migraine 
days from Weeks 1-12.  This endpoint will be calculated as outlined in Section 12.1.2 and will 
utilize the missing
 data rules provided in Section 13.3.2.  The hypotheses tested are  
Ho: ∆plb = ∆403 H a: ∆plb ≠ ∆403 
where ∆403 is the change in migraine days for subjects in the ALD403 treatment arm and ∆ plb is 
similarly defined for the placebo subjects.  The change from baseline is expected to be negative 
as migraines are being reduced.  While the test outlined above is two sided, as is the alpha level 
used for this study (i.e. 5%), clinically relevant results require a larger reduction of migraines on the ALD403 arms.   
An ANCOVA model will be used to  test for a dif
 ference between treatment arms.  This model 
will include the change from baseline measure as the response variable.  Treatment and the 
stratifica tion variable: baseline migraine days (continuous predictor) will be the independent 
variables.   
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Summary statistics including confidence interval for the treatment differences will be used to 
summarize  the res
ults for the secon dary endpoints. Testing will be performed for the key 
secondary endpoints and for the change in acute migraine medication days endpoint.  For the key 
secondary endpoints  (responder rates and  percentage of subjects with a migraine on the day after 
dosing ) this testing will utilize a CMH /extended CMH test.  The test s will be stratified by [CONTACT_22130] .  The change in acute migraine medication day endpoints wi ll 
be tested using an ANCOVA model similar to the one used for the primary endpoints:  change from baseline measure as the response, treatment and baseline acute migraine medication days as 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -[ADDRESS_197330] migraine analysis will be descriptively summarized

endpoint.  Subjects who did not complete the diary on the day following dosing will be included in the prev alence rate calculation based upon their month [ADDRESS_197331] a migraine will be included as a zero and subjects who did not

Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to 
kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual 
suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically fr om the beha vior or circumstances. For 
example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to  head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_169023] a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but  they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be 
inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm 
yourself?
Hav
e you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end  your life?  
D
id you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel 
better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt 
would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather  than an 
in
terrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from 
pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to ju mp, is grabbed and

5.3.2 Summary 
of Clinical 
Trials  23-26A double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, ascending 
dose phase 1 study (Protocol 
ALD403 -CLIN -001) to 
determine the safety and tolerability of ALD403 was conducted in two parts. In Part 
A (dose escalation), 1 of 7 
ALD403 dose levels (range 1 
mg to 1000 mg) or placebo was administered intravenously to healthy male subjects, and 
ALD403 300 mg or placebo 
was administered intravenously to healthy female subjects. Additionally, ALD403 100 mg or placeb o was subcutaneously 
(SC) administered to a cohort of healthy male subjects.  
In Part B, sumatriptan 6 mg was administer ed
 SC 4 hours after 
either ALD403 300 mg IV or 
placebo IV to healthy subjects.   
In this trial, a total of 55 
subjects recei
ved a single 
intravenous dose of ALD403 
(range 1 mg to 1000 mg) and 31 
subjects received a single dose of placebo, 12 subjects received a single subcutaneous dose of ALD403 (100 mg) and 6 
subjects received a single 
subcutaneous dose of placebo.  
A total of 179 treatmen t 
emergent ad
verse events 
(TEAEs) were reported during the trial period in 73 subjects (70.2%).   Only one serious adverse event (SAE) was 
reported.  This event was 
considered unrelated to ALD403.  There were no TEAEs that resulted in study Detailed descriptions of the

ALD403 inhibited capsaicin induced increases in skin blood flow (mediated by [CONTACT_169065]) in a dose dependent manner. The terminal eli mination half -life of 
ALD403 was approximately 28 days.  
In a second study of frequent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_169025] (Protocol 
ALD403 -CLIN -002), subjects 
with 5  to 14 migraine days per 
month were randomized to 
receive a single intravenous 
dose of ALD403 1000 mg or 
placebo in a double -blind 
fashion. The primary endpoint was the mean change in 
frequency of migraine headache 
days from baseline to Weeks 5 -
8. Subjects were followed for
24 weeks for additional safety
and efficacy analyses.
Of 174 subjects randomized,

ved either 
ALD403 (81) or placebo (82). There were no significant 
differences in baseline 
demographics or characteristics between the two treatment groups. The mean change in 
migraine days between Weeks

decrease)  vs. -4.6 (52%

for ALD403 and placebo was 
16% vs 0%, respectively ( p <

differences in the type or 
frequency of adverse events, vital signs, or laboratory safety data between the two treatment 
groups.  A single intravenous 
dose of ALD403 [ADDRESS_197347] AEs were transient and 
mild to moderate in severity. In 
the ALD403 treatment group, 46 (56.8%) subjects had at least 1 TEAE, and in the placebo group, 43 (52.4%)  subjects had 
at least 1 TEAE. Three subjects (2 in the ALD403 group; 1 in the placebo group) had a total of 6 SAEs, all of which were considered unrelated. There 
were no TEAEs that resulted in 
study drug infusion interruption, death, or study discont inuation; no TEAEs 
were considered to be life-
threatening/disabling, or fatal.  
A second clinical trial 
(ALD403 -CLIN -003) 
in healthy 
volunteers has been completed.  The trial was a multiple dose, placebo -controlled trial to 
determine the safety, tolerabilit y, pharmacodynamics, 
and pharmacokinetics of ALD403 administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers.

13.1 Decision 
Rule  62-63 A serial procedure will be used 
to account for multiplicity of dose level for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300 mg vs 
placebo comparison for the 
primary endpoint.  If this is significant, testing  will continue 
to the key secondary endpoints for 300 mg (first the Weeks 1 -4, 
75% responder endpoint and then the Weeks 1 -12 75% 
responder endpoint).  The procedure will then move on to the 100 mg group the primary 
endpoint and subsequently the 
secondary endpoints and then A serial procedure will be used 
to account for multiplicity of dose level for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints.  This procedure will start with the 300  mg vs 
placebo comparison for the primary endpoint.  If this is significant, testing will continue to a subset of the key secondary endpoints for 300 
mg (first the Weeks 1 -4 75% 
responder endpoint, then the

endpoint, and then the Weeks 1-12 50% responder endpoint).

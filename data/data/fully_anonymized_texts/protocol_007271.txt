Methodology Overview  
 This is an open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  
 
Up to twelve (12) p atients scheduled for amputation  will receive bone 
marrow cells concentrated ( BMAC ) via the BioCue™ Platelet 
Concentration Kit device injected IM at 25 sites in the leg proximal to 
the amputation in the index limb  to prevent ischemic wound 
complications after surgery . BMAC  will be injected into the anterior 
tibialis muscle (ATM)  below the point of amputation  for analytical 
purposes . Patients will be scheduled for amputation at Day  [ADDRESS_202613] 
injection. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_173253] (AE) during the 12 -month follow -up period. In subjects 
undergoing BKA, w e will compare rates of wound complications and 
conversion from BKA to AKA to historical controls at our institution to assess trends in therapeutic efficacy.    
 
Patients will undergo amputation  and injection sites will be harvested  
from the ATM  at that time. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) will 
determine capi[INVESTIGATOR_173227]. 
Angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines will be quantified using a 
multiplex array system a nd quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR).

IRB#  [PHONE_3746]   1 INTRODUCTION  
Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the endstage of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and occurs 
when there is insufficient blood flow to meet the resting metabolic demands of the leg. The clinical 
features of CLI are rest pain and gangrene, both heralding signs of limb loss.1 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_173231], approximately 40% of patients with CLI will require amputation of the affected extremity within one year.
2,[ADDRESS_202618] as much limb length as possible to promote independent ambulation with a limb prosthesis. Consequently,  below knee amputation (BKA) is the 
most common amputation procedure performed in the U.S.
4,5 However, contemporary studies and 
review of our own series demonstrate conversion rates from a BKA to AKA as high as 19% with the primary cause being ischemic wound complications of the myocutaneous flaps below the knee.
6,7 The 
physiological consequences of loss of the knee joint with AKA, as compared to BKA, is a 40 -60% increase 
in energy expenditure in ambulation with a prosthesis.8 This excessive effort results in a decreased rate 
of independent ambulation after AKA as com pared to BKA (< 33% vs. > 65%, respectively) and translates 
into decreased quality of life, increased institutionalization, and increased health care costs for AKA patients.

limit tissue destruction or enhance repair by a variety of mech anisms that include (a) secretion of 
bioactive proteins that act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion; (b) upregulation of genes that modulate 
excessive inflammatory and immune reactions; and (c) transfer of vesicular components that contain 
mitochondria an d microRNAs.

 The BioCue™ Blood and Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] ( BMAC ) Concentration System  is used to process blood 
and bone marrow as pi[INVESTIGATOR_173232]/or allograft 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The BioCue™ device is the exact same device as the MarrowStim™ PAD Kit that was used to treat subjects in prior versions of this protocol.  Treatment includes remov al of approximately 300 mL of 
bone marrow from the patient’s posterior or anterior iliac crest , which is then mixed with an 
anticoagulant solution and processed in the BioCue™  device to concentrate the autologous bone 
marrow cell suspension  for delivery .  The subsequent treatment utilizes this BMAC at the point of care 
by [CONTACT_173256].  The BioCue™  BMAC  product is hypothesized to function 
via angiogenic mechanisms .  To date there are no comprehensive descriptive analyses of the fate of 
BioCue™  BMAC  cells after transplantation in human tissue. Thus we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], Safety and

The BioCue™ Platelet Concentration Kit is indicated for use  in the clinical laboratory or intraoperatively at 
the point  of care for the safe and rapid preparation of platelet poor plasma and platelet concentrate 
(platelet rich plasma, or PRP) from a small sample of blood and bone marrow  mixture.   The design, 
materials,  and processing methods are identical to the previously cle ared GPS® II Platelet Concentration 
System in BK090008  and to the MarrowStim™ Concentration Kit  and MarrowStim™ Mini Concentration 
Kit in K071934 . The BioCue™ Separator is also identical in design to the MarrowStim™ Separators 
previously utilized in this investigation.  
 The BioCue ™ Separator ( Figure 1 ) has a 60 ml capacity and includes a density -tuned dual buoy 
separation system designed for the isolation and separation of nucleated cells.

2.2 Proposed Intended Use Statement  
Human  bone marrow preparations  induce angiogenesis, decrease muscle fiber apoptosis, and stimulate 
re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_173236]. Prio r to amputation, bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_173237] a BioCue™  device ( BMAC ), thus 
presenting a more clinically feasible and potent cell population that may improve tissue perfusion and 
mitigate ischemic wound complications after amputation .  
 
Concentrated , enriched, autologous, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_173238] . The BioCue™ device is  intended for investigational use only to 
concentrate BMA by [CONTACT_173257]. Hum an BMAC may only be administered IM to human subjects participating in clinical studies 
sponsored/approved by [CONTACT_173258], and who  meet all inclusion criteria and  
have provided formal written consent.  
 
3 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The principal objectives of this study are as follows:   
 Determine the safety and explore efficacy of BMAC  in preventing wound complications in 
amputations.  In a Phase I trial, BMAC  (up to 5 mL) will be injected into the ATM  below the point of 
amputation  in the index limb  in an area of approximately 3 x 10 x 3 cm. At the same time, BMAC (1 mL) 
will be injected at approximately 25 sites in the proximal leg to promote tissue perfusion before

injection. Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_173259] s during the 12-month 
follow -up period. Efficacy will be assessed by  [CONTACT_173260].  
 
Characterize the host tissue response to, paracrine activity of, and fate of transplanted BMAC . 
Patients will undergo amputation and injection sites  at the anterior tibial muscle (ATM) will be 
harvested at that time. Collection of up to [ADDRESS_202622] multi -dosing regi mens . This investigation will 
establish a unique clinical model that can expedite safety and mechanistic analyses of projects in  PAD 
that include bioscaffolds to enhance cell survival.
 16  
 Determine the effects of chronic limb ischemia and diabetes on ner ve function and to assess the 
effects of mesenchymal stem cell administration on their function.   Peripheral nerve tissue (sciatic, 
femoral, tibial, sural and/or plantar nerve segments) will be collected at the time of amputation from the amputated portion of the lower limb.  Patients with critical limb threatening ischemia, particularly 
with diabetes, have polyneuropathies that alter motor unit engagement and peripheral sensation leading to ambulatory dysfunction and pressure ulceration of the foot.

week post injections will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_173240]’s condition, so as to offer this research as an option to all eligible subjects.   
 
6.1.3  Handling, storage, accountability  
Autologous heparin -anticoagulated bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] ( 360 ml) is loaded into 6 Biocue™ 
separators through their center ports. The separator s are placed into the centrifuge and spun at 
3,200 RPM for 15 minutes . Following centrifugation, the BMAC containing the nucleated cells is re -
suspended within the fixed volume of fluid. The BMAC is then recovered from the separator by 
[CONTACT_108464] a syringe to the red capped port and extracting the cont ents. All steps (marrow harvest, 
BioCue ™ processing, BMAC administration) are performed at the point -of-care within a single 
procedure.  
Output characterization will be performed on a sample from a single BioCue™ separator chosen 
randomly. A sample will be pulled from one tube, assuming it is representative of all tubes.  The number of cells will be enumerated from one separator and multiplied by [CONTACT_173265] (6). In the case that a positive culture should result from the BioCue ™ product, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_173241] 48 hours. The patient will be assessed for evidence of infection including 
evidence of erythema at the site of the injection, fever (temperature > 100.9 F), and/or leukocytosis 
(white blood count >11K). In the event of  these clinical and laboratory findings, the appropriate 
antibiotic or antifungal agent will be instituted based on the culture results and recommendations of 
an Infectious Disease specialist. Follow up examinations and laboratory work will be scheduled based on the severity of symptoms and laboratory findings at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_173242].  
Sterility  testing  of the BioCue™ output will be performed  in accordance with  [ADDRESS_202630]’s research chart.  Bone

All sterility failures will be reported to the IRB and FDA as adverse events within 30 calendar days. The report will include results of the investigation into the cause of the event and any and all 
corrective actions taken to mitigate risks to future study subjects.  
Following the BioCue™ procedure,  laboratory  analyses  will be performed  on unconcentrated and 
concentrated  bone  marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26594].  Total  white blood cell (WBC) count,  mononuclear cell  
(MNC) count,  mononuclear cell  recovery  (concentrated  MNC/unconcentrated MNC),  granulocyte 
count, platelet  count,  cell viability, and  cell purity  (MNC/WBC) will  be recorded.   In addition,  total 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_173243],  total BioCue™ input volume,  total  BioCue™ output volume,  and total  delivery 
volume  will be recorded.   Additional information,  such  as CD marker characterization,  may  also be 
performed.   
6.1.4  Required training  
Operating room personnel will be instructed on the use of the BioCue™ Kit and the collection and 
transfer of bone marrow preparations. The study coordinator will be trained in the operation and management of the centrifugation system .

BMAC  Administration: A nterior Tibialis Muscle.  
On the day of BMAC  injection in the operating room of the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center , the 
index limb will be marked for amputation .  The injection site area is marked on the anterior 
compartment of the lower leg below the point of amputation. The BioCue™  product is injected along a [ADDRESS_202634] into the anterior tibialis muscle  (ATM) .  The injection site (s) will be marked with permanent ink 
on the ATM. The BMAC  suspension will be injected over 3 minutes  with the needle retracted 5 mm  
simultaneously to permit infiltration into the muscle.  
 
Ability to Recover BioCue ™ Injection Site s in Anteri or Tibialis Muscle.      
Retrieval of the BioCue ™ injection site s is accomplished at the time of amputation. The area demarcated

Needle biopsies may be performed below the knee at the time of cell injections or above the knee at the 
time of amputation to obtain skeletal muscle samples for histological and biochemical analysis.  There will 
be no additional MCS injections for this pur pose.   
Baseline Screening and Follow -Up Schedule. The following evaluations will be carried out at baseline to 
determine if the patient is eligible for study: (1) Baseline blood tests (complete blood count, serum 
chemistries , eGFR, hsCRP ); (2) medical his tory and physical exam; ( 3) concomitant medications; ( 4) 
pregnancy test for women of childbearing age; and (5) 12 lead ECG; and (6) LEADs and/or TcPO2 of 
index leg, as indicated .   In the interest of time to major amputation, we may collect data retroactiv ely to 
determine eligibility.   If eligibility can be determined based on recent prior clinical notes and laboratory 
values, we will use those values for our study purposes and omit corresponding tests from the baseline

IRB#  [PHONE_3746]   9.3 Planned Analyses  
The clinical study report will contain only summary data analyses reflecting safety profiles, and summary 
data analyses of efficacy.  All patient data will remain coded during analyses to maintain patient confidentiality.  
 The data management center for this trial will be at the CTSI, or a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be appointed by [CONTACT_079]. We will use a web -based HIPAA compliant online system 
for data entry and data management, as we are currently doing in our current clinical trials. Data will be 
collected from each enrolled patient using a comprehensive case report form and uploaded into a specifically designed database in the OnCore Enterprise Clinical Trial Management System  and VA 
REDCap system . All the data will be analyz ed and generated using SAS.   
 Safety Assessment. Primary attention will focus on the safety of the administration of BMAC  as 
measured by [CONTACT_3148]- related AEs. Treatment- related AEs will be categorized overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_173246]. Three categories of systems are cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or infectious. Two categories of 
severity will be serious adverse (SAE) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). For completeness, 
instances of AEs may appear in more than one category. Within each of these categ ories AEs will be 
listed in descending order of frequency for the treatment  group. In addition , for each category, the sum 
and difference between the two routes of delivery of the proportions will be reported as percent incidence. Binomial confidence Intervals at the 95% confidence level and p -values for these [ADDRESS_202638] in their deliberations. No adjustment for multiplicity will be made.   
 Exploratory Efficacy . Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore the 
effect of administration of BMAC  on the composite endpoint at 6-months o f death, revision o f 
amputation  and gangrene, and will be compared to historical cohorts at our institution. The null 
hypothesis of no change will be rejected if the pairwise confidence intervals does not include zero. The critical levels for the multiplicity adjustment will  be determined by [CONTACT_173272].   
 Quantities over time of BMAC  will be fit to an exponential decay curve using a residual pseudo -
likelihood procedure and cell half- life (λ) will be estimated.
18 Binomial confidence Intervals at the 95% 
conf idence level and p -values for these four groups after BMAC  transplantation will be calculated for the 
presence or absence of MHC expression and SDF -1 activation. Continuous confidence intervals at the 
95% level will be constructed to explore the difference s among the time- tiered administration of BMAC  
for (1) the CD34+CD133+ pro -angiogenic hematopoietic cells recruitment of HIF -1α/SDF -1/CXCR4 to 
ischemic muscle, (2) the quantify of capi[INVESTIGATOR_173247]3 1 counts, (3) VEGF -A,C,D, hep atocyte growth factor, angiopoietin -1 to characterize angiogenic 
cytokine expression, (4) percent coverage, fiber diameter and cross -sectional area to examine changes 
in morphology. The correlation between capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168] (CD 31 counts) with tissue perfusion (ICA) for 
each time point will be estimated by [CONTACT_4532]’s rank coefficient.

10 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
10.1 Adverse Events  
Reporting of adverse events will comply with federal regulations for IDE safety reporting.  AE s occurring  
during the enrollment period should be documented by [CONTACT_173273] v.5NOV2021                                                                                                        Page 23 of 27 
IRB#  [PHONE_3746]   be collected or analyzed by [CONTACT_173274]. The MedDRA scale will be  used to describe adverse events.  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the research treatment  that are encountered during study 
enrollment will be documented by [CONTACT_173275] 72 hours upon discovery. SAEs are defined under current cGCP  guidelines as events that 
result in one or more o f the following:  
• life-threatening illness or injury;  
• permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
• medically necessary in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• medical or surgical intervention necessary to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or function; or  
• fetal distress, fetal death, or congenital abnormality.  
 
Serious events that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects must
 be documented on a form and 
be reported within 72 hours  to Indiana University School of Medicine and to the Investigator’s IRB 
according to that IRB’s policies.  
 Any potential deficiencies with the BioCue ™ devices (including, but not limited to deficiencies in 
packaging , labelling, and/or device processing) will be reported to Zimmer Biomet for evaluation.

11.3 Minimization of Risks  
Although the risk to subjects participating in the study is anticipated to be minimal, the clinician, at 
his/her dis cretion, will not collect data from those individuals for whom collection is judged to pose an 
unusually high risk of physical or mental harm or discomfort.  
 An additional risk is the event that a syringe containing the bone marrow pro duct or the centrifugation 
tube  is dropped. In this case the syringe or tube would be recovered, swabbed externally with alcohol, 
the needle/cap removed and replaced with a sterile needle, and then the sterile contents containing the bone marrow product w ill be emitted into a sterile container on the sterile surgical field and reloaded 
into a new sterile [ADDRESS_202640] the sterile field(s). In the rare ev ent that the investigator feels that the bone marrow product comes into 
contact [CONTACT_173276] -sterile environment then the bone marrow product will be discarded, which is a 
total volume of [ADDRESS_202641] be emphasized 
that the sterile field encompasses the area of the patient’s limb continuous by [CONTACT_173277], thus the likelihood of the 
syringe contact[CONTACT_30697] a non -sterile surface is minimal. Likewise , the centrifugation tube is a closed sterile 
system with fixed caps and should it fall to the floor the contents would remain in the closed sterile system and recovered as described.  
 Participation in this study poses no risk to study personnel other than that normally encountered during standard practice. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_173278]:  
• Personnel should wear appropriate personal protective equipment to avoid contact [CONTACT_173279].  
 
[ADDRESS_202642]:  
• Obtain approval to conduct the study from the study site’s IRB;  
• Sign the Protocol Signature [CONTACT_173288]- investigators sign the 
Protocol Signature [CONTACT_173289];  
• Provide financial disclosures to Indiana University School of Medicine for themselves and all sub -investigators participating in study conduct, per Title 21CFR 54 (see Section 
12.4  below).  
 
During the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_42877]:  
• The study is conducted ethically;  
• Case report forms (CRFs), including Subject ICFs, are provided with each transfer of data requiring informed consent; and  
• All other study forms are completed as instructed by [CONTACT_173258].  
• Investigators, primary care physicians, and all enrolled diabetic subjects follow the American Diabetes Association guidelines for diabetic care throughout the trial.

1.1 Objective: The objective of  this study is to obtain preliminary information 
regarding how a menthol ban that either ex empts or includes e-cigarettes is likely 
to affect overall tobacco use 
1.2 Specific Aims: The following specific aims will be pursued: 
Aim 1: Determine the impact of the availability of menthol fla vor in e-cigarettes 
on overall tobacco product use patterns  We hypothesize that menthol cigarette smoke rs will smoke fewer cigarettes, vape 
more e-cigarettes, have higher motivation to quit smoking and be more supportive 
of a ban on menthol cigarettes when give n the option of using menthol flavored e-
cigarettes than when no su ch option is present.  
Aim 2: Determine if the impact of the availability of menthol flavor in e-cigarettes on tobacco use behavior is moderated by a ban on menthol flavor in cigarettes  
We hypothesize that the impact of menthol flavored e-cigarette availability on the 
above measures will be greater during a simulated ban on menthol cigarettes than 
if smokers can continue smoking menthol cigarettes. 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  With the passage of 
the Family Smoking Prevention and T obacco Control Act (FSPTCA), the 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA) acquired broad ability 
to regulate tobacco products, which included the use of flavorants in 
cigarettes. In 2009, the FDA banned cigare ttes flavored with fruit or candy 
in response to evidence that such fl avoring encourages experimentation by 
[CONTACT_167564].[ADDRESS_194869] of the use of ment hol cigarettes to public 
health, provided the overall recomme ndation that “Removal of menthol 
cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United 
States.”2, 3  A report produced by [CONTACT_941] F DA evaluating the public health 
effects of menthol in cigarettes similarly concluded that menthol use is 
likely associated with increased smoking initiation by [CONTACT_167565], that menthol in cigarettes is  likely associated with greater 
addiction, and that menthol smokers are less likely to successfully quit smoking.  Overall, this report conclude d that it is “likely that menthol 
cigarettes pose a public health risk above that  seen with non-menthol 
cigarettes.”
4  The role of menthol flavori ng in other tobacco products was 
not addressed in either of these reports. 
The use of electronic nicotine delivery devices (e-cigarettes) has increased 
dramatically since their in troduction in the United Stat es in 2007. Recent surveys 
Effect of Banning Menthol Flavoran t on Cigarette and E-Cigarette Use  
Version date: 01/16/20 
 Page 8 of 23  Revised: October 2, [ADDRESS_194870] found that over 12% of adults have tried e-cigarettes an d that 5.5% of all 
adults and 8.9% of young a dults use e-cigarettes eith er every day or on some 
days.5, 6  Sales of e-cigarettes for 2016 are es timated at approximately $1.[ADDRESS_194871] that as many as 30% 
of e-cigarette users prefer menthol flavored  products with over  12% of e-cigarette 
users stating that they use e-cigarettes  “because they come in menthol flavor.”10-[ADDRESS_194872] regulations regarding the 
availability of flavorants (including me nthol) will extend to these other categories 
of tobacco products as well.  Although su rveys of menthol smokers suggest that a 
substantial number would attempt to qu it smoking if menthol cigarettes were 
unavailable,3, 15, [ADDRESS_194873] made a 
cessation attempt (only 3 out of 31 subjects). However, it is not known if access to menthol flavored e-ciga rettes would increase the likelihood of menthol smokers 
quitting smoking entirely in the event of  a ban since they have an alternate 
menthol product available or conversely if likelihood of quitting would decrease 
with smokers opting  to use a combinati on of non-menthol cigarettes and menthol 
flavored e-cigarettes. The former woul d support exempting menthol e-cigarettes 
from a menthol ban whereas the latter w ould support enacting a menthol ban that 
would include all tobacco products.  Among the numerous research needs 
regarding e-cigarettes iden tified in an NIH sponsored workshop are the needs to 
evaluate the effects of flavorants, biom arkers of exposure, and patterns of use.
14 
The purpose of the current study is to obt ain initial data regarding how menthol 
flavoring in e-cigarettes aff ects tobacco use patterns in menthol cigarette smokers 
in order to plan future studies that mo re definitely assess if regulatory policy 
regarding menthol flavoring shoul d be uniform across products. 
2.2 Preliminary Data: Our research team has considerable experience with the 
methods proposed in this study and with  the study population being recruited.  
The most relevant projects include:  
2.2.1   Data demonstrating that in the event of a menthol ban in cigarettes, 
smokers of menthol cigarettes swit ch to smoking non-menthol cigarettes:  In a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_167557]. Kotlyar, we asked African American menthol cigarette 
smokers to not smoke menthol cigarettes for a [ADDRESS_194874] their smoking behavior were 
menthol cigarettes not availabl e (as in the event of a ban).[ADDRESS_194875] decreases occurred in cigarettes  smoked per day (11.9 vs. 9.8 cigs/day; p 
< .001) and exhaled CO (13.4 vs. 11.1 ppm; p = .03) between the start and the end

Version date: 01/16/20 
 Page 9 of 23  Revised: October 2, 2019  of the 4 week period. Motivation to quit smoking was higher at the week 4 visit 
than at baseline (5.3 vs. 6.3 on a 10 point scale; p = .03). At the end of the study, 
subjects indicated that quitting menthol ci garettes was difficult (average score = 
7.2 on a 10 point scale) but that they  were supportive of banning menthol 
(average score = 7.1). Our finding of s ubstantial support for a ban on menthol 
cigarettes  is consistent with other surveys16, [ADDRESS_194876] 
preferences:  [CONTACT_84472] conducted a study utilizing an experimental 
marketplace similar to the one proposed in  this project. The goal of the study was 
to determine the pattern of tobacco use and levels of biomarker exposure when 
smokers were switched to very low nicoti ne content (VLNC) cigarettes and had 
access to alternative nicotine delivery systems.[ADDRESS_194877] conditions 
(i.e., access to combustible and non-co mbustible products, access to only non-
combustible products, and a control normal nicotine content cigarette condition) 
and were provided a set number of credits which could be used to obtain available 
products. The study found significant diffe rences in tobacco product use among 
the three experimental cond itions (with greater number of participants in the 
VLNC condition using alternat ive products and with highe r rate of quit attempts) 
demonstrating that the experimental mark etplace approach was feasible and was 
acceptable to smokers. The proposed project wi ll evaluate the feasibility of using 
this approach to study effects of flavorants on tobacco product use.  
2.3 Existing Literature: Studies have found that when cigarette smokers are 
provided e-cigarettes to use ad libitum, the number of cigarettes smoked decreases 
substantially. For example, two studies in  which cigarette smokers not interested 
in quitting were provided e-cigarettes for a 24 week period and asked to use them 
ad libitum found an overall 80% reduction in  median cigarettes per day with 23% 
- 36% of smokers quittin g cigarettes entirely.20, 21  Similar results were seen in 
another study in which smokers were give n e-cigarettes that they could use ad 
libitum over a 2 month period while continuing to smoke.22  All of these studies 
used tobacco flavored (i.e., non-menthol flavored) products and therefore effects 
of menthol were not assessed.  Studies l ooking at the effects of e-cigarettes on 
craving and withdrawal symptoms have found that these products significantly 
decrease craving and withdrawal symptom severity but most of these studies do 
not specifically assess menthol flavored products.22-[ADDRESS_194878] using either 
menthol or tobacco flavored e-cigarette s (or nicotine gum) for a two week quit

to tobacco, cherry, or choc olate flavored e-cigarettes.13 In an additional cross-over 
study, twenty non-treatment seeking smokers  used menthol and tobacco flavored 
e-cigarettes, each for 7 – [ADDRESS_194880] for 5 minutes.  
In female smokers who used their non-preferred flavor (i .e., menthol smokers 
using non-menthol e-cigarettes and vice versa), nicotine concentrations were 
lower and the e-cigarette was rated as  less likeable than when using their 
preferred flavor with no su ch differences found in men.[ADDRESS_194881] the potential to decrease smoking to a greater extent than other e-cigarette flavors and that th ere may be sex differences in response to

3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes 
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome: The primary outcome is the amount of 
each tobacco product used pe r week as recorded on th eir tobacco use surveys.      
3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): Secondary outcomes 
measured at each visit include how much  of each product is obtained from the 
experimental marketplace, motivation and self-efficacy to quit smoking cigarettes and to quit all tobacco product use, number  of quit attempts, severity of craving 
and withdrawal symptoms, and exhaled carbon monoxide concentrations. Support 
for a menthol ban and urinary cotinine con centrations will be assessed at baseline 
and at week 6. 
 
4.0 Study Intervention(s)/In vestigational Agent(s) 
4.1 Description: Subjects will be randomi zed to one of three experimental 
marketplaces (20 subjects in each cond ition): 1) a condition simulating a ban on 
menthol cigarettes but not menthol e-ci garettes (condition A) ; 2) a condition 
simulating a ban on both ment hol cigarettes and menthol  e-cigarettes (Condition 
B); and 3) a condition in which ment hol is not banned for either product 
(Condition C – the control condition). All conditions would have medicinal 
nicotine available if subjects decide to quit tobacco products entirely.   
The goal of the experimental marketplace is  to provide a context in which product 
preferences can be evaluated in a syst ematic way but with a high degree of 
ecological validity. We have therefore included in the marketplace both a

Version date: 01/16/20 
 Page 11 of 23  Revised: October 2, 2019  cigarette-like e-cigarette system and a ta nk-like e-cigarette system (which has the 
potential to deliver higher doses of nicotine), as those are the two most commonly 
used e-cigarette systems currently available. 
Products available to subjects in each experimental marketplace 
Condition A  
(menthol ban for cigs) Condition B (menthol ban for cigs 
and e-cigs) Condition C 
(no menthol ban) 
-  Non-menthol cigarettes 
-  Menthol & tobacco flavored versions 
of commonly used cigarette-like e-cigarette (e.g., Vuse) 
-  Menthol & tobacco flavored versions 
of commonly used tank-like e-cigarette (e.g., Joyetech eGo AIO) 
-  Nicotine gum and lozenge (various 
flavors)  -  Non-menthol cigarettes 
-  Tobacco flavored version of 
commonly used cigarette-like e-cigarette (e.g., Vuse) 
-  Tobacco flavored version of 
commonly used tank-like e-cigarette (e.g., Joyetech eGo AIO) -  Nicotine gum and lozenge 
(various flavors) -  Menthol & non-menthol cigarettes 
-  Menthol & tobacco flavored 
versions of commonly used cigarette-like e-cigarette (e.g., Vuse) 
-  Menthol & tobacco flavored 
versions of commonly used tank-like e-cigarette (e.g., Joyetech eGo AIO)  
-  Nicotine gum and lozenge (various 
flavors) 
We will include the subject’s usual brand of cigarette s in the marketplace (either the non-menthol version 
or both the non-menthol and menthol version depending on the randomization).  Information about their 
usual brand will be collected at the screening visit in  order to incorporate it into the marketplace.   
4.2 Drug/Device Handling:  The tobacc o and nicotine replacement products 
that will be provided to subj ects are marketed products and are not required to be 
dispensed by a physician or licensed pharmacy.  They will be provided to 
participants by [CONTACT_9137]

5.0 Procedures Involved 
5.1 Study Design: This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_167558] a [ADDRESS_194882] conditions: 1) a condition simulating a ban on menthol cigarettes but not menthol 
e-cigarettes; 2) a condition simulating a ban on both menthol cigarettes and 
menthol e-cigarettes; and 3) a condition in  which menthol is not banned for either 
product (i.e., the control condition). All conditions would have medicinal nicotine 
available if subjects decide to quit to bacco products entirely.  Subjects would 
receive “credits” that they can exchange, at visits occurring every two weeks, for 
any product available in their randomized marketplace condition.  At the end of 
the experimental period any unused credits can be exchanged for monetary payment.  
5.2 Study Procedures: The following procedures will occur during the study. 
5.2.1 Screening Visit: Initial eligibil ity will be assessed via a phone interview or 
online screening form housed on REDCap. All screened participants will be 
notified by [CONTACT_167568] r eligibility to be scheduled for a 
screening visit at which written informed consent will be obtained and eligibility

Version date: 01/16/20 
 Page 12 of 23  Revised: October 2, [ADDRESS_194883] to confirm 
that they are not pregnant.  A medical professional (e.g., Nurse Practitioner) will 
review medical histories to ensure elig ibility.  Baseline questionnaires assessing 
smoking history will be administered and an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured to confirm smoking (CO > 8 ppm). A NicCheck using a urine 
sample will be performed (with a cut-off = 6 for those who otherwise qualify but for whom CO is < 8 ppm (e.g., they di dn’t smoke that morning, they came 
straight from work, etc.).  Subjects who qualify and ar e interested in continuing 
will be invited to return to the baseline visit.   
After eligibility is confirmed, subjects will begin receiving links daily via either text message or email (whichever they prefe r) to a tobacco use survey that is to be 
completed on RedCap.  On this survey subjects will report use of all tobacco and nicotine containing products used during th e past day. These survey will continue 
until the end of the subject’s participation in the study.  
5.2.2 Baseline Visit (i.e., week 0):  At the baseline visit, urine will be collected 
from which baseline urinary cotinine c oncentrations will be measured.  Exhaled 
CO will be measured from a breath sample.  Tobacco use behavior subsequent to the screening visit will be determined  as will subjects’ level of craving, 
withdrawal, motivation and self-efficacy to quit smoking and support for a ban on 
a variety of menthol containing tobacco products.  Degree of nicotine dependence 
will be assessed using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence.
[ADDRESS_194884].  All products will be discounted to approximately 66% of the 
retail market value (similar to the study summarized in preliminary data) in order 
to discourage subjects from purchasing pr oducts outside the marketplace and also 
prevent hoarding credits for payment at the end of the study.  The credit amount will be calculated in order to allow on average a 1 pack/day smoker to replace all 
of their tobacco products ba sed on normal usage patterns (e.g., for example, one 
cartridge of Vuse lasts about  as long as one pack of cigarette).  In order to 
discourage subjects obtaining more products than they need, any credits not used 
at each visit can be banked and used at later visits or converted to monetary 
payment at the end of the study.  Subjects will be informed that they can obtain 
any amount or type of product up to the value of current and banked credits and 
will be provided with the packaging that  normally accompanies these products.   
Instructions for product use will be primar ily limited to what is on the packaging 
so as to more accurately simulate natural marketplace conditions; however subjects can ask questions about the pr oducts to which accurate answers will be 
provided.  While subjects will  be encouraged to obtain all tobacco products they 
use from the experimental marketplace, no penalties will be levied for outside 
purchases in order to encourage trut hful reports of noncompliance.

 Page 13 of 23  Revised: October 2, 2019  5.2.3 Evaluation Visits (3 visits o ccurring at 2 week intervals).  Subsequent to 
the baseline visit, subjects will be eval uated at 3 visits occurring at two week 
intervals (i.e., at approximately 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the baseline visit). To each 
visit, subjects will be asked to bring b ack any unused product as well as all used 
and unused e-cigarette cartridges or e-fluid vials.  The cartridges and vials will be 
weighed prior to distribution and after use to determine the extent to which they 
were used.  Participants will be allowed to keep any of the unused products so as 
to not discourage them from bringing back unused product.   
At each visit, exhaled carbon monoxide c oncentrations will be measured and 
subjects will complete questionnaires assessing various aspects of smoking 
behavior including cravi ng, withdrawal symptoms and motivation to quit 
smoking.  Questionnaires assessing how they rate the effects of  the products they 
are using and their perceived health risk s of using these products will also be 
assessed.  A food diary asking primarily a bout dietary menthol will be completed 
to determine if dietary intake changes o ccur if menthol in tobacco products is no 
longer available.  Level of support for a ban on a variety of menthol containing 
tobacco products will be evaluated at the baseline and week 6 visits.  
Additionally, at the week 6 visit urine will be collected in order to measure 
cotinine concentrations.  At each visit (exc ept for the week 6 visit), subjects will 
again have the opportunity to obtain a dditional products for the subsequent [ADDRESS_194885] a nd are not limited to products that they 
had previously chosen. 
5.3 Individually Identifiable Health Info rmation: All information is collected 
directly from subjects (i.e., medical records will not be requested) and this is not a 
treatment study.  The data being collected  therefore does not meet the definition 
of PHI.

6.0 Data and Specimen Banking 
6.1 Storage and Access: Urine will be colle cted from subjects at the baseline 
and week 6. The samples will be stored in freezers located in labs used by [CONTACT_167569] (currently these freezers are located on the 5th floor of [ADDRESS_194886]). 
 6.2 Data: Urine samples will be labeled with  subject number and date of visit.  
Samples will be assayed for cotinine con centrations.  Cotinine is a metabolite of 
nicotine and frequently used to confirm ab stinence or quantify nicotine exposure.  
Urine may also in the future be used to  assay other measures related to smoking 
or specifically related to smoking menthol cigarettes or substances related to e-
cigarette use.  Examples of such meas ures would include assaying nicotine or 
metabolites of nicotine other than cotini ne, assaying menthol concentrations or

print and on-line sources and via flyers.  Interested participants will call the phone number listed. Study staff will explain the study to potential study 
subjects.  Individuals that indicate an interest in participating in the study 
will then be screened by [CONTACT_167570].  Additionally subjects that in prev ious studies agreed  to be contact[CONTACT_167571] – in this case, subjects 
will be informed why they are bein g called with the telephone screening 
process being the same as for subject s who contact[CONTACT_167572].  
12.2 Recruitment Materials:  Flyers a nd advertisements placed in local 
publications or on on-line resources (for example, Craigslist) will be used to 
recruit participants.   
12.3 Payment:  Subjects will be paid as fo llows: $20 for completing the screening 
visit.  In addition to receiving credits for tobacco products, they will receive $15 for each of the subsequent 4 visits in this study. They will receive an 
additional $[ADDRESS_194891] 85% of their sche duled electronic diary assessments and 
have brought in their used e-cigarette  cartridges.  A $50 bonus will be given 
to subjects completing the study and all study related assessments.  Up to $[ADDRESS_194892].   
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants 
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances: Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if 
they fail to follow study procedures (e .g., show up to scheduled study visits) 
or if there are changes to  their health that are likely to affect smoking 
behavior.  Additionally, subjects will be  told that participation is voluntary 
and that they may discontinue particip ation at any time for any reasons.   
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures: We will attempt to contact [CONTACT_167573] (and if not, why not) and to determine smoking 
status at the time of their withdrawal.

14.0 Risks to Participants 
14.1 Foreseeable Risks: The tobacco products and medicinal nicotine products 
that are used for this study are those that are commercially available. Although 
there are numerous risks associated with  smoking cigarettes, we are only enrolling 
those who are already smoking and are at the time of enrollment not motivated to 
quit.  The risks of continuing to smoke ci garettes within the context of the study 
are no greater than if they were to co ntinue smoking cigarettes outside of the 
study.   
E-cigarettes do not currently undergo re gulatory evaluation, however they are 
easily available and increasingly being use d. The risks of using e-cigarettes are 
generally thought to be lower to an indi vidual than the risks of smoking. Nicotine 
gum and lozenge are available without a prescription, commonly used and 
generally well tolerated.  Side effects that can occur include hiccups, mouth or throat irritation and upset stomach.   
All of the products being provided to subj ects contain nicotine and it is possible 
that overuse can lead to symptoms of nicotine toxicity which could include 
nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, and rapid heartbeat. Considering that we 
only enrolling experienced smokers, nico tine toxicity is not likely.   
The e-cigarette liquid contai ns propylene glycol which may be associated with 
throat irritation. There have been occa sional reports of e-cigarette devices 
malfunctioning and causing injury to users.   
There have been recent reports of seiz ures and breathing problems occurring in 
people who use e-cigarettes. These cases ar e being investigated and at this time it 
is not known how common these problems ar e or what is causing them.  Since 
many of the cases of breathing problems o ccurred in individuals using e-cigarettes 
products with liquids that c ontain cannabinoid products su ch as THC, it is likely  
that the risk is due to peop le adding substances to e-li quids that were not intended 
by [CONTACT_3455].  The e-cigarette products available in the study are widely 
available and widely used.  The devices and liquids provided to  participants are 
not modified in any way after purchase.    As with any product, there is a risk that  unanticipated effects from using the e-
cigarette or lozenges may occur, however th e risk of using the product as directed 
by [CONTACT_167574].  
14.2 Reproduction Risks: Smoking cigarettes during pregnancy is known to be 
harmful to reproductive health.  We will therefore exclude women who are 
pregnant or are planning to become pregnant during the study.  Women who 
inform us that they have become pregnant during the study will not be provided 
any additional tobacco / nicotine products. 
14.3 Risks to Others: There are no an ticipated risks to others.

 Page 18 of 23  Revised: October 2, 2019  15.0 Potential Benefits to Participants 
15.1 Potential Benefits: As this is not a tr eatment study, there is no direct benefit 
to individual participants.   
 
16.0 Data Management 
16.1 Data Analysis Plan:  Means (arithmetic or geometric for log-transformed 
variables) and their corresponding confidence intervals will be calculated for each 
study condition. Results will also be tabulat ed separately for men and women.  A 
linear mixed model will be fit for each outcome variable, with fixed categorical 
effects of group, time, and their interact ion, and random subject effects to account 
for correlation among repeated measurements on the same subject.  We expect randomization to balance groups with resp ect to important ba seline covariates 
such as cigarettes smoked per day and de gree of nicotine dependence; however, 
we will check this assumption using ANOVA and consider adjustment for 
imbalanced factors.  Exploratory modeli ng of gender and race / ethnicity effects 
will also be performed.  Model contrasts will be used to evaluate the hypotheses of the two aims, primarily that cigarettes smoked will be lower and e-cigarette use higher when menthol e-cigarettes are av ailable (Aim 1: conditions A and C 
compared to B), and that these effects will be larger when menthol cigarettes are unavailable (Aim 2: condition A compared to C) 
16.2 Power Analysis: The main purpose of this project is to provide initial 
information regarding how banning menthol in either only cigarettes or in both 
cigarette and e-cigarettes will influence toba cco use patterns so as to better design 
a subsequent study that more definitively addresses this issue.  This study will 
also provide feasibility information rega rding using an experimental marketplace 
for assessing this question.  For this p ilot study, we plan on recruiting 60 subjects 
and anticipate (assuming 10% dropout), th at there would be [ADDRESS_194893] it as this sample 
size will provide 80% power for a between-groups time-averaged effect size of 0.8, assuming two-sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_194894] autocorrelation of 0.6.   
16.3 Data Integrity: In order to ensure that  data entry is correct, data collected 
on paper questionnaires will be entered twice with the two entries compared and any discrepancies resolved.  
 
17.0 Confidentiality 
17.1 Data Security: To ensure confidential ity, all subjects will be assigned a 
study identification code to be used on a ll data collection forms except those for 
which use of personal identifiers is manda tory (e.g., informed consent form).  
Forms that link the name [CONTACT_167577] t and the subject identification code will 
be kept in a locked cabinet or office or in an electr onic file stored on servers 
maintained by [CONTACT_163673].  Visits will be conducted at the CTSI, therefore ther e will be a record of the subject’s

 Page 19 of 23  Revised: October 2, 2019  participation in the CTSI records although a copy of the consent form will not be 
placed in the participants’ medical records. 
    
18.[ADDRESS_194895] to involve Minimal Risk then no independent 
monitoring will be needed (per IRB guide lines).  In this study we will be 
providing commercially available tobacco products and commercially available 
over the counter nicotine gum and lozenges to smokers who are not interested in 
quitting smoking.  All products will be pr ovided with the labelling that normally 
accompanies it.  The risks are therefore no greater than if subjects were to 
purchase these products out side of the study.   
If the IRB determines this study to involve more than Minimal Risk, the CTSI monitoring group will be asked to mon itor this study using their standard 
procedures.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_167559] (at least bi-weekly) 
throughout the project.  During th ese meetings, the study team will 
evaluate the progress of the trial, review data qual ity, recruitment, 
retention, and examine other factors th at may affect study outcomes.  They 
will also review adverse events to de termine if there are any changes in 
participant risk.  Additional meetings will occur if concerns regarding a particular participant or a nother problem should arise. 
 
19.[ADDRESS_194896] the Privacy Interests of Participants 
19.1 Protecting Privacy: During the consent pr ocess, subjects will be told that 
they can discontinue participation at a ny time for any reason.  Furthermore, they 
are free to not answer any questions aske d on the questionnaires.  However since 
certain information is needed to assess eligibility or to assess measures of interest, declining to answer certain questions may lead to a subj ect not being eligible to 
participate or to continue with the study.   
 
20.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury 
20.1 Compensation for Research-Related Inju ry: No compensation is available in 
the event of research related injury. 
 
21.0 Consent Process 
21.1 Consent Process (when consent will be  obtained): Informed consent will 
be obtained at the screening visit.  Subj ects will have the opport unity to read the 
consent document and ask any questions that they have.  A member of the study 
staff will then ask the subject questions to make sure that they understand the

21.2 Waiver or Alteration of Consent Pr ocess (when consent will not be 
obtained): N/A  
21.3 Non-English Speaking Participants: N/A  
21.4 Participants Who Are Not Yet Adults  (infants, children, teenagers under 
18 years of age): Individuals under the age of [ADDRESS_194898] 18 years of age.  
21.5 Cognitively Impaired Adults or Adults with Fluctuating or Diminished 
Capacity to Consent:  We are not planni ng on enrolling subjects with fluctuating 
or diminished capacity to consent.  Subjects that appear to have impaired capacity 
to consent during the consent process will be excluded from the study.   
21.6 Adults Unable to Consent:  N/A  
 
22.0 Setting 
22.1 Research Sites: Potential subjects will be recruited via the use of flyers 
and advertisements placed in local publications or on on-line resources (for 
example, Craigslist). Additionally subjects that in previous studies agreed to be 
contact[CONTACT_167575]. Study visits will occur in the Clinical and Translational Research Institutes (CTSI) facilities.  
 
23.0 Multi-Site Research: N/A 
  
24.0 Resources Available  
This study has been submitted for funding to the National Institutes of Health with a funding decision pending.  The pe rsonnel assisting with this study (e.g., 
study coordinators) work with  the research groups of th e investigators. Based on 
previous studies, we believe that th at there are adequate smokers in the 
community interested in participating in  research studies in order to meet 
recruitment goals.

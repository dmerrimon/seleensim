 Page 2 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 5) Background Introduction Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a progressive autoimmune disease of biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_870599]. The prevalence of PBC in the US and Europe is estimated to be 5-40 per 100,000 persons and accounts for 3-4 % of liver transplants performed in the US. The only approved medical therapy of PBC is the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Multiple studies suggest that UDCA delays progression of the disease, particularly those that have a biochemical response which has defined by [CONTACT_870620], the simplest being a decrease of the alkaline phosphatase to 1.67 times the upper limit of normal. However, 20-40% of PBC patients have an incomplete response to UDCA and remain at significant risk of disease progression leading to death or liver transplantation. PBC is characterized by a 90% female predominance, high titers of serum anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA) directed against the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 subunit and elevated plasma levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, evidence from both human and murine models suggests that T-cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, are key to the destruction of bile ducts. Genetic evidence of a T-cell defect is also supported by [CONTACT_870621]-[ADDRESS_1215541] notable, are the results we recently published in our murine model of PBC in which both AMA and biliary inflammation are induced by [CONTACT_870622] 2-octynoic acid (2-OA). CTLA-[ADDRESS_1215542] damage. More critically, treatment with CTLA-4 Ig initiated after the 2-OA immunization and development of disease, also resulted in reduced intra-hepatic T cell infiltrates and biliary cell damage, although AMA levels were not altered.  a) Pathology of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Three important observations must be taken into account for us to understand the pathogenic basis of PBC. First, appearance of AMAs before liver disease suggests that loss of tolerance to the mitochondrial autoantigen is an early event and could be independent of the development of liver disease. Second, although the autoantigen is present ubiquitously in all nucleated cells, the immune response is restricted to epi[INVESTIGATOR_870600], to a lesser degree, to cells of salivary and lacrimal glands. Finally, recurrence of PBC after liver transplantation supports the idea that the bile duct epi[INVESTIGATOR_870601] a generic target and is not unique to the patient with PBC. Similar to other complex diseases, the combination of a susceptible genetic background and exposure to environmental triggers are needed to initiate and promote the disorder. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: ABATACEPT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH AN INCOMPLETE BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID  
 Page 3 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 Observations that 1–6% of individuals with PBC have at least one family member manifesting disease and a 63% concordance rate in monozygotic twins (vs null concordance in dizygotic sets), show the substantial genetic effect on disease susceptibility, one of the strongest for any autoimmune disorder. Many candidate genes have been investigated for a role in susceptibility to PBC, disease progression, or both in case-control cross-sectional studies. Findings of a genome-wide association study undertaken in a northern American set of patients and controls indicated a significant association between PBC and polymorphisms of HLA-DQB1, IL12A, IL12RB2, and to a minor extent, STAT4, and these associations have been confirmed in an independent cohort of Italian patients and controls with a combined analysis.  Several environmental factors—mainly infectious and chemical—are also thought to contribute to the onset of PBC, largely through molecular mimicry or modification of autoantigens. Geographic clustering of cases near toxic waste sites in [LOCATION_001] City and space-time clustering in northeast England provide epi[INVESTIGATOR_870602] a role of chemicals, infectious agents, or both. Additional data that lend support to a role for infections in disease development include the significantly higher prevalence than usual of recurrent urinary-tract infections in patients with PBC and experimental findings of sequence similarity between the E2 enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex recognized by [CONTACT_870623]. Several bacterial strains—including the non-pathogenic gram-negative bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans—have the highest known homology to the immunodominant autoepi[INVESTIGATOR_48943] E2 enzyme. Several other infectious agents have been proposed, including Escherichia coli, Helicobacter spp, organisms of the genus Mycoplasma, and a human β retrovirus, although support for the retrovirus has not been substantiated.  Other environmental factors proposed to trigger disease onset are foreign chemicals (ie, xenobiotics) that can either alter or form a complex with a defined self or non-self protein, causing a change in the protein's molecular structure that induces an immune response. Lipoic acid is attached to only a few proteins, yet it is a vital component of the E2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]. The structure of the E2 enzyme exposes lipoic acid at the exterior of the protein complex, making this compound accessible to chemical modification. The role of xenobiotics in PBC is supported by [CONTACT_870624]; furthermore, two of these compounds (6-bromohexanoate and 2-octynoic acid) can induce AMAs and liver lesions similar to those of PBC in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_870603].  AMAs in serum are highly sensitive and specific for PBC: they are detected in nearly 95% of patients, with specificity close to 100% when tested with recombinant antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence remains the test used for screening, but it can be associated with a substantial number of false-positive results. Follow-up data from AMA-positive individuals without signs of liver disease suggest that autoantibodies arise several years before onset of PBC and have a high predictive value. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_870604]: ABATACEPT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH AN INCOMPLETE BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID  
 Page 4 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 include lipoylated domains (via the Asx-Lys-Ala motif) within subunits of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase family of enzymes of the mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226], in particular, E2 subunit and E3 binding-protein components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and E2 components of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes.   b) Role of T cells in Primary Biliary Cirrhosis In addition to AMAs, autoreactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex have been identified both in peripheral blood and within the liver of patients with PBC, and the immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_870605] T cells maps in close proximity to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_870606]. Autoreactive CD4+ cell clones specific for the E2 enzyme have been isolated in intrahepatic and peripheral lymphocytes, not only in AMA-positive individuals but also in patients without antibodies, thus corroborating the notion that PBC either positive or negative for AMAs is one nosological entity.  CD4+ CD25high regulatory T cells act to prevent autoreactivity, as shown in several autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with PBC are characterized by [CONTACT_870625]4+ CD25high regulatory T cells as proportions of total T-cell receptor-αβ+/CD4+ cells, and this factor could be important in the breakdown of tolerance.   c) Summary of Results of Investigational Program Pharmacology of Abatacept Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA4 and a fragment (hinge- CH2-CH3 domains) of the Fc domain of human IgG1 that has been modified to prevent complement fixation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Abatacept is the first drug in a new class of agents termed “selective costimulation modulators.” Abatacept binds specifically to the CD80 and CD86 molecules, proteins prominently displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Activation of naive T cells during an immune response requires two stimuli from APCs. The first signal is antigen-specific; antigens are presented by [CONTACT_85804], with the signal transmitted to the T cell through the T cell’s antigen receptor. The second, or costimulatory, signal is not antigen-specific and is delivered following the engagement of a costimulatory ligand on the APC with a cognate receptor on the T cell. A key costimulatory receptor on T cells is CD28. CD28 is constitutively expressed on resting T cells and binds to both CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) on the APC. A 
PROTOCOL TITLE: ABATACEPT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS WITH AN INCOMPLETE BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE TO URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID  
 Page 5 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 costimulatory signal is required not only for the full activation of naive T cells, but also may be required for the survival of memory and autoimmune effector cells. At 24 to 48 hours following T cell activation, the T cell expresses CTLA4 on its surface, which engages the CD80 and CD86 molecules on the APC surface interfering with CD28’s ability to bind to its ligands on the APC; CD80 and CD86 preferentially bind to CTLA4 with a much higher avidity than with CD28. Although the precise mechanisms are as yet unclear, CTLA4 expression is associated with a decrease in T cell activation. After the T cell activity has been dampened, the CTLA4 recycles into the T cell’s cytoplasm. The CTLA4 section of abatacept binds specifically to CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and B7-2, respectively) and down-modulates the CD28-mediated costimulation of T cells. Thus, abatacept uses a segment of a molecule that is part of the normal immune homeostatic mechanism to suppress T cell activity involved in the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The FC region of abatacept was engineered with several point mutations designed to inactivate it. Because of these changes, abatacept does not mediate pathways such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  Study Rationale This is an open label, single center, active treatment study of the effects of abatacept on PBC patients with an incomplete response to UDCA. These patients have been demonstrated to have increased morbidity and mortality with standard-of-care treatment. An abundance of human and pre-clinical data suggests that T cell activation is central to the immune-mediated destruction of biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_870607].   6) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria 1.

 Page 13 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015  From the ICF: The clinical study will be done only at UC Davis. The name [CONTACT_870637] 1 of this document. Authorized members of the study staff will do all study procedures. An initial examination called “Screening” will help decide if you can take part in the clinical study. This will include a full physical examination including body weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature. You will also have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity of your heart. This involves placing several sticky pads on your arms, legs and chest, on your bare skin. These pads are attached to a machine that will measure your heart’s electrical activity. Also, your medical history and details of your illness will be recorded.  If you take part in the clinical study, your treatment will begin within [ADDRESS_1215554] between visits. Each week, you will be asked to administer a subcutaneous injection (a shot just under the skin) of 125mg of Abatacept. The study team will teach you how to administer this shot yourself. Blood will be collected. Some blood samples must be taken when you are in a fasting state (overnight fast, only water is allowed). Over the course of the study, a total of approximately 244 mL (about 8.25 ounces) of blood will be collected. As a comparison, 450 to 500 mL of blood is taken at a typi[INVESTIGATOR_269263]. During 2 of the 7 scheduled visits, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) will be performed. This test involves placing a small vibrating pad on your abdomen, over the area of your liver. The vibrations into your abdomen will help the study doctor to determine the stiffness of your liver.  Before entering the study, you must tell the investigator about any medications that you are taking or have taken during the last 12 months. You will also need to tell the investigator about all medications (other than study drug) that you take during the study. You may not take any new medications to treat PBC during the study or change the dose of any medications you are allowed to take. You should inform your general practitioner (family doctor) if you take part in this clinical study. Your general practitioner should not change your dosage of study medication, except in cases of emergency. The study investigator must be told about any medication prescribed by [CONTACT_870633]. Participation in other clinical studies within the last [ADDRESS_1215555] (only water is allowed) overnight before some of the blood samples are collected.

The secondary objectives of this study are: • To assess the safety of abatacept in patients with PBC • To assess effect of abatacept on liver stiffness as a measure of liver fibrosis in patients with PBC • To determine the effects of abatacept on immunologic markers of PBC • To assess the impact of abatacept on the quality of life in patients with PBC • To characterize pharmacokineticsPKof abatacept 125mg administrated SC weekly in patients with PBC  • To assess immunogenicity of abatacept 125mg administered SC weekly in patients with PBC  Sample Size Determination Among patients with PBC who do not have a complete biochemical response to UDCA, the probability of achieving serum liver biochemical normalization spontaneously is <5%. If abatacept is found to be ineffective among 20 enrolled subjects, the probability of observing 3 or fewer treatment responses is >98%. If abatacept is associated with a treatment success response rate of 30% or more, then the probability of 4 or more individuals responding is 89%. If these endpoints were met, pursuit of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial would then be justified. Populations for Analyses The primary analysis set for efficacy and safety analyses will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.

The primary endpoint assessment will be the biochemical response rate defined by [CONTACT_870630] > 40% of the Day 0 level at 24 weeks of treatment. We will report the observed biochemical response rate and a 95% confidence interval for the expected biochemical response rate. We will assess each of the secondary endpoints:  absolute and percent change in alkaline phosphatase, absolute and percent change in alanine transferase (ALT), change in liver stiffness as measured by [CONTACT_870631], change in quality of life measured by [CONTACT_870632]-40, change in AMA titer, change in IgM level, and change in CD4+CD44+CD62L- and CD8+CD44+CD62L- frequencies in PBMC from Day [ADDRESS_1215560]-treatment. Safety data, including AEs, clinical and laboratory observations and physical examination findings, and other safety related outcomes will be summarized. Summary tables of treatment-emergent AEs will be provided. A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study medication.  AEs will be included in the treatment-emergent analysis if the onset date is on or after the first day of dosing and up to [ADDRESS_1215561] dosing day. The incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_20623], and by [CONTACT_22056]. Tables of TEAEs leading to study medication discontinuation and SAEs will be provided. Descriptive statistics summarizing laboratory data (hematology and chemistry) will be presented for all trial visits. Changes from pretreatment to each trial visit will also be summarized. Additional safety assessments include vital signs, physical examinations, and ECGs. For safety assessments pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment including adverse events, laboratory observations, and physical exam findings, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be employed to analyze a continuous outcome variable measured at these multiple time points, and a generalized estimating equation will be used to analyze a count or binary outcome variable measured at these multiple time points in order to take into account a possible unknown correlation among outcomes obtained on the same patient.

 Page 18 of 26 Revised: 2September 22, 2015 16) Withdrawal of Subjects Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and noninvestigational product at the discretion of the investigator) for any of the following reasons: • Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason). • Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the subject. • Pregnancy - Instruct WOCBP to contact [CONTACT_870634] (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation. Institutional policy and local regulations should determine the frequency of on-study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in the study. - The investigator must immediately notify BMS if a study subject becomes pregnant. • Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. All subjects who discontinue should comply with protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness). If a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal must be documented appropriately.  17) Risks to Subjects From the ICF: You may have unwanted effects and symptoms as a result of taking Abatacept.

It is also not known if the medication can be passed through sperm and cause injury or harm to a/during pregnancy. Therefore, it is advised that female partners of male study participants do not become pregnant during the treatment phase of this study and use effective forms of birth control. Subcutaneous Injections: Subcutaneous injections may be slightly painful, cause bruising or, rarely, and infection.  Blood Drawing:  Blood drawing is mildly painful and can cause bruising and, very rarely, fainting, blood clots or an infection at the site.  Electrocardiogram (ECG): There is no pain or discomfort during an ECG; however, removing the pads may cause some irritation to your skin.  Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE): Magnetic resonance imaging uses a strong magnetic field, which is not harmful in itself, but implanted medical devices that contain metal may malfunction or cause problems during an MR exam.  If you have any implanted devices please inform the doctors before the procedure.   HIV Testing: Being tested for HIV may cause anxiety regardless of the test results. A positive test indicates that you have been infected with the HIV virus, but no one knows for certain when, if ever, you will become sick with AIDS or a related condition. Receiving positive results may make you very upset. If other people learn about your positive test results, you may have trouble obtaining insurance or employment. If your test is negative, there is still the possibility that you could be infected with the HIV virus and test positive at some time in the future. Also, it is always possible that the test results could be wrong.  Privacy Risks: There may also be risks to your privacy.  The Researchers will store study records and other information about you in a secure location and will grant access only to those with a need to know.

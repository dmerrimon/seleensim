unused ports and limit access to open ports based on IP address.  Security logging and 
auditing follow industry best practices.  Access to the server is restricted to key 
personnel including investigators, and computer support staff.  User access to server 
resources via network connection is limited via firewall configuration, IP address 
filtering, and encrypted user authentication protocols.  Access to the study data w ill 
be further restricted via user roles.  Application security for data entry will be protected using firewalling and IP address filtering.  User authentication will be 
managed by a single-sign-on model of log in. Pas swords for access to server 
resources are managed in a Microsoft Active Directory repository.  Passwords for applications are managed via a single-sign-on (SSO) application which stores 
passwords using a one-way 128 bit hashing algorithm (MD5).  Password policies 
force users to employ “strong” passwords, which use numbers, letters and special 
characters.   Passwords must change at least every 90 days.  All data will be de -
identified and assigned a nonsense random unique identifier.

8.  Scientific Rationale 
 Female steroid sex hormones modula te enzymes involved in maintaining 
PrEP nucleotide balance.  Currently only 
a fixed dose combination of 2 
nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTIs), tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FT C), 
is FDA approved for HIV pre -exposure 
prophylaxis ( PrEP ). TDF and FTC are 
intracellularly phosphorylated to their active forms  (TFVdp and FTCtp), which 
compete with the host cells’ naturally occurring deoxynucleotides (dATP and 
dCTP ) for incorporation into the proviral 
DNA strand to b lock r everse 
Figure 2 Theoretical Framework  
Tenofovir (TFV) is intracellularly phosphorylated to 
its active form (TFVdp), which is chemically similar 
to deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP). T FVdp 
competes for incorporation into proviral HIV DNA by [CONTACT_922] (RT), which results in chain termination. Estradiol reduces TFVdp and increases 
dATP minimizing the likelihood that RT will 
incorporate TFVdp.

 transcription. The female sex  steroid  hormone, estradiol, increases expression of 
5’nucleotidase enzymes involved in maintaining intracellular nucleotide balance.1 
Particularly, ecto -5’nucleotidase (located on the extracellular surface of the plasma 
membrane) catalyzes AMP to ADP, which is a precursor in the biochemical 
formatio n of dATP. Conversely, intracellularly expressed cytosolic 5’nucleotidase 
may dephosphorylate and deactivate PrEP’s active metabolites (TFVdp and FTCtp ; 
Figure 2).   
 Female sex steroid hormones may disproportionately i mpact PrEP 
pharmacology in diffe rent cellular populations . Previously, investigators have 
utilized several different sampling strategies from which to draw conclusions about PrEP pharmacology in HIV transmission sites. These surrogate measures include 1) 
collecting biopsies for measurement in  isolated CD4
+ T cell s – generally considered 
gold standard; 2) tissue homogenization for measurement in mixed cell populations; 3) collecting swabs  and cytobrush for measurement in fluid or mixed cell populations. 
A previous clinical study noted a pr edicti ve relationship between parent TFV 
measured in rectal fluids versu s tissue homogenates in individuals taking oral TDF.
2 
Additionally, Yang et al. d emonstrated a predictive correlation between TFVdp in 
mixed cell populations of homogenized rectal tissue vs CD4+ T cells isolated from 
rectal tissue following topi[INVESTIGATOR_572004].[ADDRESS_751177] of estradiol on 
these surrogate relationships has not been well characterized. O ne in vitro  study 
utilizing very high concentrations of TFV (1mg/ml) suggests that estradiol could disproportionately impact TFVdp formation in epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] ( enhanced formation ) 
vs CD4
+ T cells ( diminished  formati on)4, which could confound the relationship 
between surrogate measures  of mixed vs isolated cell populations. 
 We aim to quantify estradiol ’s impact on PrEP  nucleotide concentrations 
in mixed cell populations obtained via cytobrush sampling vs CD4+ T cells 
isolated from rectal tissue biopsies  in order to understand whe ther cytobrush is a 
valid PrEP pharmacology surrogate in people taking exogenous estradiol.

10.  Study Design 
 
10.1 Identification of Study Design  
This is a single center, open -label, multi-matrix sampling study of PrEP nucleotides  
in mucosal tissue concentration s meas ured after multiple doses of Truvada
® 
(TDF/FTC ). Participants will take a single daily dose of study drug for five days 
before each sampling visit. The visits will be scheduled during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (approximately D ays [ADDRESS_751178] day of menses, 
Visit 1) when estradiol is predicted to be the lowest; and the late follicular phase (approximately Days 12-[ADDRESS_751179] day of the menses, Visit 2) when estradiol is 
predicted to  be highest.  After participant educat ion, informed consent, and screening 
for study eligibility, participants will be evaluated at baseline.

 10.2 Description of Study Population 
 
Healthy, HIV-uninfected premenopausal women (N=10) will be enrolled based on the 
following inclusion crite ria: ≥ 18 years of age, no clinical evidence of sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs), unimpaired renal function (>60ml/min; as estimated by [CONTACT_3158]- Gault), a regular menstrual cycle (defined as at least 1 day of menses 
occurring every 21-35 days), being willing to refrain from inserting anything rectally for [ADDRESS_751180] on 
endogenous hor monal fluctuation (See section 14.7 for details).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_751181] of cervical, vaginal, and gastrointestinal biopsy studies in women.  We recently enrolled 48 women in a phase I dose ranging study PK study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], clinicaltrials.gov) requiring all three types of biopsies to be performed.  Prior to this study, UNC enrolled the majority of women in HPTN 066 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], clinicaltrials.gov) wh ich required all three types of biopsies to be 
performed within 60 minutes of each other.  In both cases, these biopsies were 
performed successfully and UNC enrolled to completion.  Approximately 10 women 
who participated in the aforementioned study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), have expressed 
interest in participating in additional studies of the similar nature .  As part of the 
screening and informed consent process, every participant will receive a detailed description of the procedures involved and the intensity of the protocol.

 for the initial evaluation and report ing of safety information at the participant level, 
and for alerting the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) if unexpected concerns 
arise.  The PSRT will consist of the following study site investigators: Cynthia Gay , 
MD (Study Physician), Heather Prince, PA-C (Study Physician Assistant), Mackenzie Cottrell, PharmD (Principal I nvestigator ). 
During the trial, the PSRT will review  safety reports (all AEs included, independent 
of determination of relatedness to study products).  In addition to these routine saf ety 
data reviews, the PSRT will convene on an ad hoc basis to make decisions regarding 
the handling of any significa nt safet y concerns.  If necessary, experts external to the 
protocol team, representing expertise in the fields of microbicides, biostatistic s, and 
medical ethics may be invited to join the PSRT safety review.   
14.3 Adverse Events Definition and Reporting Requirements 
 
An adverse event  (A
 E) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
research participant administered an investig ational product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product.  As such, an 
AE can be an unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product.  This 
definitio n is applied to all the study groups and is applied to all groups beginning 
from the time of consent. The term “investigational product” for this study refers to all study products. Study participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_572017]-up.  
In the case of a life-threatening event, they will be instruct ed to seek immediate 
emergency care. Where feasible and medically appropriate, participants will be encouraged to se ek evalu ation where the study clinician is based, and to request that 
the clinician be contact[CONTACT_18110]. Study staff will obtain  written 
permission from the participant to obtain and use records from non-study medical 
providers to complete any missing data element on a CRF related to an adverse event.  
All participants reporting an untoward medical occurrence will be followed clini cally, 
25February 2019 v1.0 
33 
 until the occurrence resolves (returns to baseline) or stabilizes.  
The study physician will determine AE res olution or stabilization in their best clinical 
judgment.  Study site staff will document in source documents all AEs reported by [CONTACT_572018]. Study staff will record all AEs on case report forms.  
 
14.4 Serious Adverse Events 
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be defined by [CONTACT_572019] (Version 2.0, dated January 2010) as AEs 
occurring at any dose that:  
1. Result s in death  
2. Is life -threatening  
3. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
4. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect    
5. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
6. The following are examples of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n that will not be considered to be 
AEs:  
a. Protocol-specified admission (e.g. for procedure required by [CONTACT_18113])  
b. Admission for treatme nt of target disease of the study, or for pre-
existing condition (unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_14844])  
c. Diagnostic admission (e.g. for a work-up of an existing condition such 
as persistent pretreatment lab abnormality)  
d. Administrative admission (e.g. for annual physical)  
e. Social admission (e.g. placement for lack of place to sleep)  
f. Elective admission (e.g. for elective surgery)  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
25February [ADDRESS_751199] will be as sessed per the Manual for 
Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2.0, dated January 2010). Per the Manual f or Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2.0, 
dated January 2010), the relationship categories that will be used for this study are: 
1. Related : AE and administration of study product are related in time, and a 
direct association can  be demo nstrated  
2. Possibly related : There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event, 
incident, experience or outcome may have been c aused by [CONTACT_182821].  
3. Not related : There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is  related  to the 
study agent(s)  
 
14.6 Grading Severity of Events  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatri c Adverse 
Events, Version 2.1, March 2017 will be the primary tools for grading adverse events 
for this protocol.   
14.7 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcomes 
 
25February 2019 v1.0 
35 
 Participation in this study requires taking a Pregnancy Category B medication outside 
of routine clinical care; therefore only women not intending to become pregnant will 
be enrolled into this study. The duration of m edicatio n dosing is short (5 days before 
each sampling visit) and scheduled during the early phases of the menstrual cycle (pre-ovulation); therefore the risk of unintentional in utero drug exposure is low. 
Women will be  tested at screening  using a serum pregnancy  test (human chorionic 
gonadotropin; hCG) and immediately prior to enrollment and each sampling visit 
using a urine pregnancy test. They will be required to use at least 1 pregnancy 
prevention strategy during their participation in the study. These  may inc lude 
abstinence for 3 months preceding; monogamy with a vasectomized cisgender male or a cisgender female partner; condoms with sper micide; a non -hormonal IUD; and 
hormonal contraception. Because the goal of this study is to characterize nucleotide  
concent rations within an individual during high and low estradiol exposure, only 
hormonal contraception options that do not impede cycle fluctuation will be allowed. Estradiol has been well characterized in women taking traditional 21/7 hormonal 
contracep tion regimens that allow for monthly menses. While peak estradiol 
concentrations are slightly diminished (1.6- 1.8 fold) after initiating thi s contraceptive 
regimen, estradiol’s overall concentration vs time profile follows a predictable pattern 
similar to the pre -contraception pattern.
5,6 Furthermo re, peak  estradiol concentrations 
are still 6 -9 fold greater than trough concentrations during these contraceptive cycles. 
Therefore, we wil l include women utilizing a traditional 21/7 hormonal contraception 
regimen in this study. Since estradiol fluctuations over  the contraceptive cycle are 
dramatically reduced by [CONTACT_572020]/off interval to 23/5 days5, women utilizing 
continuous hormonal contraception options such as Seasonique, injectable s, implants, 
and hormonal IUDs will be excluded from this study.  
 
Pregnancy -r elated data will be collected using th e pregna ncy CRFs for all 
pregnancies detected during the study. After the participant’s follow -up study visit, 
the study team will make every attempt to follow the participant until an outcome of 
the pregnancy can be ascertained to allow reporting of these outcome s meeting EAE 
criteria.  Pregnancy outcomes that meet criteria for EAE reporting as described above 
25February 2019 v1.0 
36 
 (e.g., maternal complications, congenital anomalies) occurring among participants 
known to be pregnant at the Final Study Visit will continue to be expeditiously 
reported.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_751200] participant privacy and 
confidentiality, it is possible that participants' involvement in the study could become 
known to others, and that social harms may res ult (i.e., because participants could 
become known as HIV-infected or at "high risk" for HIV infection).  For example, participants could be treated unfairly or discriminated against, or could have problems 
being accepted by [CONTACT_18115]/or c ommunities.   Social harms that are judged by 
[CONTACT_572021], or according to their individual requirements. In the event that a 
participant reports social harm, every eff ort will be made by [CONTACT_572022], and/or referral to appropriate 
resources for the safety of the participant as needed.  While maintaining participant 
confidentiality, study sites may engage thei r CABs i n exploring the social context 
surrounding instances of social harm. 
15.  Clinical Management  
 
In general, the site investigator has the discretion to discontinue study product use/participation at any time if they feel  that continued product use w ould be harmful 
to the participant or interfere with treatment deemed clinically necessary.  Unless otherwise specified below, the investigator should immediately consult the PSRT for 
further guidance regarding permanent discontinuation.  
The site investig a
 tor or designee will document all discontinuations on applicable 
case report forms.  
25February [ADDRESS_751201] experiences a Serious Adverse Event, enrollment will be held while 
the protocol undergoes review.  If 2 or more participants  experience Grade 3 or Grade 
4 adverse events, enroll ment will be held while the protocol undergoes review.   
 
Any Grade 3 or 4 or serious adverse event related to a study intervention (blood draw, 
biopsy) or the study drug will result in subject discontinuation.  Participants  who are 
withdrawn for safety reasons wi ll complete a follow -up visit within [ADDRESS_751202] their safety 
and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures, after consultation with the PSRT.  Participants also may be withdrawn if the stud y 
sponsors, government or regulatory authorities (including the Office of Human Research Protections), or site IRBs terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  
Every reasonable effort is made to complete a final evaluation of participants who 
withd raw or a re withdrawn from the study prior to completing follow-up.  Study staff 
members will record the reason(s) for all withdrawals in par ticipants’ study records.  
 
16.  Statistical Consideration  
16.1  Statistical analysis.  
 
We hypothesize that PrEP n ucleotid e concentrations in total rectal cells obtained via 
cytobrush will significantly correlate with isolated CD4+ T cells regardless of estradiol exposure. To test this hypothesis TFVdp and dATP concentrations in total 
rectal cells collected by [CONTACT_572023]4+ T cells 
isolated from rectal biopsies using Pearson’s correlation. We expect strong 
correlations ( >0.8) to exist during both visits. Linear regression will be performed for 
log10 concentrations of total rectal cell s (X) vs  isolated CD4+ T cells (Y) to describe 
the relationship between these sampling matrices within 
each visit. These analyses will also be performed for 
FTCtp and dCTP.  
16.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
 Power determination for the correlation  analysis was 
carried out using the R- package pwr.

 implements  the power ca lculatio n met hods described in Cohen, 1988.8 Assuming r is 
>0.78, a sample size of 10 women achieves 80% power (Figure 2). This assumed r 
value is more conservative than our previous observation of TFV concentration in 
rectal fluid versus tissue homogenate where r was 0.944. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_751203] responsibilities, and 
contraception counseling.  Additionally, laboratory results, concomitant medications, 
proper error documentation, adherence to unit specific SOPs, and CRF completion 
will be assessed.  When meeting for “on -study” reviews, the key indicators that will 
be assessed are SAE reporting, adverse event monitoring, and implem entation  of new 
protocol versions and amendments.  Additionally, missed visits, proper symptom 
grading, laboratory results, concomitant medications, proper error documentation, 
adherence to unit specific SOPs, and CRF completion will be reassessed.  Additional 
training on source documentation and good clinical practices will be addressed as 
needed.   
17.2 Sample and Data Analysis  
 
25February 2019 v1.0 
41 
 All blood, c ells, and rectal tissue samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_572024] (C PAC) at the UNC School of 
Pharmacy, which is directed by [CONTACT_18095], PharmD. TFV and FTC will be 
quantified in plasma by [CONTACT_311879]- MS/MS methods (lower limit of quantification; 
LLOQ=1ng/ml). TFVdp, FTCtp, dATP and dCTP will be quantified in PBMCs and rectal  cell lysates by [CONTACT_311879] -MS/MS methods (LLOQ=0.02ng/ml). These 
analyses will be performed at the UNC CFAR Clinical Pharmacology  and Analytical 
Chemistry Core (see Kashuba letter).

19.2 Institutiona l Review Boards 
 
The final protocol (version 1.0) will be submitted along with the informed consent to 
t
he UNC IRB.   Modifications will be made to version 1.[ADDRESS_751206] benefit from their participation. Certain risks are associated with the study p rocedures and are listed 
below.     
19.4 Risks  
1. Blood Draws :   
Risks associated with blood draws include bleeding, di scomfort , feelings of 
dizziness or faintness, and/or bruising, swelling and/or infection.   
 
2. STI Screening/Reporting :   
Disclosure of STI status may cause sadness or depression in volunteers.  Partner notification of STI status may cause problems in their relation ships 
with their sexual partners. Additionally, participants could misunderstand the current experimental status of the study medica tion and as a result increase 
their HIV risk behaviors while in the study. The following STIs are required by [CONTACT_572028]: HIV, 
Syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Hepatitis B and C. 
 
3. Anoscopy with rectal  biopsy  and cells :  
This is a commonly practiced medical procedure and the procedures done in th
is trial will not in volve any unusual risks or discomforts.  The risks 
associated with these procedures include mild discomfort and the feeling of having a “bloated stomach.”  Ano scopic biopsies are painless and heal quickly 
(usually within three days).  On extremely rare occasions, the procedure or biopsies may lead to pain, infection (sepsis), bleeding or perforation of the 
25February [ADDRESS_751207].   Perforation occurs approximately once out of every 
100,000 procedures.  If this extremely rare complication occurs, antibiotics 
and surgery to repair the perforation may be necessary.  
 
4. Confidentiality :   
Participation in clinical research includes the risks of loss of confidentiality and discomfort with personal nature of questions. Although the study site 
makes every effort to pr otect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is 
possible that participants’ involvement in the study could become known to others, and that social harms may result.  
 5. Study  Drug :  
 
Truvada® tablets are fixed -dose combination tablets containing emtrici tabine 
(FTC) 200mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300mg in each table.  There is some experience in healthy volunteers taking Truvada®.  No new or 
unexpected side effects are observed with the fixed -dose tablet than those 
observed when each drug is given separately.  The dosing regimens will be consistent with package insert recommendations.  Individual daily doses of 
this magnitude were studied during development of both TDF and FTC and 
these were well tolerated.  In our previous studies using the fixed -dose tablet 
in healthy volunteer research projects, there were no serious adverse advents attributed to study drug. 
 
FTC.  The follow ing side effects have been associated with the use of FTC: 
Headache, dizziness, tiredness, inability to sleep, unusual dream s, loose or 
watery stools, upset stomach (nausea) or vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, 
itching, skin darkening of the palms/soles, increased cough, runny nose, and 
abnormal liver function tests.  
 
25February [ADDRESS_751208] will be provided 
with a  photocopy of all documents that she signs.  The informed consent process will 
cover all elements of informed consent required by [CONTACT_18125].  In addition, the process specifically will address the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_572007] s tudy: 
1. The unknown safety and unproven efficacy of the study products 
2. The need to practice safer sex behaviors regardless of study treatment group 
3. The importance of adherence to the study visit and procedures schedule 
4. The potential medical risks of study pa rticipation (and what to do if such risks 
are experienced)  
5. The potential social harms associated with study participation (and what to do 
if such harms are experienced)  
6. The real yet limited benefits of study participation  
7. The distinction between research and clin ical care  
8. The right to withdraw from the study at any time  
The informed consent process will include an assessment of each potenti al 
participant’s understanding prior to enrollment and sequential assignment of concepts identified by [CONTACT_133810].  
Participants who are not able to demonstrate adequate understanding of key concepts after exhaustive educational efforts will not be enrolled in the study.

these products on a developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081].    
19.10 Children  
 
The NIH  
 has mandated that children be included in research trials when appropriate. 
This study meets “Justifications for Ex clusion” criteria for younger children as set 
forth by [CONTACT_18121].  Specifically, “insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children” and “children should not be the initial group to be involved 
in research studies.”  This study does not plan to enroll children under [ADDRESS_751211] of parking in the UNC Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’ s designated visitor parking deck.  Meals will be provided when 
having a biopsy.  Participants will be given $ 40 for the screening, and $25 for the 
follow-up visit. They will be compensated $5 for each dose, for $50 total.  They will 
receive $225 for each biopsy day ($200 for biopsy and $25 for blood). A participant may be compensated $[ADDRESS_751212] epi[INVESTIGATOR_572008]. PLoS One .

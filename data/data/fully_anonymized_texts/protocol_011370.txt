1.1 Study  Objectives
Describe the  purpose, specific aims or objectives.  State the hypotheses to be tested.
The purpose  of this study is to compare the binocular distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity and 
patient reported outcomes of the Alcon Vivity and Bausch & Lomb enVista IOLs.
We hypothesize  that the Alcon Vivity and Bausch & Lomb enVista IOLs will have similar distance, 
intermediate, and near visual acuity.
(If the  null hypothesis is rejected, then the visual performance of the IOLs may be different).

secondary.  The endpoints (or outcomes), determined for each study subject, are the quantitative 
measurements required by [CONTACT_109613].  Measuring the selected endpoints is the goal of a trial 
(examples: response rate and survival).
Primary endpoints will include:
Mean logMAR best-distance  corrected visual acuity at intermediate (66 cm) tested in binocular photopic 
conditions at 3 months.
1.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
State the  secondary endpoints to be measured in the study.
Secondary endpoints  will include:
- Visual  acuity:
oMean logMAR  uncorrected visual acuity at distance (4 m), intermediate (66 cm), and near (40 
cm), tested in monocular and binocular photopic conditions
oMean logMAR  best-distance corrected visual acuity at distance (4 m) and near (40 cm), testing in 
monocular and binocular photopic conditions.
oProportion  of subjects with a binocular distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) of 20/40 
(logMAR = 0.3) or better, at 3 months
oDefocus  curve, tested in binocular photopic conditions (4 m)
- Refractive  outcomes of comparator products
oMean prediction error  (MPE)
oAbsolute  prediction error (APE)

2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific Background  and Gaps
Describe the  scientific background and gaps in current knowledge. 
STUDY00015524
Approval: 7/26/2022
Page 5 of  31 (V.01/21/2019) For clinical  research studies being conducted at Penn State Health/Penn State College of Medicine, and 
for other non-PSH locations as applicable, describe the treatment/procedure that is considered standard 
of care (i.e., indicate how patients would be treated in non-investigational setting); and if applicable, 
indicate if the study procedure is available to patient without taking part in the study.
Presby[CONTACT_109614] (PC-IOL) technology has been available for decades. Lens designs 
have included refractive (e.g. AMO ReZoom), apodized diffractive (e.g. Alcon Acrysof ReSTOR/PanOptix), 
accommodating (B&L Crystalens), and extended depth-of-focus (e.g. J&J Symfony) technology. Spectacle 
independence is significantly higher with PC-IOLs when compared with that of monofocal IOLs.1,[ADDRESS_121531] the ability to change its refractive power. Spherical aberration, which may come from the cornea 
or IOL, plays an important role in pseudoaccommodation.5,6 There is a small body of literature that IOLs 
(e.g. Mini WELL, SIFI, Catalina, Italy) with highly-positive spherical aberration can result in significant 
pseudoaccommodation and lower unwanted optical phenomena than current multifocal IOLs.[ADDRESS_121532] extraction. The single-pi[INVESTIGATOR_109600] a 6.0 mm 
diameter and has a hyper-prolate profile that extends the depth of focus to deliver a broader range of 
sharp vision, with the glare and halo profile approaching that of a monofocal IOL.8
The Bausch &  Lomb enVista MX60E is a posterior chamber hydrophobic acrylic IOL. The single-pi[INVESTIGATOR_109601] a 6.0 mm diameter and has a neural aspheric optical profile. This neutral aspheric profile, combined 
with the cornea’s natural positive spherical aberration, may extend the depth of focus relative to other 
negative aspheric hydrophobic acrylic monofocal IOLs on the market.
To date,  there is no existing literature comparing the visual performance of the two above mentioned 
lens technologies; namely, one that relies on a non-diffractive, hyper-prolate profile and another that 
relies on the cornea’s natural positive spherical aberration to provide pseudoaccommodation.
2.2 Previous Data
Describe any  relevant preliminary data.
The FDA Summary  of Safety and Effectiveness on the Alcon Vivity IOL compares visual and patient 
reported outcomes of the Alcon Vivity IOL and the Alcon Acrysof SN60WF. While the Alcon Acrysof 
SN60WF and Bausch & Lomb enVista lenses are not identical, they are considered similar. The document 
reported improved intermediate vision with the Alcon Vivity over the SN60WF, and rates of reported 
visual disturbances were similar between the two devices.
2.3 Study  Rationale
Provide the  scientific rationale for the research.
Whereas the  Alcon Acrysof SN60WF has a negative aspheric optical profile, the Bausch & Lomb enVista 
has a neutral aspheric optical profile. Theoretically, the Bausch & Lomb enVista IOL may provide 
increased intermediate vision compared with the SN60WF.

8.2 Sample size  determination
If applicable,  provide a justification of the sample size outlined in section 8.1  to include reflections on, 
or calculations of, the power of the study.
The FDA Summary  of Safety and Effectiveness Data on the Alcon Vivity IOL  compared the Alcon Vivity 
IOL to the Alcon Acrysof IQ SN60WF. It demonstrated binocular DCIVA’s of 0.054 (SD = 0.09) and 0.196 
(SD 0.113) logMAR units, respectively (Table 25; difference of 0.142). The difference between the 
DCNVAs was similar.8 We hypothesize that the neutral asphericity of the B&L enVista IOL will result in a 
slightly improved DCIVA and DCNVA as compared with that of the SN60WF. As such, we assumed that 
the mean difference in the DCIVA or DCNVA between the two study devices will be ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_121561]. Dee Stephenson also described the MX60E as having monocular UCIVA 
and UCNVA  of 0.17 ± 0.17 and 0.44 ± 0.33 D, respectively.12 Binocular UCIVA and UCNVA for the Alcon 
Vivity IOL  was 0.058 ± 0.083 and 0.208 ± 0.104 D, respectively (monocular logMAR not reported).8 
Although monocular and binocular acuities are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_109605], the difference between the 
Vivity and MX60E IOLs might be approximately 0.11 for intermediate and 0.24 logMAR units, based 
upon this above information. The higher SDs are likely due to the uncorrected astigmatism in this 
population.
The sample  size calculation was performed using http://clincalc.com. Based on a difference in binocular 
DCIVA of 0.[ADDRESS_121562] to follow-up.

logMAR notation to facilitate averaging and analysis.
The paired sample  t-test or nonparametric Wilcoxan signed-rank test will be used to compare 
monocular and binocular visual acuity under uncorrected and distance-corrected conditions. 
Comparisons between patients with different IOLs will be evaluated with independent sample t-tests or 
the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for visual acuity and refractive outcomes, depending on the 
normality of the data. The level of significance will be set at p < 0.05.
9.0 Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan
This section is  required when research involves more than Minimal Risk to subjects as defined in “HRP-001 
SOP- Definitions.”
Minimal Risk  is defined as the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research that 
are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of 
routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.  For research involving prisoners, Minimal Risk is the 
probability and magnitude of physical or psychological harm that is normally encountered in the daily lives, or in 
the routine medical, dental, or psychological examination of healthy persons. 
Please complete the  sections below if the research involves more than minimal risk to subjects, otherwise 
indicate each section as not applicable.

The risks to  study subjects are the same risks as those patients would normally incur before, during, and after 
cataract surgery.
Intraocular lenses that seek to provide intermediate or near vision without glasses may be associated with additional 
risks that include blurry vision not correctable with glasses or contact [CONTACT_109631], haloes, glare, hazy or blurry vision. In an FDA trial that compared similar lenses to the ones being 
evaluated in this study, these visual phenomena were severe or very bothersome in 3-4% of patients. This specific 
risk has been explained in detail in the informed consent form, and will also be reviewed verbally at the time of 
consent for surgery.
There is  a small risk to the subjects of loss of confidentiality. Safeguards as described in the Data Management 
Plan are in place to minimize these risk.

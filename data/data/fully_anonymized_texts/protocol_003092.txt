This project was initially opene d at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (Penn) by [CONTACT_28824] (Jun Mao, MD, MSCE).  [CONTACT_260198] has change d institutions as of December 7th, 
2015 ; he is now at MSK.  As of June 30, 2016, ninety participants were enrolled at Penn.  The 
protocol currently open at Penn will remain open there and will continue to be administered by [CONTACT_72698]. 
A separate and parallel protocol will be open at MSK upon MSK‟s IRB approval.  Target enrollment 
at MSK will be 40 patients.  Target enrollment at Penn will be 120 patients.  At the end of the study, 
Penn will send deidentified data and samples to MSK.  The appropriate material transfer and data 
transfer agreements will be executed for this transfer. The datasets will be combined for analysis. 
The funding agen cy (PCORI), Penn‟s IRB, and their Cancer Center suppo rt this plan. Upon MSK‟s 
IRB approval, we plan to enroll 20 patients at MSK in 2016 and another 20 in 2017 . 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS 
  
To determine which of the treatments (acupun cture or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
[CBT-I]) is more effective for insomnia (Primary outcome) and co-morbid symptoms (i.e. pain, fatigue, 
and psychologi cal distress) in individuals with cancer. 
 
• Primar y Aim: To compare the effectiveness of acupun cture versus CBT for insomnia and 
co-morbid symptoms. 
 
• Secondary Aim 1: To identify patient-level demographic characteristics (e.g. gende r), 
clinical factors (e.g. pain), and psychologi cal attributes (e.g. outcome expectancy), that are 
associated with a better Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI) score at Week 8 (post-intervention) in 
acupun cture or CBT-I. 
 
• Secondary Aim 2: To understand patients‟ experiences of acupun cture or CBT-I to better 
inform future decision-making, intervention refinement, and treatment dissemination. 
 
• Exploratory Aim 1: To unde rstand the potential impact of sleep disruption and insomnia 
treatment on memory, attention, and concentration.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
Burden of Cancer and Insomnia: Cancer is one of the leading causes of globa l morbidity 
and mortality, second only to heart disease. [ADDRESS_779594] e will require ongoing 
treatment for persistent side effects from cancer and its treatments. Compared with the 
gene ral population, cancer survivors are at a greater risk for chronic physical and 
psychologi cal symptoms. 2,3 Sleep disturbances, primarily in the form of insomnia, are an 
especially important, but frequently overlooked, consequen ce of cancer. 4,5 Several large- 
scale epi[INVESTIGATOR_591364] 60% of people treated for cancer 
experience insomnia. 6,[ADDRESS_779595] frequen t reasons that cancer survivors visit their gene ral practitioners and 
correspond s to 7.8 fewer workdays and $2,[ADDRESS_779596] reported that it bega n 
with, or followed, their cancer diagno sis and that the effects of poor sleep were more 
overwhelming than the effects of cancer treatment. 10 
 
Insomnia and Co-morbid Symptoms: Cancer-related sleep disturbances are particularly 
pernicious because of their nega tive relationship to psychologi cal health and physical well- 
being . More often than not, insomnia co-exists with pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, 
creating a positive feedba ck loop in which all symptoms are amplified and overall symptom 
burden is increased. In a study exploring the relationships between patient-reported pain, 
fatigue, depressed mood, and difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] 11,[ADDRESS_779597] pain and fatigue levels. 
 
Need for Non-pharmacologi cal Treatment: Considering the prevalence, significance, and 
impact of insomnia, cancer patients require information abou t treatment options in order to 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 16 -947 A(5) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_779598] cancer, 46% 
received a prescription for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_591365].14   Althoug h sleep 
medication is only recommende d for short-term use, 30% of the original sample was still 
using prescription sleep aids one year following treatment completion. Unfortunately, 
sedative medications can have substantial side effects. Long-term hypnotic use is associated 
with continued sleep difficulty and performance problems, memory disturbances, driving 
accidents, and falls in the gene ral population.15  As such, many patients often prefer non- 
pharmacological interventions to treat insomnia. In a quali tative study condu cted by [CONTACT_6283]. Mao 
and Barg with White and African American cancer survivors, some patients indicated their 
desire for natural approaches to avoid addin g another “toxin” to their body after 
chemotherapy. Others simply wanted to avoid poly-pharmacy given that their many co- 
morbid conditions often require ten or greater medications already.16  These findings suppo rt 
the need for rigorously evaluating the effects of, and patient preferences for, non- 
pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_591366]-morbid symptoms in cancer.Gap in 
Evidence: Acupun cture and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) are both 
widely available and commonly used non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia and other 
co-morbid symptoms. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a documented preference for non-pharmacological methods of 
treating insomnia, there is currently a gap in the evidence available as to the comparative 
effectiveness of these options. [ADDRESS_779599] a number of neurotransmitters and hormonal 
factors known to be involved in sleep regulation, such as serotonin, melatonin, and gamma- 
aminobu tyric acid (GABA). 21  A systematic review of 20 rando mized controlled trials of 
acupun cture for insomnia sugge sted that traditional needle acupun cture was slightly more 
effective than benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s with response rates for acupun cture and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s 
being 91% and 75%. [ADDRESS_779600] sleep. 24 While the evidence for the use in insomnia and comorbid 
symptoms is compelling , acupun cture research has also been criticized for having 
substantial poor methodolo gies such as small sample size, questionabl e randomization, poor 
reporting, and inappropriate analyses. 25-27 Our study aims to address these methodologi cal 
challenge s and provide reliable evidence that patients and providers can rely on.Cognitive 
Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a form of CBT specifically for insomnia that 
combines principles from stimulus control therapy (developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a learned association between 
the bed and sleep) and sleep restriction therapy (consolidation of sleep periods through 
buildu p of sleep drive) with formal cognitive restructuring (reducing misconceptions abou t 
sleep) in order to target hyperarousal, dysfunctional beha viors and maladap tive thoughts, 
belie fs, and attitudes associated with insomnia. CBT-I is recommende d by [CONTACT_591392] a first line treatment for insomnia,28,29  is considered well 
established by [CONTACT_216418],30    and has demonstrated efficacy in 
many rando mized controlled trials.31-34  A review of studies with clinical samples of individuals

with primary insomnia concluded that CBT-I is a highly effective treatment for sleep 
disturbance and produces significant improvements in a variety of subjective sleep 
componen ts.35  In preparation for this proposal, our team completed a systematic review of 
eight controlled and four uncontrolled trials of CBT-I in cancer patients and concluded that 
CBT-I is associated

with clinically and statistically meani ngful sleep improvements in cancer patients.36 
Recent evidence also sugge sts that CBT-I is effective in reducing clinical levels of fatigue, 
anxiety, and depression related to cancer treatment. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_591367]- I is an 
effective intervention, there is still a significant proportion of individuals whose insomnia 
does not respond or remit after treatment. In a study comparing CBT-I alone or combined 
with medication, 40% of those randomized to CBT-I did not experience a treatment 
response and 61% still experienced residual insomnia symptoms.34  Considering that 32- 
89% of patients treated with CBT-I (including those with cancer) do not consistently follow 
treatment recommenda tions,38  poor adhe rence may be one factor accounting for these 
finding s. Additionally, perhaps CBT-I does not adequately, or comprehen sively, address 
the multitude of factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of insomnia 
(e.g. autonomic hyperarousal).39  There is an increasing awareness that not all treatments 
are effective for every person and that treatment decisions should be guide d by [CONTACT_9702]- 
level factors such as personal preference. 40 For beha vioral interventions like CBT-I, which 
require a significant investment of time and active participation, patient preference for 
treatment is a particularly important contributor to patient adherence and outcomes. 41,42 
Clearly, there is a need to improve and/or expand the available insomnia treatment 
options. 
 
Rationale for the study: 
• We chose to compare acupun cture again st CBT-I because CBT-I is the current gold 
standa rd non-pharmacological intervention for insomnia. 28,29 Our patient stakeholders 
were clear that they preferred non-pharmacological interventions. 
• We did not include a usual care or waitlist control because both acupun cture and 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 16 -947 A(5) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_779602] already demonstrated superiority over no-treatment control groups. 
Research demonstrating that insomnia is relatively stable once developed 7 reduces 
the potential for chang e due to the passage of time alone (maturation) or statistical 
regression towards the mean. 
• We have chosen the Insomnia Severity Index 51 as the primary outcome measure 
because it has been validated in cancer popula tions with excellen t reliability and 
validity. The ISI captures the daytime impairment and subjective distress associated 
with insomnia, has clinical cutoffs for symptom severity, and has established minimally 
important chang e values to ensure that the change s produced are not only significantly 
but also clinically significant to patients. When our patient stakeholders reviewed the 
available options they preferred the ISI because it is short, easy to complete, and has 
face validity. 
• We incorporated patient-centered seconda ry outcomes of pain, physical and mental 
fatigue, anxiety, and depression because these were the areas that our advisory pane l 
told us were impacted the most by [CONTACT_591393]. We also included a measure 
of quali ty of life in order to capture the potential for insomnia treatment to improve 
overall well-being.  
 
In summary, the proposed study is highly significant in that it is the first rigorously designed 
comparative effectiveness study ever to examine the relative benefits of acupun cture and 
CBT-I. As summarized in the background section, with the help of our patient partners, we 
have built a conceptual model that is grounde d in the current scientific unde rstandin g of 
acupun cture, CBT-I, and insomnia. It is also the first study to incorporate carefully selected 
social-demographic, clinical, and psychologi cal factors to examine the predictors and 
moderators of treatment effect of both acupun cture and CBT-I. The results of the proposed 
study have the potential to improve healthcare and outcomes by [CONTACT_591394] g cancer survivors 
and their caregivers make informed and evidenc e-based decisions and leadin g to patient-
centered and individualized care for cancer survivors with insomnia. 
 
 
Role of Patient and Stakeholder Advisory Panel 
 
Our patient advisory panel consists of eight patients, one caregiver, and two representatives 
of cancer suppo rt organizations. The pane l is diverse in terms of cancer type, stage, age, 
race, sex, educational level and occupational status. The panel helped generate the research 
question, choose the comparison groups, develop patient-centered inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, refine the research protocol, choose the most appropriate outcomes, and decide on 
specific measurement tools. Our patient partners will help to ensure that our research is able 
to engag e participants from a diverse audience. W e have created four committees consisting 
of researchers and patient partners with oversight of key research componen ts: recruitment, 
outcomes, interpretation, and dissemination. The research team and patient partners will 
attend bi-annua l meetings to review the research progress, develop or revise recruitment and 
engage ment strategies, and plan for dissemination efforts. 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
 
4.[ADDRESS_779603] a parallel-randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 16 -947 A(5) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_779604] finished primary treatment.  Forty patients will be enrolled in 
this study at MSK.  A parallel study is being condu cted at Penn.  Deidentified data from 
the 120 patients enrolled at Penn will be combined with the MSK data for analysis. Eligible 
patients will be randomly assigned to acupun cture or CBT-I. In the acupun cture group, 
patients will receive ten treatments of acupun cture over eight weeks. In the CBT-I group, 
patients will receive seven sessions of CBT-I over eight weeks. Patients will complete 
valida ted patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of sleep and co-morbid symptoms at 
baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at monthly intervals for [ADDRESS_779605]-intervention to elicit their 
experience of their insomnia and cancer, their attitudes, beliefs, and preferences for a 
specific intervention prior to the intervention, as well as explore what influences their 
decision to choose a particular treatment. Structured interviews will not be done as part of 
the MSK protocol.  At the end of intervention, we will elicit both expected and unexpected 
bene fits and side effects of treatments, assess change s in patient 
attitudes/beliefs/preferences, and gather recommenda tions for how to disseminate our 
finding s. In keepin g with standa rds for transparent reporting of clinical trials, we will follow 
the CONSORT guideline s for reporting of non-pharmacological treatment interventions  43 
and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupun cture (STRICTA). 
44   In designing the current study we relied heavily on the Effectiveness Guidan ce 
Document for conducting comparative effectiveness research of acupun cture interventions. 
45 
 
 
4.2 Intervention 
 
Acupun cture: After the acupun cture evaluation, the acupun cture procedure will be carefully 
explained to each subject. The patient will be positioned in a comfortable position, either in a 
massage chair or lying on an exam table depen ding upon patient comfort and need for 
access to appropriate acupun cture points. Each acupun cture session lasts approximately 30 
minutes. Licensed acupun cturists will administer acupun cture following the acupun cture 
protocol and procedure (Appen dix 1) twice per week for two weeks, then weekly for six more 
weeks, for a total of ten treatments over eight weeks. The first visit to an acupun cturist often 
involves a more detailed history and an examination that takes an additional [ADDRESS_779606] time is abou t 330 minutes. 
 
The FDA classifies acupuncture needl es as a Class II medical device for “gene ral acupuncture 
use” by [CONTACT_591395], registered or certified practitioners. The acupuncture groups at each site have 
performed many clinical trials in acupuncture without significant adverse events. 
 
Cogni tive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT -I): CBT-I is a multi-componen t 
intervention that includes sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, relaxation 
training , and sleep hygiene (See Append ix 2). Sleep restriction is designed to restrict time 
spent in bed to closely match the time actually spent sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A sleep efficiency percentage 
(the amount of time spent sleepin g divided by [CONTACT_591396]) is calculated 
and when the individual is able to achieve 90% sleep efficiency their sleep time is increased. 
This process continues until the person can achieve a restful night‟s sleep with few or no

disturbances. Stimulus control is based on the theory that the body eventually becomes 
conditioned to associate the sleep time and setting with arousal (e.g. only go to bed when 
sleepy and refrain from lying awake in bed). This techniqu e is designed to break the 
perpetuating behaviors and re-associate the bed with positive sleep experiences. Cognitive 
restructuring addresses the dysfunctional thoug hts and beliefs that serve to maintain and 
exacerbate insomnia. Individuals are taugh t to monitor these though ts and belie fs, challe nge 
their validity, and replace them with adap tive cognitions condu cive to the sleep process. 
Relaxation training targets the physiologi cal and cognitive arousal that accompanie s 
insomnia and sleep hygiene promotes healthy sleep behaviors and environmental conditions. 
Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_591368]-I for six weeks followed by [CONTACT_591397], for a total of seven sessions over eight weeks. The first CBT-I 
session lasts [ADDRESS_779608] role. We will largely draw from 
our existing pool of experienced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (mental health counselors, psychologi sts, 
psychiatrists, social workers, and advanced psychologi st trainee s) already trained for our 
ongoin g trials. 
 
Supervision and training for CBT-I interventionists will be condu cted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Katherine 
Duhamel and/or [CONTACT_591428] m, both of whom have extensive training and 
supervision experience in these approaches, and will include both didactic and experiential 
training . At study start-up, intensive training workshops in the delivery of CBT-I will be 
provided, with a focus on the unique issues of cancer survivors. These training s will focus on 
the acquisition of skills in the condu ct of the sessions. All interventionists will be provided 
with a copy of the manual , describing in detail the philosophy, format, and techniques 
involved in the approach. Drs. Duhamel and Appleb aum  will lead weekly supervision 
sessions for the different providers. Interventionists will receive intensive supervision, and 
their competency in the approach will be continually assessed.

provided by [CONTACT_52893]; and (4) maintain minimal PHI information in a screenin g 
log of patients approached. 
 
8.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION 
 
 
Initial Screening: All potential participants will unde rgo an initial screenin g with a research 
study assistant (RSA) in person or over the telephone . At this initial contact, the study goals 
and procedures will be explained and the research study assistant will ensure that 
participants meet basic eligibili ty criteria, including having an insomnia severity score greater 
than 7. 
 
Diagnostic Phone Interview: Interested participants will be schedule d to be interviewed by 
[CONTACT_97535] e by a trained member of the research staff to complete a diagno stic interview for 
insomnia and confirm inclusion/exclusion requirements.  Research staff condu cting the 
diagno stic interview will review with a study investigator, and the study investigator will 
approve the patient‟s insomnia diagno sis per the diagnostic interview condu cted with 
research staff. 
 
Confirmed eligibl e patients will then be schedule d to meet with a trained member of the 
research staff to obtain informed consent and complete the baseline assessment. 
 
Sleep Apnea Screening Protocol: Interested patients will be screene d for possible 
obstructive sleep apne a using the Multivariable Apnea Prediction (MAP) form (Appendix 3). 
The Multivariable Apnea Prediction (MAP) Index and computing tools were developed by [CONTACT_591404][INVESTIGATOR_591375], 
University of Pennsylvania Medical Center.  A cut off score of 0.[ADDRESS_779617] residual insomnia 
symptoms they will be welcome to participate in the trial. Should the patient not want to 
speak with their doctor about their potential sleep apnea, they will still be able to enroll. We 
will use their MAP score to determine whether it is significantly related to treatment outcome. 
 
 
Baseline Assessment: After consenting, the patients will complete the baseline assessment 
which includes questionnai res and a blood draw. Please refer to Table 2 for questionnaires 
collected at baseline. Patients who endo rsed difficulties with attention, concentration and/or 
memory will also complete the supple mentary cognitive measures. Identification of patients 
who have difficulties with attention, concentration and/or memory is by [CONTACT_591405] “ Have you experienced any difficulty with attention, concentration and/or 
memory as a result of your cancer treatment and/or insomnia?” At this time, we will assess 
belie fs abou t insomnia and pre-rando mization treatment expectancy using validated

measures. Treatment preference will be elicited using the Treatment Acceptance and 
Preference (TAP) instrument with two sequen tial questions. The first item asks participants to 
indicate whether they have a preference for one of the two treatment options (yes or no). The 
second question asks participants with a preference to indicate which option is the preferred 
choice. The participant will be informed that there are two treatment options unde r 
investigation and there is an interest in learning abou t his or her perception of each treatment. 
A verbal description of the ﬁrst treatment option will be read aloud in a slow, clear, and 
unbia sed manne r and the participant will be asked to respond to the TAP items measuring 
treatment acceptability and preference in relation to the option presented. This process will 
be repea ted for the other treatment. The presentation of the treatment options will be 
alternated to prevent sequen cing effects.  All participants will then receive the details of their 
treatment group allocation. The RSA will provide participants with two weeks of sleep diaries 
to complete at home. 
 
Blood Draw: In preparation of a future grant submission, blood samples will be collected at 
baseline, at the end of the intervention, and at the final follow up assessment to be banked 
for future correlative studies related to the intervention should we identify any literature 
during the condu ct of the trial demonstrating that specific biomarkers are associated with 
symptoms or treatment responses. Patients will be able to opt out of the blood draw or 
provide a saliva sample if desired.  Saliva samples are collected once at baseline.  Samples 
will be stored at -80°C until ready for processing.  (See Appendix 5 for details).  If there is 
anything left over, it will be banked for future use under 06-107.

9.0  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
  
Acupun cture: Licensed acupun cturists will administer acupun cture twice per week for two weeks, 
then weekly for six more weeks, for a total of ten treatments over eight weeks. The first visit to an 
acupun cturist often involves a more detailed history and an examination that takes an additional [ADDRESS_779621] time is abou t 330 minutes.  A window of +/- 3 days will be allowed for 
these treatment appoin tments.  Refer to Append ix 1 for acupun cture protocol. 
 
Cogni tive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT -I): Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_591376]-I for six weeks followed by [CONTACT_591406], for a total of seven 
sessions over eight weeks. The first CBT-I session lasts [ADDRESS_779622] time to 240 minutes.  A window of +/- 3 days will be allowed for 
these treatment appoin tments.  Refer to Append ix 2 for CBT-I protocol. 
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION DUR ING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION 
  
The study schema and study schedul e were presented in Section 1.0, Figure 1, and Section 8.0, 
Table 2, respectively. The following questionnai res (Appen dix 4) will be collected according to the 
study schedul e table. 
 
Primar y Outcome - Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): We will use patient-reported insomnia severity 
as measured by [CONTACT_117669] ( ISI) as the primary study outcome. The ISI is one of 
the few well-validated patient-reported outcome measures designed to specifically assess the 
impact on daytime functioning and the amount of associated distress. 47 The ISI includes 7 items that 
are scored on a five-point scale rangin g from 0 to 4 with highe r scores representing more severe 
insomnia symptoms. The optimal cutoff scores are 0-7 (no clinically significant sleep difficulties, 8-14

(sleep difficulties warrant further investigation) and 15+ (presence of clinically significant insomnia). 
[ADDRESS_779624] validity, specificity and 
sensitivity in a representative sample of 1670 cancer patients. 46 The ISI has established minimally 
important chang e values to ensure that the chang e is not only statistically, but also clinically, 
meaning ful to patients. 48 A reduction of eight points has been deemed to be clinically significant 
improvement. 48   The ISI has been used in several insomnia trials in cancer survivors and has 
demonstrated sensitivity to chang e in response to intervention as well as discriminating effects 
between interventions. 
 
Secondary Sleep Outcomes: The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) was specifically designed 
for use in clinical popu lations to assess seven componen t scores (subjective sleep quality, sleep 
latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleepin g medication, 
and daytime dysfunction) and a global score. It consists of 19 self-rated questions that are scored on 
a 0 to 3 scale over a period of one month. It has sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing good and 
poor sleepe rs. Acceptable measures of internal homogenei ty, consistency (test-retest reliabili ty), and 
validity have been demonstrated. 50,51 
 
The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) provides a night-by-night, self-report of sleep duration, disruption, 
and perceived quality and will be used to capture more subtle variations in sleep. The sleep diary will 
be used to calculate sleep efficiency, sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, 
time in bed, number of awakenings, sleep quality, and terminal wakefulness. Sleep diaries are 
considered a reliabl e and valid patient report of nightly insomnia symptoms. 52   Participants will 
complete the sleep diary daily througho ut treatment. 
 
Secondary Comorbid Symptom Outcomes: 
Brief Pain Inventory (BP I): An 11-item pain assessment tool for use with cancer patients. 53 The BPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_156421] (sensory dimension) and interference of pain in the patient's life 
(reactive dimension). It also queries the patient about pain relief, pain quality, and patient perception 
of the cause of pain. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_16884] a total score and two subscales, pain severity and pain 
interference. The psychometrics of the BPI  [INVESTIGATOR_591377]-established with Cronba ch‟s alpha ranging from 
0.77 to 0.91. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS): A 14-item, self-rated instrument for anxiety (7 items) 
and depression (7 items) symptoms in the past week and has been extensively used in people with 
cancer. 54 Established cutoffs for the depression and anxiety scales are indep endent and are: 0–7 
not significant; 8–10 subclinical; and 11-21 clinically significant depression/anxiety. 
 
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-Short Form (MFS I-SF): A 30 item self-report measure comprised 
of five subscales (gene ral, emotional, physical, mental, vigor) and a total fatigue score. Internal 
consistency range s from 0.[ADDRESS_779625] reliabilities ranging from 0.51 to 0.70. The 
MFSI-SF has demonstrated appropriate convergent and discriminant validity. 55   We chose MFSI-SF 
over the Brief Fatigue Inventory 56 based on feedback from our patient partner advisory pane l that 
mental fatigue was a unique and important consequen ce on insomnia that was not adequa tely 
captured by [CONTACT_591407].

Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information S ystem – Global Health Scale (PROMIS- 
GHS): The 10-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health 
Scale (PROMIS® Global 10) was used to assess key HRQOL domains includin g pain, fatigue, 
mental health, physical health, social health, and overall health. Prior psychometric work sugge sts 
the presence of two 4-item factors: globa l physical health (overall physical health, physical 
functioning , pain, and fatigue) and g lobal mental health (quality of life, mental health, satisfaction 
with social activities, and emotional problems)57. The physical and mental health summary scores 
will be scored according to PROMIS® instructions and transformed to T-score distributions with a 
mean of 50 and SD of 10. The PROMIS® T-score metric was set on the basis of a sample that is 
representative of the U.S. adult popul ation. Higher PROMIS® scores represent better 58 
 
Assessment of Potential Mediators of Outcome 
Treatment Acceptability and Preference (TAP): This measures patient acceptability and preference 
for treatment and is based on the methodology used by [CONTACT_591408]. 59 The speciﬁc attributes 
included in the TAP are: (a) appropriateness (i.e. the treatment option seems logical for addressing 
insomnia); (b) suitability to individual lifestyle; (c) effectiveness in managin g insomnia; and (d) 
convenien ce, operationalized as willingne ss to apply and adhe re to the treatment. Each of the four 
attributes are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from „not at all‟ (0) to „very much‟ (5), with highe r 
scores indicating that the treatment option is perceived as appropriate, suitable, and effective, and 
that the participant would be willing to adhere to it. A total score is computed as the mean of the four 
items‟ scores to reflect overall acceptability. This method of eliciting treatment acceptability and 
preferences was well received by [CONTACT_591409]. [ADDRESS_779627] 
researchers to gene rate a brief description of the treatment‟s purpose, componen ts and specific 
activities, role of provider, schedul e (number of sessions, frequen cy, and mode of delivery), bene fits, 
and risk of discomfort to ensure that the information is presented in a non-technical, clear and simple 
to unde rstand manne r at a 6th grade reading level. 
 
Causal Attributions of my Insomnia Questionnai re (C AM- I): This is a 12 item self-report measure that 
presents 12 domains often attributed to contribute to insomnia. 60 These include: sleep related 
though ts, hormonal factors, bodily arousal, gene tic factors, lifestyle factors, thinking patterns, 
biochemical factors, environmental factors, scheduling , sleep-related emotions, other emotions, and 
developmental factors. The questions are rated on a 7-point Likert scale with three anchors, „very 
likely,‟ „neither likely nor unlikely,‟ and „very unlikely.‟ Responses on the CAM-I have been 
associated with preference for psychologi cal or biological treatment options. This measure will be 
particularly important to determine the relative importance or impact of patient beliefs about 
insomnia on treatment outcome. Each item is assessed separately. 
 
Treatment Expectancy Scale (TES): A 4-item instrument develope d by [CONTACT_591410] (PI) et al. Outcome 
expectancy has long been considered an important predictor of treatment outcomes 61 and has 
gaine d important consideration in acupun cture in recent years. 62   It has demonstrated reliab ility 
(Cronba ch‟s α of 0.82) and validity and is positively c orrelated with patient self-reported efficacy and 
satisfaction. [ADDRESS_779628] control group. 65 Baseline expectancy predicted

Hyperarousal Scale (HAS): A [ADDRESS_779630] objective measures of EEG  arousal. 66 
Items are rated on a four point Likert scale rangin g from „0-not at all‟ to „3-extremely.‟ Considering 
that insomnia is characterized by [ADDRESS_779631] 
treatment outcomes. A single total score is provided. 
 
Cogni tive Measures: 
Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS): The BADDS is a 40-item scale that measures a 
range of symptoms related to attention. The items are scored on a 4-point scale (0 = never, 1 = once 
a week or less, 2 = twice a week, 3 = almost daily) and are grouped into five subscales: 1 
(Organizing and Activating to work), 2 (Sustainin g Attention and Concentration), 3 (Sustaining 
Energy and Effort), 4 (Manag ing Affective Interference), and 5 (Utilizing Working Memory and 
Accessing Recall). A total score is also calculated. The BADDS has been used to assess attention in 
peri- and post-menopau sal women and has demonstrated sensitivity to change . [ADDRESS_779632] (BSR): The BSR is a valida ted measure of memory retention and 
retrieval. Subjects are read a list of 16 words and asked to recall as many as possible in a total of 6 
trials immediate recall) and 20 minutes after completion of the sixth trial (delayed recall). Words are 
substituted from a standa rd set so that each word list is completely different each assessment time. 
The Total Recall is the sum of Short-term Recall and Long-term Recall. Performance on the 
Buschke was previously found to vary by [CONTACT_591411]. 70,71 
 
New Yor k University Paragraph Recall (NYU-PR): The NYU-PR test is a verbal memory measure 
that is one componen t of the Guild Memory Test. [ADDRESS_779633] responses. 
Scores range from 0–[ADDRESS_779634]. Alternate forms are 
used to avoid practice effects on re-testing. 73 
 
Blood Samples: Samples will be labeled with the subject‟s study ID, the date that the sample was 
drawn and type of the blood sample. The laboratory technicians will keep a log with the specimen 
information, conditions, processing, and storage information. 
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
Potential Risks: Patients will be monitored for side effects at each visit. Adverse effects related to 
the administration of acupun cture or CBT-I will be collected each week before and after each 
treatment by [CONTACT_591412]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_591378]. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 16 -947 A(5) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_779635] the 
health and safety of subjects will be taken. We will document all adverse events and report any 
related serious adverse events promptly to the IRB. 
 
Risk of Acupun cture and CBT-I: The risks associated with acupun cture and CBT-I are minor, and 
there are very few serious side effects. The most common side effects of acupun cture are mild pain 
on insertion of the needle, occurring at rates twice that of the placebo group. There is a possibility of 
a small amount of bleedin g or bruising and very rarely infections at the site of insertion. Every effort 
will be made to ensure the safety and comfort of the research subjects, including wipi[INVESTIGATOR_591379]. The most 
common side effects of CBT-I are short-term (less than 2 weeks) increases in daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_591380]. The acupun cture and CBT-I will be delivered by [CONTACT_591413] r the supervision of senior faculty psychologists . Every effort will be made to ensure the safety 
and comfort of the research subjects. Adverse events will be recorded during each clinical visit.  Any 
SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 5 calenda r days of the event. 
 
Risk of Blood Draw: A small number of peopl e find blood draws very uncomfortable. Risks and 
discomforts involved in having blood drawn are pain and bruising where the need le enters the skin 
and the possibility of infection or fainting. Standard of care procedures will be followed to minimize 
these risks. 
 
Confidentiality Risks: Information abou t study subjects will be kept confidential and manage d 
according to the requirements of the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 
The pape r data files will be kept in locked cabinets and electronic files will be kept in password 
protected computers. The data will be disclosed to the IRB upon request for regula tory and data 
safety monitoring. Seconda ry use of the data will not be attempted after the study ends without 
subsequen t IRB approval. 
 
Risk of psychologi cal distress: It is possible that subjects may be upset to find out that they are 
rando mized to their non-preferred arm of the study. With appropriate consent and the debriefing 
process, such risks are minimized. Subjects will be informed that they are participating in an 
experimental study to determine the comparative effectiveness of acupun cture or CBT for insomnia. 
They have the chance to be randomized to either intervention. At the end of the study, subjects will 
be offered the oppo rtunity to discuss the finding s with the PI. In addition, some of the questions in 
the questionnaire may elicit distress among subjects. At the baseline examination, patients will be 
screened for any elevated anxiety and depression or suicidal ideation/plan. If the subject 
demonstrates clinically significant distress, she/he will be referred to the psychosocial counseling 
services at each study site. During the study period, if the research staff identifies any patients who 
are psychologi cally distressed they will notify the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_591381].

Our primary outcome measure is the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), which will be measured at 
baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, 1-month, 2-month and 3-month follow-up visits. Our 
hypothesis is that between Acupun cture and CBT, one treatment will result in greater overall 
reduction in insomnia measured by [CONTACT_72244]. Our seconda ry outcomes will be measured by [CONTACT_53925] (BPI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) (see 
Section 10.0), etc. Our hypothesis is that between Acupun cture and CBT-I, one intervention will 
result in greater improvement in pain, fatigue, and psychologi cal distress than the other intervention 
for patients reporting insomnia. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_779637] unexpected 
medical visits or family events, if they miss two visits , but let study staff/PI [INVESTIGATOR_591382], we can 
reschedul e their visits.  Based on our experience doing these types of interventions, as long as 
patients get adequate sessions of treatments, their therapeutic outcomes should be optimal.  Any 
subject withdrawing their consent to participate in the study or their authorization to use their 
protected health information will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects discontinued from the 
clinical trial will be schedule d for a final evaluation and given appropriate treatment referrals. For 
the final visit, subjects will receive all assessments that were schedule d for the end of study visit. 
 
 
Subjects will be informed at the consent session that treatment may be discontinued due to: 
 
1)  Intolerable side effects (side effects felt by [CONTACT_102], therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], acupun cturist or physician to 
be of greater severity than the potential bene fit from treatment); 
2)  Failure to attend 2 consecutive acupun cture or CBT-I visits without notification of study staff; 
3)  Failure to complete questionnaires. 
 
 
If patients fail to attend sessions with notification, every effort will be made to reschedul e the patient 
such that they can receive the maximum number of treatments. 
 
Reasons why subjects are discontinued from the clinical trial will be documented on the Study 
Termination Form, along with any referrals that are made.  Every effort will be made to continue to 
collect data on every subject for the entire study duration regardless of whether or not the subject 
continues to adhe re to the study interventions, assuming the subject has not withdrawn his/her 
authorization to obtain such information.

Descriptive Statistics: Standa rd descriptive statistics will be used to report baseline participant 
characteristics. Summary statistics such as means, median s, standa rd deviations, and range s will 
be produced for measured variables. Frequencies will be tabulated for categorical and ordinal 
variables. Graphical methods will be used extensively to examine distributions, identify potentially 
influential points, and guide data transformations if warranted. For continuou s variables with 
markedly non-normal or skewed distributions, appropriate transformations may be required, such as 
natural logarithms, and will be applied as necessary and appropriate. In the sections below, we will 
assume, when discussing particular outcomes, that the appropriately transformed variables will be 
used. We will perform analysis according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle (i.e. participants will 
be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they will be rando mly allocated regardless of 
drop-out or treatment adherence status). 
 
Primary Aim Hypothesis Testing: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of acupun cture vs. 
CBT-I for insomnia and comorbid symptoms.  Primary Hypothesis: Between Acupun cture and CBT-I, 
one treatment will result in greater overall reduction in insomnia measured by [CONTACT_591414] (ISI). The primary endpoin t is ISI at week 8. The primary comparison will be ISA difference 
between groups at week 8. We will use mixed-effects models and will include ISI measures at all 
time points to address this primary hypothesis. Time by [CONTACT_591415]-effects models in order to obtain the between group difference of ISI at week 8.  Seconda ry 
Hypothesis: Between acupun cture and CBT, one intervention will result in greater improvement in 
pain, fatigue, and psychologi cal distress than the other intervention for patients reporting insomnia. 
Since our primary outcome (ISI) will be repeated over time, we will use mixed-effects models to

Missing Data: As the only certain way to avoid biases from missing data is to collect complete 
data,[ADDRESS_779640] and will continue to engage our 
patient partners to help us unde rstand the clinical trial experience from the patient perspective and 
decrease the barriers to recruitment/retention by [CONTACT_591417]. Next, we will ask those who would potentially withdraw from intervention to continue to 
provide data and reimburse them for completing the evaluation. Lastly, for those who voluntarily 
withdraw from the study, we will record their reasons for withdrawing and use this information in the 
sensitivity analyses. Because missing data is inevitable in a prospective study like this, our second 
line of defense is to apply data analysis strategies that are as robust as possible to data losses. No

universal method exists for handlin g missing data in clinical trials. 76 We will perform sensitivity 
analyses to evaluate the robustness of our results. Initially, we will perform compete-case analysis 
(participants with missing data are simply excluded from the analysis). We will then apply single 
imputation methods such as last-observation and baseline carry forward analyses. Lastly, we will 
perform multiple imputation analyses. When estimating models by [CONTACT_54683] , inferences 
retain their validity under the assumption of missing at rando m (MAR), which asserts that the 
probabil ity an observation is missing, given all the observed data items, does not depen d on the 
value of the potentially missing data item. This is a weaker assumption than missing completely at 
rando m (MCAR), which is the broade st general sufficient condition for validity of inferences in 
frequen tist analysis methods. While it is gene rally impossible to test whether MAR is a valid 
assumption, one can readily assess the sensitivity of maximum likelihood estimates to depa rtures 
from MAR using the Index of Sensitivity to Nonignorability (ISNI), a class of methods develope d by

enhan ce the unde rstanding/interpretation of our data. Patient partners will be engag ed as we 
present our primary and seconda ry analyses to ensure our interpretation of data remains patient- 
centered. 
 
Secondary Aim: Heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE): We will condu ct HTE analyses to 
identify patient-level demographic characteristics (e.g. sex 81 ), clinical factors (e.g. pain, 82   time 
since diagno sis, time since cancer therapy completion), and psychological attributes (e.g. preference 
and expectancy 41 ) that are associated with improved ISI scores at Week [ADDRESS_779643] outcomes for one treatment (e.g. acupuncture), 
but not the other (e.g. CBT- I) are considered prognostic factors. [ADDRESS_779644] modification between baseline characteristics and treatment groups; however, our patient 
partners sugge sted that this may not be as patient centered or as clinically meaning ful as using a 
dichotomous outcome of treatment response. In reviewing the literature 34   and, consulting with 
patient partners, we will define treatment responde rs as those patients with an ISI chang e score 
compared to baseline of >8 points. We will consider participants to be remitted from their insomnia if 
their absolute ISI score is <8. We intend to approach the evaluation of HTE based on existing 
literature and patient/clinician input as well as important knowledge gained from the qualitative study. 
Our current focus of evaluating and reporting HTE will be based on the approach proposed by [CONTACT_591419].[ADDRESS_779645] of the sub-group analyses will 
be exploratory and these will include socio-demographic (e.g.  age, race/ethnicity, education, and 
marital/partner status), clinical (time since diagno sis, time since cancer therapy completion, 
insomnia severity, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep apnea symptoms), and psychologi cal 
(insomnia belie fs, hyperarousal) factors. 
 
We will carefully examine the data descriptively stratified by [CONTACT_26423]-groups using tables and appropriate 
graphs. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of treatment response. We will initially 
examine the main effect of key patient characteristics associated with the dependen t outcome. Then 
we will test whether specific characteristics will interact with treatment groups (acupun cture vs. CBT)

Approval date: [ADDRESS_779646] done preliminary analyses, we 
will bring in patient partners for a data analyses and interpretation meetings to maximally incorporate 
their perspective as we interpret the statistical outputs. Subgroup analyses and HTE is an area of 
uncertainty in clinical research 85,86 without clear guidel ines. 87 However, by [CONTACT_094]-specifying primary 
subgroup analyses and using multivariate regression modelin g with interaction terms, we w ill 
minimize the possibility of false positive results. 84,88,89  As we publish our results, we will caution 
reade rs/patients that these are exploratory and require caution in interpretation. With that 
acknowledged , the HTE is probab ly the most patient-centered given that patient will have a more 
nuan ced perspective whether for his/her type of person, one treatment will be more effective than 
the other. As we condu ct this research, we will learn together with our patient-partners to develop 
more matured methodologie s to guide future patient-centered outcomes comparative effectiveness 
research. 
 
Sample Size Considerations: Our sample size is based on our primary hypothesis and primary 
outcome of Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Since the ISI is a continuou s outcome, we powered our 
trial using independ ent t-test for score at the end of Week 8. This is a conservative way to estimate 
sample size since the longi tudinal analysis using the mixed-effects model specified in the analysis 
plan will provide highe r power than a t-test. Based on our preliminary research with CBT-I in cancer, 
ISI score decreased from baseline 17.[ADDRESS_779647] difference between acupun cture and CBT-I is 1.85 (0.5 
SD of observed ISI in CBT-I group), this will provide a Cohen‟s d of 0.5 (moderate effect size). We 
estimated that the difference between the two treatments would be half of the effect observed for 
CBT-I alone which would provide adeq uate strength to detect a difference between the two groups. 
Sample size was not based on what has been considered a clinically meaningful chang e within 
groups (e.g. and 8 point reduction).  With power of 0.[ADDRESS_779648] size of 0.5. Accounting for a 20% 
potential attrition, we will need to enroll [ADDRESS_779649] would be 
required to influence patients‟ pre-treatment preference of acupun cture or CBT-I. If acupun cture is 
only slightly better than CBT-I with very small effect size, it is unlikely a patient would choose 
acupun cture over CBT-I even knowing that acupun cture will produce a small bene fit if a patient‟s 
prior preference is CBT-I. With that stated, our research might miss detecting small effects between 
acupun cture and CBT-I. For our seconda ry aim, since the sample size is fixed, the effect size of sub- 
group analyses will be determined by [CONTACT_591420]. 
Before approaching sub-group analyses, we will perform effect size estimations. These analyses will 
be condu cted in conjun ction with the stratified qualitative data interpretation to explore important 
sub-group differences that can guide future research, clinical innovation, and personalized care.

15.2  Randomization 
 
 
Rando mization for the full sample size (n=160) was already prepared by [CONTACT_591421] a rando mization list for 200 treatment assignments if necessary.  MSKCC 
participants will be taking the 40 randomization slots (121-160) and will be allocated as per those 40 
slots (20 acupun cture slots and 20 CBT-I slots are identified in these rando mizations).  Patients will 
be blinded to randomization until completion of baseline questionnaires. 
 
16.[ADDRESS_779651] complian ce, data collection, 
abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory and quality control monitoring, problem 
identification and prioritization. Coordination of study team activities will be the responsibility 
of our Research Supervisor and/or Research Manage r. 
 
All data and forms gathered for this study will be collected and stored in a secure location in 
the facilities of the Integrative Medicine Service. The data collected for this study will be 
entered into a secure database (CRDB), a study Excel database and into  study Access 
Databases. Source documentation will be available to suppo rt the computerized patient data. 
The confidentiality of patient information will be carefully protected. Following data entry by 
[CONTACT_591422], data will be maintained in a secure location in 
the Integrative Medicine offices. 
 
The questionnai res that patients fill out for this protocol will not be IRB stamped 
documents.  The questionnai res will not be chang ed from their IRB stamped counterparts, 
but in order to use these questionnaires, we need to have them in Microsoft Word 
format.  The software (AutoData Scannabl e Office) we will use takes these Microsoft Word 
documents, and prints them with a patient specific barcode at the bottom.  After the patient 
fills it out, the original questionnai re can be scanne d into this software, and the software 
reads and records the patients answers in a Microsoft Access database, where the data will 
ultimately be stored.

16.1  Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly registration reports will be gene rated to monitor patient accruals and completeness of 
registration data. Routine data quality reports will be gene rated to assess missing data and 
inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be brought to the 
attention of the study team for discussion and action. Rando m -sample data quality and protocol 
complian ce audits will be condu cted by [CONTACT_3476], at a minimum of two times per year, more 
frequen tly if indicated. 
 
 
16.2  Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Slo an-Kettering Cancer Center were 
approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001 . The plans address the new policies 
set forth by [CONTACT_30590] "Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and 
Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials" which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSK were established 
and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSK Data and Safety Monitoring Plans 
can be found on the MSK Intranet at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.orglirb/index.htm 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety and 
quali ty. There are institutional processes in place for quality assuranc e (e.g., protocol monitoring, 
complian ce and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on clinical 
research QA) and depa rtmental procedures for quality control, plus there are two institutional 
committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs. The 
committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center's 
Research Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its level of 
risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, in-house 
sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI coope rative group, etc.) will be addressed and the monitoring 
procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation. 
 
In addition to MSK‟s DSM, this study also has an independen t Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) which was required by [CONTACT_591423]. This DSM will monitor the Penn site.  In 
order to assess possible change s in risk/bene fit ratio to study subjects and to obtain indep enden t 
oversight of the study condu ct (including review of the consent form , protocol, subject requirement 
and retention, AE reporting, SAE reporting, procedures for handling patients who have symptom 
worsening ), external safety monitors will be invited to oversee the progress of the study: (1) Roger 
Cohen , MD, Professor of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, 
Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, (2) Tavis Campbell, PhD, Professor of 
Psycholog y, Department of Psycholog y, University of Calgary, and, (3) Sarah Ratcliffe, PhD,

of Pennsylvania. These DSMB members will review and monitor the study procedures, study risks, 
risk/bene fit ratio, patient enrollment, and any study-related SAEs. All SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_591424], or 
whether there is a chang e in the risk / benefit ratio for study subjects. External DSMB oversight and 
study review will be condu cted at 6-month intervals between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_591383] r teleconferencing and e-mail corresponden ce. It is expected that the DSMB 
experts will be available to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_591384] , change s 
in research design, and for other regulatory and clinical questions. 
 
 
 
17.[ADDRESS_779654] Risks (See Section 11.0 Toxicity/Side Effects): 
 
Although the risks associated with participation in the proposed study are minimal, all potential risks 
that might occur as a result of participation will be detailed in an informed consent form, and will also 
be fully discussed with each subject prior to enrollment. We will also explain to each subject that in 
the unlikely event of physical injury directly resulting from the research procedures, every effort will 
be made to make available the facilities and professional skills of MSK. It will be further explained 
that while some risks are not predictable, every precaution consistent with the best medical practice 
to protect the health and safety of subjects will be taken. We will document all adverse events and 
report any serious adverse event promptly to IRB and DSMB. 
 
Risk of Acupun cture and CBT-I: The risks associated with acupun cture and CBT-I are minor, and 
there are very few serious side effects. The most common side effects of acupun cture are mild pain 
on insertion of the needle, occurring at rates twice that of the placebo group. There is a pos sibility of 
a small amount of bleedin g or bruising and very rarely infections at the site of insertion. Every effort 
will be made to ensure the safety and comfort of the research subjects, including wipi[INVESTIGATOR_591385]. The most 
common side effects of CBT-I are short-term (less than 2 weeks) increases in daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_591380]. The acupun cture and CBT-I will be delivered by [CONTACT_591425]. Every effort will be made to ensure the safety and comfort of the research subjects. 
Adverse events will be recorded during each clinical visit. Any related SAEs will be reported to the 
IRB. 
 
Confidentiality Risks: Every effort will be made to maintain confidentiality of the study subjects. 
Research and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333494]. Subject's names or any other personally identifying 
information will not be used in reports or publi cations resulting from this study. Authorized agencies 
(e.g., qualified monitors from PCORI etc.), and appropriate personnel may review subject's records 
as required. All forms are kept in a locked file cabine t when not in use. Clinical data will be kept in a 
centralized database with restricted access to study personnel. Data will be entered into MSK's 
clinical research database (CRDB), a study excel file, and study Access Databases on a secure 
MSK shared drive. Individual identifying information will be omitted from figures used in publications 
resulting from this research.

Risk of psychologi cal distress: It is possible that subjects may be upset to find out that they are 
rando mized to their non-preferred arm of the study. With appropriate consent and the debriefing 
process, such risks are minimized. Subjects will be informed that they are participating in an 
experimental study to determine the comparative effectiveness of acupun cture or CBT for insomnia. 
They have the chance to be randomized to either intervention. At the end of the study subjects will 
be offered the oppo rtunity to discuss the finding s with the PI. In addition, some of the questions in 
the questionnaire may elicit distress among subjects. At the baseline examination, patients will be 
screened for any elevated anxiety and depression or suicidal ideation/plan. If the subject 
demonstrates clinically significant distress, she/he will be referred to the psychosocial counseling . 
During the study period, if the research staff identifies any patients who are psychologi cally 
distressed they will notify the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_591386]. 
 
Costs: Study related procedures and visits will be provided to the subjects at no cost. To encourage 
adhe rence to the study procedures, we will provide $[ADDRESS_779656] evaluation time 
points with an additional $40 for completion of the final assessment (total of $100 per participant). 
Compensation will be in the form of gift cards. 
 
Potential Benefits: 
 
 
Subjects who receive acupun cture or CBT-I may experience an improvement in their insomnia 
and/or other cancer-related co-morbidities (e.g. pain, fatigue, mood disturbance). Improving 
insomnia and other problematic symptoms often leads to an improvement in overall physical and 
emotional well-being. 
 
Alternatives to Participation: 
 
 
If patients do not enroll in this study, they may contact [CONTACT_591426]. 
 
Risk/Benefit Ratio: 
 
 
The potential benefits of this study far outweigh the potential risks. Insomnia is a common and 
debili tating symptom that is experienced by [CONTACT_164473] . The results of the proposed 
study will have an immediate impact to help cancer survivors and their caregivers make informed 
and evidence-based decisions abou t how to most effectively address cancer-related insomnia 
and co-occurring symptoms. Thus, this study has the potential to improve symptom burden and 
wellbein g for millions of individuals whose life is impacted by [CONTACT_67380]. This research also has the 
potential to generalize to other chronic conditions and the population at large. We will carefully 
monitor any adverse events related to acupuncture and CBT-I, and minimize the risks for 
research subjects.

treatment must be reported. 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR-408 „Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events‟, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5 calenda r days of the event. 
SAE‟s classified as unrelated to the study intervention (per section 11.0) will not be 
considered reportable to the IRB and will not have a correspondin g Clinical Research 
Database (CRDB) SAE report gene rated.  The IRB requires a Clinical Research Database 
(CRDB) SAE report be submitted electronically to the SAE Office as follows:

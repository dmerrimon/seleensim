1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Stud y Title  
Feasibility and Safety Study: Bariatric Embolization for Suppression of Ghrelin Level to Induce 
Weight  Loss  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1248697]  
Atlanta, Georgia [ZIP_CODE]  
 
1.3 Background  / Clinical Rationale  
1.3.1  Stomach is an Endocrine Organ  
Although there are over 40 hormones that limit food intake, there is only one hormone, ghrelin  
that has been shown to be orexigenic, i.e., to stimulate food intake. Discovered by [CONTACT_891821]. 
al. in the rat stomach, it was shown to induce growth hormone release by [CONTACT_891822] (GHS -R) in the hypothalamus or anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] (1). Since 
the identification of this neuropeptide, extensive data in both animals and humans have shown 
its potent orexigenic effects (2). Mechanisms to antagonize or suppress the effects of ghrelin 
on the central nervous system have resulted in dramatic weight loss and change in appetite 
in various studies (2, 3). In studies performed on volunteers, intravenous ghrelin stimulates 
meal initiation, with nearly ha lf of all volunteers describing a sensation of hunger with a 
compensatory increase of 28% in caloric intake (4) . Further evaluation has shown that, in 
humans, there is a consistent pattern associated with ghrelin levels, which rise shortly before, 
and fall immediately after, every meal. In situations such as weight loss, there is a  
compensatory increase in ghrelin levels which may contribute to the difficulty in maintaining 
body weight (5). In obese patients, foods fail to suppress systemic ghrelin levels, which could  
impair postprandial satiety and may initiate overeating. Due to the potent orexigenic effect of 
ghrelin, this hormone has been a target for the treatment of obesity and weight loss. Although 
various reports of ghrelin suppression have been described,  none  are clinically practical  
 
1.3.2  Anatomy of the Gastric Fundus  
The stomach is classically separated into seven major sections: cardia; fundus; antrum; 
pylorus; lesser curvature; greater curvature; a nd the angularis ( Figure 1A ). While each 
section of the stomach has a unique role in the digestive process, the fundus serves as the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_891801]  (6-9). Since ghrelin is expressed mainly in the fundus, it contains [ADDRESS_1248698] source, and has a higher 
GHS receptor activation than the hypothalamus (10, 11) . Notably, the vascular supply to the 
gastric fundus is distinct, identifiable, and can be accessed with a catheter from a 
percutaneous approach. The dominant flow to the fundus arises from the left gastric artery, 
which is the first branch off the celiac axis  (Figure 1B ).  
 
In fact, transcatheter gastric arterial embolization has been performed for at least three 
decades and has been shown to be effective at controlling acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Embolization works by [CONTACT_891823]. In addition, the GI tract has a  rich, 
collateral blood supply, with extensive vascular arcades that allow for safe embolization 
without ischemia.  Thus, bariatric  arterial embolization (BAE) is already a clinically viable 
procedure and is currently the standard of ca re in patients whose condition is refractory to 
endoscopic control of gastrointestinal bleeding.   
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_1248699] of weight loss 
in bariatri c surgery. Since bariatric surgery isolates the gastric fundus from ingested nutrients, 
ghrelin profiles are shown to be lower by 77% compared to controls (6, 12-14). Furthermore, 
the normal diurnal pattern is interrupted and the meal -initiated  fluctuations are blunted (6, 12) 
. Based on all these findings, achieving low systemic ghrelin levels should become a strategy 
to control obesity and maintain weight loss.   
 
1.4 Study Synopsis  
This is an Investigator -sponsored clinical investigation.  The purpose of this IDE study is to  
evaluate the safety and feasibility of bariatric embolization as  a new minimally -invasive image -
guided therapy for morbid obesity in which specific blood vessel s to the stomach are blocked 
in order to suppress the body's signals for feeling hungry, leading to weight loss.  
In this submission, we propose the investigational use of a legally -marketed device for a new 
intended use: the clinical use of calibrated mic rospheres for bariatric embolization.   Thus, this 
study would be considered physiologic research of the impact of bariatric embolization on the 
systemic hormonal levels of obesity and its impact on weight gain.   
This study will recruit [ADDRESS_1248700], that transvas cular bariatric 
embolization results in safe and effective weight loss in morbidly obese patients.  The duration 
of the study (time to enrollment of last patient + follow -up period) will be approximately two 
years .

2.[ADDRESS_1248703] link 
between the gastric arteries and systemic levels of 
ghrelin has been demonstrated. (15, 16) Using a 
chemical sclerosing agent, sodium morrhuate, to 
selectively ablate the gastric fundus from a 
transarterial appro ach, ghrelin suppression was 
achieved, probably in part due to the deep 
penetration of liquid embolic agents. In our initial 
studies, Bariatric arterial embolization  (BAE) was 
performed in five swine by [CONTACT_891824] (125 mcg), a chemical 
sclerosing agent, into the gastric arteries that 
supply the fundus (15, 16).  Five controls 
underwent a sham  saline procedure.  
 
The pattern of the change in ghrelin levels over 
time was significantly different between control 
and treated animals (p<0.004, Fig 2). In treated 
animals, ghrelin levels were significantly reduced at weeks 1 -4 relative to baseline (ra nge 
12.9-42.5% decrease). Control swine continued to gain weight (a 15.1% increase from their 
original weight), whereas BAE -treated swine weights only increased 7.8%. Importantly, non-
target embolization ( NTE) was seen frequently in hepatic, splenic, and e sophageal arteries in 
almost all animals.  Since these agents are very toxic, extensive tissue necrosis occurred and,  
thus, this agent is not a clinically viable option.    
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1248704] weight gain. In twelve healthy growing 
swine, BAE was performed by [CONTACT_891825] 40µm -calibrated microspheres  
(Celonova Biosciences, San A ntonio, [LOCATION_007])  into the gastric arteries that supply the fundus 
(n=6), while six control pi[INVESTIGATOR_519728] a sham saline injection .  All animals underwent 
endoscopy at three weeks to assess for ulceration or stricture. As anticipated, the average 
weekly chang e in ghrelin levels was reduced between BAE -treated and control animals and 
reached statistical significance at weeks 1 -6 and week 8 (Fig 3), with average post -procedure 
ghrelin values significantly reduced from baseline for treated animals compared to con trol 
animals ( -537.9 pg/dl ± 209.6 vs. 328.9 pg/dl ± 129.0, P = 0.004). In addition, the average 
change in weight was significantly reduced between BAE -treated and control animals and 
reached statistical significance at week 1 and weeks 3 -8 (Fig 4). Despit e the fact that 
microsphere BAE significantly decreased weight in treated pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], ulcers were visualized on 
endoscopy and histopathology in treatment animals, i.e., 33% of animals at three weeks. 
Furthermore, almost all ulceration appeared in the stomach ant rum, rather than in t he gastric 
fundus.

Tissue sections in control 
animals and treatment animals after 
bariatric embolization are shown 
in Figures 5 and 6. After sacrifice at 
eight weeks, immunohistochemical 
detection of ghrelin (mouse 
antighrelin IgG in a ratio of 1:4000, 
MAB10404, Millipore, Billerica, MA) was determined as the number of positive cells/400X 
high power field.  Ghrelin -immunoreactive cell density was significan tly lower in the gastric 
fundus in the treated animals vs. controls (15.3 vs. 22, p=0.001, Fig 5). Yet, ghrelin -
immunoreactive cell density in the duodenum was similar in treated and  control animals 
(8.5 vs. 8.6, p=NS).

All treated animals demonstrated minimal changes in the gastric fundus . This confirms 
that embolization was of adequate extent to induce ischemia, which can be challenging in 
an organ with an extensive collateral arterial supply. However, on gross patholog ic and 
histopathologic evaluation of the treatment animals, evidence of healing mucosal ulcers 
was identified in two treated animals, with a healed ulcer identified in one animal. While 
mucosal ulceration is an unwanted effect, the excellent healing respon se indicates that 
the particle embolization -induced ulcers may be mild and transient without significant long -
term sequelae.  
 
3.1.4  Limitations of Prior Studies  
On three -week endoscopy, ulcers were seen in 2/ 5 (40%) of our treatment animals. On 
histopathologic analysis of the gastric mucosa after necropsy, ulcers were seen in 2/6 
(33%) treatment animals .  Almost all  ulcers have been due to non -target embolization 
since they were seen along the greater curvature and stomach antrum, rather than the 
gastric fundus,  which was embolized.  
 
Interestingly, while all treated animals demonstrated minimal to mild ischemia in the 
gastric fundus, there was no evidence of mucosal ulceration of the gastric fundus in any 
B A 
B A 
treatment animal. This lack of ulceration is most likely due to the rich collateral vascular 
supply to the fundus from multiple sources. Considering that all observed ulcers occurred 
in the lesser curvature and stomach body, this pattern suggests that the injury was related 
to excessive non -target delivery of em bolic material at these locations or could represent 
ischemic changes from being a “watershed” territory. Histologically, the infused particles 
were observed throughout the fundus, body, and antrum of the analyzed stomachs, but in 
highest concentration at the gastric fundus. This suggests that the gastric body may be 
more sensitive to ischemia than the gastric fundus, which, in addition to the fact that the 
fundus contains the highest density of ghrelin -expressing cells, further affirms that the 
fundus is t he ideal target for bariatric embolization. (17, 18) Further ref inement and 
understanding of the vascular anatomy to the stomach and a more directed delivery of 
embolic material to the gastric fundus may reduce the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_891802]. Considering the critical importance of proton pump inhibitors in the 
management of gastric and duodenal ulcers, with which ischemia has been implicated as 
a contributor to pathophysiology, acid reduction may play a role for minimization of ulcer 
development with bariatric embolization  
 
3.1.5  Summary of Anim al Studies  
Thus, b ariatric  arterial e mbolization significantly suppresses systemic levels of the 
appetite hormone, ghrelin, and affects weight gain without a compensatory up regulation 
of ghrelin -expressing cells in the duodenum.  In summary, our studies i ndicate that the 
gastric fundus can be embolized using minimally invasive endovascular techniques, and 
results in both a local and a systemic reduction in ghrelin levels with concomitant decrease 
in weight gain in healthy juvenile swine.  Superficial ulcer ations were seen in a 33% of 
treated animals but none of these animals were prospectively treated for ulcer prophylaxis.   
 
3.2 Clinical Studies  
 
3.2.1  Bariatric Embolization of Arteries for the Treatment of Obesity :  30 Day 
Results from the Initial IDE Study  
 
This study was a prospective single arm study to evaluate the feasibility, safety and toxicity 
of bariatric embolization in five obese patients. The primary endpoint of this study is weight 
loss (percentage of excess weight loss [%EWL]) and 30 -day Adverse Event s.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Enpoint (%EWL and Major Adverse Events)  
To date,  five patients with a mean BMI of 43.8 underwent bariatic embolization at 
a single institution.  All patients tolerated the procedure well and the major adverse 
event rate at 30 days was 0%.  At 30 days, the %EWL was 7.6 % (+/ - 3.5).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Endpoints:   
At endoscopy, no major gastric ulceration was seen;  one patient  had a small 
minor superficial healing ulcer at the fundus.  Blanching of the fundus was seen in 40%  
(2/5 patients). Nausea/v omiting rate was 60% (3/5 patients). Gastric emptying study 
was normal  at baseline and 4 weeks in all patients.    Eating and hunger/satiety 
assessments showed a significant  decrease in hunger scores. A summary of the

[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk Benefit Analysis  
In our initial IDE application, we idenfiied three major areas of risk for bariatric 
embolization:  Gastric Ulcers, Increased Radiation Dose in Obese Patients 
and Non Target Vascular Embolization (NTE)  
 
Gastric Ulcers : In order to mitigate the risks for ga stric ulcers, gastroprotective 
agents were utilized in all patients.  In addition, all patients were heavily screened 
which  seemed to adequately identify all patients that would be at higher risk for 
gastric ulcerations.  Therefore, no major changes will b e needed for the protocol.  
 
Radiation Dose :  With radiation dose, the mean dose in this initial study was 
5042.6 (+/ - 996) mGy.  There were no associated skin injuries in any patients at 
followup clinic visits.  However, since this study incoroporates cone  beam CT to 
minimize the risk of NTE,  this has caused the radiation dose to be slightly 
higher.  We continue to work with imaging vendors to modify fluoroscopic time  
and using software algoriths to reduce radiation exposure.  Furthermore, we 
anticipate t hat with added technical experience, we anticipate reductions of 
fluoroscopic times for these procedures.  
 
 
NTE:    Due to the proximity of the dorsal pancreatic artery to the left gastric and 
the pancreatico -duodenal arcade to the gastro epi[INVESTIGATOR_735599], we feel that the risk of  

pancreatitis is still one  of our biggest concerns .   In our trial, 3/5 patients 
developed significant nausea/vomiting which may be attributable to reflux.  To 
minimize  such  reflux and NTE, we now routinely dilute the spheres in a larger 
volume of saline to pre vent proximal clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_891803]. Also, the 
use of 3D CTA prior to the procedure and conebeam CT  was used in all five 
patients to further understand the vascular anatomy.  However due to technical / 
anatomical challenges , an anti -reflux system was used in only one vessel.  
Moving forward,  the use of anti -reflux systems may still be employed  to mitigate 
NTE to the pancreas.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Intial [ADDRESS_1248706] in Man 2013, J Am Coll 
Cardiol. 2013;61(10_S):. doi:10.1016/S0735 -1097(13)[ZIP_CODE] -2: San Francisco.  
 
Background:   Here we provide our preliminary results of the First -In- Man study of Left 
Gastric Artery Embolization (GAE) safety and efficacy in humans.  
 
Methods:  5 patients with different degrees of obesity underwent GAE with BeadBlock 
Embolic Bead 300 -500μm microspheres (Biocompatibles [LOCATION_006] Limited, Chapman House, 
Farnham Business Park, Weydon Lane Farnham, Surrey, GU9 8QL, [LOCATION_006]). 
Esophagogastroscopy was performed in all patients before and after GAE and at 1 week 
follow up to rule out significant initial gastritis or ulcer and any worsening after the 
procedure. Blood Ghrelin level was also measured before the procedure as  well as at 1, 
2, 3 and 4 weeks follow up. Observations on Ghrelin levels and patients weight is planned 
at 3, 6 and 12 month follow up.  
 
Results:  There was no case of periprocedural complications. [ADDRESS_1248707] week after  procedure, Weight loss was observed in all patients at 1 
month follow up: mean initial  weight - 128.12+/ - 24.4kg was decreased to 114.8+/ - 21.3kg 
and mean initial Body Mass Index (BMI) - 42.2 +/ - 6.8 was decreased to 37.8+/ - 5.7. 6 
moth follow -up results of GAE will be available at time of presentation.  
 
Conclusions : Short term follow up ha s shown that GAE is safe and feasible. Further 
studies enrolling larger number of patients are planned to confirm these initial findings.  
 
3.2.2  Retrospective Analysis of Left Gastric Embolization in Patients (Scientific 
Sessions  RSNA Nov 2013)

of Weight Loss Following Left Gastric Artery Embolization in Humans  2013, 
Radiological Society of North America. November 2013; Chicago  San Francisco.  
 
PURPOSE  
Suppressing serum l evels of ghrelin, a neuropeptide with powerful appetite -stimulating 
effects produced in the gastric fundus, is an  intriguing potential means of controlling body 
weight. Since left gastric artery, which preferentially supplies the gastric fundus, is  
sometim es embolized in interventional radiology procedures, we assessed post -
procedural weight loss in patients after left gastric artery  embolization.  
 
METHOD AND MATERIALS  
Retrospective analysis of electronic medical records of patients who underwent left gastric 
artery embolization for upper gastrointestinal  (GI) bleeding were compared to age -
matched controls of similar patients that had undergone embolization of an artery other 
than left  gastric artery for upper GI bleeding. Patients were included in the analy si if they 
had a recorded weight within two weeks prior to the  embolization and within three months 
after the procedure. Differences in post -procedural weight loss between the groups were 
evaluated  by a student's t test.  
 
RESULTS  
Fifteen patients (mea n age: 66.1 years) were included in the experimental group analysis 
while eighteen patients (mean age: 63.5 years)  were included in the control group 
analysis. The mean pre - and post -procedural weights in the experimental group were 
189.1 lbs and  174.5 lbs , respectively, representing a 7.9% decrease in body weight. The 
mean pre - and post -procedural weights in the control group  were 164.7 lbs and 162.8 lbs, 
respectively, representing a 1.2% decrease in body weight. The post -procedural weight 
loss of the  nexperimental group was significantly greater than that observed in the control 
group (P=0.001).  
 
CONCLUSION  
Patients lose significantly more weight after left gastric artery embolization than following 
embolization of other arteries for upper GI  bleeding. The  current data suggests that body 
weight can be potentially modulated via left gastric artery embolization in humans.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Purpose  
In this submission, we propose the investigational use of a legally marketed device for a new 
intended use: the clinical use of the Embosphere  Microspheres  (Merit Medical, Jordan UT) for 
bariatric embolization.   Thus, this study would be considered physiologic research of the 
impact of bariatric embolization on the systemic hormonal levels of obesity and its impact on 
weight gain.   
This study is a prospect ive single arm study to evaluate the feasibility, safety  and toxicity of 
bariatric embolization in [ADDRESS_1248709], that transvasc ular bariatric 
embolization results in safe and effective weight loss in morbidly obese patients.  The duration 
of the study (time to enrollment of last patient + followup period) will be approximately two 
years.  
Study Objectives and Endpoints  
This study w ill evaluate the feasibility, safety and toxicity of bariatric embolization in 20 
morbidly obese patients at  week  2 and 1, 3, 6 and 12  months.  The primary endpoint of this 
study is the weight loss (absolute weight change from baseline and the percentage of excess 
weight loss [%EWL]) and  [ADDRESS_1248710] already been 
enrolled.  
Patients will be followe d for a period of twelve months and study outcomes will be made by

Screening for Previously Undiagnosed Diabetes  
 
Recruited patients that satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo a 
preprocedural workup, including a detailed history, physical exam, laboratory studies 
(including a glucose tolerance test to evaluate for diabetes or pre -diabetes, and H. 
Pylori serum antibody test)  
 
 
4.2.3  Pre-Treatment  Evaluations and Data Collection  
Recruited patients that satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo the following 
pre-treatme nt evaluations:  
 Detailed medical history  by [CONTACT_891829]  
 Physical exam  by [CONTACT_891829]  
 Laboratory studies (including a glucose tolerance test, and H. Pylori serum antibody 
test).  These will be performed prior to CTA or endoscopy. ) 
 Hormone testing using a Meal Tolerance Test   
o The meal tolerance test is administered in order to examine the influence of the 
gut hormones on glucose tolerance.   After the placement of a standard IV 
catheter and the collection of baseline samples, the subjects are  asked to drink 
Hagen -Daz vanilla ice cream that is put through a blender to get a milkshake 
consistency, 250 cc (in a cup) is given to the participant. They are asked to drink 
it within 15 minutes. Samples are drawn at 5’, 10’, 15’, 20’, 30’, 40’, 60’, 80 ’, 
100’, 120’, 150’, 180’ and stored at -80ºC in order to measure hormones 
secreted by [CONTACT_891830].   At each timepoint the subjects will be asked 
to fill out a simple hunger/satiety scale. Phlebotomy for the meal tolerance test 
will not exceed 78 mL. 
 Upper GI endoscopy  
 CT Angiography  
 Nuclear gastric motility examination.  
 Pregnancy test on the day of or day before procedure.  
 
For the two weeks preceding the procedure, the patients will keep a diet log, and record 
hunger levels, weight, and symptoms.  
 
The results are acceptable for baseline assessment if they were taken within the 30 day 
screening period . The baseline assessments include:  
 
 Medical history and physical examination including height and weight  by [CONTACT_891831] a baseline  and on all followup visits.  
 Hemoccult testing  
 Hematological and biochemical investigations  (performed prior to CTA or endoscopy)  
o Complete blood count (C BC) 
o Liver functions tests (LFTs)  
o Serum albumin  
o Electrolytes, urea, creatinine (EUC)  
o Serum or urine preg nancy tests  
o Fasting chemistries, including glucose and insulin  
 
All patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_891832]:  
 
1. if the patient can tolerate the procedure  
2. there are no absolute contraindications to surgery in the event that surgery 
becomes necessary to address an adverse event.  
3. whether the patient can take omeprazole without causing adverse drug 
interactions or interrupting treatment with their current medications.  
4. All patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_891833].  
 
a. Patients who are rated by [CONTACT_891834] (using standard 
ASA criteria (REF below) as class 4 or 5 (very high risk surgical 
candidates: class 4= incapacitati ng disease that is a constant threat to 
life) at the time of screening for enrollment into the study will be 
excluded from participation.   This exclusion criterion exists because of 
the possibility that surgical intervention will be needed if the study 
intervention subsequently leads to severe adverse effects.   Class 3 
(patient has severe systemic disease that is not incapacitating) or 
lower -risk patients will not be excluded.  
 
5. Screening for major comorbidities that constitute exclusions from 
participation in the study will be performed at the time of study entry by 
[CONTACT_891835]’s past medical history and current symptoms 
and signs by [CONTACT_891836].  Standard diagnostic criteria for diabetes 
(ADA 2014), symptomatic coronary artery o r valvular heart disease, 
diagnosis of active cancer (except non -mealanoma skin cancer), and 
peripheral artery disease will be used.  Referral for further evaluation and 
treatment will be made as needed.

Prior to embolization, patients will have a total of [ADDRESS_1248712] hunger levels, weight, and symptoms.  This series of  4 visits is to be 
considered the pre procedural “run -in.” 
 
All patients will also be assessed by [CONTACT_891837].   Critical Care Nursing staff , as performed with all embolization 
procedures,  will perform  all sedation and monitoring.  ECG and arterial oxygen saturation 
will be  monitored continuously.  Blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_891807] 5 min.  
 
 
 
 
4.2.4  Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medications  
The bariatric embolization procedure will be performed with m oderate sedation using 
intravenous midazolam and fentanyl.   All patients will take a daily oral proton pump 
inhibitor (Omeprazole 40 mg) and a daily oral cytoprotective agent (Sucralfate 4g). 
This regimen is based on clinical management of severe duodenal/gastric ulcers for 
six weeks.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedure  
The subject will be placed supi[INVESTIGATOR_891808].  
 
Vascular access will be achieved  using a  small [ADDRESS_1248713] 
catheter s, the arteries supplying the fundus  arising off the celiac vessel will be 
selected . Then, a microcatheter will be advanced int o the arteries  supplying the fundus  
and small calibrated  spheres  (300-500 micron size) will be infused until stasis of 
anterograde arterial flow is achieved, with particular care to avoid infusion o f nontarget 
arteries. Stasis will be defined as visualizat ion of contrast within the target artery for at  
least 5 cardiac cycles .  If an anti -reflux system (Surefire Infusion System) is used, then 
stasis will be evaluated with the tip collapsed.   
 
Upon completion, the catheters will be removed, and hemostasis wi ll be achieved with 
manual compression.   
 
The p rocedure will be performed with an allowable air kerma limit of  4 Gy (4000 mGy).  
Any patient receiving a greater radiation dose than this will be evaluated for dermal 
injuries during followup, and if necessary undergo additional evaluation and treatment 
by a Dermatologist.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Monitoring  
Real-time monitoring of all patient vital signs will  be performed per standard protocol 
for interventional  radiology procedures during the procedure.

give a 80% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis with a P value <0.05 considered 
statistically signific ant.  Thus, we envision enrolling eventually  20 patients.   
 
4.3.3  Statistical Analysis  – Endpoint Assessments  
The primary endpoint will be [ADDRESS_1248729] to determine whether there 
is a statistically significant decrease in any hormonal parameter .  Hunger scores and 
quality of life  will be similarly compared.  
 
4.3.4  Data Collection  / Case Report Forms  
The investigator s will record all pre -procedu re, procedural, and post -procedure follow -up 
evaluations and observations including complications and/or adverse effects on the Case 
Report Forms provided by [CONTACT_1034].  All forms when completed will be available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_1034]'s represent ative to verify that all necessary information has 
been included and reported accurately.   
The investigator will retain copi[INVESTIGATOR_849518] .  See a ppendix A  
An Access  databas e located on the Johns Hopkins  Radiology Sharepoint site will track 
study data and  patient demographic info rmation . The information will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_891840].  The Sharepoint site  is secured by [CONTACT_891841].   
4.3.5  Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events:  serious  (major complications)  and non -serious  (minor complications) 
and unanticipated adverse events  will be recorded on the CRF  by [CONTACT_891842] s. The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will review and determine if each 
adverse event was related to the study.  Additionally , adverse events will be reported to 
the IRBs and FDA, as required.  
 
An investigator shall submit to the Sponsor  and to the reviewing IRB a report of any 
unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, 
but in no event later than ten working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.  
An investigator shall notif y the Sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] [ADDRESS_1248730] (DSMB)  
The DSMB will be composed of a gastroenterologist, bariatric surgeon , an obesity 
specialist, and an interventional radiologist.   The DSMB will meet on a monthl y basis in 
addition to  any meetings regarding any specific event.  All meetings will be documented 
and any problems regarding the study protocol will be immediately relayed to the IRB  and 
the FDA.  The principal investigators will be responsible for commu nicating all reports and 
events to the IRB.   
 
4.4 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
4.4.1  Gastric Ulceration from Bariatric Embolization:   
To mitigate against gastric ulceration, several technical and clinical approaches will be 
employed.    
 
Technical approach: In all of our  prior animal work, small [ADDRESS_1248731], and therefore, the potential for  ischemic ulceration will be higher.  Currently, arterial 
embolization with 100 -300 micron particles is routinely clinically performed for a number 
of indications (including embolization of the left gastric artery for control of hemorrhage) 
and has not shown to have significant clinical sequelae of tissue necrosis or infarcti on.  In 
fact, all the investigators in this trial have embolized the left gastric artery for 
gastrointestinal hemorrhages with larger particles (100 -300 micron) and have not seen 
any cases of gastric ulceration/perforation.   Limited clinical experience wit h bariatric 
embolization has been performed with larger bead sizes.  Therefore,  based upon the 
limited  clinical experience and our pre -clinical data, bariatric  embolization with 400 micron 
will be performed.   
 
Clinical methods: In addition to these tech nical changes, all patients  will be aggressively 
prescreened for gastric  ulcerations including the use of gastric motility examinations, 
baseline upper endoscopy and baseline CT angiography.   Furthermore,  as shown in our 
exclusion criteria, patients th at are considered higher risk for ulcerations will be excluded:  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
 prior history of gastric pancreatic, hepatic, and/or splenic surgery  
 Prior radiation  to the upper abdomen  
 Prior embolization to the stomach, spleen or liver  
 Portal venous hypertension  
 Prior  history of peptic ulcer disease  
 Significant risk factors for peptic ulcer disease including daily NSAID use and smoking.  
 Active H. p ylori infection  
  
Finally, to further improve the safety profile of this procedure,  gastroprotective agents 
such as oral proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) and Sucralfate  will be utilized . Clinical 
use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) has significantly influenced the management of acid -
peptic disorders dramatically over the last decade. Three of these agents are now widely 
available; omeprazole (available since 1989), lansoprazole (1995), and  pantoprazole 
(1997). These agents selectively and irreversibly inhibit the gastric hydrogen/potassium 
adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ -exchanging ATPase), part of the 'proton pump' that is 
involved in the final acid secretory process. They thereby [CONTACT_891843]. Clinical uses include the treatment of peptic ulcer 
disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, Zollinger -Ellison 
Syndrome, and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori  as part of combination regimens. In 
addition, another typi[INVESTIGATOR_891810]. This agent works by 
[CONTACT_12789] a coating over ulcers, protecting the area from further injury.  
 
Therefore, the use of a both systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3066] P PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a local mucosal agent 
(Carafate) will provide a protective mechanism to the gastric mucosa to minimize gastric 
ulceration. Not only do these agents prevent ulcer formation but also have been shown to 
also improve the healing rates of gastric and duo denal ulcers.  Oral proton pump inhibitor 
(Omeprazole 40 mg) and a daily oral cytop rotective agent (Sucralfate 4g) will be taken  for 
two weeks prior and six weeks after the procedure in order to protect against gastric ulcers.  
 
 
4.4.2  Increased Radiation Dose in Obese Patients  
 Based upon the pre -IDE discussions,   the procedure will be limited to a cumulative air 
kerma to 4 Gy (4000 mGy). This proposed limit is below the trigger point recommended 
for followup  of patients for skin injuries recommended by [CONTACT_891844]. 168 (5 Gy), 
and  well above the mean dose of 2367 mGy for  treatment of gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
with interventional radiology techniques reported in a multicenter study (35).  Furthermore, 
we are currently in discussion with imaging vendors to provide the latest imaging software 
algorithms that provide ultra low dose imaging during angiography.  Systems with these 
capabilities can reduce radiation  up to 60%.    Examples of such systems include the 
Siemens Artis Q.zen or the Ph ilips Clarity IQ technology product line.  When possible, 
such systems will be utilized.  
 
 
4.4.3  Non target vascular embolization  
Because of the variable vascular supply of the stomach and the shared arterial supply with 
other surrounding vital organs, such as t he diaphragm, esophagus, liver, spleen, and 
pancreas, there is concern for non target embolization (NTE)  due to reflux.    In our 
preclinical animal studies, there was evidence of non -target injury to the body and antrum 
of the stomach due to vascular reflux of embolic spheres .   Because patients who would 
benefit from BAE are generally healthy aside from their obesity, NTE (from either poor 
targeting or reflux) is unacceptable.  To mitigate this NTE three specific technical methods 
will be implemented:  
  
a) 3D CT Angiography: Prior to the procedure all patient will undergo a 3D CT 
angiography to not only identify patients with aberrant vascular anatomy but also to 
assess the vasculature to the gastric fundus, antrum and associated adjacent organs 
such as the pa ncreas, liver and spleen.   
 
b) Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT):   Utilization of  CBCT provides near real 
time  three -dimensional (3D) maps of the gastric and adjacent organ arterial supply 
and CT -like soft tissue contrast, to enable precise targeting to the gastric fundus and 
avoid NTE of nearby [CONTACT_346038].   
 
c) Anti-reflux infusion microcatheters:  Finally, if feasible, the use of an anti -reflux 
microcatheter (Surefire Medical, Westminister, CO) will be utilized to perform all 
embolizations to eliminate NTE and provide precise targeting of the gastric fundus.

2. Why is this research being done?  
 
The purpose of this study is  evaluate the safety and feasibility of bariatric embolization 
as a new minimally -invasive image -guided therapy for morbid obesity.  In this 
procedure specific blood vessels to the stomach are blocked in order to suppress the 
body's signals for feeling hungry, leading to weight loss.  
Morbid obesity is currently treated with diet and exercise, medications, and with 
surgery. This study is designed to test the first procedure design ed to help treat obesity 
using a minimally invasive, non -surgical, angiographic (through the blood vessel) 
approach.  
Although there are over [ADDRESS_1248744] 
of weight loss in bariatric (obesity) surgery where  ghrelin levels  are shown to be  
much  lower  when  compared to untreated patients.   
 
Recent data c ollected in both animals and in patients in small, short –term studies 
has demonstrated that blocking blood vessels (embolization) to particular portion of 
the stomach can temporarily suppress systemic levels of the appetite inducing 
hormone, ghrelin, leadi ng to a prevention of short -term weight gain in animals. This 
procedure is an adaptation of a commonly performed procedure used to treat 
bleeding within the stomach. This adapted procedure has been named “bariatric 
embolization”.  
The guiding hypothesis of this study is to test that bariatric embolization results in safe 
and effective weight loss  in morbidly obese patients. Bariatric  embolization uses 
devices cleared for  embolization of highly vascular tumors or certain vascular 
malformations, but  their use in the stomach to cause weight loss is investigational . 
You may qualify to take part in this research study if you are morbidly obese and your 
physician has suggested bariatric surgery.  
 
How many people will be in this study?  
Twenty (20 )  people are expected to  participate in this study at both sites.   
 
3. What will happen if you join this study?  
If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things:  
 
Screeni ng and pre -procedure assessment  
 
Prior to being enrolled in the bariatric embolization trial , you will have a 
screening evaluation which will include  the following exams, tests and 
procedures:  
 Detailed medical history  
 Physical exam  
 Laboratory studies (including a glucose tolerance test, and H. Pylori 
serum antibody tes t) 
 Upper GI endoscopy  
 CT Angiography  
 Nuclear medicine gastric motility /emptying examination  
 
 
If you qualify for this trial:  within 30 days of the procedure you will undergo a 
baseline assessment which will include:   
 Medical history and physical examination including height and 
weight  
 Hematological and biochemical investigations  
o Complete blood count (CBC)  
o Liver functions tests (LFTs)  
o Serum albumin  
o Electrolytes, urea, creatinine (EUC)  
o Serum or urine pregnancy tests  
o Fasting chemistries, including gl ucose and insulin , and 
gastric hormones (including Ghrelin)  
 
For the two weeks prior to  the procedure, you will be asked to keep  a diet log, 
and record hunger levels, weight, and symptoms.  
 
It is very important that you tell your doctor about all medicati on you are 
taking before receiving any research intervention(s). This includes 
prescription medication and over the counter medications such as cough and 
cold remedies, pain relievers, and antacids.  Use of illegal drugs during 
participation in this study is strictly forbidden and will result in  you being 
discontinued from the study. Please ask your doctor  if you have any 
questions about anything that you take.  
 
Pre- and Post Procedure Medications:  
You will be asked to take  a daily oral proton pump inhibitor (Omeprazole 40 
mg) and a daily oral cytoprotective agent (Sucralfate 4g).  for two weeks prior 
and six weeks after the procedure in order to protect you against gastric ulcers.  
 
Bariatric Embolization Procedure : 
The baria tric embolization procedure will be performed with moderate sedation 
using intravenous midazolam and fentanyl  . 
 
 This procedure will take about 1 ½ -3 hours.  
 You will be placed on the X -ray fluoroscopy  table.  
 Next you will receive local anesthesia in the skin of your leg, then a different 
small catheter (thin tube) will be placed through the skin of your upper thigh into 
an artery that leads to your abdomen .   
 Contrast (x -ray dye) will be injected through the c atheter so your doctor can see 
all the blood vessels (angiogram) that bring blood to your stomach with an 
imaging machine (called fluoroscopy).   
 Then the catheter will be directed the artery feeding the top of your stomach 
(fundus)  and small particles  will be slowly infused into the artery(ies)  to block off 
blood flow to the fundus .  
 After the particles have been delivered the catheter will be removed from your leg   
and your artery will be closed , and pressure will be applied to the area.  
 
Follow -Up Visits  
You will be asked to  continue recording your diet, hunger levels, weight, 
symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc) and present for follow up 
visits at se t intervals for physical exam and serum blood tests for ghrelin levels 
over a [ADDRESS_1248745] -embolization.   A nuclear medicine gastric 
motility study may be performed at 1 month and at 6 months if the ba seline 
endoscopy is abnormal.   
 
Incidental Findings:  
A qualified person will review the CTA you are having as part of this research 
study  just as it would be if you were having the MRIs  as part of your routine 
medical care.  
 
There is a possibility that while reviewing your CTA we may see an 
abnormality that we did not expect to see in this study. This is what is called 
an “incidental finding.”  
 
We will let you know if we see such an incidental finding.   Depending on the 
type o f incidental finding, we may contact [CONTACT_697543]. In the 
case of a potential serious emergency, someone may go to your home.  
 
A qualified person (usually a member of the research team) will talk to you if 
there is an incidental finding. You do not have an option to decline information 
about an incidental finding.  
 
If you want, we will give information about this incidental finding to your 
primary doctor or we will refer you to an appropriate doctor for further 
evaluation.  
 An incidental finding m ay cause you to feel anxious.    
 Since an incidental finding will be part of your medical record, you 
could face greater difficulty in getting health or life insurance.  
 The costs for any care that will be needed to diagnose or treat an 
incidental finding would not be paid for by [CONTACT_98139].   These 
costs would be your responsibility.

4. What are the risks or di scomforts of the study?  
There ar e certain risks and discomforts that may be associated with this 
research study.    Previous studies have shown the side effects to be:  
 
Bariatric  embolization procedure  
Possible side effects may result from particles lodging into areas outside the targeted 
stomach  area (called non targeted embolization), resulting in blockage of the blood 
vessels to the bowel, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, groin, bladder, pelvis or 
legs. If severe, this might require surgery to correct.   
 
Other possible eve nts include nausea, vomiting, inflammation of the stomach, 
ulceration, or bleeding from the stomach.  Stomach rupture or death from this 
procedure is  also possible.  B leeding from the area in your thigh where the catheter 
goes in, allergic reaction to cont rast agent or microspheres, an effect on fertility,  
damage (perforation) to a blood vessel which could lead to hemorrhage, a temporary 
contraction in a blood vessel (vasospasm), bruise in the groin area (inguinal 
hematoma), or injury from radiation exposu re during imaging.  
 
Blood clots in your veins (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism) or 
death are unlikely but possible.  
 
Angiography  
An angiogram is a procedure in which a catheter (long narrow tube) is guided from a 
blood vessel in the leg (common femoral artery) into the blood vessels of the prostate 
artery to inject contrast (imaging dye) so your doctor can see the blood vessels.     
 
Potential side effects include groin soreness and bruise formation, damage to or 
spasms (contractions) in the blood vessels as a result of guidewire and catheter 
manipulation that results in failure to treat the prostate, formation of a blood clot 
result ing in blockage of a blood vessel, infection,  allergy to contrast agent or injury 
from radiation exposure during imaging.  
 
Radiation Exposure:  
This research study includes exposure to radiation from x -rays or gamma -rays (CT 
scan, gastric -emptying study, Bariatric Embolization) . This radiation exposure is for 
research purposes only and is not part of your medical care. X -rays and gamma rays 
can damage the genetic material (DNA) in cells. At low doses, cells usually can repair 
this damage. There is some pos sibility that an incorrect repair may increase the risk of 
cancer in your lifetime. The normal lifetime risk of cancer is 25%. A radiation dose of 
15 rems (a rem is a unit of radiation dose) would increase your lifetime risk to 25.6%.  
Additionally should y ou become pregnant prior to any of these three studies there 
would be unforeseen risks to you and/ or your embryo . 
 
The radiation exposure that you will get in this research study is  approximately 6500 
mrem. To put that in context, the average person in the  [LOCATION_002] gets a radiation 
exposure of 0.3 rem per year from natural sources, like the sun, outer space, air, food 
and soil. People who work with radiation (for example, x -ray technologists) are 
allowed a maximum exposure of 5.[ADDRESS_1248746] received or will receive from 
other tests outside of this study that are a part of your medical care.  Radiation risk 
builds up with each exposure. You should think about your own history of radiatio n

Endoscopy:  
Upper endoscopy is a very safe procedure . However it carries a very small risk of 
complications. Rare complications include:  
Bleeding. Your risk of bleeding complications after endoscopy is increased if the 
procedure involves removing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_891818] (biopsy) or treating a 
digestiv e system problem. In rare cases, such bleeding may require a blood 
transfusion.  
Infection. Most endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_891819], and risk of 
infection is low. The risk of infection increases when additional procedures are 
performed as par t of your endoscopy. Most infections are minor and can be treated 
with antibiotics. Your doctor may give you preventive antibiotics before your 
procedure if you are at higher risk of infection.  
Tearing of the gastrointestinal tract. A tear in your esophagu s or another part of your 
upper digestive tract may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and sometimes surgery to repair it. 
The risk of this complication is very low — it occurs in an estimated 3 to 5 of every 
10,000 diagnostic upper endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Other risks:  
You may also experience some brief and /or minor discomfort associated with 
the tests required.   
 
You may experience pain or bruising associated with the needle from the 
blood drawing.  Fainting and local infection can also occur when blood is 
drawn, although this is rare.  
 
You may feel pressure when the catheter is inserted into your urethra.

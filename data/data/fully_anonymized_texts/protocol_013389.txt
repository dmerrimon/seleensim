Inclusion Criteria:  
Inclusion  criteria  # 3 has been modified by [CONTACT_2869]  
“native kidney”  – the revised verbiage reads as  follows: 
Incident  dialysis  subjects  receiving dialysis  for ESRD  for 
≥ 2 weeks but  ≤ 4 months at the time of randomization 
Inclusion  criteria  # 6, 7, 8, 9 were modified as  follows  
(added  text is italicized):  
6. Ferritin ≥ 100 ng/mL  (≥ 220pmol/L).  
Subjects  with ferritin  level < 100 ng/mL  
(<220pmol/L)  during screening qualify  after  
receiving  iron supplementation (per local standard 
of care)  without the  need  to retest ferritin  prior  to 
randomization.  
7. Transferrin saturation ≥ 20%.  
Subjects  with a TSAT  level < 20% during screening  
qualify  after  receiving  iron supplementation (per  
local standard  of care),  without the need to retest  
TSAT prior  to randomization.  
8. Serum  folate  level, performed  within 8 weeks prior  
to randomization ≥ lower  limit of normal (LLN).  
Subjects  with a serum  folate  level < LLN during  
screening qualify  after  receiving folate supplement  
(per local standard of  care),  without the need  to 
retest folate prior  to randomization.  
9. Serum  vitamin  B12 level,  performed  within  8 weeks  
prior  to randomization  ≥ LLN.  
Subjects with a  Vitamin  B12 level < LLN at 
screening  qualify  after  receiving  vitamin  B12 
supplement (per  local standard of care),  without  
the need  to retest vitamin B 12 prior to  
randomization.   
To allow  subjects  who restarted dialysis  
recently due to transplanted kidney end-  
stage  renal  disease (see revised  Exclusion  
# 17 below)  
 
Revised TSAT/ferritin/Vit.B12/folate  
criteria:   Subjects  with 
TSAT/ferritin/folate/Vit.B12 levels  below  
the screening values  are eligible,  upon  
receiving  the respective 
supplementations, without the need for  
re-testing during  screening.  This will 
improve  the screening success  rate 
without altering  the patient population  
intended for  inclusion  in this study, and  
will help shorten  the screening period by

13.   Known, untreated proliferative diabetic  
retinopathy, diabetic  macular  edema,  macular  
degeneration, or retinal  vein occlusion.   (Subjects  
who are already  blind  for the above reasons  
qualify  to participate).  
17. Organ  transplant:  subjects  with any of the 
following:  
a) experienced  rejection of transplanted organ 
within  6 months  of transplantation 
b) currently on high doses of immunosuppressive  
therapy  (per discretion of  the Investigator)  
c) scheduled for  organ transplantation.  Note: being  
on a waiting  list for  kidney transplant is not

eligibility criteria  (see also updates  to 
eligibility criteria  related to  TSAT and  
ferritin  levels). This will improve the  
screening success  rate without altering  the 
patient population intended  for inclusion  
in this study, and will help  shorten the 
screening period by [CONTACT_2872] [ADDRESS_2458] baseline  Hb and there are no 
additional safety concerns.  
 
“at the  time of randomization”  has been

Text is  added to  clarify that subjects who  
are already  blind due  to the complications  
of one or more  of these conditions are OK  
to participate  as there is no possibility of 
further worsening.  
 
Revised  to allow otherwise  eligible  
incident  subjects  with prior organ  
transplant to participate  except who  
experienced  transplant rejection within 6  
months  of transplantation or on high 
doses of immunosuppressive therapy (due  
to potential confounding  effects  on safety  
and efficacy assessments)  
 
“Known” was removed  to clarify  
exclusion criterion #19  applies  to only  
active gastrointestinal bleeding.  
 
Potential subjects  with no history of 
alcohol or drug abuse was updated  from  
within 2 years to  within 6 months to  
allow  more  subjects to qualify and does  
not pose any additional safety risk.

Treatment Period (added  text is  italicized, revised  text 
is bolded and italicized):  
 
Treatment duration  is variable for  individual  subjects.  In 
order  to complete  the Treatment Period simultaneously  
for all study subjects,  the minimum  treatment duration  
may be less than [ADDRESS_2460] 4 weeks prior  to their  treatment period end.  In order  to complete  the Phase  3 program  
in a timely  manner  and simultaneously  
for all study subjects,  the minimum  
treatment duration of  subjects enrolled  
after March 2017 (as part  of Amendment

in advance  if such a  decision is  made.  Synopsis , 
Section 3.1 
Procedures for  Handling Incorrectly  Enrolled  
Subjects  
The following section was  added:  
 
Subjects  who fail to meet  all eligibility  criteria  should  
not be enrolled.   If it is discovered  in retrospect that  a 
subject  did not  meet all eligibility  criteria,  the 
Investigator  should  inform  the Medical Monitor  
immediately, and a  discussion  should occur regarding 
whether or not to discontinue  the study  subject.   All 
decisions  from  such a discussion should be  
appropriately documented.  This language was  added to  align  the 
protocol  with a new SOP for  protocol  
templates  Section 3.3  
Excessive Hematopoiesis  
The following section was  added:  
 
For subjects  randomized to  roxadustat,  the following  
scenarios are defined as  “excessive hematopoiesis”;  
• Hb increases by  > 2.0 g/dL at  any time within a 
4 week period: reduce  the dose  by [CONTACT_2873]. 
• Hb reaches or exceeds 13 g/dL: hold dosing,  
check Hb weekly.   Resume dosing when Hb < 
12.0 g/dL  (for US subjects  central lab Hb  value  
preferred),  at a dose that is reduced by [CONTACT_2874].  
For subjects  on prolonged dose  hold with  stable  (not 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  Hb, the Investigator  may use discretion  to 
schedule  less frequent visits.  
 
Anytime  Hb is assessed  via HemoCue®/CritLine®/local  
lab, a central lab Hb  should be  obtained as well.  Instructions have been added to  the body  
of the protocol, specifying when  to reduce  
or hold dosing in case of excessive Hb 
rate of rise,  in order to further emphasize  
these  specific dosing instructions; in  
addition,  these instructions also allow for

The following paragraphs were  added to  clarify:  
Given  the complexity  in  roxadustat  dose adjustments,  
and the need to take  into account the  various  clinical  
parameters  in roxadustat  dose titration, one would not  
consider  it a protocol deviation  when study  subjects are 
dosed based on their clinical circumstances, whether or  
not it is concordant with  the roxadustat  dose adjustment  
guidelines unless  it was  related  to “excessive 
hematopoiesis”   (eg, Hb ≥ 13 g/dL,  requiring a dose 
hold)  or “Overdose”   (prescribed >3.0 mg/kg per dose  
or 400 mg per dose  whichever  is lower)

roxadustat is not allowed or available during that

Given  the complexity  in EPO dose adjustments and the 
need to  take into account the  various  clinical  
parameters  in EPO dose  titration, one  would not 
consider  it a protocol deviation  when study  subjects  are 
dosed according to local standard of care whether or  
not it is concordant with   package insert/SmPC  decision  etc. can influence dose titration  
decisions  at the  time of the visit or after 
the visit. As a result,  the dose prescribed  
may not exactly  match  the dose  per the 
dose adjustment algorithm.  
However,  as the stable dose would be 
achieved  through titration, dosing  
discrepancy  when subjects  are dosed 
based on their clinical status  is not 
considered  a protocol deviation unless it  
is related  to excessive hematopoiesis  
(≥13.0 g/dL, requiring  a dose-hold) or  
overdose (>3.0 mg/kg/dose).  
Roxadustat subjects  may receive  ESA  
while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057],  in part  due to lack of  
access  to roxadustat while  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
and/or as part  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2801]- of-care 
of anemia treatment; therefore,  ESA  
administration in  such circumstances  is 
not considered  a protocol  deviation.

Protocol Deviation:  
Text has been  added  to pre-specify issues  that are not  
considered protocol  deviations.  Added text  reads  as 
follows: 
A protocol  deviation  is generally  an unplanned  
excursion  from the protocol that is not  implemented or 
intended as a systematic  change.  The investigator  is 
responsible  for ensuring the study is  conducted  in 
accordance  with the procedures  and evaluations  
described  in this protocol and must protect the  rights,  
safety  and welfare of subjects.  The investigator  should 
not implement  any deviation  from, or changes  to, the  
protocol, unless  it is necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study  subjects.  
Guidelines  related  to roxadustat,  epoetin -alfa, and IV 
iron administration deviations  are described in  the 
respective  sections.

Action  taken regarding study drug (action  taken by [CONTACT_976] 
[INVESTIGATOR_2806]) To clarify that  “Action taken regarding  
the study  drug”  refers  to PI’s decision  in 
response  to an AE (eg, PI [INVESTIGATOR_2807])  as opposed to  
subject’s own decision  (subject did not  
take study  drug as s/he was not feeling

Pregnancies: Reporting and  Follow -up of  Subjects  
Added  clarification regarding confirmation of pregnancy  
(added  text is italicized  and bolded)  
A pregnancy in  a female  subject or a male  subject’s  
female  partner must be confirmed  by [CONTACT_2877]  β- 
hCG  test(s) . If pregnancy  is suspected,  study  drug may  
need  to be interrupted  until pregnancy is  ruled  out. Text is  added to reflect the current  
clinical practice to confirm  pregnancy in  
this patient  population (known to have  
high false  positive  pregnancy  results).  
Also, to minimize  exposure to the fetus  as 
a precaution (in  case pregnancy is  
confirmed).  Section  
9.3.6  
Disease Progression  
The following section was  added:  
 
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening  
of a subject’s condition attributable  to the disease  for 
which  the investigational  product is being studied.   It 
may be an increase  in the severity  of the disease under  
study and/or  increases in  the symptoms of the disease.  
Gradual worsening of  ESRD should be  considered  
disease progression and should  not be reported  as an 
AE during the study.  This language was  added to  align  the 
protocol  with a new SOP for  protocol  
templates  Section  
9.3.8  
Blood Pressure  and Heart Rate Measurement  
Guidelines  
Revised  BP and HR measurement guidelines  (added  text 
is bolded and italicized):  
Blood pressure  should be measured  in triplicate  
(preferred ) with  at least  one minute  interval between  the 
measurements.  
Heart  rate (HR)  should be measured  in triplicate  
(preferred ) with  at least  one minute  interval between  the 
measurements.  Measuring BP and HR three times  (at 
least one minute  interval) before dialysis  
is not per standard clinical practice  and is  
difficult to  implement as  it requires  
additional time and manpower.  Added  
verbiage “preferred” will provide  
flexibility to  the sites.  Also, will help  to 
avoid protocol  deviations.  Appendix 5 
Sample Size  Determination  
The following section was  added:  
 
(ie, the proportion of subjects  who achieve a Hb

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Study  Title:  A Phase  3, Multicenter,  Randomized,  Open -Label,  Active -Controlled  
Study  of the Efficacy  and Safety  of FG -4592 in the Treatment  of 
Anemia  in Incident -dialysis  Patients  
Protocol  Number:  FGCL -4592- [ADDRESS_2477]:  Roxadustat (FG -4592)  
Target  Population:  Incident  dialysis  patients with  anemia  due to end -stage renal disease 
(ESRD)  
IND Number:  74,454 
Study  Phase:  Phase  3 
Study  Centers  
Planned:  Up to approximately  400 study centers  worldwide  
Number  of Subjects  
Planned:  A total of  up to approximately  1200 subjects  are planned to be  
randomized  in an open -label,  1:1 ratio to receive either  of the following 
two treatments:  
• Roxadustat (up  to approximately  600 subjects)  
• Epoetin alfa  (active  control, up to approximately  600 subjects)  
Primary  Objectives:  Evaluate the  efficacy  and safety  of roxadustat  in the treatment  of 
anemia in incident -dialysis  subjects compared  with Active  Control.  
Secondary  Objectives:  • Evaluate the  utilization  of intravenous  (IV)  iron with roxadustat  
compared  with Active  Control  
• Evaluate effect  of roxadustat  on serum lipid parameters  compared  
with Active Control  
• Evaluate the  effect  of roxadustat  on blood pressure  (BP)  compare d 
with Active Control  
• Evaluate time  to achieve a hemoglobin (Hb)  response  compared  
with Active Control  
Study  Design:  This is a Phase  3, multicenter,  randomized, open -label,  active-  
controlled study  to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of roxadustat  in the  
treatment  of anemia  in incident -dialysis  subjects.  
The study periods  are as follows:  
• Screening  Period:  Up to 6 weeks  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -4777 -9E3D -573C49788EDD

• Treatment Period:  Treatment  duration is variable  for individual  
subjects.   In order to  complete the Treatment  Period  simultaneously  
for all study  subjects,  the minimum treatment duration may  be less  
than [ADDRESS_2478]  4 weeks  prior  to their treatment period end.  
 
 
• Post-Treatment  Follow -Up Period:  4 weeks  
A total of  up to approximately  1200 subjects  will be randomized  to 
receive either  roxadustat or Active  Control (epoetin alfa)  in a 1:1 ratio  
(Appendix 1 ). 
Randomization  is stratified  by [CONTACT_2879], screening  Hb 
values, and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular/thromboembolic medical  
history. 
Scheduled Visits  During  Treatment  
During the  Treatment  Period,  subjects  will attend weekly  study  visits  
from  Weeks  [ADDRESS_2479]- 
Treatment  Follow -up Period.  
Starting  Dose  of Study  Drug  
Roxadustat Arm  
For subjects receiving  roxadustat,  the initial  dose (per dose  amount)  is 
based on a tiered,  weight -based  dosing scheme  (Table  S1). Roxadustat  
will be dosed  orally  three  times  weekly  (TIW)  throughout the  
Treatment  Period,  except  if a subject requires  < 20 mg  TIW  (ie, < 60  
mg per week)  to maintain  an Hb  levels  in the  Maintenance  Phase,  the 
dosing frequency should be reduced  in a step -wise fashion  eg, TIW  to 
BIW,  BIW  to QW,  QW  to Q-2 Week  etc..  
 
Epoetin Alfa  Arm 
• Subjects  on hemodialysis  (HD)  receiving  epoetin  alfa will 
initiate  IV epoetin  alfa treatment according  to the epoetin alfa 
US Package Insert  (USPI)  or Summary  of Product  
Characteristics  (SmPC).  
• For subjects on home -hemodialysis (HHD)  or peritoneal  
dialysis  (PD),  epoetin  alfa will be administered  according  to the 
epoetin USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808],  or local  standard- of-care.

Note:  Weight in HD subjects  = subject’s  dry weight.   
Dose  Adjustments for  Roxadustat  
Dose  adjustments  will occur in two separate dosing  phases:  the 
Correction  Phase  and the Maintenance  Phase.  Each  of these phases will 
follow unique dose adjustment  rules  according  to Appendix  2. All  
subjects  in the roxadustat  arm will be  dosed orally  TIW  during the  
Treatment  Period.  The maximum roxadustat dose  is 3.0  mg/kg  per dose  
or 400 mg, whichever is lower.  
All dose adjustments  as well as assessments of  excessive hematopoiesis  
are based  on Hb values using  a point -of-care device  such  as HemoCue® 
or CritLine®. In the event  that the central  lab Hb  value of  the site visit  is 
significantly  different  and the dose adjustment decision  based  on the  
HemoCue® or CritLine® value  is being  reconsidered, the Medical  
Monitor  should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  if possible.  
The determination  of Hb response and  transition  from  the Correction  to 
the Maintenance Phase of  the study is based on the central laboratory  
Hb value.  
Correction  Phase  of Dosing for Roxadustat  
The aim of the Correction  Phase  is to  increase Hb  levels  from basel ine 
to the  target Hb  level by  [CONTACT_2880]  2. This  phase is  variable in  length for  each  subject.  
Dose  adjustment  reviews  will occur on Week  4, and at intervals  of 
every 4 weeks  thereafter (Weeks  8, 12, 16, etc.)  except  in the event of  
excessive hematopoiesis, in which  case doses may  be adjusted  at any  
time.  In such cases, dose  adjustment reviews  are resumed  at 4- week  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2480]’s  Hb increases  >2.0 g/dL  from  
Week  [ADDRESS_2481]’s  dose  is reduced  by [CONTACT_2881]  3. The  next dose  adjustment review should occur 4 weeks  later at  
Week  7 and at 4- week  intervals  thereafter.  
If the dose adjustment  interval  falls  on a non -study visit week  (starting  
Week  4), the  dose adjustment  review should be performed  at the next  
scheduled  clinic  visit,  if a dose adjustment  was not required  at the 
previous visit.  For example,  if a subject’s  visit is scheduled  for Weeks  6 
and 8, and the  dose adjustment would  occur at Week  7, then the dose  
adjustment should  be evaluated  at the  Week  8 visit.  
.M aintenance  Phase  of Dosing  for Roxadustat  
The aim of the Maintenance  Phase  is to maintain  Hb levels after  the 
initial correction  by [CONTACT_2882]  2. 
Dosing  and Dose  Adjustment for Active  Control  Arm  (Epoetin alfa)  
Subjects  on epoetin  alfa should maintain  their Hb levels  within  the 
target  range accepted by [CONTACT_2883], specifically:  
• Hb 10 to 11 g/dL  in the  United  States  
• Hb 10 to 12 g/dL  in countries  outside the United  States  
Subjects receiving  HD on epoetin alfa will  be dosed  IV TIW,  with  
starting  doses  and dose adjustment rules  according  to the epoetin alfa  
USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808].  HD subjects requiring ultra -low dose of  EPO (eg,  
≤1000 IU/per  week),  frequency  of administration  may  be adjusted per  
local  standard of  care.  
Subjects receiving  PD or  HHD on epoetin alfa will be dosed according  
to the epoetin alfa USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808],  or local  standard of  care.  
For countries  using prefilled  syringes, the initial epoetin  alfa dose and 
dose adjustments  should be approximated to the closest  calculated  
weekly  dose. 
Excessive  Hematopoiesis  
For subjects randomized  to Roxadustat,  the following scenarios  are 
defined as “excessive hematopoiesis”  ; 
• Hb increases  by > 2.0 g/dL at any time  within  a 4 week  period:  
reduce the dose  by [CONTACT_2884].  
• Hb reaches  or exceeds  13 g/dL:  hold  dosing, check  Hb weekly.  
Resume  dosing when  Hb < 12.0 g/dL (for US subjects  central  
lab Hb  value  preferred),  at a dose  that is reduced  by [CONTACT_2885].  
For subjects on prolonged dose -hold, with stable (not droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  Hb, 
the Investigator  may use discretion  to schedule  less frequent visits.

FibroGen,  Inc. Confidential and Proprietary  Page 23  
  
Anytime Hb  is assessed  via HemoCue®/CritLine®/local  lab, a 
central  lab Hb should be obtained as  well.  
Supplemental  Iron  Use 
In a Phase [ADDRESS_2482] -line iron  
supplementation  without restrictions,  for both study  arms.  
In addition to the scheduled  assessments (Appendix  3), iron  indices  
may be assessed at any  time (via central  lab) to evaluate  iron storage  
status of  the subjects,  if considered necessary  by [CONTACT_737].  
a) Oral  Iron Supplementation 
All subjects should be encouraged  to take oral  iron as the 
preferred  first-line iron supplementation  during the Treatment  
Period,  except  subjects  not tolerating  oral iron. The  dose and 
frequency are at the discretion  of the Investigator. Oral iron 
supplementation  should  be started  before  the subject  becomes  
iron depleted.  
b) Intravenous Iron Supplementation  
Intravenous iron supplementation is  permitted  if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2811]’s  Hb has not responded  
adequately, and the subject  is considered  iron-deficient.  
 
 
Treatment  with  study medication  will continue during  IV iron 
administration.  Discontinuation  of IV iron is recommended  
once the subject is no longer  deemed  iron deficient  (eg, ferritin  
≥ 100 ng/ml  [≥ 220 pmol/L],  TSAT  ≥ 20%) and has evidence  of 
a hematopoietic response. 
Rescue  Therapy  Guidelines  
Rescue  therapy  guidelines  are provided to standardize  the use  of rescue 
therapy.  
 
Red Blood  Cell Transfusion  
Red blood cell (RBC)  transfusion  should  be considered  if rapid  
correction  of anemia  is required  to stabilize  the subject’s  condition  (eg, 
acute hemorrhage) and the  Investigator  is of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2812] a medical  necessity.  Study  drug treatment  may  continue

during RBC transfusion administration.  
Erythropoiesis  Stimulating  Agents  (Roxadustat Arm only)  
The use of  erythropoiesis -stimulating  agents (ESAs)  is not permitted  
during the Treatment  Period,  except  if all of  the following criteria  are 
met: 
• A subject’s Hb  level has  not responded  adequately  despi[INVESTIGATOR_2813] 
• Other  causes  for lack of  response or declining  Hb, such as iron 
deficiency, bleeding, acute inflammatory  conditions,  have been 
ruled out  
• Reducing  risk of alloimmunization  in transplant eligible  patients  
is a goal.  
Roxadustat and ESA  may  not be co -administered.  Treatment  with  an 
approved ESA  may  be initiated  ≥ [ADDRESS_2483] roxadustat  dose.  
If the situation  permits,  the Investigator  should inform  the Medical  
Monitor prior  to initiation  of ESA therapy. 
Subjects  may receive one  course  of ESA rescue during the  Treatment  
Period.  Erythropoiesis -stimulating  agen t rescue  should stop after  4 
weeks  or once  Hb exceeds  9 g/dL,  whichever  occurs  first.  If a subject  
requires  more  than 4 weeks  of ESA rescue therapy  due to inadequate  
Hb response,  the Medical  Monitor  should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Treatment  with  roxadustat  may  resume  after the following intervals:  
• Two days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2814] 
• One week  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2815] 
• Two weeks  after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2816] -epoetin  
beta (Mircera®) 
If more  than  one course  of ESA rescue is required during the Treatment 
Period,  the subject  must  be discontinued permanently from  the study,  
and is considered a Treatment  Failure.  
Inadvertent ESA administration including  ESA administered  by 
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_2817], above  criteria are met; these  ssubjects  may be allowed  to

Study  Procedures:  See Schedule  of Study Assessments ( Appendix 3)  
Roxadustat  
Formulation,  Dose,  
and Mode  of 
Administration:  Roxadustat tablets  are available  in 20,  50, and [ADDRESS_2488]  be administered  whole.  
Initial  Doses  
Subjects  will receive tiered,  weight -based  initial  doses  (Table S1 ) 
Dosing  Frequency 
Subjects  will be dosed TIW  throughout the Treatment  Period.  Dosing  
frequency may be reduced  if a subject  requires <  60 mg/week  to 
maintain Hb  levels  in the Maintenance Phase.  
Dose  Adjustment Rules  
Refer  to Section  3.5.3, and  Appendix 2.  
Reference Therapy:  Active  Control:   Epoetin alfa for injection  
Hemodialysis  subjects: Initial dose  and dose adjustments  rules  
according  to the epoetin alfa USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808].  For countries  using  
prefilled  syringes, the initial  epoetin  alfa dose and  dose adjustments  
should be approximated to the closest calculated  total weekly  dose.  
Peritoneal  Dialysis  and HHD subjects: Epoetin alfa  should be  
administered  according  to the epoetin  alfa USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808],  or local  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2489]  calculated  total weekly  dose. 
Efficacy  Endpoints  
and Assessments:  In the endpoint  definitions  below, rescue  therapy  for roxadustat -treated  
subjects  is defined  as either  ESA rescue  or RBC transfusion; rescue 
therapy for epoetin  alfa-treated  subjects  is defined as RBC transfusion. 
All endpoints  using Hb  are based on central  lab. 
 
Primary:  
• US (FDA)  submission : Mean Hb  change from  baseline (using 
central  laboratory values)  to the  average level  during the  
Evaluation  Period,  defined as Week  28 until Week  52. This  
analysis  will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. 
Hemoglobin  values under  the influence of  rescue therapy will 
not be censored  for the primary  analysis.  
• Ex-US submission:  The proportion of subjects  who  achieve a  
Hb response  at two  consecutive  visits  during the first  24 weeks  
of treatment,  without  rescue  therapy  within  6 weeks  prior  to the 
Hb response  in the Per  Protocol  Set (PPS).  
A Hb response  is defined, using central  laboratory  values, as:  
o Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL  and a Hb  increase from  baseline by  
≥ 1.0 g/dL  in subjects  whose  baseline  Hb > 8.0 g/dL,  or 
o Increase in  Hb ≥ 2.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  baseline  Hb 
≤ 8.0 g/dL  
Secondary:  
• US (FDA)  submission : The  proportion of  subjects who  achieve  
a Hb  response  at two consecutive  visits  during the first 24 
weeks  of treatment,  without  rescue  therapy  within  6 weeks  prior  
to the Hb  response.  
A Hb response  is defined, using central  laboratory  values, as  
o Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL  and a Hb  increase from baseline by  
≥ 1.0 g/dL  in subjects  whose  baseline  Hb > 8.0 g/dL,  or 
o Increase in  Hb ≥ 2.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  baseline  Hb 
≤ 8.0 g/dL  
• Ex-US submission:  Mean  Hb change from  baseline  to the 
average level  during the Evaluation  Period,  defined as Week  28 
until Week  36. This  analysis  will be based on the  PPS 
population.

 • Average  monthly  IV iron use per subject  during  the Treatment  
Period  
 
• Mean change  in low -density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol  
averaged  over  Weeks  12 to 24 
• Blood  pressure  effects:  
o Proportion of subjects with  exacerbation  of 
hypertension, meeting  at least one of the following  
criteria:  
- Increase in blood  pressure:   An increase from  
baseline  in systolic  blood pressure  (sBP)  of ≥ 20 
mm Hg  and sBP > 170 mmHg,  or an increase 
from  baseline in dBP of ≥ 15 mm Hg  and 
diastolic  blood  pressure (dBP)  > [ADDRESS_2490]  be confirmed  
by [CONTACT_2887]  
- Time  to an  increase in BP as defined  above  
- Mean change  in mean  arterial  pressure  (MAP)  
averaged  over  Weeks  8 to 12 
• Time  to achieve first  Hb response as defined  by [CONTACT_2888], (ex-US) (which is the secondary  endpoint  for the US  
[FDA] submission).  
Safety  Assessments 
and Endpoints:  Study -specific safety  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_2889]:  
• Treatment -emergent  adverse events (TEAEs)  and 
treatment -emergent  serious  adverse events (TESAEs),  and clinically  
significant  laboratory values  from  baseline 
• Vital signs,  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  findings  and clinical  
laboratory  values  
Safety  interpretation  will also be  made based on analyses of  composite  
endpoints derived  from  adjudicated  events  pooled  across multiple  
studies  in the  roxadustat Phase  3 program. The members  of an  
independent adjudication committee  blinded to treatment  assignment  
will adjudicate the following events  in multiple Phase  3 studies:  
• Death  from any cause,  MI, stroke, congestive  heart  failure requiring  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
hypertensive emergency, deep venous  thrombosis,  pulmonary  
embolism,  and vascular access  thrombosis.  
• Various  region- specific pooled analyses  of composites  of these  
adjudicated  events, pooled across multiple  studies  will be 
conducted.  The analyses  of the adjudicated  events  will be detailed  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -4777 -9E3D -573C49788EDD

 in the  region -specific  pooled  Statistical  Analysis Plan  (SAP).  
For US (FDA)  Only : The primary  safety  endpoint  in this  study  is the  
Major Adverse  Cardiac Event  (MACE)  composite  endpoint, defined as  
time to first occurrence of  death from all causes,  MI, or stroke,  for the 
purpose of  being pooled across multiple  similar  studies in the  Phase  3 
program. None of  the individual  studies  are powered  to meet  the 
MACE primary safety  endpoint  individually.  The pooled MACE  
analysis  is only for purposes  of supporting a US FDA regulatory  filing  
of roxadustat.  
• The above adjudicated  safety  events  may also be used to support  the 
pooled analyses  of additional  composite  safety  endpoints  across  
multiple studies  in the Phase  3 program,  such as  MACE+  (death,  
MI, stroke, congestive  heart  failure requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  and 
unstable  angina  requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), or  a composite  which  
consists  of all of  the adjudicated  events.  
Statistical Methods:  Sample  Size Estimation  
The sample  size calculation  is based  on the primary  endpoint for  both 
the United  States  and Ex -US. 
At least  [ADDRESS_2491] (ie,  all-cause death, MI, stroke, 
congestive  heart  failure requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  unstable  angina  
requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  DVT,  pulmonary embolism,  vascular access  
thrombosis, and hypertensive  emergency).  The final  number  of patients  
to be enrolled  will be based  on the enrollment  rate of other studies  
within  the same  indication,  in order  to optimize  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2821] a comparable  time frame.  
With  at least  [ADDRESS_2492]  99% power  to 
demonstrate statistical non-inferiority  of roxadustat versus  ESA in the  
primary  endpoint for  US (FDA)  submission  (ie, specifically,  Hb change  
from  baseline to the  average level  during the  evaluation  period  defined 
as Week  28 until Week  52). This  assumes  a difference (roxadustat  
minus  ESA)  of 0.30 g/dL, a non- inferiority  margin  for this  difference of 
0.75 g/dL  and a standard deviation  of 1.25 g/dL.  This  endpoint will  be 
analyzed using the ITT population for  the US FDA submission. 
The study will  provide at  least  99% power  to demonstrate  statistical 
non-inferiority  of roxadustat versus  ESA in the primary  endpoint  
outside of  the United  States  (ie, the proportion of  subjects  who  achieve 
a Hb  response  at two consecutive  visits  during the first 24 weeks  of 
treatment  ). This  assumes  an 80% responder  rate for both roxadustat  
and epoetin  alfa, in order  to support the primary  efficacy  analysis (ie, a

FibroGen,  Inc. Confidential and Proprietary  Page 32  
  
 
non-inferiority  comparison  in responder  rate between  roxadustat and  
epoetin  alfa) and assuming  a non- inferiority  margin  of -15% for this  
difference  (roxadustat  minus  epoetin  alfa).  This  endpoint  will be  
analyzed using the PPS population for  the European Medicines  Agency 
(EMA) submission. 
Statistical  Analysis 
1. Efficacy  analysis for superiority will be conducted  on the ITT  
population for US (FDA)  submission  and on the full  analysis set  
(FAS)  population, for  Ex-US submission. 
2. Efficacy  analysis for non-inferiority  will be conducted  on the 
ITT population for US (FDA)  submission  and on the PPS  
population, for Ex-US submission. 
3. Hemoglobin  results  obtained from  the central  laboratory  will be 
used f or all efficacy  analyses.  Baseline  Hb is defined  as the 
mean  of at least  three central  laboratory Hb  values:   at least  the 
last two screening  Hb values prior to  randomization  plus the  one 
predose Hb  value on Day  1 of the Treatment  Period. 
Primary  Efficacy Analysis  
US (FDA)  submission : The  primary  efficacy  endpoint for submission  
in the United  States is defined  as the mean  Hb change from  baseline to  
the average level  during the Evaluation Period,  defined  as Week  28 
until Week  52. The  analysis  will be based on the  ITT population. 
Hb values under  the influence of  rescue  therapy  will not be censored  for 
the primary  efficacy  analysis.  
The primary  hypothesis to be tested  for the primary  efficacy  analysis is: 
H0: Hb mean  change from baseline  to the average  level  from  
Week 28  to Week 52  in the  roxadustat  arm ≤ Hb mean  change  
from  baseline  in the  epoetin  alfa arm minus  0.75 g/dL  
Versus:  
H1: Hb change from  baseline to the  average level  of Week 28 to 
Week 52  in the  roxadustat  arm > Hb mean  change from  
baseline  in the epoetin  alfa arm minus  0.75 g/dL  
A multiple  imputation  Analysis  of Ancova  Model  (MI ANCOVA)  will 
be used for the  primary  endpoint. 
The model  will contain  terms  for treatment  arm,  baseline  measurement,  
and randomization stratification  factors  (except  screening  Hb values ( ≤ 
8g/dL  vs. >8g/dL).  The primary  efficacy  analysis will  be based  on the  
estimated  difference between  the two  treatments  overall  mean  effects  
throughout  the study based  on the MI  ANCOVA model.  
In addition, as a sensitivity  analysis, the primary  efficacy  endpoint will  
be analyzed  using the  analysis  of the mixed  model  for repeat measures

(MMRM). The  MMRM  model  will contain  terms  for baseline Hb  
measurement  as covariate,  treatment  arm, visit,  visit by [CONTACT_2890],  
and randomization stratification  factors  (except  screening Hb  values ( ≤ 
8g/dL  vs. >8g/dL)  as fixed  effects.  
Due to the large  amount  of visits included in  the model, the  
unstructured covariance pattern  model  will be tested  against the  less 
parameterized  heterogeneous  Toeplitz  structure using the  likelihood 
ratio test for nested models.  If the algorithm  for unstructured  covariance 
pattern  does  not converge  or the  likelihood  ratio  test is not statistically  
significant  then heterogeneous  Toeplitz  structure will  be used. If  this 
second model  does not  converge  either,  then  the (homogeneous)  
Toeplitz  structure  will be tried  and finally  compound  symmetry  as a 
covariance structure to achieve converge nce. 
This null hypothesis  will be rejected  if the two -sided  95% confidence  
interval (CI) for the difference of  least  square means  from  the mixed  
model  lies entirely  above  –0.75 g/dL. 
Ex-US Submission : The primary  efficacy  endpoint  for Ex-US 
submission  is defined  as the proportion of  subjects who  achieve a Hb  
response at  two consecutive  visits  during the first 24 weeks  of 
treatment,  without  rescue  therapy within  6 weeks prior  to the  Hb 
response.  
• A Hb response is defined,  using central  laboratory values, as:  
Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL  and a Hb  increase from baseline by  ≥ 1.0 g/dL  
in subjects whose  baseline  Hb > 8.0 g/dL, or  
• Increase in  Hb ≥ 2.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  baseline  Hb 
≤ 8.0 g/dL.  
Rescue  therapy for roxadustat treated  subjects  is defined  as ESA rescue 
or RBC transfusion,  and rescue therapy  for epoetin  alfa treated  subjects  
is defined  as RBC transfusion. 
The hypothesis  to be  tested  for the primary  efficacy  analysis  is: 
H0: Hb response rate  for subjects  in the roxadustat  arm - Hb 
response rate  for subjects  in the  epoetin  alfa arm ≤ -15%. 
Versus 
H1: Hb response rate  for subjects  in the roxadustat  arm - Hb 
response rate  for subjects  in the  epoetin  alfa arm > -15%.  
A two-sided  95% CI  for the difference  of 2 responder rates (roxadustat  
minus  epoetin alfa)  based  on the Miettinen  and Nurminen  approach  
adjusting for treatment and other stratification  factors  will be calculated  
and the null hypothesis  will be rejected  if the lower  bound of  the 95%  
CI is greater than - 15%.

descriptive statistics.  
Safety  parameters  include  adverse events  (AEs),  serious  adverse events  
(SAEs),  laboratory parameters, vital  signs, ECG parameters,  and 
physical  examinations  (PE’s).  For each safety  parameter,  the last  
assessment  made  prior to  the first  dose  of study medication  will be used  
as the baseline for  all analyses  of that safety  parameter.  
The analytical  methods  for the MACE endpoint, as well  as other  
composite  safety  endpoints  of interest,  will be described  in a region-  
specific  pooled statistical analysis  plan (PSAP)  to reflect the  nature of  
the pooling of these endpoints  across  comparable studies  in the Phase [ADDRESS_2493]  (DSMB).

1 INTRODUCTION 
Roxadustat (FG -4592)  is an investigational  novel  small  molecule  drug for  oral administration  
that has  not been marketed  in any country. The  drug  is in global  Phase  3 clinical  development. It  
is being developed for  the treatment  of anemia  associated  with  chronic kidney disease (CKD),  
including end -stage renal  disease (ESRD).

CKD is a growing worldwide  public  health  challenge  associated  with  significant  morbidity  and 
mortality,  yet it is under -diagnosed  and under -treated.  It is characterized  by [CONTACT_2891], ultimately  resulting  in premature  death or  renal  replacement  therapy (kidney 
transplant  or dialysis).  In 2007, CKD affected  13% of  the US adult population (approximately  29 
million  US adults)  and its  prevalence is growing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]  (Coresh,  2007) . All-cause mortality  risk 
increases  exponentially as CKD stages advance ( Tonelli,  2006) . 
The number  of patients  suffering  from ESRD also continues  to increase worldwide.  The US has  
one of  the highest  prevalence rates  of ESRD in the world: in 2010,  the US had over [ADDRESS_2495]  
patients  per million  population,  a 23%  increase compared  with  10 years prior (United  States  
Renal  Data System  (USRDS,  2011)  Vol 2, Ch 1, p188). In 2009 (point prevalence Dec 31), there 
were approximately  570,[ADDRESS_2496] patients  in the US, of whom  370,000 were  receiving  
hemodialysis  (HD),  27,000 were re ceiving  peritoneal  dialysis (PD),  and 173,000 had a  
functioning kidney transplant ( USRDS,  2011) [Vol  2, Ch  1, p184]. The average expected  life 
expectancy  of a dialysis patient is 5.9  years, compared  with  16.4 years for a transplant patient,  
and 25.2 years  for someone  of comparable age in  the general population ( USRDS,  2011) [Vol  2, 
Ch 2, p 181]. The  prevalence  of ESRD is projected  to grow  to 774,000 by [CONTACT_2892] 2020 
(USRDS,  2009) [Vol  2, Ch 2]. 
1.1.2 Anemia  Associated with Chronic  Kidney  Disease  
Anemia  is a common  complication  in patients  with  CKD,  and although its pathogenesis  is 
multifactorial,  the decreased  production of  erythropoietin (EPO),  a hormone  produced primarily  
in the kidneys,  is considered  an important  etiologic  factor.  The impaired  ability  of the body to 
absorb and utilize iron is likely  a second  important  etiologic  factor.  
Anemia  may  present  in early stages of  CKD and  its prevalence increases as CKD progresses. 
Anemia  is present in 17%  of patients  with late Stage  3 disease;  this increases  to 25%  in patients  
with Stage  4 disease,  and to 49% in patients  with  Stage  [ADDRESS_2497] not yet progressed to 
dialysis  (Coresh, 2007;  Go, 2004). Over  90 % of patients undergoing dialysis  are anemic.  Half of  
new dialysis patients  (50.1%)  have hemoglobin (Hb)  levels below 10 g/dL and approximately 
28% have Hb  levels  below 9 g/dL  (USRDS,  2003) [Ch  3, Figure  3.11].  
The clinical consequences  of anemia  in patients  with  CKD have been studied  extensively. 
Because the  main  impact  of anemia on organ function is reduced  oxygen delivery  to tissues,  it 
affects  almost  every organ system.  
Anemia  contributes to the  excess morbidity and  mortality  in CKD and ESRD.  In patients with  
CKD,  the severity  of anemia  correlates  directly  with the  risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], cardiovascular

disease,  and death  (Collins, 1998 ). Patients  with  the lowest  Hb have  worse  outcomes, as  was 
discussed  in the post  hoc analysis of mortality by [CONTACT_2893] (CHOIR)  studies in the FDA briefing  
document  for the October 2007 Cardiovascular  and Renal Advisory Committee ( Unger, 2007).  
Similar observations  are found in  USRDS  mortality  data  stratified  by [CONTACT_2894]. All -cause  mortality  
stratified  by [CONTACT_2894]  (1993–1996)  showed significantly higher first -year death  rates  in patients  with 
Hb levels  < 9, compared with 11 to  12 g/dL.  This trend continued to worsen, as reflected in  
1998–1999 data,  where the  death  rate rose  by ∼ 75% compared  with the  1993–1996 period 
(USRDS, 2000 ) Ch 8, Fig 8.16; ( USRDS, 2001)  [Ch 9, Fig 9.14]. This increase coincides with 
the introduction of the Kidney Disease Outcomes  Quality  Initiative  (KDOQI)  guidelines in  1997. 
The relative risk of  all-cause  mortality  for patients with Hb < 9 g/dL is twice that of patients with  
Hb > 12 g/dL ( USRDS,  2002)  [Ch 9, Table 9b]. The relative risk  of cardiovascular  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2822]  1.26 in  patients  with  Hb levels <  9 g/dL compared with 
those with Hb  at 11 to 12 g/dL ( USRDS, 2001)  [Ch 5, Fig 5.27].  
Multiple  studies  have shown  that treatment  of anemia  reduces the need for blood transfusions  
and improves  health -related  quality of life  (HRQoL) ( NKF K/DOQI, 2007 )). 
1.2 Treatment of Anemia  
Today, therapy with erythropoiesis -stimulating agents  (ESAs) is  a major alternative to  
transfusion in  managing anemia associated  with  CKD.  For those  not resistant  to ESAs,  parenteral  
administration  of exogenous recombinant human EPO (epoetin alfa or beta) or pegylated  
analogues has been a widely accepted approach for treatment  of anemia in patients with CKD  
(Winearls,  1986;  Eschbach, 1989; Eschbach, 1987), despi[INVESTIGATOR_2823].  These 
safety risks include hypertension, thrombosis  and cerebrovascular events  and may  be associated  
with the supraphysiologic plasma  EPO levels  frequently observed with  ESA therapy. Anemic  
patients  with CKD or ESRD will require  life-long treatment  with these  agents.  
Although the treatment  of anemia in CKD and ESRD  is thought to contribute positively to a  
patient’s quality of life, several studies in ESRD and CKD nondialysis patients have shown  
higher  mortality or  trends  in that direction  in the higher -dosed ESA -treated cohorts when  the 
protocol objective was to tre at to high target Hb levels ( Besarab,  1998, Drueke, 2006;  
Singh, 2006). An ESA dose relationship  to mortality  has been  reported in a review of  the 
USRDS database ( Zhang, 2004 ) of ESRD patients who received higher  ESA  doses. Additionally, 
ESA therapy for anemia in ESRD patients on HD  usually requires  concomitant intravenous  (IV)  
iron supplementation.  IV iron is associated with its  own  set of risks,  including anaphylaxis. 
There is currently an unmet  medical  need for an  oral treatment  that can correct  anemia  in CKD 
nondialysis  and dialysis  patients  while avoiding supraphysiologic levels of  circulating  plasma  
EPO  levels,  and also minimizes the  use of IV iron. 
Roxadustat  is an oral medication that  could potentially  deliver effective treatment for  CKD-  
related anemia with less need for IV iron supplementation and  without  producing 
supraphysiologic levels of circulating  EPO, which may  translate into an  improved safety  profile.  
1.3 Mechanism  of Action  of Roxadustat  
Virtually  all tissues  depend on a  sufficient  supply of oxygen for survival. Lack of  oxygen 
associated  with hypoxic, ischemic, and  anemic conditions  triggers a  series of homeostatic  
responses  (Figure  1). Hypoxia -inducible  factor  (HIF)  is a transcription factor that is believed to  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -4777 -9E3D -573C49788EDD  
Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -063 Amendment 4

be the key element  in the body’s oxygen sensing mechanism ( Semenza, 2000).  
Hypoxia -inducible  factor regulates  expression  of genes that  modulate  both the acute and  chronic  
response  to hypoxia, and  HIF-responsive  genes  regulate  processes  as diverse  as erythropoiesis, 
iron metabolism,  oxidation, cellular metabolism,  glycolysis, vasculogenesis, cell cycle  
progression, and apoptosis.  Chronic hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia induce  different sets of  
genes associated  with HIF transcriptional activity  (Fan, 2005 ). Hypoxia -inducible  factor  is a 
heterodimeric  transcription  factor  family  comprising three  oxygen -sensitive  isoforms  (HIF -1α, 
HIF-2α and HIF -3α), and a constitutively expressed  HIF-1β subunit, with  each heterodimeric  
isoform  responsible for the  induction of specific  sets of genes  (Greijer,  2005;  Hu, 2003). For  
example,  HIF-1α has been  shown  to regulate  vascular endothelial  growth factor  (VEGF)  
expression (Gray,  2005;  Buchler, 2003 ), while  HIF-2α is critical  for the induction of  the EPO  
gene and erythropoiesis ( Wamecke,  2004).

Hypoxia -inducible  factor target  genes  are expressed  when  the active heterodimer  binds to a  
conserved deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA)  motif found within  all HIF target  genes,  termed  the 
hypoxia response  element,  and in cooperation with other  co-activators initiates  de novo 
transcription.  One of the most  sensitive  and well -studied  HIF-responsive  genes  is the EPO gene.  
Increased  transcription  of the EPO  gene leads  to increased  circulating  levels  of EPO,  which  acts 
at sites  of erythropoiesis to enhance  the differentiation  and proliferation  of red blood cell (RBC)  
precursors.  
Although  HIF-α isoforms  are constitutively  produced, their accumulation  under normoxic  
conditions  is prevented by  [CONTACT_2895] -Lindau  (VHL)  protein,  
which  targets  HIF-α isoforms  for degradation through  the ubiquitin -proteasome  pathway.  The 
molecular  mechanism  for oxygen- dependent  degradation of  HIF-α is based  on the hydroxylation 
of specific  proline  residues,  as catalyzed by a family  of hypoxia -inducible  prolyl  hydroxylases  

DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -4777 -9E3D -573C49788EDD

(HIF -PH) that utilize  molecular  oxygen as the substrate  for hydroxylation. Thus, HIF -PH 
constitutes  the body’s main  oxygen sensor  by [CONTACT_2896]. Under  hypoxic conditions, HIF -PHs are inactive and lead  to initiation  of the HIF - 
responsive  transcriptional  cascade ( Wang, 1995 ; Semenza,  1998).  
Roxadustat is  a potent  and reversible hypoxia inducible  prolyl hydroxylase  inhibitor (HIF -PHI)  
that transiently  induces HIF stabilization  and leads  to a functional  HIF transcriptional response  
that mimics  the erythropoietic  response  associated  with  exposure  of humans  to intermittent  
hypoxia. Hypoxia  inducible  prolyl  factor induces  expression of not only EPO,  but also  the EPO  
receptor  and proteins  that promote  iron absorption and recycling  (Peyssonnaux, 2008). Thus,  
roxadustat  pharmacologically stimulates  erythropoiesis  via the  HIF pathway and in  a manner  
consistent  with  the body’s  normal  homeostatic  response  to anemia,  but under normoxic  
conditions. In  contrast  to the classical paradigm,  suggesting that anemia  in CKD patients is  
caused by [CONTACT_2897],  results  of a study of roxadustat  
treatment  of CKD subjects not req uiring  dialysis  (Study  No. FGCL -SM4592- 017) suggest  that 
the kidneys and other sites  of EPO production in this patient population  retain  the ability  to 
produce sufficient  EPO for robust  erythropoiesis.  
Roxadustat also has  the potential to  effectively  treat anemias  caused by  [CONTACT_2898] -induced 
functional iron deficiency,  which  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_2824].  In these conditions, iron 
availability  for erythropoiesis is reduced  due to a  number  of inflammatory  mediators,  all of  
which  increase Hepcidin  levels,  impairing  iron transport to the bone marrow.  Because HIF-PHIs  
such as roxadustat alter  expression not only of  the EPO gene but also of  genes  regulating iron  
metabolism,  it is postulated  that roxadustat  may  be effective in treating  these  anemias  as well  
(Langsetmo,  2005).  
Chronic  hypoxia  and intermittent hypoxia  induce  different  sets of genes  associated  with  HIF 
transcriptional  activity,  presumably  because intermittent stimulation  allows  the r estoration of  
HIF degradation, turnover, and inactivation. Transient activation  of HIF thereby [CONTACT_2899],  
as well  as expression  of additional  genes  that are secondary  to activation of HIF -dependent  
genes. Both nonclinical and clinical studies  of roxadustat  have  successfully  used the  intermittent 
dosing paradigm  to induce selective erythropoiesis  and to optimize  the Hb dose response.  
Furthermore,  roxadusta t was  selected  for development  over other HIF -PH-inhibiting  candidate  
molecules  based  on an optimal biodistribution  profile  that enhances  its selective  actions.  The 
specific tissues  where  roxadustat  enters  the cytoplasm and triggers  gene  expression  reside  in the 
main  target  organs for erythropoiesis:  the kidney (EPO production), the bone  marrow  (increase  
in EPO receptors),  the duodenum  (transepi[INVESTIGATOR_2825]),  and the liver  (EPO production 
and down- regulation  of hepcidin production);  roxadustat  distributes  preferentially  to these  
organs.  
The physiologic  mechanisms  underlying the effects  of roxadustat  on erythropoiesis  are distinct  
from  that of  ESAs,  and these differences  result in  several  potential  advantages  over  ESAs  
beyond the convenience of oral therapy.  These  potential  advantages include:  
• Increase in  the number  of EPO receptors in  the bone  marrow  
• Improved iron  metabolism and bioavailability

• Effective erythropoiesis at nonsupraphysiologic plasma  EPO  levels  (10- to 20-fold lower  
than with  parenteral  ESA therapy)  
• Absence  of hypertensive effect  
• Effective erythropoiesis in the presence of  inflammation  
• Mitigation  of thromboembolic  risk 
• Improvement  in lipid profile

As of [ADDRESS_2500] been exposed to roxadustat  in the clinical  
development  program,  comprising  377 healthy  subjects,  294 subjects  with  nondialysis -dependent  
chronic kidney disease  (NDD- CKD),  and 298 dialysis -dependent  subjects  with chronic  kidney 
disease (DD -CKD).  In completed  Phase  1 studies,  healthy volunteers received  single  doses  of 
roxadustat  up to 4.0 mg/kg  and repeat  doses up to 3.75 mg/kg three times  weekly  (TIW)  for 
4 weeks.  In a completed  thorough QT study in healthy volunteers,  single doses up to 5 mg/kg  
were administered,  without  evidence of  QT prolongation. 
Of the [ADDRESS_2501] been

1.4.1 Pharmacokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK)  and pharmacodynamics  of roxadustat were characterized  in studies  
in healthy  volunteers  and in dialysis and nondialysis  CKD subjects.  Roxadustat  showed 
generally dose  proportional  PK (except  at the lowest  dose  of 0.3 mg/kg); t 1/2 was 12 to 14 hours  
in healthy  volunteers,  and 15 to 19 hours in dialysis  subjects (after  a single  1 and 2 mg/kg dose). 
The exposure  was higher  in subjects on dialysis  compared  with  healthy  subjects.  
A relative  bioavailability  study was  conducted  in 24 healthy volunteers  comparing capsule  
formulation, which  was used in Phase  1 and Phase  2, with  tablet  formulation,  which  was 
developed for Phase 3. The study demonstrated  bioequivalence  to bridge  the 2 formulation. With  
an intermittent dose regimen  (once weekly  [QW],  twice  weekly [BIW],  or TIW),  no or limited  
accumulation in mean  AUC or Cmax was observed.  Furthermore, no evidence was  found for  time - 
dependent PK (no auto -induction or inhibition). Roxadustat  is highly protein bound and  the PK 
of roxadustat  is not  affected  by [CONTACT_2900].  Metabolites  found in urine suggested  Phase  [ADDRESS_2502]. In plasma,  parent roxadustat is the main

component. The  inhibitory potential of  roxadustat  on cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes, based  
on in -vitro  studies is limited,  and the lowest  Ki value  was observed for CYP 2C8  (16 μM).  In a 
clinical  drug -drug interaction  study with rosiglitazone, a probe  drug for  CYP 2C8, roxadustat did  
not show  any inhibitory potential  on CYP 2C8  in vivo. 
In healthy  adult  male  volunteers  (Study  FGCL -SM4592- 016), roxadustat administered  orally  as a 
single dose up to 4.0 mg/kg, and QW,  BIW,  or TIW  for 4 weeks at doses  up to 3.75 mg/kg,  was 
pharmacodynamically  active  as evidenced  by [CONTACT_2715] -dependent transient increases  in endogenous  
erythropoietin (eEPO)  (starting  from single doses of 0.3 mg/kg), increases in reticulocytes  
(starting  from doses of  2 mg/kg),  and Hb responses  (starting  at 3 mg/kg). The  mean peak level  of 
plasma  EPO  following the Day  26 dose of  2.0 mg/kg  TIW  (the high therapeutic  dose  studied)  
was 326.3 ± 197.0 mIU/mL.  
In pharmacodynamic  studies conducted with  roxadustat in CKD subjects not  on dialysis  (Study  
FGCL -4592- 017), the mean  maximum EPO increase from  baseline  ranged from  82 to 
443 mIU/mL and 492 to 554 mIU/mL after  a single  1 and 2 mg/kg dose, respectively.  Results  
from  PK studies in subjects  on HD (Study  FGCL -4592- 039 in the United  States and  in Japan  
(Study  CL-1517 -203) showed  similarity  in PK and pharmacodynamics  of roxadustat  in 
Caucasians and Japanese subjects  with  ESRD,  and the timing  of roxadustat dosing relative  to 
dialysis  (given  before  or after dialysis)  did not  impact  PK profile.  Also,  comparable  dose- 
dependent increases  in EPO levels  were observed  with both predialysis and postdialysis  dosing. 
These increases  in eEPO were transient,  peaked at around [ADDRESS_2503],  EPO levels  associated  with  therapeutic  ESA dosing range from 1,500 to 
> 10,000 mIU/mL ( Besarab,  2009). In  a clinical study with  subjects  on dialysis, the reported  
mean  administered  individual  ESA dose was  8,000 IU,  which  would  correspond to plasma  EPO  
Cmax levels exceeding  3,000  mIU/mL( Fishbane, 2007).  This is approximately [ADDRESS_2504] been in  NDD- CKD subjects  (2 US, 1 in China), and three  have been  in 
subjects  with  DD-CKD  (1 US;  1 US,  Asia,  Russia;  1 China). For details  about  dialysis,  please 
see the IB.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Studies  in Subje cts with NDD- CKD 
Data from  a 4-week  dose  ranging study  in anemic  CKD subjects not  on dialysis  (Study  
FGCL -SM4592- 017) showed  that roxadustat  promotes  erythropoiesis at  lower  doses in  CKD  
subjects  than in healthy volunteers.  With  roxadustat 0.7 mg/kg TIW  dosing, mean  Hb increased  
by 1.0 g/dL  over a 6- week  period in anemic CKD subjects  who  completed  4 weeks of  dosing;  
more  robust  mean  Hb increases of  2.0 to 2.3 g/dL  occurred  at roxadustat  doses  of 1.5 and 2.0 
mg/kg  TIW,  respectively.  Hemoglobin  responder  (Hb increase of  ≥ 1.0 g/dL)  rates  were 62%, 
60%, 91%, and  100% in the roxadustat  0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg  TIW  cohorts, respectively.  
The Hb responses were also  robust  at higher roxadustat  doses (1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg)  in the BIW  
dosing groups.  With  the additional  criterion  that Hb  achieve a level  of ≥11 g/dL  as well  as

increasing  by ≥ 1.0 g/dL, the Hb  responder  rate with  roxadustat  2.0 mg/kg  was 89% and  91% in 
with BIW  and TIW  dosing, respectively.  The rapid  rates of  rise in Hb  with roxadustat  treatment  
were not accompanied  by [CONTACT_2901]  (BP),  as has been  reported  with  ESA  
treatment  (Eschbach,  1989 ). 
Data from  16- to 24 -week  treatment  Phase  2b study  in CKD subjects not on dialysis  (Study  
FGCL -4592- 041) showed  that absolute  and weight -based  doses  of roxadustat, administered  TIW 
and BIW,  effectively  corrected  Hb levels  to a Hb  target  of 11 g/dL  (range of  11 to 13 g/dL  in 
96 subjects and 10.5 to 12.0 g/dL  in 48 subjects).  Dose -response  trends  suggested  that starting  
doses of  1.0 to1.6 mg/kg  roxadustat  administered  TIW  are appropriate to  correct  Hb levels  
during 4 weeks  of treatment  in nondialysis  CKD subjects.  Roxadustat was  also effective in 
maintaining  Hb level following  anemia  correction.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Studies  in Subjects  with DD -CKD 
Data from  a 12-week  study  in incident -dialysis  (48 HD and  12 PD)  subjects (Study  FGCL -4592 - 
053), using similarly  tiered,  weight -based  doses as Study  FGCL -4592 -041 demonstrated  
increases in  mean  Hb of approximately 2 g/dL  after  6 weeks  of treatment.  Subjects  were 
randomized  to receive either  no iron, oral iron or  IV iron.  The Hb  responses  were 
indistinguishable  between  the oral  and IV iron arms;  subjects  in the no iron arm had a similar  Hb 
response during the first [ADDRESS_2505]-line treatment in Phase  3. Starting  roxadustat  doses between  1.0 and 1.6 mg/kg appeared  
adequate to  correct  Hb in these subjects. In  addition  to Hb  response,  in this study, statistically  
significant  (p< 0.001) improvements  of 5 to 10% overall  average in the  36-Item Short  Form  
Health  Survey (SF -36) Physical  Functioning, Role physical, and  Vitality  scores,  as well  as in the  
Functional Assessment  of Cancer  Therapy -Anemia  (FACT -An) anemia  and total scores  were 
noted in the roxadustat -treated  subjects.  Significantly,  these  improvements  were more  
pronounced (33% on average and up to 100%)  in subjects  with  low BL scores (< 35), and 
improvement  was time-dependent . Also,  in this study, roxadustat transiently  lowered  total 
cholesterol by [CONTACT_2902] 20 mg/dL on average.  Importantly, highly significant low -density  
lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol  reduction was  also observed.  
Data from  a [ADDRESS_2506] subjects on dialysis  (Study  
FGCL -4592- 040) showed  the feasibility  of converting subjects  from  a stable ESA dose to  
roxadustat. In  the 6- week  dose range  portion of  this conversion  study in subjects  on HD,  a dose  
relationship  was observed f or Hb response. In subjects  dosed with roxadustat at 1 mg/kg,  the Hb  
response was  comparable  to that  in the epoetin  alfa control group, which  had a small  decline  
from  baseline in Hb levels  and a  lower  percentage  of Hb responders than did subjects receiving  
the higher  doses  of roxadustat.  In the  1.5 mg/kg  and 2.0 mg/kg  dose arms,  roxadustat produced 
an average increase in Hb  of 0.9 and 0.7 g/dL  from baseline Hb,  respectively,  and was  associated  
with a 78%  to 80% response  rate,  ie, more  than twice  that in the epoetin alfa  arm (33%). In the 
19-week  portion  of the study, Hb  maintenance  was durable  and noninferior  to epoetin alfa in the  
roxadustat  treatment  arms  (combined)  over a 19- week  period. The  roxadustat  dose  requirement  
for Hb  maintenance  was mostly  between  0.7 mg/kg  to 2.0 mg/kg  in normoresponder subjects,  
with occasional  subjects requiring doses  up to 3.0 mg/kg  TIW.  Roxadustat treatment also  
resulted in  increased  levels  of serum  iron at  the End of Treatment  (EOT)  compared  with baseline  
in the 6- week  treatment arms,  whereas  serum  iron levels  decreased from baseline in  subjects

treated  with  epoetin  alfa. Reticulocyte  Hb content  (CHr) was  better  maintained  in the pooled 
roxadustat  treatment  arm than in the pooled epoetin  alfa arm,  suggesting that functional  iron 
deficiency  does  not occur  when  treating  with  roxadustat  unaccompanied  by [CONTACT_2903]. Serum  
hepcidin was  reversibly  suppressed during roxadustat treatment.  In addition, total cholesterol  
levels  decreased  during the course  of treatment  in subjects  treated  with  roxadustat, but  were 
unchanged in  epoetin  alfa-treated  subjects.  Following discontinuation of  roxadustat  dosing,  total 
cholesterol  levels  returned  to BL at  post-treatment follow -up. 
Data from  a Phase  2 clinical  trial in China  (FGCL -4592- 048), in DD- CKD subjects, roxadustat  
was found effective for maintaining  Hb for 6 weeks. Hemoglobin  correction  and maintenance  
was dose -dependent.  Roxadustat  also transiently  lowered  total  and LDL -cholesterol by [CONTACT_2902] 20 
mg/dL on average. Serum iron levels  were  maintained  and total iron binding  capacity  (TIBC)  
increased  in roxadustat -treated  subjects  compared  with subjects  randomized  to continue  epoetin  
alfa. Other  serum  iron parameters  were not  significantly different  between  the treatment  arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ongoing  Studies  
Data from  an ongoing open -label  extension  study  (Study  FGCL -4592 -059, to which  some  
subjects  from Studies  FGCL -4592- 041 and FGCL -4592- 040 rolled  over)  further  shows  
durability  of roxadustat  effect  in maintaining  Hb levels in subjects  with CKD over 52 to 76- week  
treatment  as of  07 September  2013.  
1.4.3 Safety  
The overall frequency  and type of  treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs)  and treatment - 
emergent  serious adverse  events  (TESAEs)  observed  in these clinical studies  reflect  events  that 
would  be expected  to occur  in CKD subjects  with multiple co -morbidities  and on a number  of 
concomitant  medications.  Safety  analyses  did not  reveal  any association  between  the rates  of 
occurrence of  cardiovascular events  with  roxadustat, or  any effect  on adverse  event  (AE)  rates  
related  to either  increasing  Hb levels  or on the rate  of change of  Hb levels.  
As of [ADDRESS_2507] of  the healthy  subjects were Asian  or Caucasian,  reflecting  the 
countries  where  these  studies  were conducted  (Europe, United  Kingdom,  US, China,  and Japan). 
Most NDD- CKD and DD- CKD subjects were either  Caucasian  or African -American,  as most  
trials  for which  demographic  data are pooled were conducted in the United  States  or Eastern  
Europe. In general,  the most  commonly  reported AEs  (≥ 4% and ≥ 1%  above placebo  rate)  in 
healthy volunteers  were headache and  dizziness.  The most  commonly  reported AEs  (≥ 5%) in  
subjects  with  NDD -CKD were  diarrhea,  nausea,  urinary tract infection,  nasopharyngitis, 
peripheral edema, hyperkalemia,  headache, and hypertension (none were ≥ 8%), The  most  
commonly  reported AEs (≥ 3%) in subjects  with  DD-CKD were diarrhea,  nausea, hypertension, 
and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826]  (none  were ≥  5%). Adverse  event  rates  of hypertension (1% 
in Study  FGCL -SM4592- 017and 7.6%  in Study  FGCL -4592- 041) and thrombosis  (overall  
incidence  < 1%), compare favorably with the rates  reported  in published ESA studies in  similar  
patient  populations  (Krapf,  2009). No safety  risks  were associated  with  rate of rise of  Hb levels  
or with  achieving  an Hb  level  above  11 g/dL  using  roxadustat. Study  FGCL -4592- 041 subjects  
achieved  Hb > 11 g/dL  in > 50% of  exposure time  during study, and there were  no

cardiovascular  safety  events  (death,  myocardial infarction  [MI],  stroke, unstable  angina, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2827],  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2828])  reported  while  Hb 
> 11 g/dL  during treatment  of roxadustat.  
Supratherapeutic  doses of  roxadustat  in healthy volunteers were  associated  with an increased  
frequency of mild  to moderate  musculoskeletal  pain  and headaches,  tachycardia,  and less  
commonly, low  BP. These findings  have  not been observed at the usual  therapeutic dose range  in 
Phase  2 studies  in the target  populations.  In CKD subjects,  the observed changes  in heart  rate 
(HR) and BP were  in general  within  the normal  variations  of daily  living.  
Cumulatively,  [ADDRESS_2508]  been  reported  during roxadustat clinical studies. 
The pancreatitis  for three subjects  was associated  with cholelithiasis  or biliary sludge, confirmed  
by [CONTACT_2904]; all three subjects  underwent  cholecystectomy  with complete resolution  
postoperatively. One  subject  was found to have a  pancreatic duct  stricture.  One of the [ADDRESS_2509]  is available  in 
the IB. 
Of note, cholelithiasis is  reported  to be more  common  in subjects  with  CKD compared with  the 
general  population, with a prevalence as high as  20% (Li  Vecchi,  2003;  Gladziwa,  1993). 
Furthermore,  a higher  incidence of  pancreatitis in  patients  with  type 2 diabetes  mellitus,  and 
hence CKD,  has been well  described  in the  literature.  No increased  cancer risk  has been  noted 
with roxadustat treatment;  however,  the study program  was not powered  to detect  absence of  
cancer  risk.  
Liver  parameters  were monitored  closely  throughout  the roxadustat clinical development  
program. Increases  in liver parameters  were infrequently  seen,  and were generally  mild and 
transient in  nature. No  cases  of Hy’s  Law were observed throughout  the program. An  
independent data and safety  monitoring  committee  concluded that there was  no concern  for 
hepatotoxicity  with  roxadustat.  Based  on the safety  data collecte d to date,  roxadustat  is generally  
well tolerated  and has an  acceptable safety  profile that supports  its further development.  
In summary,  the cumulative  safety  data have not  identified  major  risks  related  to roxadustat. At 
therapeutic doses, roxadustat is well tolerated  by [CONTACT_2905].  
Potential  additional  benefits  of roxadustat compared  with  ESAs  for the treatment  of NDD -CKD  
and DD- CKD anemia  include  efficacy  without the  need for IV iron supplementation, and a  
favorable  change  in lipid  profile.  
Taking into  account  the general  measures  taken  to minimize  risk to subjects  participating  in the  
Phase  [ADDRESS_2510]  current  version of  the IB.  
1.5 Summary  
In summary,  roxadustat  is an orally  active  HIF-PHI with  erythropoietic  effects.  Intermittent 
dosing of  roxadustat  results  in transient  activation  of HIF,  intermittent induction  of endogenous  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2511] that  roxadustat is generally  safe and  well  
tolerated  in healthy  adult  subjects,  and in dialysis  and nondialysis  CKD subjects  with  anemia  
treated  up to 60 weeks.  
1.6 Roxadustat  Dose  Rationale  
Starting  doses  of roxadustat were studied  in three ways  in the  Phase  2 program:  using a strict  
weight -based  dosing approach that was useful  in the proof  of concept stage;  using a tiered  
weight -based  approach  where  a subject’s starting  dose was  selected  based  on categorizing  the 
subject’s  body weight  as low (45 to < 70 kg), medium  (70 to 100 kg), or  heavy (> 100 kg); and 
using an absolute  starting  dose regardless  of body weight. The tiered  weight -based  approach has  
been chosen  for the development  of roxadustat in the Phase [ADDRESS_2512] of  the following roxadustat  
doses: 70, and  100 mg,  for low  weight  (≤ 70 kg), and high weight (> 70 to  160 kg) subjects,  
respectively.  These  dose  tiers are based  primarily  on the interim safety  and efficacy  data 
generated  in the CKD nondialysis Correction  of anemia  study (FGCL -4592 -041) and confirmed  
by [CONTACT_2906]. These  doses will  be administered  at a frequency of  TIW.  Using  this dosing 
scheme,  subjects will receive  starting  roxadustat doses between  0.9 mg/kg  TIW  for the heaviest  
subject,  and 1.6 mg/kg  TIW for  the lightest subject.  This is comparable  to the starting  doses of  
1.0 to 1.6 mg/kg,  which  were the doses  that effectively  corrected  Hb levels  in studies  
FGCL -4592- [ADDRESS_2513]  
anemia will  be able to maintain  Hb levels  with  a total  weekly  dose reduction  of the order of  22 to 
35%. This  dose  reduction  can be achieved  by [CONTACT_2907]-defined  Hb target  range.  The Phase  [ADDRESS_2514]  and maintain  Hb levels within  treatment  thresholds  based on 
absolute  Hb levels  and change of  Hb in the previous  4 weeks.  Additional rules for dose  
adjustment were provided to minimize  excessive hematopoiesis.  These  dose  adjustment  rules  
were successful  in Hb  Correction  and Hb Maintenance  and will  be adopted  in this  study  with  
minor  modifications.  
1.7 Risks/Benefits  of Roxadustat  Treatment 
The primary  benefit  of roxadustat  is the treatment  of anemia,  including  the relief of associated  
signs and symptoms  and an increased  quality  of life. Roxadustat is expected  to be  at least  as safe 
as ESAs, and the current data suggest  that cardiovascular  risk may be lower  than with  ESAs.  
An established  dose adjustment  algorithm  will be used during the study to titrate  roxadustat  
doses to enable subjects to achieve and  maintain  optimal Hb  levels, while closely  monitoring  the 
rate of  rise of Hb  levels. Roxadustat doses may  be held and/or  the use of  therapeutic phlebotomy 
is allowed  in the event  of excessive hematopoiesis.  Adverse  and serious adverse events  (SAEs),  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2515]  (DSMB)  
will perform regular,  periodic  assessments  of safety data to detect  any potential safety  signals  
that may  arise  during the study and advise  the Sponsor  accordingly.  
Based  on the clinical  and nonclinical  trial results to date,  it is anticipated  that orally  administered  
roxadustat will  be comparable in efficacy  to marketed  parenteral  ESA products in the treatment 
of anemia of CKD,  with  an acceptable safety  profile. Roxadustat  may offer a valuable alternative  
to the current  treatment  options in the management  of anemia  of CKD.

3 STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1 Description  of the Study  
This is a Phase  3, multicenter,  randomized, open -label,  and active -controlled study to evaluate 
the efficacy  and safety  of roxadustat  in the  treatment  of anemia  in incident -dialysis  subjects.  
The study periods  are as follows:  
• Screening  Period:  Up to 6 weeks  
• Treatment Period:  Treatment  duration is variable  for individual  subjects.  In order  to 
complete  the Treatment  Period  simultaneously  for all study subjects,  the minimum treatment 
duration may be less  than [ADDRESS_2516]  
4 weeks  prior  to their treatment period end.  
• Post-Treatment  Follow -Up Period:  4 weeks  
3.2 Randomization  and Treatment  Assignment  
A total of  up to approximately  1200 subjects  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to receive either  
open- label  roxadustat  or epoetin  alfa (Appendix  1). 
Randomization  is stratified  by [CONTACT_2908]:  
• Geographical  region  
• Screening  Hb values ( ≤ 8 g/dL  vs. >  8 g/dL)  
• Cardiovascular/cerebrovascular/thromboembolic  medical  history  (Yes  vs. No) 
Randomization  schedules  will be prospectively prepared. Automated  randomization  and 
treatment  assignments  will be  provided by [CONTACT_2909]  
(IXRS).  
3.[ADDRESS_2517] study drug administration  will be on Day  1 (Week  0).

3.5.2 Starting  Dose  of Study  Drug  
[IP_ADDRESS] Roxadustat  Arm  
For subjects receiving  roxadustat,  the initial  dose (per dose  amount)  is based  on a tiered,  weight - 
based dosing scheme  (Table  1). Roxadustat  will be dosed orally  TIW  throughout the Treatment  
Period,  except  if a subject  requires  < 20 mg  TIW  (ie, < 60 mg  per week) to maintain  Hb levels  in 
the Maintenance Phase,  the dosing frequency should  be reduced  in a step -wise fashion  eg, TIW  
to BIW,  BIW to QW,  QW  to Q -2 Week  etc. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Active Control  Arm  (Epoetin alfa) 
Subjects  on HD will  initiate  intravenous  (IV)  treatment  according  to the epoetin  alfa US Package 
Insert  (USPI)  or Summary  of Product  Characteristics  (SmPC).  
For subjects on HHD or  PD, epoetin  alfa will be administered  according  to the epoetin  USPI,  or 
SmPC or local  stand ard-of-care.  
For countries  using prefilled  syringes, the initial epoetin  alfa dose and dose  adjustments should 
be approximated to  the closest  weekly  dose.

Note:  Weight in HD subjects  = subject’s  dry weight.  
 
3.5.3 Dose  Adjustment for Roxadustat  
Dose  adjustments  will occur in two separate study  dosing phases: the Correction  Phase  and the 
Maintenance Phase.  Each  of these phases will follow unique  adjustment  rules  according  to 
Appendix  2. 
All subjects will  be dosed  orally  TIW during the  Treatment  period. The maximum roxadustat  
dose is 3.0 mg/kg per dose  or 400 mg (whichever  is lower).  
All dose adjustments  as well as assessments of  excessive hematopoiesis  are based on Hb values  
using a point -of-care device,  such  as HemoCue® or CritLine®. In the event  that the central  lab Hb  
value of  the site visit  is significantly  different  and the dose adjustment  decision based  on the  
HemoCue® / CritLine® value  is being re-considered, the Medical  Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  if 
possible. 
The determination  of Hb response and  transition  from  the Correction  to the Maintenance Phase  
of the study is based on the central laboratory  Hb value.

[IP_ADDRESS] Correction  Phase  of Dosing for Roxadustat  
• The aim of the Correction  Phase  is to  increase Hb  levels  from baseline  to the target  Hb 
level by [CONTACT_2910] 2.  
• . This  phase  is variable  in length for each subject.  
• Dose  adjustment  reviews  will occur on Week  4, and at intervals  of every  4 weeks  
thereafter  (Weeks  8, 12, 16, etc.), except  in the event of  excessive hematopoiesis, in  
which  case doses may  be adjusted  at any time.  In such cases,  dose adjustment  reviews  are 
resum ed at 4- week  intervals.  For example,  if the subject’s  Hb increases  > 2.0 g/dL  from  
Week  [ADDRESS_2518]’s  dose  is reduced  by [CONTACT_2911]  3. The  next  
dose adjustment  review  should occur  4 weeks  later at Week 7 and at 4- week  intervals  
thereafter.  
• If the dose adjustment  interval  falls  on a non -study visit week  (starting  Week  4), the dose  
adjustment review should be performed  at the next scheduled  study visit if a dose  
adjustment was not required  at the previous  visit.  For example,  if a subject’s  visit is 
scheduled for Weeks  6 and 8, and the  dose adjustment  would  occur at  Week  7, then the  
dose adjustment  should be evaluated  at the Week  8 visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Maintenance  Phase  of Dosing  for Roxadustat  
• The aim of the Maintenance  Phase  is to maintain  Hb levels after  the initial correction  by 
[CONTACT_2912]  2. 
Note:  Note: Given  the complexity  in roxadustat  dose adjustments,   and  the need to  take into  
account  the various clinical  parameters  in roxadustat  dose titration,  one would  not consider it a  
protocol  deviation  when  study subjects  are dosed  based on their  clinical circumstances,  whether  
or not it is  concordant  with   the roxadustat  dose adjustment  guidelines  unless  it was related  to 
“excessive hematopoiesis”   (eg, Hb  ≥ 13 g/dL,  requir ing a dose  hold) or “Overdose”  (prescribed  
>3.0 mg/kg per dose or  400 mg  per dose whichever  is lower).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Active Control  (Epoetin alfa) Subjects  
Epoetin alfa  subjects  should maintain  their Hb levels  within  the target  range  accepted  by [CONTACT_2913],  specifically:  
• Hb 10 to 11 g/dL  in the  United  States  (US)  
• Hb 10 to 12 g/dL  in countries  outside the US  
Hemodialysis  subjects  will be dosed  IV TIW,  with starting  doses  and dose  adjustment rules  
according  to the epoetin alfa USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808].  In subjects requiring ultra -low dose of  EPO (eg,  
≤1000 IU/per  week),  frequency  of administration  may  be adjusted per  local  standard of care.  
Home -hemodialysis  and peritoneal  dialysis subjects  will be dosed  according  to the epoetin 
Package Insert  or the SmPC or local standard of  care.  
For countries  using prefilled  syringes, the initial epoetin  alfa dose and dose  adjustments should 
be approximated to  the closest  weekly  dose. 
Note: Given  the complexity  in EPO  dose adjustments  and the need to take into account  the 
various clinical parameters  in EPO dose titration,  one would not consider it a protocol deviation 
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2519] of  care whether  or not  it is 
concordant with  package  insert/SmPC  
ESA administration  in roxadustat  subjects  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2829]  a protocol  
deviation  if roxadustat  is not allowed  or available during that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Excessive  Hematopoiesis  
For subjects randomized  to Roxadustat,  the following scenarios  are defined  as “excessive 
hematopoiesis”  
• Hb increases  by > 2.0 g/dL at any time  within  a 4 week  period:  reduce  the dose by [CONTACT_2914]. 
• Hb reaches  or exceeds  13 g/dL:  hold  dosing, check  Hb weekly.  Resume  dosing when  
Hb < 12.0 g/dL  (for US subjects  central  lab Hb  value  preferred),  at a dose that  is reduced  
by [CONTACT_2915].  
For subjects on prolonged dose -hold, with stable (not droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  Hb, the Investigator  may 
use discretion to schedule  less frequent  visits.  
Anytime Hb  is assessed  via HemoCue®/CritLine®/local  lab, a central lab Hb should be  
obtained as well.  
3.6 Concomitant  Medications,  Procedures  and Nondrug  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
3.6.1 Concomitant  Medications  
Concomitant  medications  are any prescription  or over -the-counter  preparations, including  herbal  
products and  “natural  remedies”,  used by a subject  while  participating  in this  clinical  study.  
For all concomitant  medication  use, an in dication  for its use  should be provided. If  the stated  
indication  is a nonspecific  condition (eg,  “rash”)  documentation  of the condition, as specific  as 
possible, should be maintained  in the  subject’s clinical  study  records  as source  documentation. 
To avoid confounding  effects  on study endpoints,  changes to  anti-hypertensive  medications  
should be minimized,  and made only if  deemed  medically  necessary  by [CONTACT_2916].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Use of Phosphate  Binders  During the Study  (Roxadustat  Subjects)  
When  coadministered  with roxadustat, in a clinical  pharmacology  study,  the bioavailability of  
roxadustat was  reduced.  Subjects  should  be advised  to discuss  with  the Investigator  when  
changing the  dose or dosing time  of their  phosphate  binder  while taking roxadustat. To  optimize  
the absorption of  roxadustat, subjects should be advised  that roxadustat  be taken at  least  one hour  
before  or three  hours after  their  phosphate  binder  if possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Use of Hydroxymethylglutaryl  Coenzyme  A (HMG -CoA) Reductase  Inhibitors  
(Statins) During  the Study  (Roxadustat  Subjects)  
When  coadministered  with roxadustat, in clinical  pharmacolgical  studies,  hydroxymethylglutaryl  
coenzyme A reductase inhibitor  (statin)  exposure  was increased  2- to 3- fold. For  patients  
randomized  to roxadustat, investigators  should consider this  interaction  and local prescribing  
information when  deciding on the appropriate  statin  dose for individual  patients,  bearing  in mind  
the impact  of ethnicity,  other  concomitant  medications,  renal and hepatic function.  Goals  of lipid

for both study  arms.  In addition to the  scheduled  assessments (Appendix 3), iron indices  may be 
assessed  at any  time  (via central  lab) to evaluate iron storage  status  of the subjects, if  considered  
necessary  by [CONTACT_737].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral Iron Supplementation  
All subjects should be encouraged  to take oral  iron as the first -line iron supplementation  during 
the Treatment  Period, except  subjects  not tolerating  oral iron. The dose and  frequency are at  the 
discretion  of the Investigator. Oral  iron supplementation  should be started  before  the subject  
becomes  iron depleted.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Intravenous  Iron  Supplementation 
Intravenous iron supplementation is  permitted  if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2831]’s  
Hb has not responded adequately  and the subject is  considered  iron deficient.  
Treatment  with  study medication  will continue  during IV  iron administration.  Discontinuation  
of IV iron is  recommended  once the  subject  is no longer deemed  iron deficient  (eg, ferritin  
≥ 100 ng/ml  [≥ 220 pmol/L],  TSAT  ≥ 20%) and has evidence  of a hematopoi etic response. 
Note:  IV iron administration  in study  subjects  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2832] a protocol

The use of  ESAs  is not permitted  during the Treatment  Period,  except  if all of the following  
criteria  are met:  
• A subject’s Hb  level has  not responded  adequately  despi[INVESTIGATOR_2834] 
• Other  causes  for lack of  response or declining Hb,  such as iron  deficiency, bleeding, 
acute inflammatory  conditions, have been ruled  out 
• Reducing  risk of alloimmunization  in transplant eligible  patients  is a goal. 
Roxadustat and ESA  may  not be co -administered.  Treatment  with  an approved ESA may  be 
initiated  ≥ [ADDRESS_2521] roxadustat  dose. 
If the situation  permits,  the Investigator  should inform  the Medical  Monitor  prior  to initiation  of 
ESA therapy. 
Subjects  may receive one  course  of ESA rescue during the  Treatment  Period. 
Erythropoiesis -stimulating  agen t rescue should stop after  4 weeks  or once Hb  exceeds  9 g/dL, 
whichever  occurs  first.  If a subject  requires  more  than 4 weeks  of ESA rescue therapy  due to 
inadequate Hb  response,  the Medical  Monitor  should  be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Treatment  with  roxadustat  may  resume  after the following intervals:  
• Two days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2814] 
• One week  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2815] 
• Two weeks  after  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2816] -epoetin  beta (Mircera®) 
If more  than  one course  of ESA rescue is required  during the Treatment Period, the subject  must  
be discontinued permanently from  the study, and  is considered  a Treatment  Failure.

allowed  to continue  on study, if  considered  safe by [CONTACT_2917].  
3.6.4 Therapeutic  Phlebotomy  
If there are clinical  concerns  of excessive  elevation  of Hb levels, the  Investigator  may decide to 
perform  a therapeutic  phlebotomy in addition  to a dose hold. This should be discussed  with the 
Medical  Monitor and documented.

3.6.[ADDRESS_2522]  agree to practice a dual  method  of contraception,  
for example,  a combination of  the following:  (1) oral contraceptive, depo progesterone, or  
intrauterine device;  and (2) a barrier method  (condom  or diaphragm).  Male subjects  with  female  
partners  of childbearing  potential  who are not using  birth  control  as described  above must  use a 
barrier  method  of contraception  (eg, condom)  if not surgically sterile (ie,  vasectomy).  
Contraceptive  methods  must  be practiced  upon entering  the study  and through  [ADDRESS_2523]  be reported  
(Section  9.3.6 ). 
In female subjects  of childbearing potential,  serum pregnancy te st will  be done per Schedule of  
Assessments (Appendix  3) to rule  out pregnancy. Pregnancy  test is not  required  for female  
subjects  of no childbearing  potential eg, postmenopausal  (determination whether  a woman  is 
post-menopausal is at  the discretion  of the Investigator), surgically  sterile etc..  
3.[ADDRESS_2524]  will be 
established  through demographics, medical  history,  clinical laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  
physical  examinations  (PEs),  and electrocardiogram  (ECGs).  During  the course  of the study, 
vital signs, complete  and targeted  PEs, and laboratory  tests will be performed  at regular intervals.  
A comprehensive  PE will  be conducted during the Screening  visit, Day 1 and at the  End of Study  
(EOS)  visit.  A targeted PE (general  appearance,  cardiovascular,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2836])  will be 
conducted throughout  the study as  described  in Schedule of  Assessments  (Appendix  3). 
Any significant  findings prior  to administration  of study drug will  be considered as baseline  
conditions  and if appropriate,  will be captured  as baseline medical  history. Any medically  
significant  changes  from baseline  will be monitored  throughout  the study  and appropriate  
interventions  will be taken  accordingly.  Clinical laboratory  tests may  be assessed  at additional

according  to Drug -Induced Liver Injury  (DILI)  guidance (Appendix 4) . 
Adverse  events, SAEs,  and ongoing concomitant  medication  usage will  be monitored and  
recorded  throughout  the study. Serious  adverse event  reports will  be evaluated  individually  to 
assess for the  impact  of the event,  if any, on the  overall  safety  of the product and on the study 
itself.  Cumulative  AEs will be monitored  throughout  the study.  Serious adverse events  and AEs  
will be followed  until  resolved, stable,  or until  the subject’s  EOS visit. See Section  9 for  details  
on AE and SAE reporting.  
An Independent Event Review Committee  (IERC),  blinded to treatment  group, will  adjudicate  
prespecified  cardiovascular,  cerebrovascular,  and thromboembolic  safety events  of interest.  
These events  include  death  from  any cause, MI,  stroke, congestive  heart  failure  requiring  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  deep  venous thrombosis,  pulmonary

5.1 Formulation  
Roxadustat is  supplied by  [CONTACT_2918], Inc. as red  coated, oval  tablets  for oral administration,  in 
strengths  of 20 mg,  50 mg  and 100 mg. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_2838],  
microcrystalline  cellulose,  povidone, croscarmellose sodium,  magnesium stearate,  and color ant 
Red Opadry 2. All  ingredients  used for manufacture of  roxadustat comply with  US and European 
Union compendial  or regulatory  standards.  Strengths  are different in size,  and debossing  reflects  
the strength  (ie, 20, 50 or  100 mg).  Due  to the light -sensitive nature of  roxadustat  and to 
minimize  exposure of  the active pharmaceutical  ingredient  to light,  tablets should remain  in the 
original  packaging for  as long as possible and be  administered  as intact tablets  only.  
5.2 Storage  
Roxadustat tablets  should be protected  from  light, and stored  at 15º  to 30ºC (59º –86ºF).  
Epoetin alfa  should be stored  according  to the USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2808].  
All study drug (roxadustat  and epoetin alfa)  should  be stored  in a securely  locked area to  which  
access  is limited  to appropriately  qualified  and authorized  study personnel.  
Handling and  disposition  of unused study drug is  described  in the site Drug  Accountability  
Binder.

Epoetin alfa  will be administered  IV TIW  according  to the Package Insert or SmPC by 
[CONTACT_2919]. In subjects  requiring  ultra -low dose of  EPO (eg, ≤1000 
IU/week),  the frequency of administration  may be adjusted  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_2839].  
For countries  provided with prefilled  syringes, the initial epoetin alfa  dose and dose  adjustments  
should be approximated to the closest calculated  total weekly  dose.

5.4 Overdose,  Emergency  Procedures  and Management  of Overdose  
The maximum tolerated  dose of  roxadustat has  not been established  in humans. For the purpose  
of this study, the maximum  allowed  roxadustat  dose is set  at 3.0 mg/kg/dose  or 3.5 mg/kg/dose  
from  the original  protocol  (based on dry weight in  subjects  on HD and normal  weight  in subjects  
on HHD and  PD) or 400 mg per administration,  whichever  is lower.  Any dosing exceeding  the 
maximum allowed  roxadustat  dose should  be reported  within  24 hours.  
The Medical Monitor  should be contact[CONTACT_2921]. Symptoms  associated  with  
overdosing, if any, will be reported  as AEs.  An overdose without  associated  symptoms  is not an  
AE and will be recorded  on the dosing case report form  (CRF)  only.  
In the event of  suspected  roxadustat overdose, the  subject  should receive supportive care and  
monitoring. The Sponsor’s  Medical Monitor  should be contact[CONTACT_2922].  
In the event of  suspected  epoetin  alfa overdose, refer  to the  epoetin alfa  USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_2840].

6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Study  Procedures  by [CONTACT_2923],  unless  otherwise indicated,  it is preferred  that all  assessments  including labs  
and PEs  be completed  predialysis  for subjects  on HD. For subjects  on HHD and PD,  assessments  
may be completed  at any  time  during the visit,  but preferably  approximately  at the same time of 
the day at  each  study visit.  Quality of  life assessments  should be administered  approximately at  
the same time of the day. For example,  in subjects  on HD,  these assessments should be  
completed  approximately  at the  same time during dialysis  and in subjects on HHD/PD 
approximately at  the same  time  of the day. Weight  assessment  in HD subjects should be  done  
after dialysis  (dry weight).  Blood  pressure  and HR should be  assessed  according  to the 
guidelines  described  in Appendix 5.  
. 
6.1.1 Screening  Period (Up to  6 Weeks)  
Subjects  must  have a signed  written  informed consent before  any screening  tests or  assessments  
are performed.  For all screen  failures, the reason(s)  will be documented.  Subjects  will undergo at  
least two screening  visits to determine eligibility,  at least two  days apart.  All assessments and  
their timing  are outlined in Appendix  3.

6.3 Unscheduled  Visits 
Unscheduled visit(s) and  laboratory  assessments may be required at  the discretion of  the 
Investigator. Please  refer to the CRF Completion  Guidelines  located  in the  Study  Reference 
Manual for additional information . 
6.[ADDRESS_2542]  management  is dependent upon close review  of the 
laboratory  data.  
6.4.1 HemoCue® / CritLine® 
Hemoglobin values obtained  by [CONTACT_2929] -of-care devices such  as HemoCue® or CritLine® are used  
to allow “real -time”  dose adjustments  for all subjects.  HemoCue®/ CritLine® results will  be 
collected  in the CRF.  Anytime  an Hb  is obtained via such a point -of-care device,  a central  lab Hb 
should be obtained as well,  either  as part of  the regular  visit labs, or anytime  when  a point -of- 
care Hb  is obtained at unscheduled  visits,  such as during dose -hold for excessive hematopoiesis.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_2543],  local  laboratory  (ie, “stat” labs, [LOCATION_003])  test results  may  be used to 
make the necessary  clinical judgments. In all  such cases, a central  lab specimen  should be  
obtained at the  same  time.

6.7 Health  Related  Quality of Life Questionnaires 
All study subjects  will be required  to complete  the following HRQoL questionnaires: SF -36, 
FACT -An, and EQ -5D-5L. 
6.7.1 36-Item  Short  Form Health Survey  
The 36-Item Short  Form Health Survey is a HRQoL instrument  designed  to assess generic health  
concepts  relevant  across age, disease,  and treatment groups. It is aimed  at both adults  and 
adolescents ages 18 years  and older. The SF-36 consists of  8 domains  of health  status:  physica l 
functioning (PF) (10 items),  role physical  (4 items),  bodily pain (2 items),  general  health  
(5 items),  vitality  (4 items),  social functioning (2  items),  role emotional  (3 items)  and mental  
health  (5 items).  Two  component  scores,  the Physical  Component  Scores and the Mental  
Component  Summary  can also be calculated.  For both the SF -[ADDRESS_2546] -An 
The Functional  Assessment  of Cancer  Therapy- General  (FACT -G; Version  4) cont ains 27 items  
that cover  four  dimensions  of well -being:  physical  (7 items),  functional (7 items),  social/family  
(7 items),  and emotional  (6 items).  A subscale of  13 fatigue  specific  items  plus 7 additional  items  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2547] -G (Yellen,  1997).  The 
[ADDRESS_2548] -An has a recall  period  of the ‘past seven  days’. Respondents  are asked to provide  
responses, (ie, ‘Not  at all’, ‘A little  bit’, ‘Somewhat’,  ‘Quite  a bit’ and ‘Very  much’), to a list  of 
statements  which  are either  positively  or negatively phrased. For all FACT -An scales,  a higher  
score indicates  better  QoL.  
6.7.3 European  Quality  of Life  Questionnaire  in 5 Dimensions  
The EQ- 5D-5L consists of the EQ -5D descriptive  system  and the EQ visual  analog  scale.  The 
EQ-5D-5L descriptive  system  comprises  5 dimensions  of health:  mobility,  self-care,  usual  
activities,  pain/discomfort,  and anxiety/depression.  Each  dimension  has 5 levels:  no problems, 
slight problems, moderate  problems, severe problems, extreme problems. The  visual  analog  scale  
records  the respondent's  self-rated  health  status  on a graduated (0 –100) scale,  where the  
endpoints  are labeled  ‘Best  imaginable  health  state’  and ‘Worst  imaginable  health  state’  with  
higher scores  for higher  HRQoL.  EQ-5D-5L health  states,  defined  by [CONTACT_2930]-5D-5L descriptive  
system,  may  be converted into a single  summary  index by [CONTACT_2931] a formula  that essentially  
attaches  values  (also  called  weights) to  each of  the levels  in each dimension.

7.4 Safety  Assessments  and Endpoints  
Study -specific safety  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_2889]:  
• TEAEs,  TESAEs,  and clinically  significant laboratory values  from  baseline 
• Vital signs,  ECG  findings  and clinical laboratory values  
Safety  interpretation  will also be  made based on analyses of  composite  endpoints derived from  
adjudicated  events pooled across multiple  studies in the  roxadustat  Phase 3 program. The  
members  of an independent  adjudication  committee  blinded to treatment  assignment  will 
adjudicate the following  events  in multiple  phase 3 studies:  
• Death  from any cause,  MI, stroke, congestive  heart  failure req uiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
unstable  angina  requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], hypertensive  emergency,  deep venous  
thrombosis, pulmonary  embolism,  and vascular  access  thrombosis.  
• Various  region- specific pooled analyses  of composites  of these  adjudicated  events,  
pooled across  multiple  studies  will be conducted. The analyses  of the adjudicated  events  
will be detailed  in the region- specific pooled SAPs.  
For US (FDA)  Only : The primary  safety  endpoint  in this  study  is the Major  Adverse Cardiac 
Event  (MACE)  composite  endpoint, defined as time  to first  occurrence of  death from all causes,  
MI, or stroke,  for the purpose  of being pooled across  multiple  similar  studies  in the Phase  3 
program. None of  the individual  studies  are powered  to meet  the MACE primary  safety endpoint  
individually. The pooled MACE analysis is only for purposes  of supporting a US FDA  
regulatory  filing  of roxadustat.  
The above adjudicated  safety  events  may also be used to support  the pooled analyses of  
additional  composite  safety  endpoints  across multiple  studies in the Phase 3 program, such as  
MACE+  (death, MI, stroke, congestive  heart  failure  requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  and unstable  
angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]),  or a composite  which  consists  of all of  the adjudicated  events.

8 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 Sample  Size Determination  
The sample  size calculation  is based  on the primary  endpoint for  both the  US (FDA)  submission 
and Ex -US submission. 
At least  [ADDRESS_2551] (ie, all -cause death, MI, stroke, congestive  heart  failure  
requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  unstable  angina  requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], DVT,  pulmonary  embolism,  
vascular  access  thrombosis, and hypertensive  emergency).  The final  number  of patients  to be  
enrolled  will be based on the enrollment  rate of  other  studies within  the same  indication,  in order  
to optimize stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2849] a comparable  time frame.  
With  at least  [ADDRESS_2552]  99% power  to demonstrate statistical 
noninferiority of  roxadustat versus  ESA in the primary  endpoint for  US (FDA)  submission 
(ie, specifically,  Hb change  from  baseline to the  average level  during the evaluation  period  
defined as  Week  28 until Week  52). This  assumes  a difference  (roxadustat  minus  ESA)  of 
0.30 g/dL,  a noninferiority margin  for this difference of  0.75 g/dL  and a standard deviation of  
1.25 g/dL.  This endpoint will  be analyzed  using the ITT population for  the US (FDA)  
submission.  
The study will  provide at  least  99% power  to demonstrate  statistical noninferiority of  roxadustat  
versus ESA in the primary  endpoint outside of  the United  States  (ie, the proportion of  subjects  
who achieve a Hb  response  at two consecutive  visits  during the first 24 weeks  of treatment).  This  
assumes a 80% responder  rate for  both  roxadustat  and epoetin  alfa,  in order  to support the  
primary  efficacy  analysis  (ie, a noninferiority comparison  in responder  rate between  roxadustat  
and epoetin  alfa) and assuming  a noninferiority  margin of -15% for this difference (roxadustat  
minus  epoetin alfa).  This  endpoint will  be analyzed  using the PPS population for the European 
Medicines Agency  (EMA)  submission. 
Randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_2935]:  
1. Geographical  region  (US vs. Ex -US) 
2. Screening  Hb values (≤ 8 g/dL  vs. >  8 g/dL)  
3. Cardiovascular/cerebrovascular/thromboembolic  medical  history  (yes vs. no). 
8.2 Analysis  Populations 
The following  analysis populations will  be used  for the statistical  analysis:  
• Safety  Population:  The Safety  Population  consists  of all subjects  who  received  at least 
one dose of  study treatment.  All safety  data will be tabulated  using descriptive  statistics.  
If treatment  received  during the study  differs  from the  randomize d treatment,  the actual  
treatment  arm will be used  for the analysis.

FibroGen,  Inc. Confidential and Proprietary  Page 77  
  
 
• Intent -to-Treat  population:  The ITT population  consists  of all randomized  subjects. The  
primary  efficacy  endpoint  for the US (FDA)  submission  will be analyzed  using this  
population. In  addition, the superiority  comparison  of this endpoint  for the US (FDA)  
submission  will be performed  using this population  as well.  
• Full Analysis  Set: The FAS consists  of all subjects  who  receive at least  one dose  of study  
drug and have  at least  one postdose  Hb assessment.  If treatment  received  differs  from  the 
randomized  treatment,  the randomized  treatment  arm will be used. Efficacy  analysis  for 
superiority will be conducted  on the FAS population for the  EMA submission.  
• Per Protocol Set:  The PPS consists of  all randomized  subjects who received  at least  [ADDRESS_2553]  one postdose  Hb assessment  and are without  
major  protocol violations.  Criteria  for PPS exclusion  will be defined  in the  Statistical 
Analysis  Plan (SAP).  Non -inferiority  analyses for the EMA submission  will be based  on 
the PPS.  
8.[ADDRESS_2554]  an interim data cut.. 
Safety  data and dosing decisions  will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Additional  ongoing 
review  of safety  data will be conducted by [CONTACT_2936] ( Section  3.8). 
8.4 Statistical  Analysis 
Safety  and efficacy  data will be summarized  and presented  by [CONTACT_2937]. Descriptive statistics  including  number  of subjects  (N), means,  standard  
deviations, medians,  and minimum  and maximum values will  be presented  for continuous  
variables.  Counts  and percentages  will be presented  for categorical  variables.  For efficacy  
endpoints, the standard error and 95%  CIs will be presented  as part of  the descriptive summaries.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_2555]  Enrollment  and Disposition  
A table will provide  the number  of randomized  subjects  (ITT), treated  subjects  (Safety  
population), FAS and PPS subjects  and subjects who terminated  the Treatment  Period/study  
early  along with the reason  for ET. 
8.4.2 Demographics  and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographics  (age,  race, sex), baseline characteristics  including  stratification  factors,  and 
subject  disease  characteristics  will be summarized  for the Safety,  ITT,  FAS and PPS populations.  
Descriptive statistics  will be calculated for  continuous  variables  (eg, age,  weight,  baseline Hb,  
body mass  index) and frequency counts  and percentages  will be tabulated  for categorical  
variables (eg,  sex, race,  Hb category, region, iron status,  and history of  cardiovascular  disease  or 
cerebrovascular  disease) by [CONTACT_2938].  
8.4.3 Efficacy  Analyses  
Efficacy  analysis for superiority will be conducted  on the ITT  population for  US (FDA)  
submission  and on the FAS population  for Ex-US submission.

Efficacy  analysis for non-inferiority  will be conducted  on the ITT population  for US (FDA)  
submission  and on the PPS population for Ex-US submission.  
Hemoglobin  results  obtained from  the central  laboratory  will be used for  all efficacy  analyses.  
Baseline  Hb is defined as  the mean  of at least  three  central laboratory  Hb values:  the last two 
screening  Hb values prior  to randomization plus the one predose  Hb value  on Day  1 of the 
Treatment  Period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Efficacy  Analysis  
US (FDA)  Submission: The  primary  efficacy  endpoint for US (FDA)  submission  is defined as  
the mean  Hb change from baseline to  the average  level  during the Evaluation  Period,  defined as  
Week  28 until Week  52. The analysis will  be based  on the ITT  population. Hb values under  the 
influence  of rescue therapy will  not be censored  for the primary  efficacy  analysis.  
The primary  hypothesis  to be tested  for the primary  efficacy  analysis is: 
H0: Hb mean  change from baseline  to the average  level  from  Week 28  to Week 52  in the  
roxadustat arm ≤ Hb mean change from baseline  in the epoetin alfa arm  minus  0.75 g/dL  
Versus:  
H1: Hb change from  baseline to the  average level  of Week 28 to Week 52 in the  
roxadustat arm > Hb  mean change from baseline  in the epoetin alfa arm  minus  0.75 g/dL  
A Multiple  Imputation  Analysis  of Covariance (MI ANCOVA)  model  will be used for the  
primary  endpoint (change  from  baseline in Hb from  Week  28 to Week  52). 
The model  will contain  terms  for treatment  arm,  baseline  Hb measurement,   and randomization  
stratification  factors,  except  for Screening  Hb values  (< 8g/dL vs. > 8g/dL).  Detailed  analysis  of 
the primary  [efficacy] endpoint will  be outlined  in the SAP.  The primary  efficacy  analysis  for  
US [FDA] and sensitivity  analysis  for the first  secondary  endpoint  for ex -US submissions  will be 
based on the  estimated  difference between  the two  treatment  arms  of the overall  mean  effects  
throughout  the evaluation  period based  on the MI  ANCOVA model.  
In addition, as a sensitivity  analysis, the primary  efficacy  endpoint for  US [FDA] and primary  
analysis  for the first  secondary  endpoint  for ex -US submissions  will be analyzed  using  the 
analysis  of a model  for repeat  measures  (MMRM).  The MMRM  model  will contain  terms  for 
baseline  Hb, as covariate,  treatment  arm, visit,  visits  by [CONTACT_2890],  and randomization  
stratification  factors  (except  for Screening  Hb values  (,< 8g/dL vs > 8g/dL)  as fixed effects.  
Additional  analysis  using pattern  mixture  approaches  would  be detailed  in the SAP.  
Due to the large  amount  of visits to include  in the model, the unstructured covariance pattern  
model  will be tested  against  the less parameterized  heterogeneous  Toeplitz  structure using the 
likelihood  ratio  test for nested  models. If  the algorithm  for unstructured covariance pattern  does  
not converge  or the  likelihood  ratio  test is not  statistically  significant then heterogeneous  
Toeplitz  structure  will be used. If  this second model  does not  converge  either,  then  the 
(homogeneous)  Toeplitz structure  will be tried  and finally  compound  symmetry  as a covariance 
structure to achieve convergence.  
This null hypothesis  will be rejected  if the two -sided  95% CI for  the difference  (roxadustat  
minus  epoetin alfa)  of two least square  means  from  the mixed  model  lies entirely  above  –0.75 
g/dL.

Hb values under  the influence of  a rescue therapy will not be censored  in the primary  analysis.  
Ex–US Submission:  The primary  efficacy  endpoint  for Ex-US submission  is defined  as the 
proportion of subjects who  achieve a  Hb response  at two  consecutive  visits  during the first 24 
weeks  of treatment,  without  rescue  therapy  within  6 weeks  prior  to the Hb response.  
• A Hb response  is defined, using central  laboratory  values, as: Hb  ≥ 11.0 g/dL  and a Hb  
increase from baseline by ≥ 1.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  baseline  Hb > 8.0 g/dL, or  
• Increase in  Hb ≥ 2.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  baseline  Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dL  
Rescue  therapy  for roxadustat treated  subjects  is defined  as ESA rescue or RBC transfusion, and  
rescue therapy  for epoetin  alfa treated  subjects  is defined  as RBC transfusion. 
The hypothesis  to be  tested  for the primary  efficacy  analysis  is: 
H0: Hb response rate  for subjects  in the roxadustat  arm - Hb response  rate for subjects  in 
the epoetin  alfa arm  ≤ -15% 
Versus 
H1: Hb response rate  for subjects  in the roxadustat  arm - Hb response  rate for subjects  in 
the epoetin  alfa arm  > -15% 
A two-sided  95% CI  for the difference  of 2 responder rates (roxadustat  minus  epoetin  alfa) based  
on the Miettinen  & Nurminen approach adjusting for  treatment  and other  stratification  factors  
will be calculated  and this  null hypothesis  will be rejected  if the lower  bound  of the 95% CI  is 
greater  than -15%. 
The stratification  factors to be used in efficacy  analyses are:  
1. Geographical  region  
2. Screening  Hb values ( ≤ 8 g/dL  vs. >  8 g/dL)  
3. Cardiovascular/cerebrovascular/thromboembolic  medical  history  (Yes  vs. No) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary  Efficacy  Analyses  
Once the null  hypothesis has been rejected  for the primary  endpoint (for  both, US [FDA] and ex - 
US submissions),  the secondary endpoints  below will  be tested  using a fixed  sequence testing  
procedure,  in order to maintain  the overall  two-sided  Type  I error rate  at 0.05. If  p-value  from  a 
test is < 0.05, the claim of  superiority (or noninferiority)  will be considered  met and the test  will 
progress  to the  next comparison  in sequence as follows:  
• US (FDA)  Submission: The  first secondary  endpoint  for US (FDA)  submission is defined as  
the proportion of  subjects who  achieve a Hb  response  at two consecutive visits  during the 
first 24 weeks  of treatment,  without rescue therapy  within  6 weeks  prior  to the Hb response. 
A Hb response  is defined, using central  laboratory  values, as:  
• Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL  and a Hb  increase from baseline by  ≥ 1.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  
baseline  Hb > 8.0 g/dL,  or 
• Increase in  Hb ≥ 2.0 g/dL  in subjects whose  baseline  Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dL

The hypothesis  to be  tested  for this efficacy  analysis  is: 
H0: Hb response rate  for subjects  in the roxadustat  arm - Hb response  rate for subjects  in 
the epoetin  alfa arm  ≤ 15% 
Versus 
H1: Hb response rate  for subjects  in the roxadustat  arm - Hb response  rate for subjects  in 
the epoetin  alfa arm  > 15% 
A two-sided  95% CI  for the difference  of 2 responder rates (roxadustat  minus  epoetin  alfa) 
based on the  Miettinen  & Nurminen approach adjusting  for treatment  and other stratification  
factors will be calculated  and H 0 will be rejected  if the lower bound of  the 95% CI  is greater  
than - 15%.  
• Ex-US Submission : The first secondary  endpoint  for Ex-US submission  is the mean  change  
in Hb  levels from  baseline  to the  average level  during the Evaluation Period,  defined  as 
Week  28 until Week  36. This analysis  will be based  on the PPS population. 
The primary  hypothesis  to be tested  for this efficacy  analysis  is: 
H0: Hb mean  change  from baseline  to the average  level  from  Week 28  to Week 36  in the  
roxadustat arm ≤ Hb mean change from baseline  in the epoetin alfa arm  minus  0.75 g/dL  
Versus:  
H1: Hb change from  baseline to the  average level  of Week 28 to Week 36 in the  
roxadustat group > Hb  mean  change from  baseline  in the epoetin alfa  group  minus  0.75 
g/dL 
This efficacy  endpoint  will be analyzed  using a mixed  model  of repeated  measures  (MMRM)  
with Hb baseline value  as covariate and  treatment  group and randomization  stratification  
factors  as fixed  effects  and MI ANCOVA as sensitivity  analysis  for Ex-US submission.  
This null hypothesis  will be rejected  if the two -sided  95% CI for  the difference  of least  
square means  from  the mixed  model  is above –0.75  g/dL. 
Hb values under  the influence of  a rescue therapy within  6 weeks  prior  to and during this 8- 
week  evaluation period will be censored  in the analysis.  
• The average monthly  iron use will  be compared  between  the 2  treatment  groups using an  
ANCOVA model  with  baseline  iron replete  as a covariate,  and treatment  group and 
randomization  stratification  factors as  fixed  effects.  Superiority will  be declared  if the lower  
bound of  the two -sided  95% CI of the difference between  epoetin  alfa and roxadustat  exceeds  
zero.  
• Mean change  from  baseline  in LDL cholesterol  averaged  over  Weeks  12 to 24 will be 
analyzed using an MMRM  model  with baseline LDL cholesterol  as a covariate and  treatment  
group, visit,  visits  by [CONTACT_2939],  and randomization stratification  factors  as fixed  effects.  
Superiority  will be declared  if the lower  bound of  the two -sided  95% CI  of the difference  
between  epoetin  alfa and roxadustat  exceeds  zero.

• Proportion of subjects with  exacerbation  of hypertension, meeting  at least 1 of  the following 
criteria  will be analyzed  using CMH model  adjusting for treatment group and stratification  
factors  
o Increase in blood pressure:  An increase from  baseline in systolic  blood pressure  
(sBP)  of ≥ 20 mm Hg  and sBP > 170 mmHg  or an increase from  baseline in diastolic  
blood pressure  (dBP)  of ≥ 15 mm Hg  and dBP > [ADDRESS_2556]  be confirmed by [CONTACT_2887].  
Noninferiority of  roxadustat vs. epoetin  alfa will be tested.  Non -inferiority  will be declared  if the 
upper bound of the two -sided  95% CI of  the hazard  ratio  is less than 1.3. 
• Time  to an  increase in blood pressure (defined  as an increase from  baseline of  ≥ 20 mm Hg  
systolic  BP and sBP >170 mmHg  or an incre ase from  baseline  of ≥ 15 mm Hg  diastolic BP  
and dBP > 100 mmHg).  Time  to an increase in blood pressure will  be analyzed  using the 
Cox Proportional  Hazards  model  adjusting for  treatment group and randomization  
stratification  factors.  Superiority of  roxadustat  vs. epoetin  alfa will  be tested.  
• Mean change  in mean  arterial  pressure  (MAP)  averaged  over Weeks  8 to 12 will be analyzed  
using an MMRM  model  with baseline  MAP as a covariate and  treatment  group, visit,  visits  
by [CONTACT_2890],  and randomization  stratification  factors  as factors.  Superiority  will be  
declared  if the lower  bound  of the two -sided  95% CI of the difference  between  epoetin alfa  
and roxadustat  exceeds  zero.  
The time  to achieve the first  Hb response  defined  as the primary  endpoint (for  ex-US 
submission)  will be analyzed  using the Cox  Proportional  Hazards  model  adjusting for treatment  
group and other  stratification  factors.  Non-inferiority  of roxadustat  vs. epoetin  alfa will be tested.  
Non-inferiority  will be declared  if the upper bound  of the two -sided  95% CI  of the hazard ratio  is 
less than 1.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Efficacy  Analyses  
• Hemoglobin  maintenance:  The mean  change in Hb  averaged over  8 weeks of  treatment at  
Weeks  28 to 52 without rescue therapy  within  6 weeks  prior  to and during this 8- week  
evaluation  period. The mean  change in Hb  will be analyzed  using an MMRM  model  with  
baseline  Hb as a covariate  and treatment  group, visit,  visits  by [CONTACT_2939],  and 
randomization  stratification  factors as  fixed  effects.  Non-inferiority  between  roxadustat  
compared  with epoetin  alfa will be declared  if the lower  bound  of the two -sided  95% CI  of 
the difference  between  roxadustat  and epoetin  alfa exceeds  -0.75 g/dL.  All subjects  will be 
included in the  analysis  
• HRQoL benefit of  roxadustat  will be assessed using SF-[ADDRESS_2557].  Between

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse  Events  
Adverse  events  will be coded using the  Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  
(MedDRA).  
An AE (classified  by [CONTACT_2940])  occurring  during the Treatment  Period  will be considered  a 
TEAE if  it was not present  prior  to the first dose  of study medication,  or if it was  present  prior  to 
the first  dose  of study medication  but increased  in severity  during the Treatment  Period.  An AE 
that occurs more  than 28  days after the EOT/ET visit date  will not be counted as a TEAE.  
The number  and percentage of  subjects  reporting  TEAEs  in each treatment group will be  
tabulated  by [CONTACT_2941]; by [CONTACT_2942],  preferred  term,  and 
severity; and  by [CONTACT_2943],  preferred  term,  and relationship. If  more  than one event  
occurs with  the same  preferred  term  for the same subject, the  subject  will be counted only once  
for that preferred  term using the most  severe and  most  related  occurrence for  the summarization

DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2560]  immediate ly (within  24 hours of awareness) report  to the sponsor all SAEs,  
regardless  of whether  the Investigator  believes they  are related  to the  study  drug. 
The definitions  of an AE, suspected  adverse  reaction,  adverse reaction,  and SAE are described  
below  in accordance with the FDA Final Rule  Vol 75, No 188, September  29, 2010; Article  18 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of  the European  Parliament and of  the Council  of [ADDRESS_2561]  medical  occurrence associated  with  the use of  a drug in humans,  whether  
or not considered drug- related.  
An AE can  be any unfavorable and  unintended sign (eg, an  abnormal  and clinically  significant  
laboratory  finding), symptom,  or disease temporally associated  with  the use of  a drug, without  
any judgment  about causality.  This includes  any occurrence that is new in  onset  or aggravated in  
severity  or frequency  from the baseline  condition, or abnormal  results  of diagnostic  procedures,  
including laboratory  test abnormalities.  An AE can arise from any use of  the drug (eg,  off-label  
use, use in combination with another drug) and from  any route  of administration,  formulation, or  
dose, including  an overdose.  
An AE includes medical  conditions , signs,  and symptoms  not previously  observed in  the subject  
that emerge during the  protocol -specified  AE reporting period, including  signs or symptoms  
associated  with  an underlying condition  that were not present prior  to the  AE reporting  period 
(Section  9.3.1 ). 
9.2.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse  Event  
An SAE is any AE or suspected  adverse reaction  that results in any of  the following outcomes:  
• Death  
 
• A life-threatening  AE (ie,  if in the view of  the Investigator  or sponsor, the  subject  was at 
immediate  risk of death at  the time  of the event).  Life-threatening  does not  refer  to an  
event which  hypothetically  might  have caused death  if it were more  severe.  
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2850]  
 
• A persistent or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions

FibroGen,  Inc. Confidential and Proprietary  Page 85  
  
 
• A congenital  anomaly  or birth defect,  or 
 
• An important  medical  event  (based  on appropriate  medical  judgment,  the event  
jeopardizes the subject  and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  of 
the above -listed  outcomes)  
9.2.3 Definition of a Suspected Adverse  Reaction  
Suspected  adverse  reaction  means  any AE for  which there is a reasonable  possibility  that the 
drug caused  the AE.  The term “reasonable possibility”  means  there is evidence  to suggest  a 
causal  relationship  between  the drug  and the AE.  A suspected  adverse reaction  implies  a lesser  
degree of  certainty  about causality  than the term “adverse reaction.”  
9.2.4 Definition of an  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction  means  any AE caused by a drug.  
9.2.5 Special  situations  
Certain  safety  events called  “Special Situations” that  occur  in subjects  while  on the medicinal  
products administered  as part of  the study require  reporting may include, but are not limited  to: 
• Overdose  of the medicinal  product  
• Suspected  abuse/misuse  of the medicinal  product  
• Inadvertent or accidental  exposure  to the medicinal product  
• Medication  error involving the medicinal  product  (with  or without  subject/patient  
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal  product;  eg, name  [CONTACT_2976])  
• Drug -drug interaction  
9.[ADDRESS_2562]  be reported begins  after  informed  consent  
is obtained  and ends 28 days after the  ET/EOT Visit Date (ie,  completion  of 4-week  ET Follow - 
up visit for the  Early  Terminated  subjects  and completion  of End of Study (EOS)  visit for  the 
Completed  subjects)  except  for pregnancy reporting ( Section  9.3.6) . In addition, all AEs  reported  
spontaneously by [CONTACT_2949], outside the study  period, may be recorded.  
Adverse  events  will be followed  until resolved,  stable,  or until the subject’s  last study visit or lost 
to follow -up. If an AE is not resolved  or stabilized  at the  subject’s last visit,  it is up  to the 
discretion  of the Investigator  and study  Medical Monitor  to de termine  if further  monitoring of the  
event  is warranted. 
Adverse  events  collected  prior  to dosing of  study drug will  be considered “nontreatment  
emergent” while  those reported after  the first  dose  of study drug and up to  [ADDRESS_2563]  
dose of  study drug will be considered “treatment  emergent”  and be assessed  for relationship  to 
study drug.

9.3.2 Adverse  Event  Eliciting/Reporting  
During the  AE reporting period, study  site personnel  will query  each  subject at each  visit to 
actively solicit  any AE occurring  since  the previous  visit.  All AEs  will be collected  in response  
to a general question about  the subject’s  well -being  and any possible  changes  from  the baseline  
or previous visit, but  shall not be  specifically  solicited.  There will  be no directed  questioning for  
any specific AE.  This does not preclude  the site  from  collecting  and recording  any AEs  reported  
by [CONTACT_2950].  
Whenever  possible, diagnoses  should be recorded  when  signs and symptoms  are due to a  
common  etiology, as determined  by [CONTACT_2951].  New indications for 
medications started  after informed  consent is obtained until  [ADDRESS_2564]  dose  of study 
drug will  be recorded  as AEs;  recurrence or worsening of medical  history  problems  requiring 
new or changes  in concomitant  medication,  will also be recorded  as AEs.  Abnormal, clinically  
significant  laboratory results,  PE findings,  and ECGs  will be recorded  as AEs  if they are deemed  
the Investigator to meet  criteria  
The following  attributes  must  be assigned to each  AE: 
• Description  (Investigator’s  verbatim  term describing  the event).  
 
• Dates  of onset and resolution 
 
• Severity  
 
• Relationship  to study drug 
 
• Outcome  
 
• Action  taken  regarding  study drug (action  taken  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_2851]) 
 
• Other  treatment required  
 
• Determination  of “seriousness”  
 
9.3.3 Assessing  Adverse  Event  Severity  
The Investigator  should use the National  Cancer Institute  (NCI)  Common  Terminology  Criteria  
for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version 4.0. For  terms  not specified  as part of  NCI -CTCAE,  the 
following guidelines  should be used  to determine  grade:  
• Grade  1, Mild : Asymptomatic  or mild  symptoms  which  the subject  finds easily  
tolerated.  The event  is of  little conc ern to the subject  and/or  of little -or-no clinical  
significance; clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only;  intervention not  indicated.  
• Grade  2, Moderate:  The subject  has enough discomfort  to cause  interference  with  or 
change in some  of their age- appropriate  instrumental activities of  daily living  (eg, 
preparing  meals,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2852],  using the telephone, managing  
money);  local  or noninvasive intervention  indicated.

Roxadustat  Protocol FGCL -4592 -063 Amendment 4 
FibroGen,  Inc. Confidential and Proprietary  Page 87  
  
 
• Grade  3, Severe:  The subject is incapacitated  and unable to work  or participate  in many  
or all  usual  activities.  The event  is of definite  concern  to the subject  and/or  poses  
substantial risk  to the  subject’s  health  or well -being;  Likely  to require  medical  
intervention  and/or close follow -up, including  but not limited  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2853].  
• Grade  4, Life-threatening:  The subject  was at immediate  risk of death from  the event as  
it occurred.  
• Grade  5, Death related  to AE.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_2565] of  the information about the  safety  of a drug prior  to marketing  comes  from  clinical  trials; 
therefore,  AE reports from Investigators  are critically  important.  Moreover,  appropriately 
deciding whether the AE  meets  the definition  of a suspected  adverse reaction is usually the most  
difficult determination,  but it is critical  to avoid the miscategorization  of the product’s  safety  
profile.  
Default  reporting of  individual  events  as possibly  related is  uninformative  and does not  
meaningfully  contribute to the development  of the product safety  profile.  
The Investigator  must  provide  an assessment  of the relationship  of the AE to study drug  in 
accordance with  the guidance  below. Absence of  an alternative  cause would  not normally be  
considered enough  evidence  to assess an event as possibly related  or related  to study drug. The  
following are examples  of adverse events  and their relationship  to study drug:  
Related (Adverse  Reaction):  
• Any event for which  there  is evidence to conclude  that the study  drug caused  the event.  
Possibly Related (Suspected Adverse Reaction):  
• A single occurrence of  an event that is uncommon, but is a  typi[INVESTIGATOR_2854],  such  as anaphylaxis,  rhabdomyolysis, Stevens - 
Johnson syndrome,  etc. 
• One or more  occurrences of  an event  that is not commonly  associated  with drug exposure  but 
is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug.  
Not Related:  
• The event  represents  the underlying disease (eg, disease- related symptoms,  disease 
progression) and the presentation of  the event  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855].  
• The event  represents  a comorbid condition  present  at the time  the subject entered  the study 
that has  not worsened.  
• The event  represents  a known adverse reaction  associated  with  a co -medication  received  by 
[CONTACT_1177].  
• The event is common  for the study  population (eg, cardiovascular events  in an elderly  
population).  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2566]  be reported  immediately  to the Sponsor  and/or its designa ted safety  management  
vendor.  
To report  an SAE,  the Investigator  must  fax or email  an SAE  Report  Form to Sponsor’s  
designated safety  management  vendor within  24 hours of  becoming  aware of  the serious  event.  
In case of  emergency  or doubt, the  Investigator shall  call Sponsor’s  Medical  Monitor for  
guidance. Follow -up reports  must  be submitted  in a timely  manner  as additional  information  
becomes  available.  
Full details of  the SAE should also be  recorded  on the medical  records  and in the CRF.  The 
following minimum  information  is required:  
• Subject  number, sex and  age 
 
• The date of  report  
 
• A description  of the SAE (event, seriousness  of the event)  
 
• Causal  relationship  to the study drug 
 
Follow -up information for the event should be sent  promptly  (within  7 days)  as necessary.  
For each SAE observed, the Investigator  should obtain all  of the information  available about the  
event, including (but not limited  to): hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2856],  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2857], death  
certificate,  appropriate laboratory findings  (including autopsies  and biopsy  results),  and clinical  
examinations  (including  radiological examinations  and clinical consultations). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  Serious  Adverse  Events  to the  Institutional  Review  Board  / Independent  
Ethics  Committee  
The Investigator is responsible  for notifying  his/her  Institutional Review  Board  (IRB) or Ethics  
Committee  (EC)  of SAEs  in accordance with  local  regulations.  Sponsor, or its  safety  
representative,  will provide  to the Investigator a  copy of  any expedited  safety  reports  that it 
intends  to file  with  a regulatory  authority.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
For any death  occurring during the  subject’s  study participation, regardless  of attribution,  the 
Investigator will  report the  death  immediately  to the Sponsor’s  Medical Monitor  and their 
designated safety  management  vendor. 
The Investigator  should  notify Sponsor  and their designated safety  management  vendor of  any 
death or other  SAE occurring after a subject  has discontinued or terminated  study participation  
that may  reasonably  be related  to the study.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2567]’s  death.  
When  reporting a death,  the event  or condition that caused  or contributed  to the fatal  outcome  
should be recorded  as the primary  event term  on the SAE Report Form.  
9.3.6 Pregnancies:  Reporting  and Follow -up of Subjects  
A pregnancy  in a female  subject  or a male  subject’s female  partner  must  be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_2877] β -HCG test(s).  If pregnancy is suspected,  study  drug may  need to be  interrupted  
until pregnancy is ruled  out.  If  a female subject  or the female partner  of a male  subject becomes  
pregnant while the subject  is receiving  study treatment  or within  [ADDRESS_2568]  be completed  and submitted  to Sponsor  (by [CONTACT_2952]) within  [ADDRESS_2569]  be reported  by [CONTACT_2953] a Pregnancy Outcome  Report  Form,  which  
should be sent  to the  Sponsor  and/or  its designated  safety  management  vendor within  [ADDRESS_2570] (eg, laboratory parameter,  vital sign, ECG data,  
PE) should be defined  as an AE only if  the abnormality  meets  one of  the following  criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs  or symptoms  
• Requires  active  intervention  
• Requires interruption  or discontinuation  of study medication  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2818], the abnormality  is clinically  meaningful  and 
significantly  different  from baseline.  
9.3.8 Disease  Progression  
• Disease  progression can be considered as a worsening of  a subject’s  condition  
attributable to  the disease for  which  the investigational  product  is being studied.  It may  
be an increase in the severi ty of the disease under  study and/or  increases in the symptoms  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2571] should be considered disease  progression and  
should not be  reported  as an AE during the study.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: 1B482E3D -40AC -[ADDRESS_2572]  ACCESS  TO SOURCE  DOCUMENTS  
Following site  prequalification  and/or  initiation  of the study site,  periodic monitoring visits  and 
site closeout visits  will be made by [CONTACT_2954]. The  Investigator  must  provide direct  
access  to, and allocate  sufficient  space and time  for, the monitor  to inspect  subject  source  
records, CRFs,  queries,  collection  of local  laboratory  normal  ranges (if applicable),  
investigational  product accountability records,  and regulatory  documents  in accordance with  
GCP and I CH E6 guideline.  
The purpose  of study monitoring  is to verify  the following:  
• The rights  and well-being  of human  subjects  are protected  
 
• The reported  data are accurate,  complete,  and verifiable from source documents  
 
• All data are collected,  tracked,  and submitted  by [CONTACT_2955],  
including unscheduled and missed  assessments

Appendix  2 Roxadustat  Dose  Adjustment  Rules  
Dose  adjustments  should occur in two separate study dosing phases:  the Correction  Phase  and 
the Maintenance Phase (see below). The aim of the Correction Phase  is to  increase Hb  levels  
from  baseline to the  target  Hb level.  This phase is  variable in  length for each subject.  The 
determination of  Hb response and transition  from  the Correction  to the Maintenance Phase  of the 
study is based  on the central  laboratory  Hb value.  
All dose adjustments  should be based  on Hb  values using a  point -of-care device,  such as 
HemoCue® or CritLine®. In the event  that the central  lab Hb  value of  the site visit  is significantly  
different and  the dose adjustment  decision  based on the HemoCue® / CritLine® value is being  re- 
considered, the Medical Monitor  should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530],  if possible.  
Dose  adjustment  reviews  will occur on Week  4, and at intervals  of every  4 weeks  thereafter  
(Weeks  8, 12, 16, etc.), except in the  event of excessive  hematopoiesis,  in which case doses may  
be adjusted  at any time.  In such cases,  dose adjustment  reviews  are resumed  at 4- week  intervals.  
For example,  if the subject’s  Hb increases  > 2.0 g/dL  from Week  [ADDRESS_2584]’s  dose  
is reduced  by [CONTACT_2970]  3. The  next  dose adjustment  review  should occur  4 weeks  
later at Week  7. If  the dose adjustment  interval falls  on a non -study  visit week  (starting  Week  4), 
the dose adjustment  review should be performed  at the next  scheduled  study visit if  a dose  
adjustment was not required  at the previous  visit.  For example,  if a subject’s  visit is scheduled  
for Weeks  [ADDRESS_2585] requires  < 20 mg 
TIW  (ie, < 60 mg  per week)  to maintain  the target  Hb level,  the dosing frequency  should  be 
reduced  in a step-wise fashion  eg, TIW to BIW,  BIW  to QW, QW  to Q-2 Week  etc. The  Medical  
Monitor  should be notified  as soon as  possible  of such dose change.  The maximum roxadustat  
dose is 3.0 mg/kg per dose  or 400 mg (whichever  is lower).  
The following  scenarios are defined  as “excessive  hematopoiesis”;  
1. Hb increases  by > 2.0 g/dL at any time  within  a 4 week  period:  
reduce the dose  by [CONTACT_2884].  
2. Hb reaches  or exceeds  13 g/dL:  hold  dosing, check  Hb weekly.  
Resume  dosing when  Hb < 12.0 g/dL (for US subjects  central  lab 
Hb value preferred),  at a dose that  is reduced by [CONTACT_2971].  
For subjects on prolonged dose -hold, with stable (not droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  Hb, PI [INVESTIGATOR_2863].  Anytime Hb  is assessed  via HemoCue®/CritLine®/local  lab, a  
central  lab Hb should be obtained as  well.  
Given  the complexity  in roxadustat  dose  adjustments,   and  the need to  take into account  the 
various clinical parameters  in roxadustat  dose titration,  one would  not consider it a protocol  
deviation  when study subjects  are dosed based on their clinical  circumstances,  whether or not it 
is concordant  with   the roxadustat  dose  adjustment  guidelines  unless  it was related  to “excessive 
hematopoiesis”   (eg, ,Hb ≥ 13 g/dL, requiring a dose  hold))  or “Overdose” (prescribed  >3.0 
mg/kg  per dose  or 400 mg per dose whichever is  lower)

Example: A dose increase at a dose of 70 mg  results  in 100 mg  as the new dose. A dose 
reduction at a dose of 150 mg results in 100 mg as the new dose.  
Note: Maximum  dose capped at 3.0 mg/kg per dose or 400  mg, whichever is  lower.  
*Transition  from  Correction  to Maintenance  Phase  will occur once  the 
central  laboratory Hb value  is ≥ 11 g/dL  and ≥ 1 g/dL  from  baseline   
 
At any time during  the Treatment Period  if Hb  increases  by 
>2.0 g/dL within  4 weeks,  the dose  should be  reduced by [CONTACT_2873].

Appendix  5 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  Measurement Guidelines  
Blood Pressure  
Blood  pressure  (BP)  measurement  should be done  with the subject comfortably  seated  in a chair,  
with the legs uncrossed, and the back  and arm  supported, such  that the middle  of the cuff on the  
upper arm  is at the  level of the right  atrium (the midpoint  of the sternum).  The subject  should be  
instructed  to relax  as much  as possible  and to not  talk during the measurement  procedure;  
ideally, [ADDRESS_2598]  during the course  of the study,  timing  as indicated  in the Schedule  of Assessments.  Also  
the same arm  should be used consistently  for readings  throughout  the study.  
Blood  pressure  should be  measured  in triplicate (preferred) with  at least  one-minute  interval  
between the  measurements.  In subjects  on HD, BP should be  measured  prior to  the start  of the 
dialysis  procedure  that day, preferably  using the  nondialysis arm. In subjects on HHD/PD,  BP 
should be  measured  approximately at  the same  time of the day  at each visit.  
Heart Rate  
Heart  rate measurement  should be done  at rest in  a sitting  position  wherever  possible. It can be  
performe d with  an electronic  automated  device as used for BP  measurement.  The same  device  
should preferably  be used  for the subject  during the course of  the study, timing  as indicated  in 
the schedule of  assessments.  Heart rate (HR)  should  be measured  in triplicate (preferred) with  at 
least one-minute  interval between  the measurements.  In subjects  on HD, HR should be measured  
at predialysis  and in subjects  on HHD/PD and should  be measured  approximately at the same  
time of the day at each  visit.

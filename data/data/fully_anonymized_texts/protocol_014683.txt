MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 4 of 178 Template 16.2 2. Gene expression signatures associated with respon se to therapy will include expression of messenger 
ribonucleic acid in blood and tumor samples before and after treatment to examine gene expression 
patterns at basel ine and changes in response to treatment. Anal ysis may also include but is not limited to: 
evaluation of key oncogenic mutations and/ or mutations in immune-related molecules. 
3. Levels of circulating free DNA and/or circulating soluble factors which may include cytokines, 
chemokines, growth factors, soluble receptors, and an tibodies against tumor and self-antigens, may be 
evaluated before and after treatment to evaluate re sponse to treatment with MEDI0680 and durvalumab  
compared with nivolumab monotherapy 
4. Pharmacodynamic assessments of MEDI0680 and durv alumab combination in the periphery include: 
a. Flow cytometric assessment of cell populations such  as T cells and B cells be fore and after treatment 
to evaluate their association with drug exposure a nd response to treatment; analysis may include 
characterization of phenotype, expression of activati on markers, proliferation, and production of 
cytokines and effector molecules 
b. Dose escalation only: Serum solub le PD-L1 levels before and after treatment may be measured to 
evaluate their association with drug exposure a nd response to treatment with MEDI0680 and 
durvalumab  
c. Dose escalation only: MEDI0680 receptor occupancy on peripheral blood T cells before and after 
treatment may be measured to evaluate associations with d rug exposure and response to treatment with 
MEDI0680 and durvalumab  
5. Expression and localization of key molecules such as PD-L1, PD-L2, and PD-1 within the tumor 
microenvironment, as well as the frequency, localization, and phenotype  of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, 
may be examined in biopsy specimens by [CONTACT_4658] , immunofluorescence, and/or flow cytometry and correlated 
with response to treatment 
6. Antitumor activity, including OR, DR, DC , and PFS, may be assessed by [CONTACT_497092] a multicenter, open -label, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the sa fety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and 
antitumor activity of MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab or nivolumab monotherapy in adult 
immunotherapy -naïve subjects with selected advanced ma lignancies. The study will be conducted at 
approximately 50 study centers globally.  
The study includes 2 phases, dose -escalation and dose-expansion. In the dose- escalation phase, subjects with 
selected solid tumors will receive MEDI0680/ durvalumab combination therapy. In the dose- expansion phase, 
subjects with ccRCC will receive either MEDI0680/ durvalumab combination therapy or nivolumab 
monotherapy .  
In the dose -escalation phase, subjects may receive treatme nt for up to 12 months; in the dose expan sion phase, 
subjects may remain on treatment until  unacceptable toxicity, confirmed progressive disease (PD), or 
development of other reason for treatment discontinuation.  Subjects in dose expans ion may receive study 
drug(s) for a maximum of 2 years . At the conclusion of the study, subjects who continue to demonstrate clinical 
benefit will be eligible to receiv e study drug(s).  St udy drug will be provided via an extension of the study, a 
rollover study requiring approval by [CONTACT_497093].  The sponsor rese rves the right to terminate  access to study drug if 
any of the following occur:  a) the marketing application is rejected by [CONTACT_497094]; b) the study 
is terminated due to safety concerns; c) the subject can obtain medication from a gover nment sponsored or 
private healt h program; or d) therapeutic alternatives become available in the local market. All subjects will be 
evaluated regularly. Clinical status will  be classified according to modified RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_639015] v1.1 for subjects in the dose expansion phase, and other disease- specific 
assessments. All subjects will be follow ed for survival until the end of study. Adverse events and SAEs will be 
followed.  
In the dose -escalation phase, sequential cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 6 dose- level cohorts: 
0.1 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 3 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W, and increasing dose levels of MEDI0680 Q2W 
(0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. The dose-escalation phase will initially 
include immunotherapy -naïve subjects with solid tumors. As of Protocol Amendment 2, only subjects with 
non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI high) colorect al cancer (CRC), bladder cancer, ovarian  cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 5 of 178 Template 16.2 cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) will be enrolled.  
The dose -escalation phase will be execute d according to a 3 + 3 design. If ≥ 2 of 6 subjects experience a dose 
limiting toxicity ( DLT), a dose level from the intermediate zone- based cohort(s) that does not exceed the MTD 
or the highest protocol defined dose for each investiga tional product in the absence of exceeding the MTD may 
be explored. Based on emerging safety, PK, pharmaco dynamic, and clinical activity data for the MEDI0680 
Q2W treatment schedule, the dosing interval for MEDI0680 could have been increased to every 4 weeks 
(Q4W).  
Any dose -level cohort in the dose-escalation phase that di d not exceed the MTD can be expanded up to a 
maximum of 18 subjects for further eva luation of safety, PK, pharmac odynamics, and antitumor activity. 
Based on 6 dose -level cohorts in the main 3 + [ADDRESS_639016] planned dose-level cohort of 20 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W in combination with durvalumab Q2W and 
the MTD was not reached.  
The dose -expansion phase will begin after the dose-escalat ion phase. As of Amendment 5, immunotherapy-
naïve subjects with ccRCC will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms: (1) 
MEDI0680/ durvalumab combination therapy or (2) nivolumab monotherapy . Stratification factors will include 
the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK CC) risk group (0 = favora ble risk; 1 or 2 = intermediate 
risk; 3 = poor risk) and PD -L1 expression status ( ≤ 1% and > 1%). Up to 40 subjects may be randomized in  to 
the MEDI0680/ durvalumab combination therapy arm and up to 20 subjects in the nivolumab mon otherapy arm 
based on evaluation of emerging safety and efficacy parameters in the curr ent study as well as other ongoing 
studies.  An interim futility analyses will be performed for the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination therapy arm 
in the dose-expansion phase after [ADDRESS_639017] completed study.  
An evaluation of a possible correlation between clinical ac tivity of MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab 
or nivolumab and potential biomarkers (eg, PD- L1 expression on tumor) will be ongoing throughout the study. 
Randomization into the dose expansion phase may be discontinued at the discretion of the sponsor should 
emerging clinical or pre -clinical data suggest that continued treatment may not be beneficial. 
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION   
For the dose -escalation phase, subjects will be immunotherapy- naïve adults with selected solid tumors who are 
refractory or intolerant to standard ther apy or for which no standard therapy exists. As of Protocol 
Amendment  2, only subjects with NSCL C, SCCHN, MSI-high CRC, blad der cancer, ovarian cancer, 
esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, or RCC will be enrolle d. No more than [ADDRESS_639018] 1 and no more 
than 2 prior anti-angiogenic therapy regimens (including, but not limited to, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, 
axitinib, tivozanib, and bevacizumab ) in the advanced or metastatic setting; m ust have received no more than 
3 total prior systemic treatment regimens in the advanc ed or metastatic setting (prior mammalian target of 
rapamycin [mTOR] regimens are not allowed); a nd must have evidence of radiographic progression on or after 
the last treatment regimen received within [ADDRESS_639019], DOSAGE , AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION 
Subjects will be treated in either the dose-escalation or dose-expa nsion phase. Both MEDI0680 and durvalumab 
will be administered via IV infusion.  Nivolumab will be administered  per the dosing information in the package 
insert. In the dose-escalation phase, sequential coho rts of subjects will receive 1 of 6 MEDI0680/ durvalumab 
combination dose levels:  0.1 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 3 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W, or increasing dose levels 
of MEDI0680 Q2W (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. Subjects will remain on 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 6 of 178 Template 16.2 treatment for up to 12 months. Subjects in the dose-escal ation phase who achieve and maintain DC (ie, CR, PR, 
or stable disease SD) through the end of the 12-month  treatment period will enter follow-up. During the first 
[ADDRESS_639020] discontinuation criteria. Only 1 round of 
retreatment will be allowed.  
In the dose -expansion phase, subjects will receive either  20 mg/kg MEDI0680 in combination with 750 mg 
(fixed dose) durvalumab Q2W or nivolumab Q2W monotherapy. Subjects in the dose- expansion phase will 
remain on treatment until unacceptab le toxicity, confirmed PD, or development of other reason for treatment 
discontinuation. 
Prior to the removal of a MEDI0680 monotherapy arm in this protoc ol amendment, some subjects were 
randomized and beg an receiving MEDI0680 monotherapy. These subjec ts are to continue receiving 20 mg/kg 
MEDI06 80 Q2W monotherapy until unacceptable toxicit y, confirmed progressive disease (PD), or development 
of other reason for treatment discontinuation and will follow the sche dule of study procedures for 
MEDI0680 /durvalumab combination therapy.  
In the event of an initial assessme nt of PD (based on RECIST v1.1)  in either the dose-escalation or 
dose-expansion phases, a subject may continue  to receive the assigned study treatment until confirmation of PD 
if the subject fulfills the criteria for treatment in the setting of PD and does not meet any of the investigational 
product discontinuation criteri a. If the lesions included in the tumor burden subsequently regress to the extent 
that the criteria for PD are no longer met, then treatment  may continue according to the treatment schedule. 
Initial observation of PD must be confirmed by a subseq uent scan no earlier than [ADDRESS_639021] discontinue treatment.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
Sample Size  
Initially, a total of approximately 96 subjects could be requir ed for both dose-escalation and dose- expansion 
phases of the study. 
For dose -escalation (enrollment completed) , the number of subjects will depend  upon the toxicities observed as 
the study progresses. Up to appr oximately 36 evaluable subjects could be required by [CONTACT_941] 3  + 3 design with 
6 dose cohorts in the main dose escalation design. Additional subjects could be required if dose de- escalation 
occurs, intermediate dosing using the modified zone-based design is explored, the dosing interval of MEDI0680 
is changed, or expansi on of a dose-escalation cohort occurs. Subjects in the dose escalation phase are 
considered evaluable if  they receive the protocol-assigned do ses of both durvalumab and MEDI0680, and 
complete the DLT-evaluation period or experience a DL T during the DLT-evaluation period. Non- evaluable 
subjects will be replaced. The table below  provides the probability of dose- escalation to the next higher level 
for each underlying true DLT rate. For example, for a common toxicity that occurs in 10% of subjects, there is a 
greater than 90% probability of escalating to the next hi gher dose level. Conversely, for a toxicity that occurs 
with a rate of 60%, the probability of escalating to the next higher dose level is less than 10%.  
Probability of Escalating Dose for Different True Underlying Dose-limiting Toxicity Rate at Given Dose 
Level 
True Underlying DLT Rate 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 
Probability of escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001 
 
For dose -expansion, up to approximately 60 subjects  (40 subjects in the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination 
therapy arm and 20  subjects in the nivolumab monotherapy ar m) may be randomized at the selected 
combination dose (ie, MTD or highest protocol -defined dose for each agent in the absence of exceedi ng the 
MTD)  in a 2:1 ratio.  The primary objective of the dose-expansion phase is to evaluate the antitumor activity 
based on objective response rate (ORR) of MEDI0680 in co mbination with durvalumab versus nivolumab 
monotherapy  in immunotherapy-naïve subjec ts with advanced or metastatic ccRCC based on an application of 
RECIST v1.1 to investigator -assessed tumor measurements. Assuming an ORR for nivolumab monotherapy of 
21.5%, the sample size is chosen to detect a differ ence in ORR of 26.0% (ie, ORR = 47.5%) with 76 % power at 
a 1-sided significance level of 0.10. The 95% confidence in terval of a 47.5% ORR (19 re sponders / 40 subjects) 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 7 of 178 Template 16.2 is 31.5%, 63.9%).   
Safety  
The MTD evaluation will be based on the DLT-evaluable Population (Q2W schedule) which includes all 
subjects enrolled in the dose -escalation phase who receive 2 protoc ol-assigned doses of durvalumab and 
MEDI0680 and complete the safety follow -up through the end of the DLT- evaluation period, or experience a 
DLT during the DLT-evaluation period (defined as the time period starting with the first dose of study drugs 
until the planned administr ation of the third dose of durvalumab and MEDI0680).  
The safety evaluation will be based on the As -treated Population and will include AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations. Summ ary statistics will be provided for AEs, SAEs, and 
AE grade, severity, and relationship to investigationa l product, reported from the start of treatment with 
durva lumab and MEDI0680 or nivolumab. Adverse events will  be graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI  CTCAE) v4.[ADDRESS_639022] v1.1 to 
investigator -assessed tumor measurements and BICR. The ef ficacy analysis will be based on the As- treated 
Population.  
The following efficacy endpoints will be analyzed. More details will be pr ovided in the statistical analysis plan. 
x ORR is defined as the propor tion of subjects with a BOR of confirmed CR or confi rmed PR. ORR will be 
estimated with a 95% CI using the exact probability method. For the dose- expansion phase, comparison of 
arms will be obtained from Fisher’s exact test. 
x DCR16 is defined as the proportion of subjects wi th a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD 
(maintained for ≥ 16 weeks). A similar definition applies to DCR24. DCR16 and DC R24 will be estimated 
with a 95% CI using the exact probability method.  
x TTR is defined as the time from the first dos e of treatment until the first documentation of a subsequently 
confirmed objective response. Only subjects who ha ve achieved OR will be evaluated for TTR. The 
median TTR and its 95% CI will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
x DR is defined as the time from the first documen tation of a subsequently c onfirmed objective response 
until the first documentation of a disease progression (sub sequently confirmed for do se escalation phase) or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Only subjects who have achieved OR will be evaluated for 
DR. The median DR and its 95% CI will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
x PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment until the first documentation of a disease 
progression (subsequently confirme d for dose escalation phase) or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. The median PFS and its 95% CI wi ll be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimat e the PFS curve and the PFS rate at time points of 
interest.  
x OS is defined as the time from the first do se of treatment with durvalumab and MEDI0680 or nivolumab 
until death due to any cause. The median OS and its  95% CI will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. The Kaplan- Meier method will be used to estimate the OS curve and the OS rate at time points of 
interest. 
Immunogenicity  
Only subjects w ho receive at leas t one dose of both durvalumab and ME DI0680 and provide at least one 
posttreatment  sample will be evaluated. Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_497095] s who develop detectable anti -durvalumab or anti- MEDI0680 antibodies. 
The immunogenicity titer will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of anti -durvalumab 
or anti-MEDI0680 antibodies. The impact of ADAs on PK a nd pharmacodynamics will also be assessed if data

 [ADDRESS_639023] dose. Durvaluma b and MEDI0680 steady-state PK 
parameters including concentrations at peak concentration at steady state (C max,ss ) and trough concentration at 
steady state  (Cmin,ss ) will be estimated. Accumula tion to steady state will be  assessed as the ratio of 
Cmax,ss :Cmax and C min,ss :Cmin. All PK parameters will be estimated by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis. 
Descriptive statistics of non -compartmental PK parameters will be provided. 
Exploratory Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be the primary methods for the exploratory analyses. Depending on the nature of the 
data, geometric mean and other appropr iate statistical summaries might be used as well. Tumor responses by 
[CONTACT_90589], immune-related complete response, immu ne-related partial response, immune- related stable disease, 
and immune -related progressive disease will  be summarized and analyzed descriptively. Tumor response by 
[CONTACT_497096] v1.1. Th e irRECIST is similar to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_639024] v1.1.  
Interim Analysis  
An interim futility analyses will be performed for th e MEDI0680/durvalumab combination therapy arm in the 
dose-expansion phase after [ADDRESS_639025] accrual  may be paused in both cohorts to evaluate the 
MEDI0680/durvalumab combination therapy arm for futility . Continued randomization of  subjects in both arms 
will be terminated if 2 (10%) or fewer responses w ithin the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination arm are 
observed. For the futility analysis, a response is defined as either a confirmed or unc onfirmed CR or PR as per 
RECIST v1.1.

1.1 Immunotherapy 
In the [LOCATION_002] (US), cancer is the second most common cause of death after heart 
disease, accounting for nearly 1 in every 4 deaths ( Siegel et al, 2013 ). There has been a 
20% lower death risk rate from cancer in 2009 in comparison to 1991, likely 
reflecting progress in diagnosing certain cancers earlier and improvements in treatment 
(Siegel et al, 2013 ). Unfortunately, despi[INVESTIGATOR_203807], there continues to be an unmet 
medical need for more effective and less tox ic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], especially for patients with 
advanced refractory disease. 
Recent advances in immunotherapy offer promise for improving clinical outcomes in patients 
with advanced malignancies. It is increasin gly appreciated that cancers are recognized by [CONTACT_33103], and under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even 
eliminate tumors ( Dunn et al, 2004 ). Studies in mouse models of transplantable tumors have 
demonstrated that manipulation of co-stimulat ory or co-inhibitory signals can amplify T-cell 
responses against tumors ( Peggs et al, 2009 ). This may be accomplished by [CONTACT_497097]-inhibitory molecules such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or 
programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) from binding w ith their ligands, B7 or B7-H1 (programmed 
cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]).  
The human CTLA-4 blocking antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_497068] (OS) benefit in two Phase 3 studies ( Hodi et al, 2010 ; Robert et al, 2011 ). Based on 
these data, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_497069] 2011 by [CONTACT_497098] (unresectable or metastatic)

improved clinical outcomes in non-small cell lu ng cancer (NSCLC) compared to carboplatin 
and paclitaxel alone ( Lynch et al, 2012 ). Additionally, clinical activity across a range of 
tumor types, including NSCLC, for PD-[ADDRESS_639038] been 
reported from Phase 1 studies ( Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; Topalian et al, 
2012; Hamid et al, 2013 ).
1.2 MEDI0680 and Durvalumab (MEDI4736) Background 
1.2.1 MEDI0680 Background 
MEDI0680 is a humanized modified IgG4 ka ppa monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for 
human PD-1. MEDI0680 may help to promote an effective anti-tumor immune response by 
[CONTACT_15781]. Like other anti-PD-1 antibod ies in clinical development, MEDI0680 blocks 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 19 of 178 Template 16.2 the interactions between PD-1 and its ligands  (PD-L1 and programmed cell death ligand 2 
[PD-L2]), thereby [CONTACT_497099]-1. In addition, 
MEDI0680 improves the intrinsic functionality of T cells by [CONTACT_497100]-1, thereby [CONTACT_497101]-surface PD-1 and membrane proximal Src homology 
domain containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), als o known as protein tyrosine phosphatase 
non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11). This mechanism has not been described for other PD-1 
targeted agents and may be unique to MEDI0680 (AMP 514). 
1.2.2 Durvalumab Background 
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) [ADDRESS_639039] human 
PD-L1. Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 with high affinity and blocks its ability 
to bind to PD-1 and cluster of differentiat ion 80 (CD80). The fragment crystallizable (Fc) 
domain of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 
heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc γ receptors 
responsible for mediating antibody-depe ndent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( Oganesyan et al, 2008 ). 
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience 
Programmed cell death 1 (CD279) is a member  of the immunoglobulin superfamily of 
molecules involved in regulation of T-cell activ ation. Programmed cell death 1 expression is 
induced in activated T cells and is strongly upre gulated following chronic antigen stimulation 
in the context of chronic infections and cance r. Programmed cell death 1 is also expressed on 
activated B cells and can be induced on natu ral killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and 
monocytes. Programmed cell death 1 binds  to 2 ligands, PD-L1 (CD274) and PD-L2 
(CD273). Programmed cell death ligand 1 binds to two receptors, PD-1 and CD80 (B7-1), 
while PD-1 is the only known receptor for PD-L2 apart from RGMb. Programmed cell death 
ligand 1 is widely expressed and can be induced in many hematopoietic and non-
hematopoietic cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, especially interferon (IFN)- γ. It is 
expressed in a variety of normal tissues and in bo th solid and hematologic tumors. It has also 
been described on peripheral tissues including cardiac endothelium, lung, small intestine, 
keratinocytes, islet cells of the pancreas, and sy ncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta as well as 
a variety of tumor cell types ( Hamanishi et al, 2007 ; Inman et al, 2007 ; Ishida et al, 2002 ; 
Keir et al, 2008 ; Latchman et al, 2001 ; Liu et al, 2007 ; Nakanishi et al, 2007 ; Ohigashi et al, 
2005 ; Parsa et al, 2007 ; Schreiner et al, 2004 ; Thompson et al, 2004 ; Yamazaki et al, 2002 ). 
Programmed cell death ligand 2 expression is more limited; it is largely restricted to subsets 
of B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macr ophages, where it is induced by T-helper 
cell 2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4. Pr ogrammed cell death ligand 2 expression has 
also been reported in the lung, certain cancers, and cancer-associated fibroblasts. CD80 is 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 20 of 178 Template 16.2 primarily expressed by [CONTACT_497102]- presenting cells (APC), including B cells, 
dendritic cells, and monocytes, and can also be  expressed on T cells. CD80 expression is 
generally low in the tumor microenvironment; however CD80 is present on APC in the 
draining lymph nodes ( Blank, 2014 ; Hamid and Carvajal, 2013 ; Kamphorst and Ahmed, 
2013 ; Maj et al, 2013 ; Quezada and Peggs, 2013 ). 
Engagement of PD-1 on T cells inhibits acti vation with downstream effects on cytokine 
production, proliferation, cell survival, and tr anscription factors associated with 
effector T-cell function ( Bennett et al, 2003 ; Carter et al, 2002 ; Fife and Bluestone, 2008 ; 
Freeman et al, 2000 ; Nurieva et al, 2006 ; Saunders et al, 2005 ). 
1.3.1 MEDI0680 Nonclinical Experience 
The pharmacology of MEDI0680 has been studied in  a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems 
to support its use as an investigational drug in oncology. MEDI0680 binds to human PD-1 
with an affinity of 2.4 nM, determined using flow cytometry saturation binding experiments. 
MEDI0680 blocks the interactions between PD-1 a nd its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2; the half 
maximal inhibitory concentrations ar e 2.[ADDRESS_639040] article-related increase in prothrombin time (PT), which was 
observed on Study Day 3, Study Day 31, and Study Day 100 in males and females given 
≥ 1 mg/kg MEDI0680. This finding was considered non-adverse, as values remained within 
the historical control range and there were no correlating findings. The increase in PT was 
partially reversible. 
Please refer to the current Edition of the I nvestigator’s Brochure for additional information. 
1.3.2 Durvalumab Nonclinical Experience 
Durvalumab has shown the following activity as an anti-PD-L1 molecule: 
• Durvalumab binds to PD-L1 and blocks its interaction with PD-1 and CD80 
• Durvalumab can relieve PD-L1-mediated suppre ssion of human T-cell activation in vitro 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 21 of 178 Template 16.2 • Durvalumab inhibits human tumor growth in a xenograft model via a T-cell dependent 
mechanism 
• A surrogate anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody resu lted in improved survival in a syngeneic 
tumor model as monotherapy and resulted in complete tumor regression in > 50% of 
treated mice when given in combination with chemotherapy 
 
In general, there were no durvalumab-related ad verse effects in toxicology studies conducted 
in cynomolgus monkeys with durvalumab that were of relevance to humans. Adverse 
findings in the non-Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic and dose range-finding study (4 doses over 5 weeks), and a GLP 
4-week repeat-dose toxicity study were consistent with anti-drug antibody (ADA)-associated 
morbidity and mortality in individual anim als. The spectrum of findings, especially the 
microscopic pathology, in a single animal in the GLP, 4-week, repeat-dose study was also 
consistent with ADA immune complex deposition, and ADA:durvalumab immune 
complexes were identified in a subsequent non-GLP, investigative immunohistochemistry 
study. Similar effects have been observ ed by [CONTACT_497103]. Given that immunogenicity of human 
mAbs in nonclinical species is not genera lly predictive of responses in humans, the 
ADA-associated morbidity and mortality we re not taken into consideration for the 
determination of the no-observed-adverse-ef fect level (NOAEL) of durvalumab. In the GLP 
13-week IV repeat-dose toxicity study, treatm ent with durvalumab was not associated with 
any adverse effects. Therefore, the NOAEL of durvalumab in all the general toxicity studies 
was considered to be 200 mg/kg loading dose followed by 4 or 13 weekly doses of 
100 mg/kg, respectively, the highest dose tested in these studies. In addition to the in vivo 
toxicology data, no unexpected membrane binding of durvalumab to human or cynomolgus 
monkey tissues was observed in GLP tissue cross-reactivity studies using normal human and 
cynomolgus monkey tissues. In vitro cytokine  release studies showed that durvalumab did 
not induce cytokine release in blood from any donor. Additionally, an  enhanced pre- and 
postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys showed that treatment with 
durvalumab from confirmation of pregnancy until natural delivery was not associated with 
maternal toxicity, effects on pregnancy outcome, embryofetal development, or effects on 
infant growth and development during the 6 month postnatal phase. 
1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience 
Clinical experience with durvalumab and MEDI0680 is briefly described below. Refer to the 
current Investigator’s Brochures for details.

Study D6020C00001 
In Study D6020C00001, the dose-escalation phase for immunotherapy-naïve subjects is 
complete. All dose-level cohorts were enrolled and 30 subjects were exposed to MEDI0680 
in combination with durvalumab. Dose levels included 0.1 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 
3 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W, and increasing doses of MEDI0680 Q2W (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 
20 mg/kg) with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not 
identified and the highest combination dose level administered was 20 mg/kg MEDI0680 
Q2W with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. The study is ongoing and data are included as of the 
data cut-off date of 30Nov2016. One subject received MEDI0680 20 mg/kg Q2W in 
combination with durvalumab 750 mg Q2W in  dose expansion. Two subjects received 
MEDI0680 20 mg/kg monotherapy in dose expansion.  
The mean (range) exposure to MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab as of the data 
cut-off date was 23.9 (2 to 52) weeks.  
Across all cohorts of subjects receiving MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab, the 
most frequently reported AEs ( ≥ 5 subjects), regardless of causality, were anemia, arthralgia, 
back pain, constipation, cough, decreased appe tite, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema peripheral, 
fatigue, nausea, pruritus, pyrexia, rash, upper re spi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], and vomiting. There 
was no trend towards a dose relationship in incidence of AEs. 
A total of 18 (58.1%) subjects receiving MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab in the 
As-treated Population had at least 1 AE ≥ Grade 3 in severity (regardless of causality). All of 
these events were Grade 3.  
AEs ≥ Grade 3 considered related to MEDI0680 or durvalumab according to the investigator 
were reported in 6 (19.4%) subjects receiving MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab in 
the As-treated Population. These included:  increased lipase (0.1 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W + 
3 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W and 10 mg/kg ME DI0680 Q2W + durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W); 
prolonged ECG QT (0.5 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W + 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W); and 
increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), incr eased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), atrial

Overall, 10 (32.3%) subjects receiving MED I0680 in combination with durvalumab died 
during the study; 9 died due to disease under study and 1 due to “other” reason. 
Twelve subjects experienced treatment emergent  serious adverse events (SAEs), of whom 
3 subjects had events considered related to  MEDI0680 and durvalumab by [CONTACT_093]. A 
total of 7 (22.6%) subjects receiving MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab 
permanently discontinued investigational product as  a result of an AE. No AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in more than [ADDRESS_639044] across cohorts. AEs included: ALT 
increased, AST increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, dyspnea, ECG QT 
prolonged, headache, intracranial mass, and pleural effusion.  
As of the data cut-off date across all cohorts in subjects receiving MEDI0680 in combination 
with durvalumab, 1 (3.2%) subject had a confi rmed complete response (CR) and 8 (25.8%) 
subjects had a confirmed partial response (PR). The objective response rate (ORR) was 
29.0% (95% CI 14.2%, 48.0%). The rate of disease c ontrol (DC; CR + PR + stable disease

Study D6020C00002 
As of 30Nov2016, 58 subjects received MEDI0680 monotherapy. All cohorts except dose 
de-escalation 3 mg/kg Q2W were enrolled. Dose levels included 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 
20 mg/kg Q3W, 10 and 20 mg/kg Q2W, 20 mg/kg QW × 2 and 20 mg/kg QW × 4. 
Enrollment was completed in August 2015 and the study is ongoing. Overall, mean (range) 
exposure as of the data cut-off date was 23.1 (2 to 105) weeks. 
Across all cohorts, the most frequently reported AEs ( ≥ 10 subjects; regardless of causality) 
were arthralgia, anemia, asthenia, consti pation, decreased appetite, dyspnea exertional, 
fatigue, nausea, pyrexia and vomiting. A tota l of 35 (60.3%) subjects in the As-treated 
Population had at least 1 AE ≥ Grade 3 in severity regardless of causality. The majority of 
these events were Grade 3. Six subjects experienced Grade 4 AEs: hyperbilirubinemia 
(0.5 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q3W), lacunar infarction (0.5 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q3W), atrial

A total of 13 (22.4%) subjects permanently discontinued MEDI0680 as a result of an AE, 
with no apparent relationship to MEDI0680 dose level. Events reported in more than 
[ADDRESS_639047] across cohorts included increased blood cr eatinine and fatigue (2 subjects each). 
Assessment of antitumor response was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ). Across all cohorts, 1 (1.7%) subject had a 
confirmed CR, 8 (13.8%) subjects had a confirmed PR, and 1 (1.7%) subject had an 
unconfirmed PR. For these 10 subjects, th e ORR was 17.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
8.6%, 29.4%). The ORR with confirmed CR and c onfirmed PR was 15.5% (9 subjects; 95%

MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 25 of 178 Template 16.2 durvalumab in externally sponsored/investigator- initiated clinical trials. Of the 2,[ADDRESS_639049] 
adverse drug reactions seen with the immune chec kpoint inhibitor class of agents are thought 
to be due to the effects of inflammatory c ells on specific tissues. These immune-mediated 
risks seen with immune checkpoint inhi bitors such as durvalumab can include 
gastrointestinal AEs such as colitis and diar rhea, pancreatitis, pneumonitis/interstitial lung 
disease, renal AEs such as nephritis and increas es in serum creatinine, hepatic AEs such as 
hepatitis and liver enzyme elevations, dermatiti s/rash, endocrinopathies such as hypo- and 
hyper-thyroidism, hypophysitis, adrenal insuff iciency and type I diabetes mellitus, and 
neurotoxicities such as myasthenia gravis a nd Guillain Barre syndrome. These events are 
manageable by [CONTACT_213174]/established treatment guidelines as described in the toxicity 
management guidelines contained in each of the study protocols. 
Data from Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 (durvalumab monotherapy) is presented below. 
Please refer to the durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure for data from all studies. 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is a Phase 1/2, firs t-time-in-human (FTIH), multicenter, 
open-label, dose-exploration, dose-escalation, an d dose-expansion study to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biologic dose, safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, 
immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of durvalumab in adult subjects with advanced solid 
tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. A total of 
1,[ADDRESS_639050] received 
durvalumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), either in the dose-escalation or dose-
expansion phase of the study. The 10 mg/kg Q2 W cohort comprises subjects with NSCLC, 
urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinom a of head and neck (SCCHN), microsatellite 
instability high, gastroesophageal cancer, ovari an cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer , uveal melanoma, non-SCCHN

 26 of 178 Template 16.2 human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (positive) , advanced cutaneous melanoma, small cell lung cancer, 
glioblastoma multiforme, soft tissue sarcoma, and nasopharyngeal carcin oma. Subjects in the 
10 mg/kg Q2W dose cohort were exposed to a median of 6 doses of durvalumab (range, 1–
27). 
The safety profile of durvalumab as monotherapy and combined with other anticancer agents 
was consistent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune 
checkpoint inhibitor class. The safety profile  of durvalumab monotherapy in the 970 subjects 
with advanced solid tumors treated at 10 mg/kg Q2W in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 was 
manageable and generally consistent with the known safety profile of the anti-PD-L1/PD-1 
drug class. Immune-mediated AEs were manage able and generally reversible by [CONTACT_497104], treating with  immunosuppression and/or endocrine therapy 
per the toxicity management guidelines, or, infrequently, by [CONTACT_497105].  
As of 24Jul2016, among the 970 subjects treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W in 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, a total of 554 subjects (57.1%) experienced a 
treatment-related AE, with the most frequent (occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects) being fatigue 
(18.7%), nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (7.6%), pruritus (6.8%), decreased appetite (6.7%), 
hypothyroidism (6.3%) and rash (6.0%). The majori ty of the treatment-related AEs were 
Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity with Grade 3 or higher AEs reported in  88 subjects (9.4%). 
Treatment-related ≥ Grade 3 or 4 events reported in ≥ 2 subjects were fatigue (1.6%), 
increased AST (1.0%), increased ALT (0.8%), increased γ glutamyl transferase (0.7%), 
hyponatraemia and diarrhea (0.5% each), colitis  (0.4%), decreased appetite and vomiting 
(0.3% each), and increased ALP, anemia, arthralgia, autoimmune hepatitis, increased blood 
bilirubin, dyspnea, hyperglycemia, infusion related reaction, leukopenia, nausea, neutropenia, 
nervous system disorder, maculo-papular ra sh, thrombocytopenia, transaminases increased 
and weight decreased (0.2% each). Four subj ects had a treatment-related Grade 5 event 
(autoimmune hepatitis, immune thrombocyt openic purpura, pneumonia, and pneumonitis). 
Treatment related SAEs that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects were colitis and pneumonitis (4 subjects 
each); nervous system disorder (3 subjects); and acute kidney injury, AST increased, and 
diarrhea (2 subjects each). The majority of the treatment-related SAEs were ≥ Grade 3 in 
severity and resolved with or without seque lae. Treatment-related AEs that resulted in 
permanent discontinuation were seen in 24 subjects (2.5%) with colitis being the most 
frequent (3 subjects). Approximately half of  the treatment-related AEs resulting in 
discontinuation were ≥ Grade 3 in severity and the majority of these resolved with or without 
sequelae.

MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639051] v1.1. There are different data cut-offs for 
efficacy data from the different cohorts in the study. 
• NSCLC: As of 29Apr2016, 304 NSCLC subjects had received durvalumab monotherapy, 
144 (47%) subjects with non-squamous and 160 (53%) subjects with squamous histology. 
Subjects with tumors defined as PD-L1 high (defined as tumor tissue samples that had ≥ 25% of tumor cells with membrane staining for PD-L1 [tumor cells ≥ 25%]) had 
improved ORR and OS. The ORR was 25% and 6% in subjects with PD-L1 high and low/negative (defined as tumor cells < 25%) tumors, respectively and 18% in the overall 
population, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The ORR in first-line subjects was 29%, 11%, and 27% for PD-L1 high, PD-L1 low/negative, and the overall population, respectively. In the second-line setting OR R was 26%, 4%, and 19% and in the third-line 
plus setting it was 22%, 6% and 13% for PD L1 high, PD-L1 low/negative and the overall population, respectively. The 12-month OS  rate was 71% and 44% in subjects 
with PD-L1 high and low/negative tumors, resp ectively, in the first-line setting. In the 
second-line setting the 12-month OS rate wa s 56% and 39% and in the third-line plus 
setting it was 51% and 37%, in subjects with PD L1 high and low/negative tumors, respectively. 
• SCCHN: As of 29Apr2016, 62 subjects w ith recurrent/metastatic squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck had received durvalumab monotherapy. ORR was 11% 
across all subjects, 18% in subjects w ith PD-L1 high tumors (tumor cells ≥ 25%) and 8% 
in subjects with PD-L1 low/negative tumors (< 25%). Among the 7 responders (all subjects), 6 subjects had a duration of response (DoR) of ≥ [ADDRESS_639052] 
DoR being 19.8 months. Six- and 12-month OS were 62% and 42%, respectively, for the 
all treated subject populati on and 53% and 45%, respectively, for the subjects with 
PD-L1 high tumors, and 66% and 41%, resp ectively, for the subjects with PD-L1 
low/negative tumors. 
• Urothelial Carcinoma: As of 20Nov2015, 61 subjects had been enrolled into the 
urothelial cell cohort. Forty-two s ubjects who initiated study therapy ≥ 12 weeks prior to 
data cut-off were evaluable for response. Confirmed ORR was 46% in the PD-L1 high subgroup compared to 0% in the PD-L1 lo w/negative subgroup. ORR in the entire 
response evaluable population was 31% (13/42 subjects).  
• Other indications: In PD-L1 unselected subjects, the ORR, based on investigator 
assessment per RECIST v1.1, ranged from 0% in  uveal melanoma to 17.4% in advanced 
cutaneous melanoma, and disease control rate (DCR) at 24 weeks (DCR24) ranged from 
4.2% in triple negative breast cancer to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma. Across 
the PD-L1 high tumors, ORR was > 10% for advanced cutaneous melanoma and HCC (33.3% each). In the PD-L1 high subset, DCR24 was > 10% in advanced cutaneous melanoma (66.7%) and HCC (33.3%). 
 
As of 24Jul2016, PK data were available for 977 subjects in the dose-escalation and 
dose-expansion phases of Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 following treatment with 
durvalumab 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W), or 20 mg/kg every 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 28 of 178 Template 16.2 4 weeks (Q4W). The peak concentration (C max) increased in an approximately dose-
proportional manner over the dose range examined. The area under the concentration curve 
from zero to 14 hours increased dose-proportionally at doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg and more than 
dose-proportionally at doses of < 3 mg/kg, likely due to saturable target-mediated clearance. 
The steady state was achieved at approxim ately Week 16. Accumulation of durvalumab was 
observed following repeated dosing. Mean accu mulation ratio ranged from 0.64 to 1.87 and 
3.15 to 4.93 for C max and trough concentration, respectivel y. Near complete target saturation 
(soluble PD-L1 [sPD-L1] and membrane bound) is expected with durvalumab ≥ 3 mg/kg 
Q2W. As of 24Jul2016, a total of 790 subjects pr ovided evaluable samples for ADA analysis. 
Overall, 25 of 790 subjects (3.2%) tested pos itive for treatment emergent ADAs in the ADA 
evaluable population; 19 (2.4%) subjects were pers istently positive for the presence of ADA. 
Three subjects (0.4%) were neutralising ADA positive. Based on population PK covariate 
analysis, ADA positive status was not asso ciated with a clinically relevant reduction of 
exposure to durvalumab. There was no apparent effect of immunogenicity on the PK profile. 
At the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose, sPD-L1 suppression in ADA positive subjects was similar to 
that observed in ADA negative subjects.

clinical activity across a number  of tumor types, such as melanoma, NSCLC, and renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) ( Weber et al, 2012 ; Topalian et al, 2012 ; Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et 
al, 2012 ; Hamid et al, 2013 ; Motzer et al 2015 ). Previous studies have shown that PD-L1 
expression is associated with a poor prognosis in RCC, presumably because of its 
immunosuppressive function ( Thompson et al, 2006 ). In a recent Phase 3 study involving 
subjects with advanced RCC who received previous treatment, an improvement in median 
OS was shown for patients that received nivolumab compared to patients that received 
everolimus. The ORR was greater  with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor than with the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) i nhibitor (based on independent review, 
21.5% [95% CI: 17.6%, 25.8%] vs 3.9% [95% CI: 2.2%, 6.2%]; Opdivo [nivolumab] Package Insert, 2015 ).  
The mechanisms of action of anti-PD-[ADDRESS_639054]: while both 
inhibit the interaction between PD-1 and PD -L1, only anti-PD-1 blocks PD-1/PD-L2 and 
only anti-PD-L1 blocks PD-L1/CD80. All three interactions may contribute to 
immunosuppression in the tumor and tumor-dra ining lymph nodes. The interaction between 
PD-L1 and CD80 may be especially important in  the context of anti-PD-1 treatment. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 29 of 178 Template 16.2 The blockade of PD-1 can lead to increased release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN- γ 
at the tumor site ( Peng et al, 2012 ). Interferon- γ enhances the expression of PD-L1 in a range 
of cell types ( Lee et al, 2006 ) and so PD-1 blockade may resu lt in increased PD-L1 mediated 
blockade of co-stimulatory CD80 within the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, 
PD-1/PD-L2 signaling may be more pronounced in the context of PD-L1 
blockade. Further support for the combinati on strategy is provided by [CONTACT_497106] ( Curran et al, 2010 ). This includes significantly enhanced activity of a PD-1/PD-L1 
combination relative to maximally efficacious doses of PD-1 or PD-L1 monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] a 
murine syngeneic sarcoma model as desc ribed in the current edition of the MEDI0680 
Investigator’s Brochure. Based upon these observations, the complex feedback between 
pathways and differences in pathway blockade  between agents, combination therapy with 
durvalumab and MEDI0680 may generate superior antitumor activity compared to either 
monotherapy. This may translate into high rates of response in tumors known to respond to 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_497070]. However, the combination of these two 
agents may increase the frequency or severity  of toxicities, and thus  a dose-escalation study 
in the appropriate setting to explor e this combination is indicated.  
In the dose-expansion phase of the study, nivolumab is included as a comparator as it is now 
the standard of care in the metasta tic RCC setting in some markets. 
Benefit-risk Evaluation 
Potential Benefits 
Emerging data with both durvalumab and ME DI0680 in a monotherapy setting across a 
range of tumor types demonstrate encouraging clinical activity with a manageable safety 
profile (Sections 1.4.1, Section 1.4.2). In Study D6020C00002, MEDI0680 monotherapy 
showed an ORR of 24.1% among 29 subjects wi th advanced RCC. Of the 14 RCC subjects 
who received MEDI0680 at the 20 mg/kg dose le vel, 4 (28.6%) subjects had an objective 
response (OR).

 [ADDRESS_639056] frequently reported AEs ( ≥ 10 subjects) in subjects receiving MEDI0680 monotherapy 
in Study D6020C00002 were fatigue, decreased appetite, anemia, constipation, nausea, 
arthralgia, asthenia, dyspnea exertional, vomit ing and pyrexia. Twenty-nine subjects in 
Study D6020C00002 (MEDI0680 monotherapy) had at least [ADDRESS_639057] across cohorts included pneum onia (5 subjects), fatigue and hypotension 
(4 subjects), pyrexia (3 subjects), abdominal p ain, cellulitis, diarrhea, disease progression, 
pleural effusion, and vomiting (2 subjects).  
Most frequently reported AEs ( ≥ 5 subjects) for MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab 
(Study D6020C00001) were anemia, arthralgia, back pain, constipation, cough, decreased 
appetite, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, nausea, ed ema peripheral, pruritus, pyrexia, rash, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], and vomiting. Twelve subjects in Study D6020C00001 receiving 
MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab had at least [ADDRESS_639058] across cohorts was pleural effusion (2 subjects). One subject in Study 
D6020C00001 received MEDI0680 monotherapy in expansion and had an SAE of abdominal 
pain.  
Immune-mediated reactions/immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) are considered to be 
AEs of special interest (AESIs). ImAEs are imp ortant risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
and are being closely monitored in c linical studies with durvalumab and MEDI0680 
monotherapy and combination therapy. See Section 5.3 for a summary of AESIs. 
The proposed combination of durvalumab with MEDI0680 has the potential to increase the 
frequency or severity of toxicities of monotherapy with either agent.

 31 of 178 Template 16.2 Overall Benefit-risk and Ethical Assessment  
There continues to be a high unmet need for new treatment options in advanced solid 
malignancies. An estimated 338,000 new cas es of RCC are diagnosed worldwide, 
approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis 
(Ferlay et al, 2015 ; Fisher et al, 2013 ; Motzer 2015 ). Recent approval of a check-point 
inhibitor monotherapy has afforded RCC patients an increased number of treatment options. 
However, there is an unmet need for additiona l treatment strategies for pa tients that do not 
respond or have limited clinical response to current therapeutic options. The study design 
aims to minimize potential risks by [CONTACT_497107]. Early safety 
assessment is in place for risks deemed most likely based on prior experience with 
durvalumab and MEDI0680. 
Based upon the available nonclinical and clinical sa fety data, the limited survival benefit 
provided by [CONTACT_497108], the limited life expectancy 
due to malignant disease, and the strengt h of the scientific hypotheses under evaluation, 
combination therapy with MEDI0680 and durvalumab proposed for evaluation in this study 
may provide meaningful clinical benefit with a manageable safety and tolerability profile by 
[CONTACT_497109], as compared with monotherapy. 
Therefore, the investigation of the potential th erapeutic efficacy of the combination of 
MEDI0680 with durvalumab in patients with selected solid tumors, including RCC is 
acceptable, and the overall benefit/risk asse ssment supports the proposed study design.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Description of the Study 
3.1.1 Overview  
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/[ADDRESS_639064] advanced 
malignancies. The study will be conducted at  approximately 50 study centers globally.  
The study includes 2 phases, dose-escalation and dose-expansion. In the dose-escalation 
phase, subjects with selected solid tumors  will receive MEDI0680/durvalumab combination 
therapy. In the dose-expansion phase, subjects with ccRCC will receive either 
MEDI0680/durvalumab combination therapy or nivolumab monotherapy. Changes initiated 
to the dose-escalation and dose-expansion phases as of Protocol Amendment 5 are described 
in Section 9.1.  
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 36 of 178 Template 16.2 In the dose-escalation phase, subjects may recei ve treatment for up to 12 months; in the 
dose-expansion phase, subjects may remain on treatment until unacceptable toxicity, 
confirmed PD, or development of other reason for treatment discontinuation. All subjects 
will be evaluated regularly. Clinical status will be classified according to modified 
RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) for subjects in the dose-escalation phase and by 
[CONTACT_393] v1.1 for subjects in the dose-expa nsion phase, and other disease-specific 
assessments (see Appendix 4). All subjects will be followed for s urvival until the end of 
study (see Section 6.3). Adverse events a nd SAEs will be followed as per Section 5. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose-escalation Phase  
In the dose-escalation phase, sequential cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 
6 dose-level cohorts: 0.1 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 3 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W, and 
increasing dose levels of MEDI0680 Q2W (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) with 10 mg/kg 
durvalumab Q2W. The dose-escalation phase will include immunotherapy-naïve (defined in 
Section 4.1.2) with solid tumors. As of Protoc ol Amendment 2, only subjects with NSCLC, 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head a nd neck (SCCHN), micr osatellite instability-high 
(MSI-high) colorectal cancer (CRC), bladder can cer, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, 
gastric cancer, or RCC will be enrolled.  
The dose-escalation phase will be executed according to a 3 + 3 design. If ≥ 2 of 6 subjects 
experience a DLT, a dose level from the intermediate zone-based cohort(s) that does not 
exceed the MTD or the highest protocol-defined  dose for each investigational product in the 
absence of exceeding the MTD may be expl ored (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for description of 
modified zone-based dose-escalation). Based on emerging safety, PK, pharmacodynamic, 
and clinical activity data for the MEDI0680 Q2W treatment schedule, the dosing interval for 
MEDI0680 could have been increased to every 4 weeks (Q4W; however, as of Protocol 
Amendment 3, this dosing schedule will not be implemented since dose-escalation is 
considered complete, see earlier versions of the protocol for more information on this dosing 
schedule). 
Any dose-level cohort in the dose-escalation phase that did not exceed the MTD can be 
expanded up to a maximum of 18 subjects  for further evaluation of safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity. 
Based on 6 dose-level cohorts in the main 3 + 3 dose-escalation design on a Q2W treatment 
schedule, up to 36 subjects may be enrolled. Additional subjects could be required if dose 
de-escalation occurs, intermediate dosing using the modified zone-based design is explored, 
or any dose-level cohort is expanded beyond 6 subjects.

combination with durvalumab Q2W and the MTD was not reached (See Section 1.4.1 for the 
number of subjects enrolled as of this amendment). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-expansion Phase 
The dose-expansion phase will begin after th e dose-escalation phase. Immunotherapy-naïve 
subjects (defined in Section 4.1.2) with ccRCC  will be randomized in  a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 
2 treatment arms: (1) MEDI0680/durvaluma b combination therapy or (2) nivolumab 
monotherapy. Stratification factors will incl ude the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center (MSKCC) risk group (0 = favorable risk; 1 or 2 = intermediate risk; 3 = poor risk; 
Motzer et al, 2002; see Appendix 7), and PD-L1 expression status ( ≤ 1% and > 1%). Up to 
40 subjects may be randomized in the ME DI0680/durvalumab combination therapy arm and 
up to 20 subjects may be randomized in the nivolumab monotherapy arm based on evaluation 
of emerging safety and efficacy parameters in  the current study as well as other ongoing 
studies. An interim futility analyses wi ll be performed for the MEDI0680/durvalumab 
combination therapy arm in the dose-expans ion phase after [ADDRESS_639066] that continued 
treatment may not be beneficial.  
The endpoints to be measured in this study are described in Section 2.

(Section 4.1.6). Only 1 round of retreatment will be allowed.   
Nivolumab will be administered accordi ng to the package insert guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Beyond Progression 
For subjects treated with MEDI0680 monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab, in the 
event of an initial assessment of PD (based on an  application of RECIST v1.1 to investigator-
assessed tumor measurements), a subject may continue to receive the assigned study 
treatment as long as none of the criteria listed below are met. 
• Confirmed PD: The assessment of PD by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 (baseline PD assessment) will be 
confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assessment time point, but no sooner 
than 4 weeks later. If any subsequent tumor assessment time point shows ≥ 20% increase 
in the overall tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), 
when compared to the baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and 
new lesions), the subject would be deemed as having confirmed PD and must be discontinued.  
• Meets any of the investigational pro duct discontinuation criteria (Section 4.1.6). 
• Clinical symptoms or signs indicating significant PD such as the benefit-risk ratio of 
continuing therapy is no longer justified. 
• Decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncol ogy Group (ECOG) performance status. 
• Threat to vital organs/critical anatomical s ites (eg, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention, and continuation of study therapy would prevent 
institution of such intervention. 
 
Subjects will be made aware of the potential benefits and risks of continuing the study 
regimens in the setting of PD by [CONTACT_428918].  
Nivolumab will be administered acc ording to the package insert guidelines.

In the dose-escalation phase, durvalumab will be administered Q2W for 12 months and 
MEDI0680 will be administered Q2W for 12 months (Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-1). In the 
dose-expansion phase, MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab (depending on assigned 
treatment arm) will be administered Q2 W until unacceptable toxicity, documentation of 
confirmed PD, or development of other reason for treatment discontinuation. 
In the dose expansion phase, nivolumab (depend ing on assigned treatment arm) will be 
administered Q2W as per the local (country-specific) package insert (or similar) until 
unacceptable toxicity, documentation of confirmed PD, or development of other reason for 
treatment discontinuation, according to the local (country-specific) package insert (or

 41 of 178 Template 16.2 3.1.3 Dose-escalation Phase: Dose- escalation and Modified Zone-based 
Design 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-escalation 
As of Protocol Amendment 3, enrollment in the dose-escalation phase is complete. 
Rules for dose-escalation and de-escalation are as follows: 1. A minimum of [ADDRESS_639069] 24 hours.  
3. All safety data will be reviewed by a study-specific dose-escalation committee before 
proceeding with an escalation or de-escalation decision. 
4. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design will be followed as summarized below: 
a. If 0 out of the 3 subjects in a dose cohort experience a DLT during the 
DLT-evaluation period, dose-escalation may pr oceed to the next planned cohort(s) 
with approval of the dose-escalation committee.  
b. If 1 of the 3 subjects in any dose cohort experiences a DLT during the 
DLT-evaluation period, that dos e cohort will be expanded to a total of 6 subjects. If 
no more than 1 of 6 subjects in the dose  cohort experiences a DLT, dose-escalation 
may proceed to the next planned dose cohort(s) with the approval of the 
dose-escalation committee. 
c. If [ADDRESS_639070] been exceeded a nd no further subjects will be enrolled 
into that dose cohort. The following options could be evaluated: 
◦ In the Primary Q2W schedule (see Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-1): 
▪ A previous lower dose cohort or an intermediate dose cohort  
▪ A switch to Q4W dosing for MEDI0680 
▪ An intermediate dose using the modified zone-based design 
◦ In the Alternative Q4W schedule: 
▪ A previous lower dose cohort or an intermediate dose cohort  
▪ An intermediate dose using the modified zone-based design 
5. Intermediate doses may be explored based on a zone-based design ( Huang et al, 2007 ). 
The modified zone-based design takes the initial dose-escalation along a predefined path 
(ie, main dose-escalation) until the MTD is  exceeded or the highest protocol-defined 
doses for each agent in the absence of exceeding the MTD are reached. Lower zones or doses in the same zone as the MTD or the highest protocol-defined doses for each agent 
in the absence of exceeding the MTD may be explored simultaneously with the dose-expansion cohort (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
6. If the MTD is exceeded for Cohort 1 (starting dose level):  
a. Based on ongoing review of emerging data from the current study as well as ongoing 
clinical studies with durvalumab and MEDI0680 (MEDI0680; monotherapy and 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 42 of 178 Template 16.2 combination therapy), the dosing interva l of MEDI0680 may be changed in which 
longer dosing intervals may be evaluate d in combination with durvalumab. For 
example, if the emerging safety profile of the combination precludes the Q2W dosing interval for MEDI0680, a longer dosing interval for MEDI0680 (MEDI0680; ie, 
Q4W) may offer the possibility of better tolerability for the combination. There can 
be escalation to explore higher dose cohorts based on a 3 + 3 escalation design (see Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-1) 
b. Dependent on emerging subject data, including safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, 
biomarker, and response among subjects on the Q4W dosing regimen, higher doses of 
MEDI0680 may be explored. 
7. If the MTD is not exceeded for Cohort 1, then higher cohorts will be explored using the 
3 + [ADDRESS_639071] dose 
evaluated on the Q2W schedule that did not exceed the MTD or a lower dose based on evaluation of emerging PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy parameters in the current study and other ongoing studies. 
8. Any dose-escalation cohort that has not ex ceeded the MTD can be expanded up to a 
maximum of 18 subjects for further evaluation of safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-limiting Toxicity  
Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during the dose-escalation phase. Non-evaluable 
subjects will be replaced in the same dose c ohort (see Section 4.1.7). Grading of DLTs will 
be according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03. 
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or highe r treatment-related toxicity that occurs during 
the DLT-evaluation period, including but not limited to: 
• Any Grade 4 imAE regardless of duration 
• Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis regardless of duration 
• Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-infectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration 
• Any Grade 3 imAE, excluding colitis and pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to 
≤ Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_497071] ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days  
• Any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days of the 
initiation of maximal supportive care 
• Liver transaminase elevation higher than  8 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or total 
bilirubin higher than 5 × ULN 
• Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 3 within 
≤ 7 days and Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with any clinically important bleeding 

MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 45 of 178 Template 16.2 • Any other toxicity that is greater than baseline grade, is clinically significant and/or 
unacceptable, and is judged to be a DLT by [CONTACT_121287]-escalation review committee 
 
The definition excludes the following conditions:  
• Grade 3 endocrinopathy, that is managed with  or without systemic corticosteroid therapy 
and/or hormone replacement therapy, and the subject is asymptomatic 
• Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (eg, inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease,  lymph nodes, etc) that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 within 
30 days 
• Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade 
 
Immune-mediated AEs are defined as AEs of immune nature (ie, inflammatory) in the 
absence of a clear alternative etiology. In th e absence of clinical abnormality, repeat 
laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm  significant laboratory findings prior to 
designation as a DLT. 
While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose-escalation are specified above, 
an AE not listed above may be defined as a DLT after a consultation with the sponsor and 
investigators, based on the emerging safety profile. 
Primary Escalation (Every 2-week Dosing of MEDI0680) Dose-limiting Toxicity 
Period 
The period for evaluating DLTs is the time period starting with the first dose of study drugs 
until the planned administration of the third dose of durvalumab and MEDI0680 during Q2W 
dosing. Subjects are considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if they receive the 
protocol-assigned doses of both durvalumab a nd MEDI0680 (ie, 2 doses of both durvalumab 
Q2W and MEDI0680 Q2W) and complete the safety follow-up through the end of the 
DLT-evaluation period, or experience a DLT during the DLT-evaluation period. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The MTD is defined as the highest dose within a dose-escalation cohort where no more than 
1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT.  
Dose-escalation is complete (see Section 1.4.1). An  MTD was not identified and the highest 
combination dose administered was 20 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 10 mg/kg durvalumab 
Q2W. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 46 of 178 Template 16.2 3.1.4 Dose-expansion Phase  
Dose-expansion will be initiated follo wing completion of the dose-escalation phase. 
Immunotherapy-naïve subjects with ccRCC will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
either 20 mg/kg MEDI0680 in combination w ith 750 mg durvalumab Q2W or nivolumab 
Q2W. Dose levels of MEDI0680 and durvalumab were selected based on data from the 
dose-escalation phase of this study, the ongoing FTIH MEDI0680 Study D6020C00002, and 
ongoing durvalumab studies and analyses (see Se ction 3.2.1). The dose level of nivolumab is 
the recommended dose for treatment of patients with advanced RCC.  
Prior to the removal of a MEDI0680 monotherapy arm in this protocol amendment, some 
subjects were randomized and began receiv ing MEDI0680 monotherapy. These subjects are 
to continue receiving 20 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2 W monotherapy until unacceptable toxicity, 
confirmed PD, or development of other reason for treatment discontinuation, and will follow 
the study procedures outlined in Section 4.2 for MEDI0680/durvalumab combination therapy 
(with the exception of durvalumab specific procedures). 
During the dose-expansion phase, subjects will be monitored for safety according to the same 
criteria employed during dose-escalation. If during the treatment period, ≥ 33% of subjects in 
the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination arm exper ience safety events meeting DLT criteria 
(even if outside of the DLT-evaluation period [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]]), randomization may be 
paused and study data will be reviewed to determine whether additional monitoring or 
alternate dose levels or treat ment schedules should be evaluated prior to further 
randomization. 
3.1.5 Management of Study Medication Related Toxicities 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications of Durvalumab and MEDI0680 
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab and MEDI0680 leading to T-cell activation 
and proliferation, there is the possibility of observing imAEs during the conduct of this study. 
Potential imAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], BMS-936558, and 
BMS-936559 and may include immune-mediated en terocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and 
endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; Topalian et al, 2012 ). Subjects 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of imAEs. In the absence of an alternate 
etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune-mediated etiology should be considered for signs 
or symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, he patitis, and endocrinopathy. Subjects should be 
evaluated to identify any alternative etiology 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 47 of 178 Template 16.2 1. In the absence of clear alternative etiology, all ev ents of an inflammatory nature should 
be considered to be immune-mediated 
1. Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_62613]-grade events 
2. Systemic corticosteroids should be considered  for a persistent low-grade event or for a 
severe event  
3. More potent immunosuppressives should be c onsidered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids (eg, infliximab, mycophenolate, etc) 
 
If the investigator has any question in regards to an AE being an imAE, the investigator 
should immediately contact [CONTACT_7195]. Do se modifications may not be required for 
AEs that are clearly not attributed to durva lumab or MEDI0680 (such as an accident) or for 
laboratory abnormalities that are deemed as ymptomatic, not deemed to be clinically 
significant, require no intervention, and are doc umented in the medical records. Laboratory 
abnormalities that are felt to meet these cr iteria must be discussed and agreed on by [CONTACT_497110] c ontinued. Dose reductions of durvalumab and 
MEDI0680 are not permitted. 
Treatment modifications of MEDI0680/durvalumab may be required in the event of 
treatment-related toxicity. General treatmen t modification and toxicity management 
guidelines are provided in Appendix 6. Additionally, management guidelines for adverse 
events of special interest (AESIs) are detailed  in Section 5.3. All toxicities will be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE V4.03. In case of doubt th e investigator should consult with the 
medical monitor.

ongoing FTIH study. The MEDI0680 starting dose will be 0.1 mg/kg administered by [CONTACT_497111] 1 and then Q2W (± 3 days) for 12 months. As of 02Nov2015, 58 subjects received 
MEDI0680 monotherapy (see Section 1.4.1). Dose levels included 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 
20 mg/kg Q3W, 10 and 20 mg/kg Q2W, 20 mg /kg QW × 2 and 20 mg/kg QW × 4. One DLT 
was reported.  
Durvalumab 
Durvalumab dose levels were selected based on data from the FTIH Study 
CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108. The dose selected for furthe r evaluation in the dose-expansion 
phase of Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is 10 mg/kg administered Q2W. This was based on 
evaluation of the current PK data in th e subjects enrolled in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 
where doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg Q2W were evaluated. Durvalumab exhibited 
nonlinear (dose-dependent) PK consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. Linear PK 
was observed at doses of 3.0 mg/kg and above an d is consistent with near complete target 
suppression, which is supported by [CONTACT_118423]-L1 s uppression data. Further,  the 10 mg/kg Q2W 
dose was not associated with any DLTs in the dose-escalation phase and was, therefore, 
selected for further evaluation in the dose- expansion phase of Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-
1108. For the current study, the starting dos e of durvalumab was 3 mg/kg, one dose level 
below the 10 mg/kg referenced above. 
Durvalumab will be administered by [CONTACT_239208] 1 and then Q2W (± 3 days) for 12 months. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-expansion Phase 
MEDI0680/Durvalumab Combination Therapy 
The dose-escalation phase of this study (D6020C00001) was completed as of the date of this 
amendment with the highest MEDI0680/durvalumab combination dose level administered 
being 20 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. A dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT) was reported in [ADDRESS_639073]. An MTD was not identified and no significant AE trends 
were observed across the dose levels evaluated.  
Following IV infusion of MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab, mean C max, trough 
concentration, and AUC τ values of MEDI0680 increased approximately dose proportionally 
from 0.1 to 20 mg/kg. Co-administration of durvalumab did not affect MEDI0680 PK 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 49 of 178 Template 16.2 compared to MEDI0680 monotherapy. Preliminary data from MEDI0680/durvalumab 
combination therapy in the dose-escalation phase  of this study suggest that target receptor 
occupancy is achieved at both the 10 + 10 mg/kg and 20 + 10 mg/kg dose levels of 
MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab in early assessments (first cycle). MEDI0680 
PK was linear with dose-proportional increases in serum concentrations from 0.1 to 20 mg/kg 
in combination with 10 mg/kg durvalumab administered Q2W.  
Durvalumab Weight-based Dosing to Fixed Dosing 
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from Study 
CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 (solid tumors; N = 292; doses = 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks). Population PK analysis indicated  only minor impact of body weight (WT) on 
PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) 
and fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvaluma b was evaluated by [CONTACT_497112] (5 th, median and 95 th percentiles) using the population PK 
model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median 
body WT of approximately 75 kg). A total of [ADDRESS_639074] variability with fixed dosing regimen. Thus, a fixed dosing of 
durvalumab 750 mg will be explored in the dos e-expansion phase of this study. The dose of 
20 mg/kg MEDI0680 Q2W with 750 mg durvalumab (fixed dose) Q2W was selected for the 
dose-expansion phase to maximize the likelihood of observing robust efficacy with tolerable 
safety profiles based on available PK , PD, and clinical response data.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_639075] historically shown respons iveness to immunotherapy (IMT) may benefit 
from complete pathway blockade. Solid tumors  such as melanoma (MEL), RCC and NSCLC 
are known to respond to IMT ( Brahmer et al, 2012;  Hodi et al, 2010; Motzer et al, 2015 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ). 
Rationale for RCC Population 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 50 of 178 Template 16.2 An estimated 338,000 new cases of RCC are diagnosed worldwide, with approximately 
30% of patients presenting with metastatic disease ( Ferlay et al, 2015 ; Fisher et al, 2013; 
Motzer et al, 2015 ). A number of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_497072], how ever, these treatments are associated with 
limited OS (< 2 years). A PD-1 -targeting agent, nivolumab, r ecently received approval for 
the treatment of patients with advanced RCC with its Phase 3 study stopped early after it was 
determined that nivolumab improved OS versus ev erolimus in subjects with advanced RCC 
(Motzer et al, 2015 ). The confirmed ORR (95% CI) in  this Phase 3 study was 21.5% 
(17.6, 25.8) based on independent review, suggest ing that some RCC patients are primarily 
nonresponsive or are only minimally res ponsive to nivolumab monotherapy ( Opdivo 
[nivolumab] Package insert, 2015 ). Thus, exploration of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_497073]. Following Protocol Amendment 5, 
nivolumab monotherapy was added as a comparator arm in the dose expansion phase to 
enable comparison of MEDI0680/durvalumab activ ity with the current standard of care.  
The mechanisms of action of anti-PD-[ADDRESS_639076]: while both 
inhibit the interaction between PD-1 and PD L1, only anti-PD-1 blocks PD-1/PD-L2 and 
only anti-PD-L1 blocks PD-L1/CD80 and support  for the combination strategy is provided 
by [CONTACT_497113] ( Curran et al, 2010 ). Based upon these observations, the complex 
feedback between pathways and differences in pathway blockade between agents, 
combination therapy with durvalumab and MEDI0680 may generate superior antitumor 
activity compared to either monotherapy. This may translate into high rates of response in 
tumors known to respond to therapeutic agents  that target PD-[ADDRESS_639077] safety parameters, and enhanced monitoring for 
imAEs, will be employed to assess the sa fety profiles of MEDI0680 in combination with 
durvalumab or nivolumab monotherapy.

MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639078] on safety and efficacy. Expression and localization of 
PD-L1 will be examined to determine if it is  a predictive biomarker for response to therapy. 
The endpoints chosen to assess secondary ob jectives are commonly used in oncology studies. 
Pharmacodynamic and Predictive Exploratory Endpoints 
The goals of exploratory assessments are to identify predictive markers (measures of a 
subject’s health or immune status  prior to treatment that correlate with clinical response) and 
to characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of MEDI0680 and durvalumab (changes in a 
subject’s immune status following treatment a nd correlations with drug exposure and clinical 
response). The rationale for the exploratory endpoints is based on ongoing studies of 
MEDI0680 and durvalumab, as well as knowledge gained in clinical studies with other 
cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The collections are being synchronized in the monotherapy and 
combination treatment studies to enable comparisons of the pharmacodynamic markers and 
predictive markers among the two monothera pi[INVESTIGATOR_497074]. 
Collection of tumor biopsy specimens, as well as whole blood, and plasma specimens, are 
needed to assess the requested pharmacodynamic and predictive markers. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were also analyzed  in dose escalation but were removed for dose 
expansion as of Amendment 5. Tumor biops y specimens provide critical information about 
the status of the antitumor immune response, at  the site of disease. Since the antitumor 
immune response can evolve with time and in response to different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], fresh pre-
treatment biopsies, when clinically feasible, provide more relevant information than archival 
biopsies. During dose-expansion, optional posttr eatment biopsies will be collected at 
approximately Day 57 and end of treatment (EOT).  If available, the pretreatment and Day 57 
biopsies will be compared to assess changes in the tumor microenvironment after one cycle 
of treatment, at a time when active tumor regression has occurred in subjects receiving 
durvalumab monotherapy treatment. The EOT biopsy specimens will be evaluated to 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 52 of 178 Template 16.2 understand potential mechanisms of resistance in  tumors that remain following treatment. 
Peripheral specimens (whole blood, PBMC, and p lasma) indicate a subject’s overall immune 
status and can provide insight into  the antitumor immune response. 
Pharmacodynamic Markers 
Receptor targeting and occupancy is being ev aluated using the sPD-L1 assay (durvalumab) 
and the PD-1 flow cytometry assay (MEDI0680). These assays are especially useful during 
dose-escalation and may help to inform dose s election for the dose-expansion phase; these 
assays will not be conducted in the dose-expa nsion phase as of Protocol Amendment 5. 
The functional consequences of complete pathway blockade will be evaluated by [CONTACT_497114]. Similar evaluations are 
being conducted in conjunction with monot herapy studies, to understand the functional 
consequences of each agent alone.  
Changes in the immune response in the tumor microenvironment will be assessed using 
multiple approaches. Expression and localizati on of key molecules such as PD-L1, PD-L2, 
and PD-1 within the tumor microenvironment may be examined by [CONTACT_9064] 
(IHC). Biopsy specimens may also be evaluated for changes in the frequency, phenotype, 
and/or localization of infiltrating T cells and APC. Gene expression profiling will be used to 
evaluate a broader panel of markers that indicate the level of inflammation within the tumor 
microenvironment and the balance between mark ers of immune suppression versus action in 
T cells and APC.  
Changes in the immune responses in the periphery are also being evaluated using multiple 
approaches. Flow cytometry assays may be us ed to evaluate factors such as phenotype, 
expression of activation markers, proliferation, and production of cytokines and effector 
molecules, by [CONTACT_497115] T cells, B cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell 
(MDSC). Gene expression analysis (evaluation of messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA] 
and/or micro ribonucleic acid [miRNA]) of peri pheral blood specimens and/or cryopreserved 
PBMC may also be conducted. Plasma specimen s will also be collected prior to treatment 
and at several posttreatment time points to enable evaluation of circulating soluble factors 
indicative of immune response (eg chemokines, cytokines, soluble re ceptors, and antibodies 
to self-antigens and tumor antigens), cancer biomarkers, and tumor DNA.  
Other pharmacodynamic markers may be evaluated as determined by [CONTACT_91010].

 [ADDRESS_639079] lik ely to respond to treatment with durvalumab and 
MEDI0680. Similar evaluations are being c onducted in conjunction with monotherapy 
studies for both agents. 
Tumors can express PD-L1 as a mechanism of ad aptive resistance to an activated immune 
response within the tumor microenvironment. Fresh and/or archival pre-treatment biopsies 
will be collected from all subjects and analyzed  by [CONTACT_497116]-L1 may be a predictive marker for re sponse to treatment with durvalumab and 
MEDI0680. 
The combination of durvalumab and MEDI0680 may be  especially benefic ial in cases where 
PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and CD80 are all expressed in the tumor microenvironment. 
Expression of PD-1, PD-L2, and CD80 may be evaluated using IHC and/or other methods, to 
determine whether expression of multiple path way molecules may be a predictive marker for 
response to treatment with durvalumab and MEDI0680. 
Expression of additional immune-related markers in the tumor microenvironment may also 
be conducted by [CONTACT_69162]/or other methods. Ge ne expression analysis of pre-treatment 
biopsy specimens may also be conducted to determine whether certain baseline patterns of 
mRNA/miRNA expression, such as markers of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment, 
correlate with response. Results of these expl oratory studies may suggest predictive markers 
for response to the combination treatment.  
Pre-treatment biopsy specimens may be analy zed for the presence of key mutations; these 
may include but are not limited to epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506], Kirsten rat sarcoma 
oncogene homolog (K-ras), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene (N-ras), APC, B catenin, 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and C-MNNG HO S transforming gene, as mutational status 
may impact tumor immunogenicity and mechan isms of tumor immune evasion. Correlations 
between key mutations and response to  the durvalumab and MEDI0680 treatment 
combinations may be evaluated.  
The general status of the immune system may al so affect responsivene ss to immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including MEDI0680 and durvalumab. Pre-treatment numbers of total T cells, CD4 T cells, 
CD8 T cells, B cells, and NK cells per mL of peripheral blood, the relative populations of 
these lymphocyte subsets, and the relative  frequency of proliferating, naïve, effector, and 
memory T cells, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_497117] D6020C00001 Amendment 5

(see Section 4.1.6) regardless of the reason (with drawal of consent from further treatment, 
due to an AE, other), will be identified as  having permanently discontinued treatment.  
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from treatment in the absence of disease 
progression will be asked to come in for every protocol-specified visit and will follow all 
protocol procedures with the exception of dosing . For subjects refusing to return to the site, 
they should be contact[CONTACT_457] [ADDRESS_639105] to follow-up, starts

survival until the end of the study. Subjects who decline to return to the site for evaluations 
should be contact[CONTACT_12090] 3 months as an alternative. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lost to Follow-up 
Subjects will be considered lost to follow- up only if no contact [CONTACT_497120] (as defined in Section 6.3) such that there is insufficient 
information to determine the subject’s status at that time. 
• Subjects who refuse continuing participati on in the study including phone contact [CONTACT_497121] “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow-up.” Investigators 
should document attempts to re-establish contact [CONTACT_95094]. If contact [CONTACT_4490] a missing subject is re-established, the subject should not be considered lost to follow-up and any ev aluations should resume according to the 
protocol.

to follow-up, the subject starts alternative trea tment, or the subject is enrolled in another 
clinical study. 
4.1.7 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects in the Phase 1/dose-escalation cohorts are considered evaluable if they receive the 
protocol-assigned dose(s) of both durvalumab and MEDI0680 (ie, 2 doses of durvalumab 
Q2W and 2 doses of MEDI0680 Q2W) and complete the safety follow-up through the end of 
the DLT-evaluation period or they experien ce a DLT during the DLT-evaluation period. 
Non-evaluable subjects in the dose-escalati on cohorts will be replaced in the same dose 
cohort. No subjects will be replaced in the dose-expansion phase. 
4.1.[ADDRESS_639107]’s consent to the us e of data does not have a specific expi[INVESTIGATOR_69089], but the subject may withdraw consent at any time by [CONTACT_95129]. If 
consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior  to that time may still be given to and used 
by [CONTACT_497122]. 
Samples Obtained for Genetic Research or Future Research 
Samples obtained for genetic research or future research will be labeled with a sample 
identification number but will not be labeled with personal identifiers such as the subject’s name. If the subject withdraws consent for partici pating in the future research, this link will 
allow the sponsor to locate the subject’s sample and destroy it. The coding of samples and 
results is to ensure that these research results  are kept confidential by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_95068]’s 
identity and these results separate.  
If the subject consents to have his/her samples  used for genetic research or future research, 
this additional research may not start imme diately and may start at any time during the 
storage period. The subject’s sample(s) including  any specimens of extracted DNA will be 
stored by [CONTACT_316760] a secure central laboratory. 
The subject’s samples will not be kept for more than [ADDRESS_639108] chooses not to allow his/her study samples to be 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639109]’s sample is sent 
to the sponsor for genetic research or future rese arch, the investigator will arrange to have it 
destroyed. If consent is withdrawn after the sub ject’s sample(s) have been sent to the sponsor 
for genetic research or future research, the spons or and the investigator w ill ensure that these 
sample(s) are destroyed unless the sample identification number has been removed and the 
subject can no longer be linked to any sample(s) . However, if the subject’s sample(s) have 
already been used for research, the sponsor is not  required to destroy results of this research. 
In this case only the remaining sample(s) will be destroyed.

time, it is preferred that assessments are pe rformed in the following order: 12-lead ECG, vital 
signs, and then blood draws. The timing of the first two assessments should be such that it 
allows the blood draw (eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the exact nominal time. 
All subjects will be followed for survival un til the end of the study regardless of further 
treatments, or until the sponsor ends the study. S ubjects who decline to return to the site for 
evaluations should be contact[CONTACT_497123] 3 months for 12 months and then every 
6 months. Subjects who are permanently discont inued from treatment because of toxicity in 
the absence of disease progression will be asked to come in for every protocol-specified visit 
and will follow all protocol procedures with the exception of dosing.

[IP_ADDRESS] Solid Tumors 
See Appendix 5. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 76 of 178 Template 16.2 4.3.2 Archival Tumor Samples, Bone Marrow Biopsies, and Tumor Biopsies 
[IP_ADDRESS] Archival Tumor Samples 
Archival tumor samples are required for all su bjects (dose-escalation and dose-expansion 
phases) and must be deemed available during the screening period. FFPE tumor samples will 
be collected for IHC and additional correlativ e markers (eg, tumor mutation analysis, 
ribonucleic acid analysis, and immunodiversity). If a tumor block cannot be provided for this 
study, then only freshly cut sections should be provided as described in the Laboratory 
Manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Biopsies 
If the subjects are unable to verify availability of archival tumor samples, as mentioned in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], then baseline fresh tumor biops ies will need to be obtained prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drugs  for the dose-escalation phase or prior to 
randomization for the dose-expansion phase.  
Subjects in the dose-expansion phase are en couraged to provide on-treatment fresh tumor 
biopsies on Day 57 (could be performed up to [ADDRESS_639127] not be performed after  dosing of investigati onal treatment) if 
clinically feasible (ie, repeat biopsy does not pose unacceptable medical risk to a subject as 
determined by [CONTACT_093]). In addition, biopsies may be performed if clinically 
indicated, at the time of progression and at the end of treatment . For subjects who require 
serial image-guided core needle tumor biopsy, it will be performed ac cording to institutional 
practice. These post-treatment biopsies are opti onal. Tumor lesions used for biopsy should 
not be lesions used as RECIST target lesions. 
An evaluation of a possible correlation between clinical activity of durvalumab and 
MEDI0680 and potential biomarkers (eg, PD-L1 expression on tumor) will be ongoing 
throughout the study. For the dose-escalation phase, tumoral PD-L1 expression will be 
assessed on screening samples after enrollment on an ongoing basis. For the dose-expansion 
phase, tumor tissue (FFPE archival or fresh tumor tissue) must be received by [CONTACT_497125] (block or unstained slides) and evaluab le for PD-L1 expression status in order to 
randomize a subject to study treatment.  
Tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be les ions used as RECIST target lesions, unless 
there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy. If a RECIST target lesion is used for biopsy the 
lesion must be ≥ [ADDRESS_639128] diameter. Additiona l tumor biopsies are permitted as 
clinically indicated (eg, for mixed responses or upon PD). If clinically practical, at each time 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639129] core 
biopsies will be placed in formalin and proce ssed for FFPE, while the second and fourth core 
biopsies (fourth biopsy, if available)  will be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then 
stored at -80°C. In exceptional cases, excisiona l or punch biopsies are permitted and may be 
substituted for the required minimum of 3 core biopsies if sufficiently large (4 mm or greater 
in diameter). 
Tumor biopsies will be stored at MedIm mune or an appropriate vendor selected by 
[CONTACT_24540]. Core biopsies may be used for biomarker and pharmacodynamic studies using 
methods such as IHC, IF, tumor mutation analysis, and gene expression analysis. Additional 
details for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
4.3.3 Medical History and Physical Examination 
Physical examinations will be performed on stud y days noted in Section 4.2. A full physical 
examination will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, musculoskeletal, neurological, psychiatric, 
dermatological, hematologic/lymphatic, and en docrine systems; weight; and height (at 
screening only). A smoking questionnaire will be administered at screening (dose-escalation 
only). Abbreviated symptom-directed physical  examinations will be conducted post-
screening, except for a full physical examination at the end of treatment and end of study. 
Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, pulse oximetry [at screening only], and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be measured on study days  noted in Section 4.2. On Cycle 1 Day 1 in 
the durvalumab and MEDI0680 combination arm,  vital signs will be measured within 
30 minutes prior to the start of durvalumab administration (± 30 minutes), 15 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) post-end of infusion (EOI) of durvalumab, and at 10 minutes (± 5 minutes) and 
60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post-EOI of MEDI0680. For all other combination dose days, vital 
signs will be measured 30 minutes (± 30 minutes) prior to  durvalumab administration, 
15 minutes (± 5 minutes) post durvalumab EOI, and 10 minutes (± 5 minutes) and 
30 minutes (± 5 minutes) post MEDI0680 EOI. 
In the nivolumab arm, on Cycle 1 Day 1 vital sign s will be measured within 30 minutes prior 
to the start of nivolumab (± 30 minutes), a nd at 10 minutes (± 5 minutes) and 60 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) post-EOI of nivolumab.  All ot her nivolumab dose days will measure vital 
signs 30 minutes (± 30 minutes) prior to i nfusion and 10 minutes (± 5 minutes) post EOI. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 78 of 178 Template 16.2 Electrocardiograms will be recorded on study days as noted in Section 4.2. 
Electrocardiograms recorded at screening will be obtained in triplicate (all [ADDRESS_639130] 1 minute apart). On Cycle [ADDRESS_639131] or nivolumab and as clinically indicated. For abnormal ECGs or if 
clinically indicated ECGs are required, they sh ould be obtained in triplicate (all [ADDRESS_639132] 1 minute ap art). In case of clinically significant ECG 
abnormalities, including an ECG that dem onstrates a QTcF value > 500 milliseconds, 
2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained ov er a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) and the 
average of all 3 ECGs should be used to confirm prolongation.  
Findings from medical history (obtained at scr eening) and physical examination shall be 
given a baseline grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of 
pre-existing conditions during the study will be  considered AEs, with resolution occurring 
when the grade returns to th e pre-study grade or below.

serum will be collected in samples taken according to the schedules of procedures presented 
in Section 4.2. 
4.3.7 Biomarker Evaluation and Methods 
Blood samples will be collected and analyzed to evaluate protein, nucleic acid and 
cellular biomarkers according to the schedules presented in Section 4.2. 
The numbers of T cells, B cells, and NK cells as well as subsets of T cells may be evaluated 
in whole blood by [CONTACT_4133]. Additional flow cytometric assessment of immune-cell 
phenotypes and function will be conducted; these may include evaluating phenotype, 
expression of activation markers, proliferation, and production of cytokines and effector 
molecules, by [CONTACT_497115] T cells, B cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.  
Blood samples will be collected for analysis of circulating soluble factors in relation to T-cell 
activation. They may include but are not limi ted to soluble CTLA-4, soluble B7-1/B7-2, 
soluble IL-6R, vascular endothelial growth facto r, fibroblast growth factor, IL-1 IL-2, IL-4, 
IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, granzyme B, IFN, C-X-C motif chemokine 10, suppressor of cytokine 
signaling 3, a proliferation inducing ligand, B- cell activating factor, insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2, the presence of IFN- γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α), IL-2, 
IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-[ADDRESS_639135] and tumor antigens and explore their association with treatment and 
clinical outcome. Additionally, levels of circulating tumor DNA may be evaluated in 
response to treatment and relationship with clinical outcome.  
In the dose escalation phase, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated from whole 
blood, preserved, and stored for flow cytometry of additional cell types such as immune 
regulatory populations which may include myeloid-derived suppressor cells, subsequent 
functional analysis or assessment of the diversity of the immune cell repertoire, its 
relationship to clinical responses, and changes in response to treatment with durvalumab and 
MEDI0680. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells may also be used for gene expression 
analysis. 
Whole blood samples will be collected in PAXgene tubes and stored frozen at -80°C for 
miRNA and/or mRNA sample preparation. Ribonucleic acid may be used in the analyses of 
transcript and/or miRNA expression and stored for future analyses. Ribonucleic acid analyses 
may be conducted to generate hypotheses associated with the mechanisms of action of 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 82 of 178 Template 16.2 durvalumab and MEDI0680 as well as to identify subsets of subjects responsive to the 
durvalumab plus MEDI0680 treatment combinations evaluated in this protocol. 
For dose-expansion randomization, all subjects’ tumor tissue will be tested for expression of 
PD-L1 through a central vendor, as determined by [CONTACT_497126] (SP263) IHC assay. Subjects 
with advanced or metastatic ccRCC who are naïve to immunotherapy will be randomized 2:1 
into one of two arms with either MEDI0680 in combination with durvalumab or nivolumab 
monotherapy. Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_497127] (0 = favorable risk; 1 or 
2 = intermediate risk; 3 = poor risk; see Appendix 7), a nd PD-L1 expression status ( ≤ 1% and 
> 1%; Motzer, et al 2002 ). 
Tumor biomarkers, including but not limited to the expression level and localization of 
PD-L1 protein on tumor cells (by [CONTACT_497128]) and the T-cell number and phenotype in 
tumor tissues will be evaluated in archived and fresh tumor samples for any relationship with 
subject response to treatment.  
Archived material and/or fresh biopsies may be analyzed for the presence of key mutations 
which may include but are not limited to: EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, APC, B catenin, ALK, and 
C-MNNG HOS transforming gene to evaluate their  potential relevance and correlations with 
response to the treatment combinations used in this protocol. Analysis of mRNA and/or 
miRNA in archived and/or fresh tumor tissue may be performed to identify a predictive or 
posttreatment signature [CONTACT_497156]. 
Other biomarkers may be evaluated as determined by [CONTACT_91010]. Details for sample 
collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.

durvalumab, 26 mM histidine/histidine-hydrochloride, 275 mM trehalose dihydrate, 
0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 80, at pH 6.0. Each carton contains 4 single-dose vials. White labels 
will be applied to cartons and vials containing durvalumab. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639139] will be supplied to the site in vials in coded kits. Each kit has a 
unique number that is printed on all labels within the kit (ie, the outer carton label and the 
label of each vial within the carton).  
If there are any defects noted with the inve stigational product, the investigator and site 
monitor should be notified immediatel y. Refer to the Product Complaint section 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) for further instructions. 
Durvalumab Dose Calculation 
Dose-escalation Phase 
The dose will be calculated using the following formula: 
By [CONTACT_8497]:  Dose (mL) = [subject wei ght (kg) × durvalumab dose level (mg/kg)] 
            5 0  m g / m L  
where 50 mg/mL is durvalumab concentration after reconstitution. 
The corresponding volume of durvalumab should be rounded to the nearest tenth mL 
(0.1 mL). Dose adjustments for each cycle are on ly needed for greater than 10% change in 
baseline weight. 
Dose-expansion Phase 
A fixed dose of 750 mg (ie, 15 mL) durvalumab will be administered for all subjects 
randomized into the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination arm.  
Durvalumab Dose Preparation Steps 
No incompatibilities between durvalumab and polyethylene, polypropylene, 
polyvinylchloride, or polyolefin copolymers have been observed. Durvalumab does not 
contain preservatives and any unused portion must be discarded. Preparation of durvalumab and preparation of the IV bag are to be performed  aseptically. Total in-use storage time from 
needle puncture of durvalumab to start of admini stration should not exceed 4 hours at room 
temperature or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F ). If storage time exceeds these limits, a 
new dose must be prepared from new vials. 
Durvalumab requires reconstitution prior to use.  The reconstitution should be performed with 
4.[ADDRESS_639140] foaming. Commercially available sterile WFI will be supplied by [CONTACT_30107]. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639141] ituted durvalumab should stand undisturbed at 
room temperature for a minimum of 5 minutes or until the solution clarifies. The 
reconstituted solution should appear clear or slightly opalescent. A thin layer of bubbles on 
the liquid surface is considered normal. 
Durvalumab will be administered using a 250 mL IV bag containing 0.9% (w/v) saline and 
delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.22 or 0.2- μm in-line filter. To prepare the 
durvalumab saline IV admixture, a volume of 0.9% (w/v) saline equal to the calculated 
volume of durvalumab to be added to the IV ba g must be removed from the IV bag prior to 
addition of durvalumab. The calculated volume of durvalumab is then added to the IV bag, 
and the bag is mixed by [CONTACT_471385]. 
Following preparation of the dose, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered 
as an IV infusion for approximately [ADDRESS_639142] be re corded in the source documents. 
Durvalumab Administration Guidelines 
Each dose of durvalumab should be administered using the following guidelines: 1. Investigational product must be administered at room temperature by [CONTACT_83752] a peripheral vein. Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at room temperature to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures. 
2. A physician must be present at the site or immediately available to respond to 
emergencies during all administrations of i nvestigational product. Fully functional 
resuscitation facilities should be available. Investigational product must not be administered via IV push or bolus but as a slow IV infusion. The entire content of each IV bag will be infused using an infusion pump. 
3. The infusion lines should be attached only at  time of use. Lines used for infusion during 
dose administration will need to be equipped with 0.22- or 0.2 μm in-line filters.

 88 of 178 Template 16.2 MEDI0680 Dose Preparation  
Thawing techniques include 3 options: 
• Option 1 (preferable) – Remove from carton the vial(s) required for the subject’s dose 
and place in a secure refriger ator approximately 3 to 4 hours prior to use. This technique 
allows MEDI0680 to thaw slowly wh ile still being refrigerated. 
• Option 2 – Remove from carton the vial(s) re quired for the subject’s dose and place on a 
countertop in a secure location and thaw at room temperature. This technique will 
take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours to thaw MEDI0680. 
• Option 3 – Remove from carton the vial(s) re quired for the subject’s dose and place on 
the counter within a laminar flow hood and thaw via circulating airflow. This technique will take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour to thaw MEDI0680. 
 
IMPORTANT: Do not remove vial cap until fully thawed and removed from the 
laminar flow hood. 
Mixing - Ensure that the contents of the vial are completely thawed before drawing the 
subject’s dose. Gently swirl the solution to completely mix the contents. Do not shake the 
vial. Do not foam the vial contents . 
Infusion of MEDI0680 should begin within 4 hours of completion of thaw. 
MEDI0680 Preparation of Intravenous Dose 
The IVBP is required for intravenous dose preparation of MEDI0680.  
For the 20 mg/kg dose level, the dose will be  prepared directly using the investigational 
product. Calculate MEDI0680 dose using the following formula:

MEDI0680 Dose Preparation Steps 
The dose of MEDI0680 for administration must be prepared by [CONTACT_497131]. Only remove the required 
MEDI0680 and the IVBP vials required for subject dosing from storage. 
No incompatibility between MEDI0680 and plas tics (polyolefin, polyethylene and polyvinyl 
chloride) has been observed when used along with IVBP. IV bags must be free of latex and 
di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Polypropy lene and polycarbonate syringes should be 
used for dose preparation. Infusion line should contain a 0.22 or 0.2 μm in-line filter. 
Follow the guidelines of the IV bag manufacturer for maximum number of allowable 
punctures through the injection port; if needed, us e an intermittent ad aptor on the injection 
port for dose preparation. 
For all dose levels, IVBP must be used to precondition the IV bag prior to addition of 
MEDI0680 (specific instructions below). 
Preparation of 20 mg/kg dose for IV infusion: 
• Add the calculated volume of 0.9% saline (described below) in an empty IV bag to 
achieve 60 mL dose delivery volume using following equation: 
◦ Equation 2:  Volume of 0.9% saline required to add in IV bag = 60 mL – 
(Investigational Product + 1 mL IVBP)  
• To this bag, add [ADDRESS_639146] as de scribed below (Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1).

Dose preparation steps common for all dose levels are as follows: 
1. Select the IXRS-assigned number of vials of in vestigational product required to prepare 
the subject’s dose. 
2. After thawing, all investigational produ ct vials should be equilibrated to room 
temperature for [ADDRESS_639147] manager should remove 
the tab portion of the vial cap and clean the rubber stopper with 70% ethanol or equivalent and allow to air dry. To avoid foaming, the vial should not be shaken.  
4. For ease of preparation, a 1.5-inch 19-gauge withdrawal needle is recommended. Use a 
new needle for withdrawing investig ational product from each vial.  
5. Gently mix the contents of the infusion bag. The resulting mixture should be inspected to 
ensure that the solution is clear. 
 
MEDI0680 Administration Guidelines 
The day of dosing with investigati onal product is considered Day 1. 
Each dose of MEDI0680 should be administered using the following guidelines: 1. Investigational product must be administered at room temperature by [CONTACT_83752] a peripheral vein. Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at room temperature to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures. 
2. A physician must be present at the site or immediately available to respond to 
emergencies during all administrations of i nvestigational product. Fully functional 
resuscitation facilities should be available. Investigational product must not be administered via IV push or bolus but as a slow IV infusion as per Table [IP_ADDRESS]-2. The entire content of each IV bag will be infused using an infusion pump. 
3. The infusion lines should be attached only at time of use. Lines used for infusion during 
dose administration will need to  be equipped with 0.22- or 0.2- μm in-line filters. 
4. Some investigational product may remain in the IV line after the infusion is completed. 
15 to 30 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride IV solution should be added to the infusion bag 
after the investigational product has been admi nistered to flush the line (infusion rate 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 91 of 178 Template 16.2 should not be changed) or complete the infusion according to institutional policy to 
ensure the full dose is administered and document if the line was not flushed. 
 
The duration of the investigational produc t administration will be recorded. 
Table  [IP_ADDRESS]-[ADDRESS_639148] Solution Volume by [CONTACT_497132] (mg/kg) Total Investigational Product Solution Volume Per Bag (mL) 
20 60 
 
MEDI0680 will be administered by [CONTACT_12781] a minimum of 30 minutes at dose levels 
of 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg, over a minimum of 60 mi nutes at dose levels of > 2.5 mg/kg up to 
a total dose of 1200 mg, and over a minimum of 90 minutes at total doses > [ADDRESS_639149] solution needed to 
prime the IV tubing (see example below). This step is necessary because the same volume of 
saline will be needed at completion of the infusi on to flush the IV tubing in order to deliver 
the complete volume of investigational produ ct solution. Because the IV tubing contains 
investigational product solution, the flush must  be infused using the same infusion rate as 
that used for the investigational prod uct solution in the infusion bag. 
Example: 
If the IV tubing capacity is [ADDRESS_639150] 15 mL of 0.9% normal saline via 
infusion pump at the same rate as dosing. 
The start time of the investigational product i nfusion will be the time the infusion of the 
investigational product solution from the infusi on bag (with IV tubing already primed with 
investigational product solution) is started. Th e stop time of the infusion should be the time 
the IV tubing has been flushed to administ er the residual invest igational product solution. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nivolumab 
For information on nivolumab, refer to the lo cal (country-specific) package insert (or 
similar).

MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 92 of 178 Template 16.2 [IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Dose Administration 
Subjects will be monitored during and after infusion of durvalumab, MEDI0680, or 
nivolumab (see Section 4.3.3).  
In the event of Grade ≤ 2 infusion-related reaction, th e infusion rate of durvalumab or 
MEDI0680 may be decreased by 50% or temporarily interrupted until resolution of the event 
(up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.  
Refer to the local (country-specific) package insert (or similar) for guidance on dose 
administration and modification for subjects in the nivolumab arm. 
Primary prophylaxis against infusion-related reacti ons is not permitted during this study in 
order to avoid obscuring potential safety signal and enable a future assessment regarding 
whether pre-medications should be required for a ll subjects in future studies. However, at the 
discretion of the investigator, secondary prophyl axis (ie, prevention of infusion-related 
reaction following initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) is appropr iate and will be permitted. Acetaminophen 
and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydra mine) or equivalent medications may be 
administered per institutional standard as secondary at the discretion of the investigator. If the infusion-related reaction is Grade [ADDRESS_639151]  be trained to recognize and treat 
anaphylaxis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Product Complaints 
Any defects with the investigational product must be reported immediately  to the

4.8 Statistical Evaluation 
4.8.1 General Considerations 
Tabular summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_32024] . Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_497134]. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. All anal yses will be based on the As-treated Population, 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639161] analyzed 
according to the treatment they actually receive. Additional details of statistical analyses will 
be described in the statistical analysis plan. 
4.8.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
A total of approximately 96 subjects could be  required for both the dose-escalation and 
dose-expansion phases. For dose-escalation, the number of subjects will depend upon the 
toxicities observed as the study progresses. Up to approximately 36 evaluable subjects could 
be required by [CONTACT_941] 3 + 3 design with 6 dose cohorts in the main dose-escalation design. 
Additional subjects could be required if dose de-escalation occurs, intermediate dosing using 
the modified zone-based design is explored, the dosing interval of MEDI0680 is changed, or 
expansion of a dose-escalation cohort occurs. Subjects in the dose-escalation phase are 
considered evaluable if they receive the protocol-assigned doses of both durvalumab and 
MEDI0680, and complete the DLT-evaluation period or experience a DLT during the 
DLT-evaluation period. Non-eval uable subjects will be rep laced. The table below provides 
the probability of dose-escalation to the next  higher level for each underlying true DLT rate. 
For example, for a common toxicity that occurs in 10% of subjects, there is a greater than 
90% probability of escalating to the next hi gher dose level. Conversely, for a toxicity that 
occurs with a rate of 60%, the probability of escalating to the next higher dose level is less 
than 10%.

escalating dose 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.009 0.001 
DLT = dose-limiting toxicity. 
 
For the dose-expansion phase, up to approxim ately 60 subjects (40 subjects in the 
MEDI0680/durvalumab combination therapy arm and 20 subjects in the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm) may be randomized at the select ed combination dose (ie, MTD or highest 
protocol-defined dose for each agent in the ab sence of exceeding the MTD) in a 2:[ADDRESS_639162] v1.1 
(Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) to investigator-assessed tumor measurements. Assuming an ORR for

MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 97 of 178 Template 16.2 nivolumab monotherapy of 21.5%, the sample size is  chosen to detect a difference in ORR of 
26.0% (ie, ORR = 47.5%) with 76% power at a 1-sided significance level of 0.10. The 95% 
CI of a 47.5% ORR (19 responders / 40 subjects) based on the exact probability method is 
31.5%, 63.9%. The assumption of a nivolumab monot herapy ORR of 21.5% is based on the 
data from the nivolumab package insert (see Section 1.5). 
4.8.3 Safety Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Maximum Tolerated Dose Eva luation (Every 2-week Dosing Schedule) 
The MTD evaluation will be based on the DLT-evaluable Population which includes all 
subjects enrolled in the dose-escalation phase who receive 2 protocol-assigned doses of 
durvalumab and MEDI0680 and complete the sa fety follow-up through the end of the 
DLT-evaluation period, or experience a D LT during the DLT-evaluation period.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Safety Endpoints 
The safety evaluation will be based on the As-treated Population and will include AEs, 
SAEs, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physic al examinations. Summary statistics will 
be provided for AEs, SAEs, and AE grade, and relationship to investigational product, 
reported from start of treatment with durvalumab and MEDI0680 or nivolumab alone. 
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 and described by [CONTACT_497135]. 
Laboratory abnormalities with toxicity grades according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 will be 
derived and summarized. Safety analyses will be descriptive in nature and no formal 
statistical comparison will be made. 
4.8.4 Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints 
For the dose-escalation phase, efficacy analyses will be based on an application of modified 
RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_639163] 
v1.1 to investigator-assessed tumor measurements and blinded independent central review 
(BICR). The efficacy analysis will be  based on the As-treated Population.  
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 98 of 178 Template 16.2 The following efficacy endpoints will be an alyzed. More details will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan. 
ORR (primary endpoint) is defined as the proportion of subjects with a Best Overall 
Response (BOR) of confirmed CR or confirmed PR. ORR will be estimated with a 95% CI 
using the exact probability method. For the dose-expansion phase, comparison of arms will 
be obtained from Fisher’s exact test. 
DCR at 16 weeks (DCR16) is defined as the proport ion of subjects with a BOR of confirmed 
CR, confirmed PR, or SD (maintained for ≥ 16 weeks). A similar definition applies to 
DCR24. DCR16 and DCR24 will be estimated wi th a 95% CI using the exact probability 
method.  
Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time fro m the first dose of treatment until the first 
documentation of a subsequently confirmed OR. Only subjects who have achieved OR will 
be evaluated for TTR. The median TTR and its 95% CI will be assessed using the Kaplan-
Meier method. 
Duration of response (DR) is defined as th e time from the first documentation of a 
subsequently confirmed OR until the first documentation of a disease progression 
(subsequently confirmed for dose escalation phase ) or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. Only subjects who have achieved  OR will be evaluated for DR. The median DR 
and its 95% CI will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as th e time from the first dose of treatment until 
the first documentation of a disease progressi on (subsequently confirmed for dose escalation 
phase) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The median PFS and its 95% CI will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to 
estimate the PFS curve and the PFS rate at time points of interest.  
Overall survival (OS) is defi ned as the time from the first dose of treatment with durvalumab 
and MEDI0680 or nivolumab until death due to any cause. The median OS and its 95% CI 
will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to 
estimate the OS curve and the OS rate at time points of interest. 
4.8.5 Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Exploratory pharmacodynamic analyses may include but are not limited to: 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 99 of 178 Template 16.2 1. Dose escalation only: Serum sPD-L1 levels will  be measured to evaluate their association 
with drug exposure, and response to treatment with durvalumab and MEDI0680 or MEDI0680 alone 
2. Dose escalation only: Levels of PD-1 e xpression and MEDI0680 receptor occupancy on 
peripheral blood T cells before and after treatment may be measured to evaluate 
associations with drug exposure, response to treatment with durvalumab and MEDI0680 
3. Flow cytometric assessment of cell populations such as T cells, B cells, and 
myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) will be performed before and after treatment to evaluate its association with drug exposure and response to treatment with durvalumab 
and MEDI0680; analysis may include characterization of phenotype, expression of activation markers, proliferation, and producti on of cytokines and effector molecules  
4. Levels of circulating soluble factors, which may include cytokines, chemokines, growth 
factors, soluble receptors, and antibodies ag ainst tumor and self-antigens, will be 
evaluated before and after treatment may be examined in relation to treatment with durvalumab and MEDI0680 compared with nivolumab monotherapy 
5. Expression and localization of key molecules such as PD-L1, PD-L2, and PD-1 within 
the tumor microenvironment, as well as  the frequency, localization, and phenotype of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, may be examined in biopsy specimens by [CONTACT_4658], IF, and/or flow cytometry and correlated with response to treatment  
6. Expression of miRNA/mRNA in blood and/or tumor samples may be performed before 
and after treatment to examine gene expression patterns at baseline and changes in response to treatment and to try to identi fy a gene signature [CONTACT_497157] 
7. Genetic profiling of pre-treatment and posttreatment biopsy specimens may be performed 
to identify potential genetic predictors of response or resistance. This may include evaluation of key oncogenic mutations, and/ or mutations in immune-related molecules. 
 
4.8.6 Analyses of Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetics 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity 
Only subjects who receive at least one dose of both durvalumab and MEDI0680 (if 
assigned), and provide at least one posttreatm ent sample will be evaluated. Immunogenicity 
results will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_497136]-durvalumab or an ti-MEDI0680 antibodies. The immunogenicity 
titer will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of anti-durvalumab or 
anti-MEDI0680 antibodies. The impact of ADAs on PK and pharmacodynamics will also be 
assessed if data allow. Samples will be collected and banked for evaluating neutralizing 
capacity of ADAs in the future.

 100 of 178 Template 16.2 [IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
Only subjects who receive at least one dose of durvalumab and MEDI0680 (if assigned) and 
provide at least one posttreatment sample will be evaluated. Individual durvalumab and 
MEDI0680 concentrations will be tabulated by [CONTACT_497137]. 
The PK of durvalumab and MEDI0680 will be assessed using parameters including C max and 
minimum concentration (C min) after the first dose. Durvalumab and MEDI0680 steady-state 
PK parameters including concentrations at peak concentration at steady state (C max,ss ) and 
trough concentration at steady state (C min,ss ) will be estimated. Accumulation to steady state 
will be assessed as the ratio of C max,ss :Cmax and C min,ss :Cmin. All PK parameters will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis. Descriptive statistics of non-compartmental PK 
parameters will be provided. 
4.8.7 Exploratory Analyses 
Descriptive statistics will be the primary methods for the exploratory analyses. Depending on 
the nature of the data, geometric mean and ot her appropriate statistical summaries might be 
used as well. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune-related Response Criteria 
In order to more fully assess the efficacy of these immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], efficacy analyses will 
also be based on an application of immune-rel ated Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (irRECIST) (modified from Nishino et al, 2013)  to investigator-assessed tumor 
measurements. Endpoints to be summarized include: BOR, OR, DC, TTR, DR, and 
PFS.Tumor response by [CONTACT_497138] v1.1. The 
irRECIST is similar to RECIST v1.1 (Appendix 5) except for the following: 
• The measurements of the new lesions are included in the sum of the measurements of all 
target lesions and do not automatically c onstitute PD under irRECIST, whereas new 
lesions are not measured and automatically constitute PD under RECIST v1.1. 
 
4.8.8 Interim Analyses 
An interim futility analyses will be perform ed for the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination 
therapy arm in the dose-expansion phase after [ADDRESS_639164] 
accrual may be paused in both cohorts to ev aluate the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination 
therapy arm for futility. However, an accrual pause may not be necessary if existing data upon 
randomization of [ADDRESS_639165] no t been triggered as per the 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 101 of 178 Template 16.2 predefined futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. The purpose of the interim futility analysis will be for 
evaluation of key efficacy data for internal pr ogram decision as to whether to continue 
randomization of subjects. Continued randomizati on of subjects in both arms will be 
terminated if 2 (10%) or fewer response s within the MEDI0680/durvalumab combination 
arm are observed. For the futility analysis, a response is defined as either a confirmed or 
unconfirmed CR or PR as per RECIST v1.1. 
Futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_497081] a non-small probability (10%) to be greater than 
or equal to a target response rate of 25.1%.  If the true response rate is ≥ 25.1% there is a 
9.0% probability that the study will be stoppe d early erroneously (false negative). The target 
response rate was set so as to demonstrate an ORR at least as large as that of nivolumab 
based on investigator assessments, in a similar RCC population (ORR = 25.1 [95% 
CI: 21.0%, 29.6%]; Motzer et al, 2015 ). 
 
5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) E6 (R1) defines an AE as: 
 Any untoward medical occurrence in a p atient or clinical investigation subject 
 administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
 relationship with this tre atment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
 sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
 associated with the use of a medicinal product,  whether or not considered related to the 
 medicinal product. 
An AE includes but is not limited to any cli nically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. The term disease progress ion should not be reported as an AE or 
SAE, however, medically significant indivi dual events and/or laboratory abnormalities 
associated with disease progression (see definiti on of disease progression below) that fulfill 
the AE or SAE definition should be reported. An abnormal laboratory finding (including 
ECG finding) that requires medical interventi on by [CONTACT_093], or a finding judged by 
[CONTACT_497139]. If clinical sequelae are 
associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be 
reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 102 of 178 Template 16.2 urine red blood cells increased). Abnormal laboratory values that are not, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], medically significant and do not require intervention should not be reported as AEs. 
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emerge nt. A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new 
sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward me dical event that begins after written informed 
consent has been obtained but before the subj ect has received inve stigational product.  
Elective or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to the subject being 
enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-e xisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical event 
occurring during the prescheduled elective proc edure or routinely scheduled treatment should 
be recorded as an AE or SAE. 
Adverse Events Associated with Disease Progression 
Disease progression can be considered as a w orsening of a subject’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or in creases in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of a new metastasis  or progression of existing metast asis related to the primary 
cancer under study should not be considered an AE. Death clearly resulting from disease 
progression should not be reported as an SAE (see reporting guidelines in Section 5.4.3) . 
New Cancers 
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the investigational product and have been 
identified after the subject’s incl usion in the study. New metastatic lesion(s) of the subject’s 
known cancer should not be re ported as a new cancer. 
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that: 
• Results in death 
• Is immediately life-threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148078]  
• Results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 103 of 178 Template 16.2 • Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
Medical or scientific judgment should be exer cised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165433]; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. 
5.[ADDRESS_639166] for durvalu mab or MEDI0680 include but are not limited 
to events with a potential inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism and which may 
require more frequent monitoring and/or interve ntions such as steroids, immunosuppressants 
and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs are also being closely monitored in 
clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy a nd combination therapy. An imAE is defined 
as an AE that is associated with drug exposure an d is consistent with an immune-mediated 
mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, 
and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate,  should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. 
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or 
other etiologic causes of the imAE.  
If the investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an imAE, the investigator 
should promptly contact [CONTACT_5989]. 
Potential imAEs include the following: 
• Colitis, enterocolitis, and other co rresponding gastrointestinal disorders  
• Pneumonitis 
• Hepatitis and hepatotoxicity, including ALT/AST increases 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 104 of 178 Template 16.2 • Neuropathy and neuromuscular toxicity (ie, events of encephalitis, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathies, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis) 
• Endocrinopathy (ie, events of hypophysitis, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] (including diabetes 
insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562]), adrenal insufficien cy, hyper- and hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes mellitus) 
• Rash including dermatitis 
• Nephritis and increased creatinine 
• Pancreatitis (or laboratory tests suggestive of pancreatitis - increased serum lipase , 
increased serum amylase) 
 
Further information on these risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab and MEDI0680 Investigator’s Brochures. More specific 
guidelines for evaluation and treatment of these ri sks are described in detail in Appendix 6. 
5.3.2 Hepatic Function Abnormality (Hy’s Law) 
Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definiti on of Hy’s law (ie, any increase in ALT or 
AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 
2 × ULN) is considered an AESI. Concurrent fi ndings are those that derive from a single 
blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow-up 
investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_497140]/or wh ether there is objective evidence that clearly 
supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended 
gallbladder) or an agent ot her than the investigati onal product. See Appendix 6  for the 
definition and reporting of AESIs of hepatic function abnormality 
5.3.3 Infusion Reactions 
Adverse events of infusion reactions (also termed infusion-related reactions) are of special 
interest to the sponsor and are defined, for th e purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring 
from the start of the study treatment infusion up to 48 hours after the infusion start time. 
Guidelines for management of subjects with infusion-related reactions are outlined in 
Appendix 6. For all infusion reactions, the eCRF should be completed as instructed in 
Section 5.4, and all SAEs should be reported to MedImmune Patien t Safety as described in 
Section 5.5. 
5.3.4 Hypersensitivity (Including Anaphylaxis) Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylax is) been reported with anti-PD-L1 and 
anti-PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al, 2012 ). As with the administration of any foreign protein 
and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be caused by 
[INVESTIGATOR_24512] D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 105 of 178 Template 16.2 various mechanisms, including acute anaphylactic (immunoglobulin E-mediated) and 
anaphylactoid reactions against the mAb, and serum sickness, etc. Acute allergic reactions 
may occur, may be severe, and may result in death. Acute allergic reactions may include 
hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, 
hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze , cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, 
hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness. 
5.[ADDRESS_639167], possible etiologies, and whether the 
event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to MedImmune 
Patient Safety. See Section 5.2 for the definition of SAEs and Appendix 2 for guidelines for 
assessment of severity and relationship. If an AE  evolves into a condition that meets the 
regulatory definition of “serious,” it will be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Infusion of biological products is commonly a ssociated with infusion-related reactions. 
Anaphylaxis and infusion related reactions have some common manifestations and may be 
difficult to distinguish from each other. Infusion related reactions are commonly observed 
during or shortly after the first time exposure to  therapeutic monoclona l antibodies delivered 
through IV infusion. These reactions are less common following subsequent exposures. 
Unlike infusion related reactions, anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after 
subsequent exposure to an antigen, and it is  most commonly accompanied by [CONTACT_497141]. The investigator is  advised to carefully examine symptoms of 
adverse reactions observed during or shortly after exposure to MEDI0680 and durvalumab or 
nivolumab, and consider the above mentione d facts prior to making a final diagnosis. 
Reactions occurring at the time of or shortly after subsequent infusions of investigational 
product are to be judged by [CONTACT_327039]/her own discretion. For the investigator’s 
convenience and in order to facilitate cons istency in judgments a copy of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network (FAAN) guidance for anaphylaxis diagnosis is provided in Appendix 3.

• Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported and documented in the 
eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE. 
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due ) to disease progression, the AE causing the 
death must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should contain a comment 
regarding the co-involvement of disease progression, if appropriate, and should assign 
main and contributory causes of death. 
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem 
(autopsy) may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy 
of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to MedImmune Patient Safety or designee within the usual timeframes.

The sponsor is responsible for reporting certain SAEs as expedited safety reports to 
applicable regulatory authorities, ethics co mmittees, and participating investigators, in 
accordance with ICH guidelines and/or local re gulatory requirements. The sponsor may be 
required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being 
notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit additional 
information requested by [CONTACT_95110]. 
Investigators should provide all available in formation at the time of SAE Report Form 
completion. Investigators should not wait to co llect additional information to fully document 
the event before notifying MedImmune Patient Safety of an SAE. When additional 
information becomes available, investigators should submit a follow-up SAE Report Form 
(separate from the initial report form) with the new information. A ny follow-up information 
to an SAE also needs to be provided to MedImmune Patient Safety within [ADDRESS_639173] in excess of 
that specified in the Investigator’s Brochures, unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study subject with the investig ational product, with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to 
MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety  Fax Notification Form (see Section 5.[ADDRESS_639174] information). If the overdose results in an  AE, the AE must also be recorded on the 
AE eCRF (see Section 5.4). Overdose does not auto matically make an AE serious, but if the 
consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is 
serious and must be reported as an SAE (see Section 5.4 and Section 5.5). MedImmune does 
not recommend specific treatment for an ove rdose. The investigator will use clinical 
judgment to treat any overdose.

All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to the sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Maternal Exposure 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the c ourse of the study investigational product should 
be discontinued immediately. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_429001] a contraceptive 
medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abor tions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregna ncies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed 
up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs during the course of the st udy, then the investigator or other site 
personnel will inform the appropriate sponsor representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately 
but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event. 
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s patient safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar 
days for SAEs (see Section 5.5) and within  30 days for all other pregnancies. 
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available. 
The pregnancy reporting module in the eCRF is  used to report the pregnancy and the 
pregnancy outcome module is used to report the outcome of the pregnancy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Paternal Exposure 
Pregnancy of the subject’s partner(s) is not c onsidered to be an AE. However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital abnormality), occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_639175]’s last dose of 
nivolumab should, if possible, be followed up and documented.

10. Section 2.1, Section 2.2 and Section 4.8.4: Clarif ied that OR is the primary endpoint in 
dose expansion and clarified OS as a secondary endpoint. 
11. Section 2.1 and Section 2.2: Clarified saf ety endpoint and immunogenicity endpoint. 
12. Section 2.3.2 (Exploratory Endpoints): The following changes were made to this section: 
◦ This section was updated to account for the removed of the MEDI0680 monotherapy 
arm and addition of the nivolumab monotherapy arm. 
◦ Removed the potential for analysis of total mutational load, gene conformational 
changes or epi[INVESTIGATOR_497089] T-cell reception (TCR) diversity  
◦ Removed the specification that biopsies we re to be pre-treatment and posttreatment 
for IHC, IF and/or flow cytometry anal ysis for expression and localization of key 
molecules to reduce the burden for patients. 
◦ Clarified that sPD-L1 levels and receptor o ccupancy will only be measured in the 
dose-escalation phase as the data previously collected in the study are sufficient for analysis. 
13. Section 3.1.1 (Overview) and Section 4.1.1 (Number of Subjects): Changed the number 
of study centers from 80 to 50 as fewer subje cts are required following the change in 
study design.

Assessment of Severity 
Assessment of severity is one of the responsib ilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. Severity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 as provided 
below. The determination of severity for all ot her events not listed in the NCI CTCAE should 
be made by [CONTACT_497148] 1 to 5 as defined below. 
Grade 1 (mild) An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic inte rvention. The event does not 
generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. 
Grade 2 (moderate) An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual 
activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. 
Grade 3 (severe) An event that requires  intensive therapeutic intervention. The 
event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects the clinical status of the subject. 
Grade 4 (life threatening) An event, and/or it s immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental 
disabilities that affect or limi t the ability of the subject to 
perform activities of daily liv ing (eating, ambulation, toileting, 
etc). 
Grade 5 (fatal)     Death (loss of life) as a result of an event. 
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that 
persists for several hours may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be 
considered a nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477786]. 
 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639217]. 
An event will be considered “not related” to use of the investigational product if any of the 
following tests are met: 
• An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the investigational 
product and the onset of the event (eg, the event occurred either before, or too long after, 
administration of the investigational product for it to be considered product-related) 
• A causal relationship between the investig ational product and the event is biologically 
implausible (eg, death as a passenger in an automobile accident) 
• A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (eg, typi[INVESTIGATOR_316741] a concomitant drug and/ or typi[INVESTIGATOR_5194]-related event) 
 
Individual AE/SAE reports will be considered “r elated” to use of the investigational product 
if the “not related” criteria are not met.  
“Related” implies that the event is considered  to be “associated with the use of the drug” 
meaning that there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_316787] (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible 
causation). 
Relationship to Protocol Procedures 
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs 
that occur prior to the admini stration of investigational produ ct) as well as treatment-
emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occu r as a result of a procedure or intervention 
required during the study (eg, blood colle ction, washout of an existing medication). The 
following guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_497149]: 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 148 of 178 Template 16.2 Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the 
subject’s medical record. 
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in  the protocol (the alternative 
etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical 
record).

Network symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006;117:391-7. 
The NIAID and FAAN define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset 
and may cause death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to 
capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 
3 categories).  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak

b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated  symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e g, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e g, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age sp ecific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP 
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that

 [ADDRESS_639219] v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) and will be 
performed according to the schedule presented in Section 4.2. All images will be collected 
and stored for possible future central re-analysi s. All subjects will be followed for survival 
every 3 months (± 1 week) until [ADDRESS_639220] dose, and then every 6 months 
(± 2 weeks) until the end of the study (defined as [ADDRESS_639221] is enrolled or 
the sponsor stops the study). 
In the dose-escalation phase, RECIST will be modified so that PD must be confirmed at least 
4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the absence of clinical deterioration (ie, rapid 
disease progression or threat to vital orga ns/critical anatomical sites requiring urgent 
alternative medical intervention, decline in EC OG performance status, or symptoms or signs 
indicating clinically significant progressive diseas e). Treatment with investigational products 
(MEDI0680 and durvalumab) will continue between the initial assessment of progression and 
confirmation of progression (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for treatment beyond progression). In the 
absence of clinical deterioration, RECIST with  this modification may discourage the early 
discontinuation of the investigational products an d provide a more complete evaluation of its 
antitumor activity than would be seen with conventional response criteria. 
Tumor assessments should include the follow ing evaluations: physical examination (with 
photograph and measurement of skin lesions as  applicable) and CT or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans. Computed tomography or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
will be performed at screening and for res ponse assessment in all subjects. Computed 
tomography or MRI scan of the head and neck is  only required for subjects with SCCHN or 
for subjects with metastatic disease in the he ad or neck not involving the CNS. Computed 
tomography or MRI scan of the brain will be pe rformed at screening for subjects with known 
CNS metastatic disease or if the subject is neurologically symptomatic during the course of 
the study. The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast. If CT with 
contrast is contraindicated, CT without contra st is preferred over MRI. The same method is 
preferred for all subsequent tumor assessments. 
Physical examination 
• Lesions detected by [CONTACT_497150], eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes. Documentation by [CONTACT_497151]. 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 [ADDRESS_639222] scan  
• CT (contrast preferred) scans should be perform ed with contiguous cuts in slice thickness 
of [ADDRESS_639223] should be performed using a 5-mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm. 
 
MRI scan 
• MRI scan should use the same anatomical plane for serial assessments.  
• In case of MRI, measurements will be preferably performed in the axial (transverse) 
plane on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. However, there are no specific sequence recommendations. 
 
Measurability of Tumor Lesions  
Tumor lesions will be categorized as follows: 
• Measurable Lesions -  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
◦ [ADDRESS_639224] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the 
slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm)  
◦ 10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial) 
◦ For malignant lymph nodes to be consider ed pathologically enlarged and measurable, 
a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_639225] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm) 
• Nonmeasurable Lesions - Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions (or 
sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm in short axis). Lesions considered truly 
nonmeasurable include the following: leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusion, and inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly id entified by [CONTACT_497152]. 
• Target Lesions – At baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a 
maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in  which circumstance the next largest lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
• Non-target Lesions -  It is possible to record mult iple non-target lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item on the case report  form (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”). 
• New Lesions - If measurable, new lesions will be measured and included as target lesions 
in order to facilitate the e xploratory irRECIST analysis . Using irRECIST, up to 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 153 of 178 Template 16.2 5 additional new lesions (maximum of 2 additi onal lesions per organ) may be included in 
the tumor burden at each post-baseline assessmen t. Other new lesions will be followed as 
non-target lesions. 
 
RECIST v1.1 Response Criteria 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
• Complete Response -  Disappearance of all target lesi ons. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reducti on in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may 
not be “0” if there are target nodes).  
• Partial Response  - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
• Progressive Disease  - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (thi s includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the rela tive increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: The appear ance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression.) 
• Stable Disease  - Neither sufficient shrinkage to quali fy for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the sm allest sum of diameters while on study. 
 
Evaluation of Non-target Lesions 
• Complete Response -  Disappearance of all non-targe t lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm in short 
axis).  
• Non-complete Response/Non-progressive Disease  - Persistence of 1 or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tum or marker level above the normal limits. 
• Progressive Disease - Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions will be 
defined as the overall level of substantial wors ening in non-target disease such that, even 
in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discont inuation of therapy. In the ab sence of measurable disease, 
change in nonmeasurable disease comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large,” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to 
widespread. 
 
Appearance of New Lesions 
The appearance of new lesions is considered PD according to RECIST v1.1. Considering the 
unique response kinetics that have been obs erved with immunotherapy, new lesions may not 
represent true disease progression. In the absenc e of rapid clinical deterioration, subjects may 
MedImmune Protocol D6020C00001 Amendment 5 
MEDI0680  29Mar2017; Final 
 154 of 178 Template 16.2 continue to receive MEDI0680/durvalumab comb ination therapy or nivolumab monotherapy 
if investigators consider that subjects conti nue to benefit from treatment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Evaluation of Overall Response 
Confirmation of CR, PR is required by a rep eat assessment no fewer than [ADDRESS_639226] v1.1 to investigator-assessed tumor measurements and BICR. The efficacy analysis 
will be based on the As-treated Population. 
Overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target and non-target 
lesions with or without the appearance of new lesions are shown below.

of dosing. It is recommended that management of imAEs follow the guidelines 
presented in this table  
- Subjects should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant 
medications, infections, etc) 
- In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events 
should be considered potentially immune mediated. 
- Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_497091]-grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events  
- For persistent (greater than 3 to 5 days) low- grade (Grade 2) 
or severe (Grade ≥ 3) events promptly start prednisone PO 
1-2 mg/kg/day or IV equivalent  
- If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering 
28 days of taper), increase the c orticosteroid dose (prednisone 
dose [eg, up to 2-4 mg/kg/day or IV equivalent]) until 
stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume 
corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (> 28 days of taper) 
- More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg, 
infliximab) – (also refer to the individual sections of the 
immune mediated adverse event for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not 
responding to systemic steroids.  
- Discontinuation of study drug is not mandated for Grade

can interfere with an  individual’s health and participation in life activ ities. Even  with intensive 
rehabilitation many persons affected by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) will lead sedentary lifestyles. 
Individuals with SCI face a multitude of challenges due to physical difficulties that impact their 
health, independence, and satisfaction with life. With the integration of modern technology 
into rehabilitation, multiple techniques have been developed that combine our knowledge of 
walking with robotic technology.  Further, emerging research indicates that application of 
electrical  stimulation directly to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_547251].1-[ADDRESS_715947] current stimulation (tsDCS), has the ability to alter spi[INVESTIGATOR_547252] I.3-[ADDRESS_715948] excitability and 
neuroplasticity that leads to recovery  after SCI.  The purpose of this study is to determine 
whether tsDCS is safe for individuals with SCI.  In specific Aim  1, we will determine whether 
tsDCS is safe for patients with SC I. In specific aim 2, we will investigate the potential 
neurophysiological changes and functional improvem ents in gait for individuals with SCI after 
combined application of tsDCS and exos keleton assisted gait training. We  hypothesize that 
when subjects are receiving the tsDCS in combination with exos keleton training they will 
demonstrate an increased mag nitude in spi[INVESTIGATOR_547253], as compared to when subjects are receiving exos keleton training without tsDCS. 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND  INFORMATION 
As of 2014, there were an estimated 276,000 persons in the [LOCATION_002] living with a 
SCI, and an additional 12,500 new cases  added each year.  Of those injured, approximately  66%

may  regain  some  ability to ambula te over ground, ambula tion in the community and household 
may  be limited or impossible secondary to the physical demands encountered during gait. This 
contributes to an extremely limited number of steps taken per day, and often leads to a 
sedentary lifestyle.19 It is well appreciated that a sedentary lifestyle from paralysis co ntributes 
to many seco ndary medical problems such as diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis/osteopenia, 
urinary, pulmonary and cardiovasc ular disease.20-[ADDRESS_715949] shown that placing the body in a load bearing position and moving the lower  limbs

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/[ADDRESS_715952], limited research has investigated its use in the SCI 
population. Before this technology  could promote recovery  after SCI, further research  is needed 
to eva luate the safety and efficacy of this intervention. Therefore, the purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_547258].  It is hypothesized that use 
of tsDCS will l ead to measurable changes in spi[INVESTIGATOR_183862] (measured by H-reflex in soleus 
muscles) in individuals with SC I. We  further hypothesize that this potential neurophysiological 
change could lead to gait improvemen ts. To answer our questions, we will use exos keleton 
assis ted ga it training as a standard gait training interventi on in combination with tsDCS. 
 
OBJEC TIVES 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether tsDCS is safe for individuals with SCI. 
Specific Aim  1: To determine whether tsDCS is safe for patients with SCI.  There is one 
study that has utilized tsDCS in 17 individuals SCI17.  No adverse events were noted in this study, 
therefore we hypothesize that all subjects will tolerate the use of tsDCS without adverse 
reactions. 
Specific Aim  2: To investigate the potential neurophysiological changes and functional 
improvem ents in gait for individuals with SCI a fter combined application of tsDCS and 
exos keleton assis ted gait training. It has been demonstrated that use of tsDCS has an impact on 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_183862], however  there has been no investigation on the potential impact changes in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_547259]. We hypothesize that when subjects are 
receiving the tsDCS in combination with exos keleton training they will demonstrate an 
increased  mag nitude in spi[INVESTIGATOR_547260] s peed, as 
compared to when subjects are receivi ng exos keleton training without tsDCS.

Screening 
After informed consent is provided, the subject will undergo  a screening evaluation to 
assess s kin integrity, hip, knee, and ankle range of m otion, and spasticity. We will also perform 
assessme nts of functional mobility and measurements to ensure the individual will safely fit 
inside the robotic exos keletons. 
 
Baseline Visits 
Subjects will participate in two baseline visits, [ADDRESS_715955] on arrival and 40 minutes 
after initial assessme nt. Subjects will be asked to minimize their activity between assessme nts 
by [CONTACT_547293] a chair or lying on a mat. 
 
Training Visits 
Each training visit will involve  either an exos keleton intervention or a combined 
exos keleton and tsDCS interventi on. Subjects will participate in a total of 15 training visits.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  06/24/2016   
Exos keleton Interventi on: Each exos keleton intervention will last 20 minutes. During 
the exos keleton training sessio n, subjects will wear Ekso®, a lower  extremity exoskeleton 
robotic walking device. Initial training will focus on static and dynamic standing balance and 
weight shift training with the exos keleton and progress  to more difficult activities such as 
transitioning form sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit, walking, and turning. There will always be at 
least one trainer present during the training sessions to provide varying  levels of assis tance. As 
a subject's skill with the powered exos keleton improves, the need for trainer assistance will be 
proportionately reduced. At the conclusion of [ADDRESS_715956]. 
Safety: There will always be at least one trainer present during the training sessio ns to 
provide varying  levels  of assis tance. A 2nd staff will stand and walk with the subject if needed to 
ensure safety and prevent falls. Subjects will wear a safety harness attached to an overhead 
body weight support system to prevent  falls if necessary.  
 
tsDCS Intervention: tsDCS interventi ons will last [ADDRESS_715957] Current Stimulator.  Stimulation will be 
provided following published tsDCS protocol7, 17. One el ectrode (50 cm2) will be placed al ong 
center of spi[INVESTIGATOR_547265] T10. The reference electrode will be 
placed over  the R shoulder. Direct current intensity will be applied at 2.5 mA (0.05 mA/cm2) 
with a total charge of 60 mC/cm2 for 20 minutes. These stimulation parameters are below the 
known threshold for possible tissue damage38. 
Subjects will participate in individualized training sessio ns at UT Health Motor Recovery  
Laboratory at the NeuroRecovery  Rese arch Center at TIRR Memorial  Hermann.

Outcome  Mea sures 
Subjects will participate in a screening, 2 baseline visits and 15 intervention visits. 
Outcome  measures that will occur at baseline and during intervention visits and will include 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_547266] (H-Reflex) and [ADDRESS_715958]  (10MWT). 
Assessments: 
 Soleus H-reflexes:  H-reflex will be elicited by [CONTACT_547294] N. tibialis.  Surface electromyogra phy 
electrodes will be placed at  the soleus muscle of the testing leg to record the electrical- 
induced muscle activity. At the beginning of the test, stimulus thresholds and maximal 
amplitudes of H-responses (Hmax) a nd M-responses (Mmax)  will be asse ssed. The 
stimulus intensity applied to elic it H-reflexes  will be chosen  just below stimulus intensity 
required to elicit Hmax,  i.e. 0.9 times.  The size of each H-reflex will be measured as the 
peak-to-peak amplitude of the non-rectified EMG trace  (Figure 2). H-reflex mag nitude 
will be normalized by [CONTACT_547295] a percen tage of the amplitude of Mmax.

 [ADDRESS_715959] (10MWT): The 10MWT will assess  subject’s gait s peed.  Four marks 
will be placed on  the ground at 0, 2, 12 and 14 meters. Subjects will walk a total of 14 
meters. The middle 10 meters (between marks at 2 and 12 meters) will be timed and 
recorded as their gait speed. Subjects will perform a 10MWT without use of 
exos keleton. 
  Exos keleton user feedback: A questionnaire will be administered to allow participants 
to provide feedback regarding their experience after completion of treatment sessio ns. 
 
Treatment sessions: We will track  any signs of adverse  reaction to the tsDCS intervention such 
as skin irritation, complaints of pain or  discomfort continuously throughout subject’s 
participation.

DATA and SAFETY MONITORING 
We will use followi ng strategies  to prevent some  expected events for this study: 
1)   Loss  of confidentiality or privacy  
Information obtained for this study will be kept private to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371]. However, 
research information may be shared with the Universi ty of [LOCATION_007]  Health Science Center at 
Houston Institutional Review  Board  (IRB), the research physician investigator, the research  staff 
and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to 
research. 
The study will be performed  at UT Health Motor Recovery  Laboratory at the TIRR 
NeuroRecovery  Rese arch Center. 
Data will be collec ted on paper forms  which will be kept in a locked room in a locked filing 
cabinet in the research office. To allow for data analysi s, data will be de-identified and entered 
into an ex cel spreadsheet. All computers are password protected and therefore, only 
authorized persons have the access to the electronic files saved  in computers and will adhere to 
TIRR Memorial  Hermann standards. 
2)   Loss  of saved  electronic data after a computer crash 
All origi nal data will be maintained on paper data collec tion forms.  De-identified data may  be 
entered into computer for data analysi s.  A standard procedure of el ectronic file backup is 
established and enforced by [CONTACT_978]. All file backups are routinely performed in the local  hard 
drive.  
However, if there are other unanticipated problems which occur during and after data 
collec tion: the origi nal paper version of the data will be maintained in the locked file cabinet. 
3)   Loss  of balance or fall from testing 
One r esearch team member will remain next to the subject as long as the subject is donned in 
the exos keleton robot to prevent loss of balance or fall whether sitting or standing. If a fall or 
significant loss of balance occurs, one staff physician will be notified immediately. All adverse 
events will be reported per CP HS protocol. 
4)   Possible  skin irr itation 
Local  skin irr itation, bruising, swelling, or temporary discomfort following wearing of the 
exos keleton and/or post tsDCS intervention may  occur. Prior to tsDCS application and donning 
the exos keleton subject’s skin will be inspected by a licensed Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_182413], 
and compared after tsDCS interventi on and doffing exos keleton. Any differences will be 
recorded and followed up with the study physician ac cordingly.  All adverse events  will be 
reported per CP HS protocol. 
5)   Bone Fracture

STATISTICS 
Descri ptive statistical analysis will be performed to exami ne the trend of the outcome 
measures at baseline, interve ntion and combined intervention for each case study series. 
 
ETHICS   
 
The study will be performed  under the prevue and in accordance with the rules set by 
[CONTACT_547296] S ubjects (UT IRB). Potential subjects will be 
identified by [CONTACT_547297]/or on the inpatient wards at The 
Institute for Re habilitation and Rese arch (TIRR) Memorial  Hermann. Once identified, the 
potential subjects will be approached and asked if they wish to discuss a study utilizing 
electrical  stimulation and exos keletons (Robotic suits worn on the outside of the body) for 
individuals with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]. It will also be explained that choosing not to inquire further 
about the study will in no way jeopardize the relationship with anyone at TIRR or in the 
Memorial  Hermann system. Once the potential subject agre es he/she will be introduced to 
either the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_172356]-Inves tigator. Once the potential subject agre es to 
discuss the study, the individual and anyone that the potential subject wishes to accompany 
him/her will go into a private room to discuss the contents of the consent form with either the 
Principal Inves tigator or the Co-Inve stigator. After the consent is reviewed  in its entirety, and 
after allowing ample time for questions, either the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_172356]-Investigator 
will give the potential subject time to discuss the study with whomev er the potential subject 
cares to discuss the study with. If the subject agrees to enroll in the study, the Principal 
Inves tigator or Co-Investigator will review  the informed consent form with the subject in its 
entirety. 
 
DATA HANDLING  and RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_547269]’s name  [CONTACT_547301]. Each 
subject will be assig ned an identification number which will be used from this point forward. All 
measurements will be stored according to the identification number. All research materials will 
be kept in a locked file cabinet in the research office. All computers are password protected 
and only authorized persons have the access to the electronic files saved in computers. Paper 
data will be stored in the UT  Health Motor Recovery Laboratory research office in a locked file 
cabinet. Access to the file cabinet will be given  to the Primary Investigator and authorized team 
members. All electronic data stored on the hard drive of the desktop machine will be password 
protected and available only to the authorized research team members. Identifiable data will 
be stored for [ADDRESS_715962] after 5 years  as well. Identifiable data will be shredded at the end of 5 years  after the 
completion of the study.

Title PlacEbo -controlled, Randomized, patient -Selected Outcomes N -of-1 
triALs (PERSONAL -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]):  alpha -blockers for lower urinary tract 
symptoms  
Study Description  This study will focus on  determin ing if placebo -controlled N -of-1 
deprescribing trials can identify older men who are likely to benefit 
from stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_615973] . We 
will also assess recruitment, retention, and completion rates for the 
study and other secondary outcomes  among this population of older 
men receiving chronic tamsulosin therapy for LUTS to facilitate 
deprescribing decisions.  
Study Intervention  Participants will start with a 1 -week run-in period where they will use 
the PERSONAL Redcap surveys to track daily symptoms and side 
effects while taking only placebo study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] . Based on the 
pharmacokinetics and expected timeframe of symptomatic relief from 
tamsulosin (half -life=14 to 15 hours; steady state by [CONTACT_941] 5th day of daily 
dosing), all N -of-[ADDRESS_816720] a duration of 12 weeks during which 
participants will complete the run -in and 2 cycles consisting of a pair of 
2-week treatment periods (taking tamsulosin  or placebo) separated by 
1 wee k of wash -out with placebo . The order of treatment periods within 
a cycle will be random (e.g. ABAB, BABA, ABBA, or BAAB) according 
to pre -filled bubble packs given to participants during their orientation 
visit, but all patients will undergo [ADDRESS_816721] symptoms (LUTS) 
using a modified version of the widely used American Urological 
Association Symptom Index (AUASI). This modified questionnaire 
includes daily questions regarding storage and voiding symptoms. All 
participants will also be presented a global urinary symptom bother 
question . 
 
Study Population  Older men age 55-80 years based on the following Inclusion criteria : 
• Male sex at birth.  
• An ICD -10 diagnosis consistent with BPH  
• Has been taking Tamsulosin for at least 12 months with active 
prescription  
• No history of urinary incontinence, acute urinary retention, recurrent 
urinary tract infections, obstructive kidney disease, or urethral stent  
• Able to speak and complete questionnaires in English.  
• Have an iOS or Android smartphone  
Primary Objective  To determine if placebo -controlled N -of-1 deprescribing trials can 
identify older men who are likely to benefit from stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_615974] : 1.0

Secondary 
Objectives  • To describe the recruitment timeframe, study retention, and 
questionnaire completion rates  
• To describe patient characteristics at baseline related to the 
condition and their medication  
• To assess medication side effects during the study  
• To describe magnitude of changes in quality of life (PROMIS -29) 
between treatment with tamsulosin and placebo  
Recruitment 
Methods  We will use a mix of secure electronic health record  messaging and 
phone calls to invite patients to enroll . 
Sample Size  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_615975] 20 older men with LUTS/BPH.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background : Lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia  (BPH)  
 
Lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS) comprise  a syndrome of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_615976] (i.e., storage  LUTS, such as urgency, 
daytime frequency, nocturia, etc.), or during the initiation and process of urination (i.e., voiding  
LUTS, such as weak stream, straining, incomplete voiding, etc.).1 More than 30% of men will 
develop clinically significant LUTS in their lifetime, and the majority of male LUTS, including both 
storage and voiding subtypes, are attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) .2 In 
addition to worse health -related quality of life,3-7 older men with LUTS/BPH have an increased risk 
of new mobility impairment, falls, fractures, disability, and death.8-[ADDRESS_816726] 
costs of treating LUTS/BPH in the [LOCATION_002] were $1 billion and increased to $[ADDRESS_816727] of caring for men with LUTS/BPH has increased 
dramatically.13,14 
 
Because m ore than 80% of men develop histologic evidence of BPH on autopsy by [CONTACT_654] [ADDRESS_816728] dominated the pharmaceutical 
and surgical treatment landscape for LUTS/BPH.  However, growing evidence suggests that older 
man are more likely to suffer from LUTS caused by [CONTACT_227396], non -prostatic  conditions that are not 
targeted by [CONTACT_421826], such as obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease, or heart 
failure.16,17 This is compounded by [CONTACT_615988]/BPH.18,19  
 
One consequence of our limited diagnostic accuracy for LUTS/BPH is that older men are 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_615977] (the new prescription rate for 
men with LUTS/BPH ages 50 -59 years increases from 15 to 32 per 100 person -years f or men ages 
60-64 years), and this trend is increasing over time.[ADDRESS_816729] potentially harmful side effects in older men (e.g., orthostatic 
hypotension and dizziness, falls, fractures, depression),22-28 leading to low adherence and high 
rates of discontinuation .29,30 In addition to being particularly susceptible to the harmful side effects of 
these medications, older men with LUTS/BPH have lower levels of physical activity, increased 
obesity and metabolic syndrome, and increased frailty,4,7,31 -33 which further increases their risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_615978].  
 
1.2 Background: Alpha blocker deprescription  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_275653], the impact of α1 -blockers compared to placebo on LUTS is small.[ADDRESS_816730]  that many patients, who are on α1 -blocker monotherapy or combination 
therapy with 5 -alpha -reductace inhibitors (5 -ARIs), can discontinue α1 -blocker therapy after initial 
improvement without the need to restart treatment.  35-[ADDRESS_816731] et al suggested that over 79% 
of patients taking α1 -blockers may be doing so inappropriately.[ADDRESS_816732] benefits and known harms, a more personalized and patient -centric 
approach is needed to ensure that only men in whom benefits outweigh the harms continue to 
receive chronic α1 -blocker therapy.

1.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Our eligibility criteria and screening procedures are established to exclude individuals for whom the 
study is not appropriate. Per the exclusion criteria, this includes patients with specific  urologic or 
psychiatric conditions . After obtaining participant consent, the screening process will include 
verification of these factors by [CONTACT_15370] . This multi -gated comprehensive approach should 
systematically identify and screen out any individual for whom this study is not indicated . There are 
no direct benefits to the participants (financial compensation is purposely not presented as a 
benefit), except as to their feelings of being involved as participants in an important research study. 
Additionally, patients will learn about their results regarding response to tamsulosin which may lead 
to better informed decisions of whether to continue the medication.  
 
This study will provide valuable insights into the feasibility of tamsulosin deprescription across a 
diverse patient population. The potential public health benefit to society in this study could be large, 
as we are targeting a common condition in older men (one in three older men develop LUTS/BPH 
in their lifetime). Our overarching goal is to build the evidence needed for a full -scale efficacy trial 
testing deprescription , thus this research has great potential to change the paradigms for 
LUTS/BPH management. Scientific and clinical knowledge gained from this study could  be 
extremely useful to practicing clinician , individuals, policy makers, insurers, and public health 
planners  developi[INVESTIGATOR_615979]/BPH . Thus, given the importance of 
knowledge to be gained  and the anticipated benefit to research participants and others , the risks to 
subjects are reasonable.

 5.0 SCREENING, CONSENT, RANDOMIZATION  
 
5.1 Screening  
 
Eligible patients at the UCSF Mission Bay and Parnassus sites will be identified through a medical 
records query  using MyChart Recruitment . Our inclusion criteria include patients who are already 
on the study drug, tamsulosin.  
 
My Chart Recruitment:  
MyChart (Apex) conducts a search for patients based on the study’s inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. This is a completely computer -aided search, meaning the computer —and not a person -- 
searches patient charts. When a patient is identified as potentially el igible, they receive an email 
from MyChart that says to log in to MyChart to read about a study they might be interested in. The 
email is short and is the same for every recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] —there is no patient -specific, study -specific or 
disease information in it.  
 
When the patient logs into MyChart, there is a new “Research” tab with template information  about 
participating in research and how to opt out of receiving recruitment messages. Then, the  patient 
can click through to learn about a specific study they may be eligible for.  The patient has the option 
of clicking a link/button to let the study team know that they are  interested in learning more about 
the study. Only if the patient takes this action will the study  team receive information about the 
patient. If t he patient clicks “No thanks” or simply does not  respond, they will not be contact[CONTACT_615995], they won’t receive any follow -up emails  from MyChart about this study, and their 
information will not be shared with the study team.   
 
If the patient indicates interest, o ur research staff will reach out to eligible patients for a telephone 
screening to determine eligibility. Phone screening will determine if the participant owns a personal 
smartphone, participant age, abbreviated medical history specifically checking for diagnosis of 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and use of tamsulosin for the past [ADDRESS_816737]. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 4 
treatment schedules  with 2 cycles each containing treatment blocks of tamsulosin and placebo (e.g. 
UCSF

 ABAB, BABA, ABBA, or BAAB) . Data  analysts, and investigators will remain blinded to participants’ 
randomization arm. Primary outcomes will be collected using self -administered questionnaires 
without risk of unblinding. Intervention status and any variables related to intervention status w ill be 
recorded and stored in a separate data base  by [CONTACT_615996] (CRC) .

 6.2 Assessments  
 
6.2.1  Medical screening  
 
The medical screening process is described in Section 5.1.  
 
6.2.2  Demographic/Clinical Information  
 
Demographic information (e.g., date of birth, race, ethnicity, marital status, education) will be 
recorded at Screening.  Clinical ly relevant  medical history, including history of current disease, other 
pertinent clinical conditions, and information regarding underlying diseases will be recorded at 
Screening.  
 
The following items should be reported:  
- Medical History: includes medical conditions that are commonly associated with LUTS, other 
urologic history, psychiatric history , health -related behaviors, and cardiovascular comorbidities . 
- Comprehensive BPH/LUTS treatment history: current/past/never use  of BPH/LUTS 
medications, procedures, behavioral  interventions  (e.g., pelvic floor physiotherapy , bladder 
training, timed voiding, double voiding , diet ) 
- Concomitant  Medications/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] : Every medication or treatment taken by [CONTACT_615997]. All concomitant 
medication and concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_615981] . 
Name, indication for administration, and dates of medication or therapy will be captured.  
 
6.3 Questionnaire  Data   
 
Once eligibility is determined, participants will complete a set of questionnaires, that is 
estimated to take approximately 60 minutes.  During week 14 (post -study) , a subset of 
questionnaires will be repeated .  During the study period, a smaller  questionnaire assessing  
lower urinary tract symptoms will be administered dail y via the phone app.  
 
Questionnaires to be completed for primary and exploratory  outcome assessment include:   
- International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)41: We will assess LUTS severity  via the 7-
item IPSS , which is the most widely used male LUTS instrument in both clinical and research 
settings. IPSS total score is continuous (range: 0 to 35) and ha s clinically relevant categories (0 -7, 
8-19, 20 -35) indicating no/mild, moderate, and severe LUTS, respectively, as well as validated 
storage and voiding subscores.42 The minimally important difference is 2 -3 points for the IPSS, 
based on therapeutic response to BPH surgery.43 
 
- Revised Patients' Attitudes Towards Deprescribing (rPATD)44: We will assess patient 
attitudes toward deprescribing using this standard set of 22 questions each graded on a 5 -point 
Likert scale. The subdomains include burden ( perceived burden of routine  medication taking), 
appropriateness (perceived benefits/harms of the medication), concerns about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (concerns 
related to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56007]), and involvement (perceived involvement in care and 
understanding of the medication).  
 
- Perceived benefit from tamsulosin : We will assess patient perceived benefit from 
tamsulosin by [CONTACT_7939] a single question of perceived benefit in which patients can choose between 3 
options: “none”, “little”, and “much” . 
 
- Satisfaction with chronic tamsulosin therapy : This will be assessed with a question with 4 
individual option choices: “ much satisfied”, “little satisfied”, “little dissatisfied”, and “much 
dissatisfied”.

PERSONAL  Page 16 of 30 Protocol Version Date: 01/20/2023  
  
- Voils DOSE -Nonadherence measure45: We will assess patient’s baseline adherence using 
this questionnaire which consists of two sections. The first summarizes the frequency of missed 
doses and the second section assesses the cause of the missed dose.  
 
- Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI)41: LUTS will be  assessed daily using a 
modified version of the widely used  Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI), including 
seven individual items on urinary frequency, urgency, intermittency, straining, weak urinary stream, 
incomplete bladder emptying, and nocturia . Specifically, we will adapt  the recall period to 24 hours 
from 1 month to allow for more frequent assessments .  This measure along with an additional 
quality of life question constitutes the IPSS score.  
 
- PROMIS -29 Profile 2.0: The Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS®) is a National Institutes of Health initiative to develop state -of-the-science self -report 
measures to assess functioning and well -being in physical, mental and social domains of health. 
PROMIS measures are potentially useful to screen for disability, ide ntify health care disparities, 
enhance communication between patients and clinicians, and improve population health.  
 
6.4 Study Assessments by [CONTACT_615998]:  
1) Eligible patients at the UCSF Mission Bay, Parnassus, and Zuckerberg San Francisco General

We will use  individual -specific effect estimates of tamsulosin treatment on daily AUASI to 
define strong responders (upper bound of 95% confidence interval ≤ -6.0), moderate responders 
(upper bound of 95% confidence interval > -6.0 and ≤0.0), and minimal/non -responders (upper 
bound of 95% confidence interval ≥0). We selected the minimum upper bound of 95% confidence 
interval  for strong responders based on the mean expected effect size of BPH surgery.  We 
selected the minimum upper bound of 95% confidence interval  for moderate responders  to identify 
individuals with a statistically significant decrease in AUASI.  Minimal/non -responders  will be defined 
as those without 95% confidence interval s that include 0, suggesting no statistically significant 
difference between treatments, or those with a lower  bound of 95% confidence interval ≥[ADDRESS_816743] of tamsulosin

side effects.  
To determine if there are carryover effects, we will include a variable indicating the sequence 
of each period (tamsulosin then placebo or placebo then tamsulosin) in the linear mixed model. To 
evaluate whether treatment effect is correlated with baseline characteristics , we will calculate the 
correlation between the random intercept and random treatment effect and used a likelihood ratio 
test to compare models with an unstructured covariance matrix versus an independent covariance 
matrix.  
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the feasibility outcomes. In general, frequency 
distribution and percentage will be used to summarize categorical variables and median with 
interquartile range (IQR) to describe continuous variables. 95% conf idence intervals (CIs) will be 
used to quantify the precision of these performance estimates.  
We will pre -designate drop -out rates of <15%, 15 -25%, and >25% as indicating optimal, 
acceptable, and inadequate participant retention during the 12 -week intervention period. Among 
non-dropouts , we will consider completion of >85%, 75 -85%, and <75% of questionnaire 
completion  to indicate optimal, acceptable, and inadequate intervention adherence, respectively.  
 
 
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a study participant, 
including any abnormal sign (e.g. , abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not 
considered related to participation in the research. Medical conditions or diseases present before  
starting study interventions should only be considered adverse events if they worsen after starting 
the interventions.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any AE that results in death, is life threatening, or places the 
participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, requires or prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in congenita l 
anomalies or birth defects, or any other important event judged by [CONTACT_616003] a participant based upon appropriate medical judgment.  
 
An unexpected problem  is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria: 1) is unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research 
procedures described in the protocol and the characteristics of the study populat ion; 2) is related or 
possibly related to participation in the research; and 3) suggests that the research places 
participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was p reviously known or recognized.  
 
10.2 Expectedness  
 
An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  “unexpected”  if it is not listed  above 
or included in the following list:  
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Erectile dysfunction  
• Decreased libido  
• Rhinitis  
• Fatigue  
UCSF  
Protocol Version  Number : 1.0 
PERSONAL  Page 21 of 30 Protocol Version Date: 01/20/2023  
 • Insomnia  
• Diarrhea  
• Constipation  
• Nausea  
• Back pain  
• Worsening lower urinary tract symptoms   
 
10.3 Attribution  
 
A suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is reasonable possibility 
that the intervention caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the intervention and 
the adverse event.  
 
The investigative team  will assign  attribution  of the possible  association  of the event  with the study  
intervention  using the following  definitions:  
 
Unrelated (nonattributable)  to the deprescription  intervention : The adverse  event  is clearly  not 
related  or is doubtfully  related  to the deprescription  intervention  
 
Related  (possibly attributable or attributable) to  the deprescription  intervention : The adverse  
event  may be related,  is likely  related,  or is clearly  related  to the deprescription  intervention  
 
10.4 Severity  
 
Signs or symptoms shall be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_616004]  (CTCAE) (use latest version at initiation of 
clinical trial).  When  specific  adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE, they are to be 
graded as mild, moderate, severe, or life -threatening according to the following grades and  
definitions:  
 
AE Severity Grading  
 
Severity 
(Toxicity 
Grade)   
Description  
 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 
(ADL)  
 
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
 
10.5 Reporting Requirements  
 
UCSF  
Protocol Version  Number : 1.0 
PERSONAL  Page 22 of 30 Protocol Version Date: 01/20/2023  
 For this study, new AEs or SAEs will be considered  reportable any time after the Baseline Visit 
until 7 days (for non -serious AEs) or 28 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. 
All events  should be  followed  to their resolution,  until the Investigator  assesses  them  as stable,  
irreversible,  or until the study participant  is lost to follow -up, whichever comes  first. 
 
The study coordinator will record all reported events in the adverse event log (including subject’s 
name, date, and event description). All SAEs occurring during the study must be reported to the 
appropriate study investigator within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_615983] -investigators on the action to be taken. This action and date of implementation 
will also be recorded in the adverse event log. The entire investigative team will participate in 
classifying events a s AEs, SAEs, or unexpected problems, as well as ‘non -attributable’, ‘possibly 
attributable’, or ‘attributable’ to the proposed study.  
 
The study will follow UCSF Reporting Requirements:  UCSF  requires  submission  of Adverse  Events  
that qualify  as: Any unexpected, physical, psychological or social research -related event which 
is definitely,  probably  or possibly  related to the study; where the risk is not included, or exceeds the 
nature, severity, or frequency described in the protocol, study consent form, or other study 
information previously reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
An unexpected AE also includes any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in subject withdrawal from study participation  
• Due to an overdose of study medication  
• Due to a deviation from the IRB approved study protocol  
 
11.0 PROTOCOL VIOLATION AND WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS  
 
11.1 Protocol Violation  
 
A protocol violation occurs when a study participant  or Investigator fails to adhere to specific  
protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, study participant  safety and primary 
endpoint criteria. Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to: 
 
• Randomization of a participant who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
• Inappropriate delivery of experimental or control interventions to participants in the wrong study 
arm 
• Use of prohibited co -interventions during the study treatment period  
• Any other deviation that presents significant risk or safety concerns to the   study participant  
• The investigative  team  will determine  if a protocol  violation  should  result  in withdrawal  of a study 
participant .

leaflet. Reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_615984]. When appropriate, 
outcome and follow -up data will be obtained, unless the participant specifically declines further 
follow -up. 
 
An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Significant  study  intervention  non-compliance  (compliance  is an aspect  of the study  objectives ) 
UCSF  
Protocol Version  Number : 1.0 
PERSONAL  Page 23 of 30 Protocol Version Date: 01/20/2023  
 • Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_3445]  
• Any event , medical condition , procedure, surgery,  or situation occurs such that continued 
collection of follow -up study  data would  not be in the best interest  of the participant  or might  
require an additional treatment that would confound the interpretation of the  study  
 
12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING  
 
12.1 Individuals Overseeing Data Management  
 
A Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will be assigned to the study. The responsibilities of 
the CRC include screening and enrolling subjects; data collection, abstraction, entry, and 
reporting; communicating with participants; scheduling study participant  visits; regulatory 
monitoring; and problem resolution and prioritization. The data collected for this study will be 
entered into a secure  database (REDCap). Source documentation will be available to support 
the computerized participant  record. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_615985].  
 
12.2 Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
 
Participant  data will be collected  using  protocol -specific  case  report  forms  (CRF).  Source  
documentation  will include  only those  documents  containing  original  forms  of data,  including  
clinic  charts,  shadow  files, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and clinician  notes. Data recorded directly on the 
CRFs designated as source documents (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of data) will 
be considered source data. All other data recorded on the CRFs will not be considered source  
documentation.  
 
12.3 Data Management Procedures  
 
All data collected on this protocol will be securely stored and managed in a REDCap database 
system at the University of [LOCATION_004] – San Francisco (UCSF) under the stewardship of the 
principal investigator.  
 
This database will be developed and maintenance performed with support of the School of 
Medicine (SOM) at UCSF. REDCap was developed by [CONTACT_29392]’s CTSA and is currently used 
and supported by [CONTACT_726] 1000 consortium partners. REDCap provides: 1) a strea m-lined 
process for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_188930] a database; 2) an intuitive interface for collecting data (with data 
validation and audit trail); 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to 
common statistical packages (SAS, SPSS, etc.); 4) branching  logic, file uploading, and 
calculated fields; and 5) a quick and easy protocol set -up. 
 
All connections to REDCap, both external and internal, occur over encrypted channels. 
Access to components of the system is role -based and can only be granted by [CONTACT_423079]. All collected information is stored on a standalone database server hosted by 
[CONTACT_25999]. The database server resides behind the UCSF internal firewall and access to the 
server is controlled via firewall rules.  
 
All collected data is backed up daily, both on the local server and by [CONTACT_616005].  
 
12.4 Data Quality Control and Reporting  
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor study participant  accruals and 
UCSF  
Protocol Version  Number : 1.0 
PERSONAL  Page 24 of 30 Protocol Version Date: 01/20/[ADDRESS_816745] 
periodic random -sample data quality and protocol compliance audits.  
 
12.5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Level of Risk :  
 
This study  involves  feasibility  testing  of a deprescription  intervention  with daily questionnaires  that 
is believed  to be overall  low-risk.  
 
Safety  
 
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_616006] 3 consecutive days during their N -of-1 trial  or if a dramatic worsening in 
their daily IPSS questionnaires are suggestive of increased risk of retention.   
 
Other risk mitigation  
 
The following procedures will be used to minimize risk and to ensure participant confidentiality both 
during and after the study : 
• The eligibility criteria is a rigorous list of inclusionary/exclusionary criteria to minimize risk and 
was approved by [CONTACT_616007] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Bauer . 
• All study files, folders, and records will be kept in locked file cabinets that can be accessed only 
by [CONTACT_3462].  
• All data w ith PHI  be securely exchanged in accordance with UCSF -approved policies.  
• The study databases are housed in REDCap, a secure cloud data collection system behind IT -
regulated and firewalls of the University of San Francisco, [LOCATION_004]. REDCap has the 
protections needed for storage of PHI and backup systems.  
• Each participant will be assigned a unique numerical study identifier which will be used on study 
materials instead of names or other individually identifying information.  
• Document s with participant identifiers ( e.g., name) are stored on secure server s located behind 
a fire wall  and accessed only by [CONTACT_21575] . 
• Information that could identify individual participants will not be released without written 
permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_110453], 
the NIH, the Office for Human Research Protections, or other gove rnment agencies responsible 
for protecting participant safety.  
• All investigators and support staff are HIPAA certified and have completed and are current with 
regard to IRB training.  
 
13.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
13.1 Informed Consent  
 
Prior to the enrolment of each participant , the risks, benefits and objectives of the study will be 
reviewed with the participant . Alternative, non -protocol, treatment options will be discussed with the 
patient. Pa rticipants will be informed that participation in this clinical trial is voluntary and that the 
participant may withdraw consent at any time.

 13.2 Potential Risks  
 
Our eligibility criteria and screening procedures are established to exclude individuals for whom 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_615986]. Our eligibility criteria and screening procedures are 
established to exclude individuals for whom the study is not appropriate. Per the exclusion criteria, 
this includes patients with certain urologic conditions or psychiatric conditions. After obtaining 
participant consent, the screening process will include verification of these factors by [CONTACT_15370]. 
This multi -gated comprehensive approach should systematically identify and screen out any 
individual for whom this study is contraindicated.  
 
Risks of Research Participation  – Participation in research involves some loss of privacy. We will 
do our best to make sure that all personal information gathered for this study is kept private. 
However, we cannot guarantee total privacy. There is also a minor risk to loss of confidentiality, 
either through the breach of data collected via the Internet, text messaging, or through the breach 
of secure study databases, physical files, etc.  There is also some risk due to randomization. The 
intervention may be more burdensome and may not have a beneficial effect on their health 
outcomes compared to usual care.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_816746] benefits to the participants (financial compensation is purposely not 
presented as a benefit), except as to their feelings of being involved as participants in an important 
research study. The potential public health benefit to so ciety in this study could be large, as we are 
targeting a common condition in older men (one in three develop LUTS/BPH in their lifetime). 
Scientific and clinical knowledge gained from this study could be extremely useful to practicing 
clinicians , individu als, policy makers, insurers, and public health planners.  Additionally, study 
results may help individual patient decided if they should stay on tamsulosin.  
 
This study will provide valuable insights into the feasibility of tamsulosin deprescription across a 
diverse patient population. The potential public health benefit to society in this study could be large, 
as we are targeting a common condition in older men (one in three older men develop LUTS/BPH 
in their lifetime). Our overarching goal is to build the evidence needed for a full -scale efficacy trial 
testing deprescription , thus this research has great potential to change the paradigms for 
LUTS/BPH manageme nt. Scientific and clinical knowledge gained from this study could be 
extremely useful to practicing clinician , individuals, policy makers, insurers, and public health 
planners  developi[INVESTIGATOR_615979]/BPH . Thus, given the importance of 
knowledge to be gained  and the anticipated benefit to research participants and others , the risks to 
subjects are reasonable.

form about other alternatives to participation. We will let participants know that they are free to 
choose not to participate in the study, and if they decide not to take part, there is no penalty to 
them. We will le t them know they can participate in other research studies at UCSF (if available and 
if they are eligible) or they can choose not to participate in any research studies. We also 
encourage them to talk to  their clinician  about their choices before deciding to take part in the 
study.

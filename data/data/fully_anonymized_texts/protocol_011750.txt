HRP-593 / v121917OBJECTIVES:
Up to 85% of stroke survivors have hemiparesis that affects the upper extremity (UE) on one side1 and 
usually impacts the hand more than shoulder and elbow2. Currently, for mildly impaired stroke survivors (about 
20-25%)3, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and modified CIMT have been reported to produce 
significantly greater gains in hand/arm function compared to conventional therapy4,5. However, intervention 
options for a large percent of stroke survivors, who have moderate to severe impairment, are lacking, since 
these individuals do not meet the inclusion criteria for CIMT6,7. 
Device use  has been studied to assist arm/hand function for individuals with moderate to severe 
stroke. Positive clinical outcomes have been reported8-10, but the quality of the evidence is low11. One of the 
factors that impact the effects of device-assisted interventions is how the device is used. We suggest that 
devices should assist the practice of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in a way that enhances the neural 
activities related to ‘normal’ motor patterns, and minimizes undesired activities related to suboptimal 
compensatory movements. Most of these compensatory movements are obligatory, due to the loss of 
independent joint control, which is clinically called ‘synergy’. 
The importance  of practicing ADLs has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_824897]/arm interventions in 
mildly impaired individuals6. However, when success in ADL tasks becomes the primary goal, individuals 
frequently develop compensatory movements12 and evoke neural activities unrelated to the required 
movements. As demonstrated in animal models, compensatory neural activities negatively impact 
neuroplasticity and motor recovery13-18. Conversely, trainings that restrict compensation heightened 
ipsilesional plasticity and enhanced motor recovery20-22, which is defined as the restoration of a back to 
pre-injured state at the levels of function, performance, and neural acvitivites16,19. This has prompted the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_824851]19.
We aim to investigate the feasibility of maximizing hand motor recovery and minimizing compensation via 
practicing ADLs in an anti-synergy environment in the more severely impaired chronic post-stroke population. 
Specifically, we propose to use devices to address 2 major issues that are commonly presented in this 
population:  1) inability to open the paretic hand23,24, and 2) abnormal UE synergic movement patterns, defined 
as the abnormal coupling between shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers23,25,26. Recently, we developed and tested 
an EMG-triggered functional electrical stimulator (named ReIn-Hand) to assist voluntary hand use during the 
practice of ADLs and found promising preliminary results in gaining finger extension ability and UE motor 
function27-30. We also have evidence demonstrating that ACT3D robotic modulation of shoulder abduction 
(SABD) loading during active reaching can reduce the UE synergy both acutely and long-term31-34. By [CONTACT_824898]-Hand with a robot, we propose a reaching-graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-retrieving-releasing (GR3) intervention in individuals 
with moderate to severe chronic stroke. This design aims to practice ADLs in an ‘anti-synergy’ pattern, via 
augmenting hand opening by [CONTACT_824899]-Hand and minimizing the effects of the UE synergy by [CONTACT_166736], to maximize 
potential motor recovery. We will measure not only the intervention-induced changes in clinical outcomes, but 
also in UE kinematics and functional and morphologic neuroplasticity to disentangle motor compensation versus 
recovery. 
Aim 1: We will measure the intervention-induced changes in clinical outcomes. We will recruit 60 
individuals with moderate to severe (10≤ Fugl-Meyer≤ 40, and Chedoke≤ 4) chronic (>1 year) hemiparetic stroke, 
who will be randomly assigned to 2 different groups. The experimental group will receive a ReIn-Hand+robot 
assisted GR3 intervention, and the control group will receive a dose-matched ReIn-Hand assisted GR3 
intervention without robot mediation of SABD load. All stroke participants will be examined using validated 
clinical assessments twice pre-intervention, post-intervention (within one week immediately after the end of the 
intervention, and at 3-months follow-up. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have greater 
improvements than those in the control group, as primarily measured by [CONTACT_824900].
Aim 2: We will measure the intervention-induced changes in UE kinematics while performing hand 
opening with and without SABD load at pre- and post-intervention tests to attempt to disentangle motor 
compensation from recovery. We hypothesize that at post-intervention, 1) the maximal hand opening area will 
be increased, and less coupled with compensatory forces at the shoulder and elbow; and 2) the above

HRP-593 / v121917improvements will be significantly larger in the experimental group. These motor performance changes will 
suggest motor recovery at the performance level.
Aim 3: We will measure the intervention-induced changes in neuroplasticity.  We will measure 
intervention-induced functional and structural changes in gray matter density (GMD) and white matter integrity 
(WMI) at pre- and post-intervention. We hypothesize that after the intervention both groups will have: 1) hand-
opening related cortical activity shift from the contralesional to the ipsilesional hemisphere, 2) increased GMD 
in ipsilesional and decreased GMD in contralesional sensorimotor cortices; and 3) increased WMI in ipsilesional 
cortico-fugal tracks and decreased WMI in the contralesional cortico-fugal tracks, with larger changes in the 
experimental group compared to that in the control group. These neuroplastic changes will suggest motor 
recovery at the neural level.
This will be the first effort to investigate the effects of device-assisted practice of ADLs in an anti-synergic 
pattern, and thus close-to-normal, on UE motor recovery in individuals with moderate to severe stroke by 
[CONTACT_824901], kinematics, and neuroplasticity. If hypotheses are supported, the results may 
impact current clinical practice by [CONTACT_824902]-assisted practice of ADLs in an anti-
synergy pattern and potentially benefit a large population.
BACKGROUND:
A. Significance
A large post-stroke population exhibits poor or no voluntary control of the paretic hand1. In our  recent 
survey on arm/hand function in [ADDRESS_1143837] gap between 
the desired and available function for the paretic hand compared to shoulder/elbow function35. 
Furthermore, from the stroke survivors’ perspective, the most important factor impacting UE recovery is ‘the 
use of the arm in everyday tasks’36. Unfortunately, hand interventions currently largely ignore individuals with 
moderate to severe stroke.  Re-engaging this large population in arm/hand interventions via device assistance 
is of great significance. 
We propose  to use ReIn-Hand, a smart EMG-driven FES device, and a robot to assist this more 
severely impaired population to practice reaching-graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-retrieving-releasing (GR3) training in an anti-
synergy pattern. Results  will be used to answer the following 3 questions with increased power:
1. Is  a device-assisted intervention that targets performing ADLs in an anti-synergy pattern feasible 
to improve hand and arm function in individuals with moderate to severe chronic stroke? Due to practical 
reasons, this question has not been well studied yet. Currently, one opi[INVESTIGATOR_824852] a stroke have limited hope for the return of 
hand dexterity37-40. However, such prediction is largely based on conventional and spontaneous recovery, 
which may not apply to new therapeutic methods. As we know, an initial severe neural injury usually 
results in motor compensation in the early phase41, which in turn causes persistence of ‘learned nonuse.’ 
In a rat model, when this maladaptive compensation was enhanced by [CONTACT_824903]’s non-paretic 
forelimb, such training not only resulted in exacerbated impairments and disuse of the paretic 
forelimb14,15, but also diminished performance improvements in subsequent rehabilitative training of the 
paretic forelimb compared with rats that did not received ‘maladaptive compensation’ training14,42,43. 
These behaviors were found to be the result of increased aberrant formation of synapses by [CONTACT_824904]17, which reflects ongoing competition for survival between synapses18,44 (i.e., ‘synaptic 
competition’). On the contrary, restricting the non-paretic forelimb and training the paretic one leads to 
increased perforated synapses in peri-lesion areas, reflecting mature and efficacious excitatory 
synapses45. These previous results imply that synapses generated by [CONTACT_824905]-induced synapses, probably even in more severely impaired 
individuals. Furthermore, in order to maximize the ability to compete with compensation-induced 
synapsis, we need to assist practices of motor activities in an anti-synergy pattern, rather than 
compensatory strategies. It has been shown that behavioral manipulation impacts the neural and 
vascular repair (e.g., axonal sprouting46-50, synaptogenesis17, dentritic growth51, astrocytic reactions52-54,

HRP-593 / v121917and vascular  remodeling responses55). Therefore, practice ADLs in an anti-synergy pattern can be critical 
for creating desired neural activities while minimizing undesired neural activities. Although the chronic 
phase is not optimum for neural repair, it diminishes the confounding factors caused by [CONTACT_824906][INVESTIGATOR_824853]. Ability for neural repair may still exist even during 
chronic phase, as previous results and our own preliminary results showed that even long after stroke 
new movement patterns can be developed in response to motor training19, 29 and associated with the 
neuroplasticity similar to that was reported in mildly impaired subacute individuals following CIMT29. As 
an initial feasibility study, we choose the chronic phase that guarantees a ‘worst’ case situation. Answers 
to this question, if positive, are expected to push future related research to sub-acute or acute phase, 
and open a door for this large population back to intervention targeted hand function recovery.
2. Is  progressively modulating shoulder abduction (SABD) load important for implementing device-
assisted ADL-related intervention in more severely impaired individuals? Our lab demonstrated that 
increased SABD load introduced 1) increased involuntary flexion forces at elbow25,32-34, wrist and 
fingers24, 2) decreased voluntary finger extension ability23, and 3) decreased FES-mediated hand 
opening30 on the paretic UE. On the contrary, by [CONTACT_824907]-load support while a subject 
actively lifts and reaches, even a severely impaired stroke survivor can reach in a comparable way as a 
healthy control subject does34. Furthermore, when training moderate to severe impaired chronic 
individuals reaching with subject- and need-specific SABD-load, they gained significant range of motion33. 
Practically, although our inclusion criteria require a minimal FES-mediated thumb-index finger distance 
of 4cm on the tabletop, once the subjects lift the paretic arm above tabletop, the FES assistance may not 
result in sufficient hand opening anymore30, and thus may hinder the intervention progress. Furthermore, 
even if the ReIn-Hand can successfully open the paretic hand in the context of SABD-induced synergy, 
such synergy itself can cause abnormal movement patterns at shoulder and elbow, and the associated 
neural activities may result in non-desired synaptic competition. In short, without appropriate SABD-load 
supporting, an intervention can be restricted to a tabletop until a subject gains his/her ability to lifting the 
paretic arm against gravity without maladaptive compensation. However, restricted training on tabletop 
will impact the ability to transfer training to real ADL performances that usually require arm lifting. 
Mechanistically, the primary means to increase hand opening is via using contralateral corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_824854] (CST)56. With robotic support, we can initially lower the neural demands for driving shoulder and 
elbow, and reserve more residual CST resources (which are limited in stroke) for driving the hand. 
Therefore, implementing SABD control via robot during GR3 is anticipated to be especially important for 
individuals who cannot lift the paretic arm above table without compensation, which is prevalent in 
individuals with moderate to severe stroke25. For these participants, robot will create a haptic environment 
that allows them for the lifting and reaching in an anti-synergy pattern and enhances its associated 
neural/vascular activities. Specifically, we will progressively modulate SABD load in a manner where 
subjects are able to demonstrate 70%-80% FES-mediated opening ability in the experimental group. By 
[CONTACT_824908]-induced changes resulted by [CONTACT_824909]3 with and without SABD 
modulation, we will be able to shed a light on this question.
3. Are  the intervention-induced changes in individuals with moderate to severe chronic stroke motor 
compensation or recovery? Both previous results from other groups and our preliminary results 
demonstrated intervention-induced changes in this more severely impaired chronic population8,29,33,57. 
However, whether these changes are motor compensation or recovery is still unknown. Although 
compensation is easier to occur, rehabilitation should urge the use of effective ways to maximize motor 
recovery, which refers to the restoration of a function back to a more-normal, pre-injured state16,19 (see 
table 1 for the definition of ‘recovery’ and ‘compensation’ at functional, performance, and neuronal levels, 
respectively). Previous evidence from clinical assessments usually suggests pure compensation during 
the chronic phase58. However, post-intervention increase in the functional use of ipsilesional sensorimotor 
cortices and back-to-normal structural changes were also reported29,59,60. This discrepancy between 
measures at performance and neural levels may be due to the limited resolution of impairment measures, 
like Fugl-Meyer Stroke Assessment61,62 (FMA), the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment63 (CMSA),

HRP-593 / v121917etc. Detailed kinematic  analysis of motor patterns together with non-invasive neural imaging methods are 
desired to quantify ‘recovery’ versus ‘compensation’64. Up to now, such efforts in more severely impaired 
individuals are very limited. We propose to measure changes in kinematics with high resolutions (a 
position accuracy of 1mm and an angular accuracy at 0.02 degrees for hand opening area, and an 
accuracy of 0.1N for shoulder/elbow force generation), and in functional and structural neuroplasticity to 
shed a light on this question. 
Table 1.  Definitions of recovery and compensation at [ADDRESS_1143838] been used in interventions, including both non-EMG-driven and EMG-
driven ones. Non-EMG-driven devices, like The Ness H200 (Bioness, Inc, Valencia, CA), require pushing 
a button (usually by [CONTACT_824910]) to trigger the assistance8. This type of devices cannot provide 
the synchronized proprioceptive and somatosensory feedback with motor tasks. Such synchronization is 
preferred since it increases Hebbian learning by [CONTACT_824911]65, and acts as a signal 
for axonal sprouting after cortical lesions62. EMG-triggered devices provide this desired synchronization. 
However, current available devices commonly use EMG amplitude to control repeated hand opening 
and/or closing at a fixed sequence, usually with the arm resting on a table. Due to the UE synergies, 
when a stroke user activates proximal muscles during reaching and lifting, EMG-amplitude from both 
finger/wrist flexors and extensors could significantly increase24. Therefore, amplitude based approaches 
cannot reliably control the hand in the context of non-tabletop activities in individuals with abnormal UE 
synergies66. Innovatively, we have designed algorithms to reduce the impact of synergic muscle 
activation67, thus guaranteeing a <1% error rate in the detection of a hand close instead of an open, while 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a >90% accuracy rate of detecting hand opening during a functional arm movement. 
Although ReIn-Hand  can detect hand opening in the context of synergic muscle activities, its resulted 
hand opening area is usually reduced with a lifted the arm30. Furthermore, it cannot reduce the expression 
of SABD-induced synergy at shoulder or elbow either. Due to these 2 issues, interventions without 
appropriate SABD-support will either be restricted to a tabletop, thus becoming less ADL-related, or be 
performed with the abnormal movement patterns caused by [CONTACT_824912]-induced synergy. We therefore 
innovatively propose to combine ReIn-Hand and robot to allow individuals with moderate to severe stroke 
for the practice of some of ADLs in an anti-synergy movement pattern. By [CONTACT_824913]-matched 
control group who will only get assistance from ReIn-Hand for hand opening, we will be able to investigate 
the importance of practicing in ‘close-to-normal’ pattern vs. non-controlled way.
The use of  robotic-controlled kinematic measures at multiple joints will provide high resolution 
and accurate data to disentangle motor recovery versus compensation. Using an effective ACT3D 
robotic modulation of shoulder load, we have developed and validated a set of methods to reliably 
quantify elbow and hand control abilities under various conditions with high resolution and accuracy31. In 
order to disentangle motor recovery versus compensation for hand control, we propose to use these 
validated methods to quantify intervention-induced changes simultaneously in at multiple joints when 
maximally opening the paretic hand with or without lifting the arm in moderate to severe stroke individuals. 
As suggested, reduced synergy is one of the important signs of motor recovery68. In the proposed study, 
we will measure both hand-opening-induced UE synergies as quantified by [CONTACT_824914] #: STU00206913-MOD0037 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/24/2023 through 12/4/2023.

HRP-593 / v121917at shoulder  and elbow, and the impact of SABD-induced synergy on hand opening ability. When 
performing hand opening without lifting the arm, an intervention-induced increase or decrease in the 
coupling shoulder and elbow torques (i.e., hand-opening-induced UE synergy) will indicate motor 
compensation or recovery, respectively. Furthermore, we will quantify the impact of SABD-induced 
flexion synergy on the hand opening ability. A better maintaining of maximal hand opening area while 
lifting the arm compared to without lifting will indicate motor recovery. Otherwise, a significantly reduced 
hand opening when lifting will indicate motor compensation, since it reflects that when restricting the 
compensation from shoulder by [CONTACT_824915], an individual cannot open the hand anymore. 
The use  of multi-modality imaging methods will provide quantitative measures of intervention-
induced neuroplasticity . Motor recovery is not only defined at functional and motor performance levels 
(see table 1), but also at the neural level. Up to now, cortical activities related to hand opening with and 
without lifting the arm following a hand related intervention have not been widely investigated yet. We 
have established validated methods in using high density EEG approach together with subject-specific 
MRI-based brain model in estimating the cortical activities with a time resolution of [ADDRESS_1143839]-intervention shift of 
cortical activity back to ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices will indicate motor recovery since it mimics 
“normal” hand-related cortical activity.
At neuronal  level, motor recovery is defined as restoring function in neural tissue that was initially lost 
after injury19. If strictly following this definition, then structural repair has to occur to support it. In animal 
models, evidence for structural changes, such as axonal sprouting, synaptogenesis, dendritic growth, 
and so on, has been reported46-54. In human model, several groups have shown increases in gray matter 
(GM) density in ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices74, along with increases in fractional anisotropy (FA) in 
ipsilesional corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] (CST)75 in acute and chronic stroke individuals with mild impairments. 
However, since individuals with moderate to severe stroke are largely ignored in current arm/hand 
interventions, it is still unknown whether an arm/hand intervention for these more severely impaired post-
stroke individuals will result in structural changes. Using advanced anatomical and structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) methods we will measure morphological changes in GM density and 
descending WM integrity. Different from the previous work that focused on the ipsilesional side in mildly 
impaired subjects, we will also innovatively quantify these structural changes in the contralesional side. 
This is based on our recent results that separately evaluated reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_824855]76. Our results 
demonstrated that individuals with the greatest UE synergy severity and hand impairments post-stroke 
have the highest FA in the contralesional reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735], a pattern consistent with increased 
myelination and suggestive of neuroplastic reorganization following stroke-induced compensation76. 
Using a multi-modal MRI approach, the proposed study will provide evidence for morphological 
neuroplasticity in this more severely impaired large population. We anticipate simultaneous structural 
changes in the form of a decrease in the contralesional GM density and FA, and an increase in these 
structural measures in the ipsilesional side. This will agree with ‘synaptic competition’ theory and support 
the motor recovery.
C. Relevant  prior experience and gaps, as well as preliminary data
Aim 1:  to measure the device-assisted intervention-induced changes in clinical outcomes
Both electronic  and robotic devices have been used to assist arm/hand therapy in individuals with 
moderate-severe stroke. As a systemic review summarized, robotic-assisted interventions improved ADL 
scores, arm function and arm muscle strength, but the quality of the evidence was low to very low11. Many 
factors may impact the effects of device-assisted interventions. One of them may be the way to use 
devices. For example, although various devices have been used to facilitate the training of different joints, 
they have never been used in a way to assist both proximal and distal joints during the performance of 
an ADL.  A recent large trial used [ADDRESS_1143840] 127 participants with moderate-to-severe chronic 
IRB #: STU00206913-MOD0037 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/24/2023 through 12/4/2023.

HRP-593 / v121917stroke to  practice horizontal reaching (the 1st 3 weeks), graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824856] (the 2nd 3 weeks), and 
integrating proximal and distal joints (the 3rd 3 weeks)77. At the end of a 12-week intervention, results of 
this device-assisted training was not different from usual care77 or intensive therapy77. Although this 
intervention involved [ADDRESS_1143841] removing items from a dishwasher in moderate chronic 
indiviudals8; and a hand robot was used for reaching and graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824857]-acute mild-severe 
individuals60. These ADL-targeted interventions, all with relatively small size (N is about 10), reported 
better outcomes than the large size study without targeting ADL77, and supported the importance of ADL 
practice in this more severely impaired population. 
It is  worth noting that none of previous ADL-targeted interventions support shoulder load to reduce 
the remarkable impact of SABD-induced synergy on function and motor patterns at distal joints23-25,34. 
When success in the ADL task becomes the dominant goal without efforts to reduce synergy, individuals 
frequently develop compensatory movements. One study found that CIMT improved efficiency of paretic 
arm movements by [CONTACT_824916]12, suggesting that CIMT promotes the 
refinement of compensatory movement strategies. While realizing the importance of being able to 
progressively use the paretic UE during ADLs, we also strive for motor recovery with the hope of breaking 
the bottleneck that may be caused by [CONTACT_824917]. We propose to combine ReIn-Hand and robot to 
allow participants to repetitively practice reaching, graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], retrieving, and releasing (GR3) with 
progressively increased challenge. We expect that this intervention will improve motor function (as we 
practice ADLs) and decrease impairment (as we enhance the hand opening29 and reduce the SABD-
induced synergy33 simultaneously). 
Preliminary results:  Eight participants with chronic (>1-year post, mean: 11.2 years) severe stroke (UE 
FMA scores  10-24/66) were recruited to participate in a 20-session intervention (3 sessions/week). 
During each session, participants performed 20-25 trials of Reaching, Graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Retrieving, and 
Releasing (GR3) a 3cm jar with the assistance of the ReIn-Hand device. Pre, post and 3-month follow-
up clinical assessments, including UE FMA61,62, Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment Hand Subscale63 
(CMSA_H), grip dynamometry, the BBT81,82, active and passive goniometrics for wrist and metacarpal 
phalangeal (MCP) flexion and extension (II, V fingers), the Nottingham Stereognosis Assessment83,84 
(NSA), and sensory touch thresholds using monofilaments were performed. Non-parametric Friedman 
tests of differences between pre- and post-intervention measures found significant changes in the BBT 
(λ2=10.38 p< .05), passive and active range of motion (λ2=11.31 p< .05 and λ2=12.45, p< .01, 
respectively), and NSA (λ2=6.42, p< .05). These results suggest that the ReIn-Hand assisted GR3 
intervention may improve voluntary hand control in individuals with severe impairment following stroke. 
Other considerations:  1) Dropout rate: The dropout rate for robot-assisted arm/hand training has been 
reported to be 45 per 1000, which is comparable to that for conventional interventions (42 per 1000)11. 
As adverse events were seldom described, assistive devices are concluded to be safe as a rehabilitation 
tool11. 2) Dosage: A home-based study used the Bioness H-[ADDRESS_1143842]-selected ADL (e.g., open jar) every weekday for 8 weeks. It 
reported significant increases on motor function in the group who practiced 120min/session but not in the 
group of 60 or 30min/session85. Furthermore, our own preliminary results using ReIn-Hand to assist 8 
severely impaired individuals to practice GR3 suggested that a dose of 60min/day, [ADDRESS_1143843] (BBT), however it was not maintained 
on 3-month follow up27. Our ACT3D-mediated reaching intervention in [ADDRESS_1143844] with a dose of 60min/day, 3 weekdays for 8

HRP-593 / v121917weeks32.  In order to balance fatigue and intensity, 
we choose a dose of 90min/day, 3 weekdays for 8 
weeks. This dose is stronger than that used in our 
preliminary interventions, but weaker than 
120min/session for 40 sessions. 
Aim 2: to  measure the intervention-induced 
changes in biomechanics 
To disentangle  intervention-induced 
improvements due to motor recovery or motor 
compensation, quantitative measures that 
simultaneously quantify multi-joint kinematics with 
high resolution and accuracy have advantages 
compared to clinical assessments19. These 
kinematic measures also closely follow the 
validated clinical assessments such as FMA86. 
Using kinematic measures a few previous studies 
reported that reduced synergy was one of the 
important signs of motor recovery68,87,88. Therefore, 
we propose to quantify maximal hand opening 
area with and without lifting the paretic arm. 
Simultaneously, we will also measure the coupling 
force/distance in X, Y, Z directions generated by 
[CONTACT_824918] (see figure 1C). This will allow 
us to quantify the impact of SABD-induced synergy 
on hand opening, and impact of hand-opening-
induced synergy on proximal joints. Measuring 
these UE kinematics before and after the two 
interventions have potential to provide information 
about underlying mechanisms that drive any 
potential improvements achieved by [CONTACT_824919].
Preliminary results
Kinematics: 36  individuals (moderate stroke: 
FM=26~40 N=13,  severe stroke: FM=10~25 N=13, 
healthy control: N=10) were recruited for this 
study. Each participant was instructed to perform 
following sequent movements: 1) moving the hand 
to the home position; 2) resting for 1s; 3) lifting the 
arm off the table with a shoulder load equal to 25% 
or 50% of the participant’s shoulder abduction 
maximum voluntary torque (MVT) or staying at 
table for 2s; 4) maximal hand opening while 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_824858]. More details of the 
experimental setup and protocol can be found in 
our publication23. Hand pentagon area (HPA), 
defined as the area formed by [CONTACT_824920] (see figure 1A subplot), was used to 
quantify hand opening ability. Forces under thumb

HRP-593 / v121917and fingers  were recorded to quantify graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824860] (see figure 1B subplot). We found that 1) 
in individuals with moderate stroke, increasing 
shoulder abduction loading reduced the ability to 
maximally open the hand; and 2), in individuals 
with severe stroke, who were not able to open 
the hand, involuntary graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824861]23 (see figure 1A and 1B). 
Furthermore, coupling forces generated at 
shoulder and elbow while performing maximal 
hand opening with and without SABD load were 
recorded by [CONTACT_941] 3D load cell that was attached 
to the forearm orthosis. In [ADDRESS_1143845]-intervention coupling forces at X, Y, 
and Z directions (solid lines) were reduced to 
about 50% of that before intervention. When 
performing the hand opening while lifting up 
again 50% of a subject’s SABD maximal 
voluntary torque, coupling forces at X and Y 
directions (dashed lines) also reduced about 
50%. Please note for the hand opening with 
SABD load, the force in the Z direction was 
controlled by [CONTACT_106528]3D robot, and thus was not 
compared. These preliminary results 
demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying hand 
opening ability and coupling forces at shoulder and elbow with high resolution. Furthermore, results in 
figure 1C supported feasibility of motor recovery after the preliminary GR3 intervention in chronic stroke 
individuals with moderate to severe impairments.
Aim 3:  to measure the intervention-induced changes in neuroplasticity 
Aim 3A:  neuroplasticity at functional level
Motor recovery  is also demonstrated at the neural level. Intervention-induced neural changes have been 
investigated widely using animal models89. For instance, monkeys or rodents trained on a skilled  
‘reaching to graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ task express enlarged representation of the digits of the hand or forelimb in 
ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) following training as measured by [CONTACT_824921]90,91. 
The cortical reorganization underlying effective task-specific arm/hand interventions in acute and chronic 
stroke subjects with mild impairments support those seen in the animal literature described above. 
Several variations of arm/hand interventions, including CIMT, bilateral task-specific training, and hand-
specific robot-assisted practice have shown cortical reorganization such as increased sensorimotor 
activity and enlarged motor maps in the ipsilesional hemisphere related to the paretic arm/hand92-95. 
These results suggest increased recruitment of residual resources from the ipsilesional hemisphere 
following training. In moderate to severe chronic stroke, hand task related cortical activity has been 
reported to involve contralesional or secondary motor areas96-101, reflecting compensatory mechanisms 
at neural level. In these individuals, increased contralesional activity when moving their paretic arm

HRP-593 / v121917correlates with impairment102,103.  Intervention-induced cortical reorganization in individuals with moderate 
to severe stroke was less investigated before, and thus largely remaining unknown. We propose to 
simultaneously measure the changes in cortical activities related to hand opening with and without SABD 
load while measuring the UE kinematics. We expect that hand-opening related cortical activities will shift 
from contralesional sensorimotor cortices back to ipsilesional side. This back to normal change will 
suggest motor recovery at neural level.
Aim 3B:  neuroplasticity at structural level
It is widely  accepted that neuroplasticity is a key factor for determining outcome104-106. Besides 
functional cortical reorganization that is proposed to study in aim 2, structural changes may also occur. 
In animal models, it has been reported that cortical activity changes significantly influence the targets for 
both local and distant sprouting axons89,107, and thus guide structural changes. For example, in monkeys or 
rodents trained on a skilled reach to grasp task, in addition to functional cortical activity changes 
mentioned above, rapid local structural changes in the form of dendritic growth, axonal sprouting, 
myelination, and synaptogenesis also occur21,108-110. Importantly, these neural changes correspond to 
motor recovery following rehabilitative training in these animals111,112. In human model, rapid acquisitions 
of high-resolution anatomical 3D imaging (MPRAGE) allow for the detection of changes in gray matter 
(GM) density using techniques such as voxel-based morphometery113,114. Furthermore, the inception of 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has allowed for researchers to identify neural tissue connectivity and is 
particularly sensitive to white matter (WM) morphology115. Together, MPRAGE and DTI measures can 
be implemented to detect gray and white matter changes in health, disease, and injury115. Using these 
methods, intervention-induced structural changes in subacute mildly impaired stroke individuals have 
been reported74,75. These results are largely in agreement with findings in animal models, suggesting 
increased synaptogenesis and/or dendritic complexity in GM, along with increased integrity of WM 
tissue74,75. However, since individuals with moderate to severe stroke are largely ignored in current 
arm/hand interventions, it is unknown whether an arm/hand intervention for these more severely impaired 
post-stroke individuals will result in structural changes. If yes, whether structural changes restore the 
function in neural tissue that was initially lost after injury is also a question. 
To answer  above questions, we will use anatomic T1 and Diffusion weighted scans to quantify GM 
density, a measure of dendritic complexity, and WM Fractional Anisotropy (FA), a measure of white 
matter integrity, before and after intervention. We hypothesize that following device-assisted GR3 
interventions, moderate to severe chronic stroke individuals will show similar structural changes as 
observed in mildly impaired individuals, demonstrated by 1) an increase in GM density in ipsilesional 
sensorimotor cortices and decreased GM density in contralesional sensorimotor cortices; and 2) increased 
WM integrity in ipsilesional cortico-fugal tracks and decreased WM integrity in the contralesional cortico-fugal 
tracks. Furthermore, above changes will be at a higher level in the experimental group as compared to 
that of the control group.
Preliminary results  
At cortical  level: For the 8 individuals that participated the preliminary GR3 intervention as stated in the 
aim 1  preliminary result part, we also quantified the intervention-induced changes in functional cortical 
activity. Surface EEG data related to hand opening with and without lifting the arm were measured before 
and after the intervention; We then reconstructed the cortical activity (see method part for details). 
Reconstructed sources in the regions of interest (ROIs), including bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices 
(primary motor cortex (M1) + primary sensory cortex (S1)) and secondary motor cortices (supplementary 
motor area (SMA) + premotor area (PM)), were used to calculate the 1) cortical activity ratio (CAR), which 
was defined as the total current strength of one ROI normalized by [CONTACT_824922] 4 
ROIs; and 2) a Laterality Index (LI) that reflects the relative contributions of each cerebral hemisphere to 
the source activity (definitions for both CAR and LI can be found in the method part). Individuals 
demonstrated a shift in cortical activity related to hand opening from the contralesional to the ipsilesional 
hemisphere following the intervention (p<0.05, not depi[INVESTIGATOR_1230]). For the table condition, this was driven by 
[CONTACT_1744] #: STU00206913-MOD0037 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/24/2023 through 12/4/2023.

HRP-593 / v121917decreased contralesional  M1+S1 activity and increased ipsilesional secondary motor cortices’ activity 
(p<0.05, see figure 2B); and for the lifting condition, this back-to-normal shift was driven by [CONTACT_824923] M1+S1 activity (p<0.05, see figure 2C). The increased use of ipsilesional resources and 
decreased use of contralesional resources support the motor recovery after the preliminary GR3 
intervention.  
At the  structure level: On 19 moderate to severely impaired chronic stroke individuals and 15 healthy 
age-matched controls,  we used high-resolution DTI to quantify WM fractional anisotropy (FA) in relation 
to severity of arm synergy (as measured by [CONTACT_824924]) and hand related motor impairments (FMA hand 
portion). We found that post-stroke the contralesional reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_824863] (r=-0.606, p=0.003) and hand impairment (r=-0.609, p=0.003)76 (see Figure 3). 
This supports the hypothesis that more severely impaired chronic stroke individuals depend more on 
contralesional corticobulbar pathways to compensate for the stroke-induced damage, and that these 
contralesional pathways lack the ability to allow further significant recovery. Furthermore, we examined 
structural GM changes in the 8 individuals who participated in the preliminary study as stated in aim 1 
preliminary results section. Subjects displayed increased GM density in ipsilesional primary sensorimotor 
cortex and decreased GM density in contralesional primary sensorimotor cortex at the level of p<0.[ZIP_CODE]. 
These findings suggest that despi[INVESTIGATOR_824864], post-stroke participants 
maintain ability to show GM structural changes following a ReIn-Hand assisted GR3 intervention. The 
ipsilesional GM density changes are similar as those reported in post-stroke individuals with mild 
impairment. The intervention-induced decrease in contralesional GM density has not reported before. 
This discrepancy may be because compensatory structural changes in contralesional side in mildly 
impaired individuals is not as significant as that in more severely impaired individuals. Overall, our 
preliminary results suggest 
that residual 
neuroplasticity in more 
severely impaired 
individuals may have the 
potential to support 
improved hand motor 
recovery, and such 
neuroplasticity may 
include structural changes 
corresponding to both 
inhibiting the 
compensatory expression 
and facilitating motor 
recovery.

STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  / INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT(S):
This study investigates  the feasibility of regaining hand opening ability in individuals with moderate to 
severe stroke using device-assisted intervention. Three devices will be used during intervention:

HRP-593 / v1219171), The ReIn-Hand device:  it combines intelligent detection software, “the ReIn-HAND platform”, and an 
FDA approved (510(k)# K021100) electrical stimulator (Empi [ADDRESS_1143846] Zynex 
Medical, Inc, Englewood, CO). The ReIn-Hand platform wirelessly and simultaneously records surface 
EMG activities from up to 8 upper limb muscles, including: deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps, extensor 
communis digitorum, extensor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778], flexor digitorum profundus, flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778], and abductor 
pollicis. The device then uses novel signal processing methods to detect hand opening with or without 
arm movements based on EMG features118. Once hand opening is detected, a signal is sent to trigger 
ES to assist with paretic hand opening (see the supplementary material for a video of the use of this 
device). The stimulation electrodes will be placed over finger/wrist extensors; and the stimulation will 
have following parameters: amplitude sufficient for maximal hand opening without discomfort, biphasic 
waveform, frequency 50Hz20% and 300us pulse width, ‘ON’ duration=3s.
2), The  arm coordination training 3D robot (ACT3D): ACT3D is a customized research equipment. It 
comprises a modified force-controlled HapticMASTER (HM) robot (MOOG, The Netherlands) integrated 
with a Biodex experimental chair (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). The ACT3D allows for low 
inertia movements in three dimensions and can provide a virtual effect of gravity that can be enhanced 
or reduced by [CONTACT_824926] (i.e., Z-axis). ACT3D robot will be used to measure 
the forces and moments during the performance of required motor tasks for quantifying the intervention 
-induced changes in biomechanics (i.e., experiments for aim 2), and for providing controlled Z-force 
during determining the intervention parameters when PACT3D is not available. Please note that both 
PACT and ACT3D provide the same control of force in the Z-direction.
3) The  passive arm coordination training 3D robot (PACT3D): The PACT-3D generates the required 
endpoint forces  using a novel spring system that is passive in nature but can be controlled using an 
actuator to set  the desired force. Same as ACT3D, it also allows for low inertia movements in three 
dimensions and can provide a virtual effect of gravity that can be enhanced or reduced by [CONTACT_824927] (i.e., Z-axis). However, PACT3D is portable, lighter, and with even lower 
inertia as compared to ACT3D robot. PACT3D robot will be used to providing controlled Z-force during 
interventions for the experimental group.
Device Handling : The above three devices will be stored in the laboratories in the Department of 
Physical Therapy  and Human Movement Sciences at [ADDRESS_1143847], Chicago, IL [ZIP_CODE]. Use of 
one or two of these devices will be only on consented participants by [CONTACT_824928].
PROCEDURES INVOLVE D:
Introduction
The general  hypothesis is that the ReIn-hand and robot assisted GR3 intervention will result in improved 
hand/arm motor recovery in individuals with moderate to severe stroke, as measured by [CONTACT_208872], UE kinematics, and neuroplasticity, and such improvement will be larger in the experimental 
group (trained with ‘ReIn-Hand + robot’) as compared to the control group (trained with ‘ReIn-Hand only’). 
The control factors are time (3 levels: pre, post, and 3-month follow up intervention) and group (2 levels). 
Aim 1:  to measure the device-assisted intervention-induced changes in clinical outcomes
Experimental Design
A double-blinded, 2-baseline,  randomized experimental design will be used (see Figure 4).

HRP-593 / v121917Power analysis  and 
Subjects: Using our 
preliminary results, 
we will power the 
study to detect 
differences in the 
BBT of a minimum 
effect size of 0.9 at a 
significance level of 
0.01. Based on our power analysis with consideration of dropout rate at 7%, we will recruit 60 (with 56 
valid data in the end) adults (age: 21-81 years) with chronic (>9 months since stroke) UE hemiparesis 
resulting from unilateral stroke to participate in this study. Main inclusion criteria include: 1) moderate to 
severe UE impairments with UE FMA 10-[ZIP_CODE]; 2) moderate to severe hand impairment with CMSA_H 
scores between 0 and 4120; 3) ability for the ReIn-Hand device to generate an opening of ≥4 cm between 
thumb and the index finger. Exclusions include: 1) inability to follow 3 step commands121; 2) difficulty in 
sitting for 3 hours by [CONTACT_6270]-report; 3) Chemodenervation: Botox injection within the last 6 months; 4) 
incompatible with MRI scan, and 5) any contraindications to electrical stimulation (e.g. pregnancy, seizure 
in the past 6 months, implanted pacemaker). More detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria section. 
Randomization: Following  consent, the blinded assessor will determine the eligibility using the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Participants who satisfy study criteria will undergo baseline assessments 2 times 
prior to randomization/allocation. The training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], who will not be blinded, will assign participants 
to the experimental or control group via a computer-generated random, permuted, randomization 
sequence, with consideration of the balance in FMA scores of the 2 groups. 
Interventions: 
Research participants will  participate in a 24-session intervention, ~2 hours per session, 3 sessions per 
week, for 8 weeks in total. The individuals involved with the administration of the intervention are two 
training physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (Training PT) and two training technicians. Research participants, training 
PTs, and clinical evaluators will be blind to group assignment.
For all  sessions and both groups, research participants will be seated in a seating system with straps 
across the chest and waist to prevent unwanted trunk movement. The training technicians will stretch 
the paretic UE for up to 15 minutes. The ReIn-Hand device will be attached to the paretic upper 
extremity (UE) and then positioned at a home position in 75° shoulder abduction (SABD), 30° shoulder 
flexion, and 60° elbow flexion.
The first  session will be a 'parameter adjusting session', during which the training PT will determine 
training parameters, including: 1) SABD load, 2) target(jar) distance, 3) jar width, 4) jar weight, 5) jar 
height, and 6) jar orientation. These training parameters will be established both on the table condition 
and using a robot. The robot modulates the supporting force in Z-direction applied to the arm while 
participants are required to lift the arm, thus changing the shoulder abduction (SABD) load. The SABD 
load will be set as the maximum load that allows the participant to: actively reach the target distance, 
and achieve a ReIn-Hand mediated hand opening no less than 4 cm between the tips of the thumb and 
index fingers. After establishing SABD load, all the additional parameters (#2-6) will be set, first with the 
established SABD load as following: 2) Target distance is 70% of the distance of the max reach of the 
paretic UE when fully supported on a frictionless table created by [CONTACT_166736]; 3) Jar width will be 
increased in 0.5 cm increments, by [CONTACT_824929], to the max width the participant can 
achieve with the ReIn-Hand; 4) Jar height (i.e., distance from the lowest part of the jar to the surface of 
the table) will be set as 2 cm increments to the max height the participant can successfully (and 
painlessly) reach the jar; 5) Jar orientation (i.e., the relation of the long axis of the jar to the table 
surface) will be set as 2° increments to the maximum amount that allows the participant to successfully 
grasp the jar; and 6) Jar weight will be increased in 100 g increments, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_824867] 4.  Flow chart of the experimental design. The blue area shows the involved experimenters.

parameters (#2-6) under table condition; i.e., this time without robot support and thus using a height-
adjustable table.
Once the  intervention parameters are set, the training technician will guide the participant to perform 
the GR3 activities using these parameters. Participants in the experimental group will be trained using 
the robot. Their forearm of a participant will be attached to an orthosis, which will be firmly attached to 
the robot. Participants in the control group will be trained on a regular height-adjustable table. All 
training sessions will consist of 40 trials (about 1 hour) of 'reaching-graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-retrieving-and- releasing' 
(GR3) activities, which include: 1) Reaching towards a plastic jar (diameter=3cm, weight=30g when 
empty); 2) Activating finger/wrist extensor muscles to trigger the ReIn-Hand device, which in turn 
assists the opening of the paretic hand while reaching; 3) Graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824868]; 4) Retrieving the jar to the 
home position and placing it on the table; and 5) Releasing the jar. In order to avoid fatigue, a resting 
time of 20-30 seconds will be provided between trials.
Participants in the  control group will be encouraged to perform GR3 activities with the arm above the 
table. The experimental group will get the necessary SABD support via the PACT3D and thus be 
required to reach above the table. Both groups will be provided with the same verbal cues. A successful 
trial requires the completion of all five tasks required during one trial: Reaching towards a plastic jar, 
triggering the ReIn-Hand device, graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824868], retrieving the jar to the home position and placing it 
on the table, and releasing the jar. An unsuccessful trial is defined as the failure to complete one of the 
five tasks during one trial. The result of each of the 40 trials will be recorded by [CONTACT_824930].
The Training  PT will review the training performance after each session to determine if adjustment of 
parameters is necessary for the next session. If a participant successfully completes 30/[ADDRESS_1143848] all the parameters at the following session in order to 
progressively challenge the participant. New parameters then will be implemented by [CONTACT_824931].
Outcomes: Clinical assessments will be  completed by [CONTACT_824932] (2 times), within 
one week of the end of treatment, and [ADDRESS_1143849] (BBT)82-83. The secondary outcomes will be the Action 
Research Arm Test116,117 (ARAT), Quantitative Measure of Hand Opening Area and Closing Force

Stroke Impact Scale (hand function domain, SIS_H)125,126 and Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment: 
Kinaesthesia Subscale83,84 (NSA).
In addition,  the blinded assessor will also perform the following outcome measures weekly: BBT (about 
5 mins), QMHOC (~10 mins), and CSTT Test (~15 mins). 
Aim 2: to  measure the intervention-induced 
changes in biomechanics
Experimental Design
Before and  after one week of the intervention, 
we will measure UE kinematics and surface 
EEG data during maximal hand opening with 
and without SABD load. All the participants will 
be seated in a Biodex seating system with straps

HRP-593 / v121917positioned at  a home position in 85° shoulder abduction and 40° shoulder flexion, and 90° elbow flexion 
with the forearm in mid pronation-supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810]. The hand will rest on a cylinder, attached to forearm orthosis 
that is covered with an array of pressure sensors (Pressure Profile Systems, Inc., Los Angeles, CA 
[ZIP_CODE]). Furthermore, a six-axis load cell (JR3, model 45E15A) will be used to measure forces generated 
by [CONTACT_824918]. These forces will also be used by [CONTACT_824933] (Moog-FCR 
B.V., the Netherlands) and to measure the weight of the arm. Subsequently, 160 EEG active electrodes 
(Biosemi, Inc, Active II, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) will be mounted on a stretchable fabric cap based 
on a 10/20 system. Skin under each of the electrodes will be prepared to keep the impedance below 5 
k for the duration of the experiment. Additionally, the positions of EEG electrodes on the subject’s scalp 
will be recorded with respect to a coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_824934]-auricular notches 
using a Polaris Krios handheld scanner and reflective markers (NDI, Ontario, Canada). This will allow for 
coregistration of EEG electrodes with each subject’s anatomical MRI data. EMG signals of the 
intermediate head of deltoid (IDL), flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and extensor digitorum communis 
(EDC) will be recorded using surface electrodes. Furthermore, 5 markers at the size of (9x9 mm) with 
unique optical features will be placed on the tip of the thumb and the 4 fingers, with another marker on 
the back of the hand for reference purposes. Position (with an accuracy of 1mm) and angular (with an 
accuracy at 0.02 degrees) information of fingertips will then be captured by 2 registered portable Moire 
Phase Tracking cameras (Metria Innovation, Inc., Wauwatosa, WI). This will allow for the kinematic 
tracking of the hand pentagon area during the various motor tasks. The total setup time will be about 2 
hours. A break (0.5-1 hour) will follow setup to avoid fatigue.
Before implementation  of the main protocol, we will first measure a subject’s maximal voluntary torque 
(MVT) in the direction of SABD, maximum finger graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824869], and maximum HPA 
of the non-paretic hand when the hand is maximally stretched on a table top (see figure 4A subplot) for 
normalization purposes. During the main protocol, participants will be instructed to move to the home 
position (the blue ball in figure 7) first, which will trigger the home position to change to a green ball. This 
sign will indicate the experimenter to inform the subject the start of a trial. Participants will then be asked 
to relax in the home position for 5-7s and then to self-initiate the required motor task for 2s, with the eyes 
looking at the paretic hand without blinking or eye moving. Maximal hand opening will be performed in [ADDRESS_1143850] 50% of his/her SABD MVT. Real time visual feedback of 
the participant’s SABD torque will be provided to the experimenter only to control the performance of the 
task. A set of 60-[ADDRESS_1143851] 15 seconds between trials and ~[ADDRESS_1143852] EEG, EOG and EMG data (all at 1KHz, Active II, Biosemi, Inc.,

Hz, trakSTAR, Northern Digital Inc. Waterloo, Canada) and the pressures under the thumb and fingers 
(at 512Hz, Pressure Profile Systems, Inc., Los Angeles, CA [ZIP_CODE]). We will also measure subject’s 
upper- and forearm lengths.

We will  use the EEG data collected during aim 2 to investigate the neuroplasticity at functional level. 
Aim 3B:  Experimental Design
Within two  weeks prior to and following the intervention, scans will be performed at Northwestern

isotropic voxel resolution of 1x1x1

planar imaging (TR=5s, 
TW=85ms, matrix size=150x150, 
FOV=225x225mm, number of 
slices=120) producing an isotropic 
voxel resolution of 1.5x1.5x1.[ADDRESS_1143853] of 
diffusion weighting of 1000s/mm2 
in 60 different directions, and 8 
scans with no diffusion weighting 
(b=0 s/mm2).
Statistical Analysis,  expected 
outcomes, Potential Problems 
and Alternative Strategies
A voxel-wise  General Linear Model will be applied using permutation-based non-parametric testing 
with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement127 to detect changes in GM density and FA integrity following 
the intervention and any group differences. Voxel-based threshold of changes in GM density and FA 
integrity will be set at p < .[ADDRESS_1143854]  that about 50% of our participants will have severe impairment, and thus cannot open 
hand voluntarily. In this case, we will measure the pressure under thumb and fingers before and after 
intervention.
Other methods,  such as functional MRI, can also measure the functional cortical reorganization. We 
choose to use high-density EEG approach, since robotic control of SABD loading will be used. This will 
allow us to measure both SABD-induced and hand-opening-induced synergies simultaneously at multiple 
joints and at cortical level. Furthermore, the EEG method is robust to the head movements that are 
commonly associated with the shoulder abduction. We have more than 15-year experience in using high-
density EEG with robot and thus confidant that this approach can give us reliable measures.
Alternative diffusion analysis  methods such as probabilistic and deterministic tractography allow the 
recreation of WM tracts through user-specified regions of interest. We choose to instead use TBSS since 
tractography methods may lose validity when passing through lesioned tissue, whereas we can mask out 
lesioned tissue and restrict our analysis to healthy tissue in TBSS while using a whole-brain analytical 
approach. Additionally, it solves the issues of non-ideal registration and the arbitrary nature of choosing 
spatial smoothing extent in analyzing white matter connectivity by [CONTACT_824935]-tuned nonlinear registration 
and subsequent projection onto a static white matter tract representation (i.e. mean FA skeleton).

WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS
Possible reasons  for removal include changes in participant health conditions, changes in experimental 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, or other unpredictable conditions. 
Participants are  free to choose to stop being in the study at any time.  Already collected data may not be 
removed from the study database. An investigator may review study data related to the participant 
collected prior to the participant’s withdrawal from the study, and may consult public records, such as 
those establishing survival status. If a participant wants to withdraw their data for the further use in our 
research, we will request they write a letter with signature [CONTACT_824975] [INVESTIGATOR_577138]. Yao. 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS
Performing different movements  using the arm:  The repeated movements may result in minor muscle 
soreness, fatigue and muscle spasms.  However, our protocols include many rest periods that should 
significantly reduce the risk of these adverse effects.
Surface electrodes:  The self-adhesive surface electrodes used to record muscle activity may produce 
minor irritation of the skin. The possibility of irritation will be minimized by [CONTACT_824946]. 
Using Electrical  stimulator: If the intensity progressively increases during the contraction period, 
then risk of muscle tear or injury is minimal. If a high intensity is applied, participants will experience 
high levels of soreness.  We  will use the [ADDRESS_1143866] users. When using at home, the individual with stroke will

intensities from the clinician, with the maximal stimulation intensity pre-set by [CONTACT_15370].
Taking MRI: This  study uses structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 
look at the brain. These structural and diffusion-weighted MRI are types of scans that use magnetic fields 
and radio waves to make a pi[INVESTIGATOR_824870], including lesioned tissue and tracts. Some people cannot have an MRI because they have 
some type of metal in their body. For instance, if a participant has a heart pacemaker, artificial heart 
valves, metal implants such as metal ear implants, bullet pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], chemotherapy or insulin pumps or any 
other metal such as metal clips or rings, they cannot have an MRI. During this test, the subject will lie in 
a small closed area inside a large magnetic tube. Some people are scared or anxious in small places 
(claustrophobic). The MRI scanner makes loud banging noises while taking a measurement, so either 
ear plugs or specially designed headphones will be used to reduce the noise.
POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO  PARTICIPANTS
We cannot  promise any benefits to participants from taking part in this research. However, the 
literature supports the use of an EMG-driven electrical stimulator (ES) device, which ReIn-hand is in 
this category, in the treatment of the hemiplegic wrist and forearm.  Please note, such benefits are 
based on statistical data, may not apply to all the participants, and may not continue after the research 
has ended.

PROVISIONS TO  MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS 
Data analysis  plan
Aim 1:  to measure the device-assisted intervention-induced changes in clinical outcomes
We will first compare the  [ADDRESS_1143867] (time points: pre, post, 3-month, and groups: experimental and 
control) mixed-effects model will be conducted on ARAT, FMA, BBT, CMSA_H, MAL, SIS_H and NSA 
scores. If any significant effect is found, a post-hoc Bonferroni test will be used to compare the means 
with correction of type II error of multiple comparisons. We expect to see post-intervention improved 
scores on ARAT, FMA, BBT, CMSA_H, MAL, SIS_H and NSA in both groups, with the experimental 
group having greater improvements than that in the control group.
Aim 2:  to measure the intervention-induced changes in biomechanics
Hand opening  ability: An HPA is defined as the sum of the areas of three triangular areas, formed by 
[CONTACT_824948], HPASTIMSTMRSTRL, where   denotes the triangular area, T, I, M, 𝑆∆
R, L are abbreviations for thumb, index, middle, ring and little fingers (Figure 1A). HPA is shown to be an 
effective measure in evaluating hand opening ability30, and will be used as the primary measure in the 
present study to quantify hand opening. All participants will be asked to rest their hand on the cylinder 
prior to the trial and the resting HPA formed by [CONTACT_824949]. The HPA will be baseline corrected to zero while the hand is relaxed on the cylinder and then 
normalized to the maximal HPA. Maximal HPA will be measured when the non-paretic hand is placed on 
a flat surface with maximal finger abduction (see figure 1A subplot). Peak HPA value will first be identified 
during the hand opening period, and then an averaged HPA over a 100ms time window, centered at the 
peak value, will be calculated as the HPA for one trial during a certain abduction condition. In the case of 
generating closing force when opening (as shown in our previous publication23), the graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824871] (Figure 1B subplot). To 
quantify the graspi[INVESTIGATOR_88743], the peak value during the hand graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824872], and 
then an averaged graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824873] a 100ms time window centered over the peak value will be 
calculated as the graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824874]. The maximal graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824875]. 
Coupling forces  generated by [CONTACT_824918]:  Forces/moments generated by [CONTACT_824950] Z directions, as well as the distance in X and Y directions will be measured . Measurements 
in each direction within each of the conditions (i.e., table and SABD50 conditions) will then be averaged 
cross trials, separately. We are interested in the intervention-induced changes in coupling movements, 
defined as . (𝑀𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 ‒𝑀𝑝𝑟𝑒 )/𝑀𝑝𝑟𝑒
A three-way repeated measure of ANOVA with mixed model will be used to determine whether SABD 
load, time (pre, midtreatment, post, 3m and 6m followup), group, and/or their interaction explains the 
measured changes in HPA, the graspi[INVESTIGATOR_88743], coupling movements, separately. Data will be first 
examined to determine the presence of outliers (if found, will be removed) and to test for normal 
distribution (if found, will be corrected) using Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-wilk test. Post hoc comparisons with the Bonferroni 
adjustment will be adopted to compare within-subject differences. Statistical significance will be set at 
p<0.05. 
We expect  that 1) the GR3 intervention will increase the post-intervention HPA (or reduce the 
graspi[INVESTIGATOR_824876]); 2) the post-intervention coupling movements at shoulder and 
elbow during hand opening will be decreased; 3) the impact of SABD-induced synergy on HPA will be

control group, suggesting the importance of practicing ADLs in ‘close-to-normal’ pattern.
Aim 3:  to measure the intervention-induced changes in neuroplasticity 
Aim 3A:  at the cortical level
For the EEG  data, trials beyond 95% confidence intervals for maximum velocities, maximum 
accelerations, and trajectory path position  or with eye/muscle movement artifacts in the EEGs will first 
be removed. For the remaining trials, the onset of EMG activity will be detected off-line to align EEG 
signals in individual trials for ensemble averaging across trials for each of the conditions, separately. 
Averaged EEG signals from -2000 ms to +200 ms, with 0 denoting the onset of EMG, will be imported 
into the CURRY software environment (Compumedics Neuroscan Ltd., Charlotte, NC) for low-pass 
filtering with a cutoff frequency of 70 Hz and baseline correction. Cortical activity from -700 to +50 ms will 
then be reconstructed using an inverse method (Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography128-133) 
based on a subject-specific boundary element method model. Possible sources will be located on a 
cortical layer with [ADDRESS_1143870] (ROIs) include bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (primary motor cortex (M1) + 
primary sensory cortex (S1)) and secondary motor cortices (supplementary motor area (SMA) + premotor 
area (PM)). 
Our primary  interest is to investigate the shift of cortical activity. Therefore, we will use the estimated 
current density strengths to calculate a Laterality Index (LI = (I-C)/(I+C)), where ‘I’ and ‘C’ are the current 
density strengths from the ipsilesional and contralesional sensorimotor cortices (i.e., combined primary 
sensorimotor and secondary motor cortices). LI reflects the relative contributions of each cerebral 
hemisphere to the source activity, with a value close to +1 for an ipsilesional source distribution and -1 
for a contralesional source distribution. As the secondary measure, we will quantify a cortical activity ratio 
 for each of the 4 ROIs, where ‘S’ represents the current density strength of one of the 𝐶𝐴𝑅 =∑𝑛
1𝑆𝑛/∑𝑚
1𝑆𝑚
nodes, and n and m represent the number of nodes in one of the ROIs and whole sensorimotor cortices, 
respectively. The CAR reflects the relative strength from one ROI as normalized by [CONTACT_824951] 4 ROIs.
Statistical analysis:  A three-way mixed model will be used to determine whether SABD load, time 
(pre, post), group, and/or their interaction explains the measured changes in LI, and CAR, respectively. 
We expect  that the post-intervention LI will be more positive with increased CAR in the ipsilesional 
activity and decreased CAR in the contralesional activity. Furthermore, we expect that greater 
improvement will be found in the experimental group as compared to that in the control group, suggesting 
the importance of practicing ADLs in ‘close-to-normal’ pattern.
Aim 3B:  At the structure level
To calculate  GM density, anatomical T1 data will be analyzed with FSL-Voxel Based Morphometry 
(VBM) 1.1 (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslvbm/index.html; Oxford University, Oxford, United 
Kingdom)[ADDRESS_1143871] left hemisphere lesions will be 
flipped to ensure the lesions of all subjects are in the right hemisphere. The T1 images will then be brain-
extracted using the Brain Extraction Tool and segmented into GM using FAST4. The resulted GM partial 
volume images will be aligned to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) [ADDRESS_1143872] for local expansion or contraction due to the non-linear component of the 
spatial transformation, and then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a sigma of 3 mm.

HRP-593 / v121917To calculate  the integrity of the white matter, the FSL software library136 will be used for processing 
of raw diffusion imaging data. The images will be skull-stripped, each diffusion weighted condition will be 
linearly registered to the b=0 s/mm2 to minimize subject motion artifacts, and all data will be subsequently 
corrected for eddy current distortions for preprocessing. The diffusion tensor parameters will be 
calculated from the preprocessed diffusion data to generate fractional anisotropy (FA) maps that will be 
used to perform tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).  All FA maps will be linearly and then non-linearly 
registered to the FMRIB58_FA in Montreal Neurological Institute’s (MNI) standard space using FNIRT. A 
mean FA image will be created from all individual FA images and thinned to generate a common group 
WM skeleton which represents the centers of all tracts common to the group. A FA threshold will be 
applied at 0.2 to minimize potential WM / GM partial volume effects. All FA images will be projected onto 
the common group skeleton for subsequent statistical analysis.
Plan for securing  the data 
All of the collected  data are for research purposes only, and data will be kept in strict confidence. With 
the exception of the form needed to collect participant contact [CONTACT_824952], all remaining data collection forms are designed so that only the study identification number 
appears as an identifier. Data collection paper forms will be kept in a locked, secure file cabinet at the 
PI’s office at Northwestern University. Electronic data collection forms will be secured in an encrypted 
study folder stored on the server provided by [CONTACT_824953]. 
Access to the server is regulated and monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_824877]. The PI, with support from the project manager, will monitor compliance with IRB and HIPAA 
regulations. No identifiable information will be given to any unauthorized person without permission from 
the subject. The consent form will include statements required by [CONTACT_824954] (e.g. NIH, FDA audits, etc).
All data  will be merged and stored on the server provided by [CONTACT_824955]. The database will be secured with password protection. The informatics manager will receive 
only coded information that is entered into the database under those identification numbers. Electronic 
communication with outside collaborators will involve only unidentifiable information.  All information 
published on papers or presented at conferences will be identified as a number without identification of 
subject personal information.  
The link  between the study identification numbers and identifying information (e.g., name, address, 
age, telephone numbers and email addresses) will be kept separate from the dataset. Only the research 
study staff has need (and necessary access) to cross-reference files such as when it is necessary to 
contact a participant for monthly check-ins, scheduling follow-up appointments and/or clarification of 
survey answers (e.g., interpreting hand-written comments).
All MRI  data will be uploaded to the Northwestern University Research Image Processing System 
(NURIPS), an online collaborative research environment for securely storing, managing, analyzing and 
sharing de-identified medical imaging, associated data (e.g. behavioral), and results from advanced 
customizable processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_32042]. NURIPS is supported by [CONTACT_369867]-IT and takes 
advantage of the NU high performance computing cluster, Quest. NURIPS is a secure environment that 
supports the latest NU policy and procedures for encryption of data during transit and rest, provides 
granular project level access controls with varying permissions based on user groups, and allows non-
NU collaborators access once they obtain an affiliate NetID. All data are backed up and have restore 
points that go back for [ADDRESS_1143873] access to common data analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_824878].

HRP-593 / v121917All study  staff will be trained on all aspects of the study – including data monitoring, quality and 
security. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_824879]. 
Data monitoring  efforts will include monitoring and review of all self-reports and clinical measures 
data collection forms for completeness. We will contact [CONTACT_824956]-reports are incomplete or if handwriting is illegible.
We will  also use this contact [CONTACT_824957]-up appointments and remind participants 
about upcoming study appointments. We will closely monitor all data and conversations with participants 
for any reporting of adverse events as noted above. [CONTACT_153452] will regularly create and review reports on 
eligibility, screening, recruitment, retention, reasons for ineligibility, declining participation and 
withdrawals. Information from these reports and monitoring activities will allow for effective and efficient 
identification of protocol deviations and troubleshooting that may or may not require modification to the 
produce, testing protocol or standard operating procedures. 
Data quality  will be safeguarded by [CONTACT_824958]. All data in 
paper format will be double-entered in the data set. All online captured data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_824959]. 
[CONTACT_153452] will  check data quality reports to describe missing, erroneous, and inconsistent data to ensure 
that the protocol is followed, protocol deviations are tracked, and a high quality of data is maintained. 
Further, double entry of data will be conducted.  
Data quality  will also be guaranteed by [CONTACT_824960], protocol review and administration, IRB approval and 
continuing review processes, adverse event reporting procedures, data storage and management, and 
emergency procedures in our Lab. The operations manual for our Lab includes policies and standard 
operating procedures for data, lab and clinical security, handling of hazardous materials and 
emergencies, and how to use shared core resources such as NUCATS, the Quantitative Data Sciences 
Core, and all software required for the study. 
Each study  undertaken at our Lab has a unique study protocol manual, which will be checked and 
approved by [CONTACT_824961]. All the protocols have data 
collection forms for each of the designed experiments/surveys, which list all the steps that will be checked 
while conducting the study. Research staff members undergoing training will have the chance to observe 
an experienced team member in the clinic for a data collection session. The research staff trainee will 
then be observed by [CONTACT_824962]. 
Finally, in  accordance with Northwestern University IRB requirements, all research team members 
are required to complete training certification in human subjects’ research ethics through the online CITI 
(Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) certification program - a leading provider of research 
education content. Northwestern University also requires certification from the National Health Institute’s 
online “Protecting Human Research Participants” (which can be accessed at the following url: 
http://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/login.php). Northwestern University’s IRB requires staff orientation on 
all safety and standard operating procedures to conduct research in the clinical environment. All of these 
elements will ensure a high quality of the study data as well as a consistent and comprehensive approach 
practiced by [CONTACT_824963].

HRP-593 / v121917Data security  will be ensured by [CONTACT_824964], study protocol, and research 
training requirements as noted above. The data will be secured in paper and/or electronic format as 
described above. Data required to review for eligibility screening will be kept in the locked storage cabinet 
in the PI’s office. The link between the study identification numbers and identifying information (e.g., 
name, address, age, telephone numbers and email addresses) will be kept separate from the dataset. 
Only the research study staff has need (and necessary access) to cross-reference files such as when it 
is necessary to contact a participant for scheduling follow-up appointments and/or clarification of survey 
answers (e.g., interpreting hand-written comments). 
PROVISIONS TO  MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS
To ensure  the safety of participants, the data monitoring committee (DMC) will periodically evaluated 
the data collected regarding both harms and benefits. The data monitoring committee (DMC) will 
composed of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_824880] 2-3 independent monitors. The DMC will review safety data, such 
as adverse events (AE) reported by [CONTACT_824965], either by 
[CONTACT_824966]. The DMC will also review efficacy data, such as the clinical 
assessments before and after the intervention. 
The frequency  of data review for this study differs according to the type of data and can be 
summarized in the following Data Review Table:

Subject’s feeling at ease
Subjects who  choose to be in this study will be informed that they have the right to be treated with 
respect, including respect for the decision whether or not to continue or stop participating in the study. 
All examinations and procedures will be thoroughly explained to each subject to ensure subjects feel at 
ease with the questions, examinations, and procedures involved. Subjects will be informed that if at any 
point they feel uncomfortable about answering any questions on any questionnaires or surveys, they will 
not be required to answer that question. Subjects will be informed that they are free to choose to stop 
being in the study at any time, and that choosing not to be in this study or to stop being in this study will 
not result in any penalty or loss of benefit to which they are entitled. Specifically, the choice not to be in 
this study will not negatively affect the right to any present or future medical treatment.
Subject’s medical record  access
The research  staff from Northwestern University will obtain a release from the patient, if we need to 
access medical records of the subject.
COMPENSATION FOR  RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY
Minimal risk  is when the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the proposed 
research are not greater, in and of themselves, than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during 
the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. The proposed research is 
greater than minimal risk. In the event of research-related injury, subjects will not be compensated for 
medical care required because of an untoward outcome resulting from participation in the research study. 
Subjects should seek medical treatment through his or her doctor or treatment center of choice.
As stated  in the consent form: “If you become ill or get injured as a result of this study (medications, 
devices or procedures), you should seek medical treatment through your doctor or treatment center of 
choice. You should promptly tell the study doctor about any illness or injury.  The researchers will not 
pay for medical care required because of a bad outcome resulting from your participation in this 
research study. This does not keep you from seeking to be paid back for care required because of a 
bad outcome.”
ECONOMIC BURDEN  TO PARTICIPANTS
Taking part  in this research study will not lead to any costs to participants. 
CONSENT PROCESS
We will  obtain Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-592), a copy of consent has been attached, 
from all subjects.
During phone/email  recruiting, basic information of the consent will be already explained to the 
subjects. Upon request, a copy of consent form will be emailed or mailed to the subjects. If not heard

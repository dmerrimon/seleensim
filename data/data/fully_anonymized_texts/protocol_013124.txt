number of Veterans with chronic pain. Mindfulness -Based Interventions (MBIs) are one such 
approach shown to be effective for treating chronic pain and comorbid conditions (e.g., PTSD, 
insomnia, depression, and substance abuse). However, the predominant MBI offered in the 
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and other health care systems, Mindfulness -Based 
Stress Reduction (MBSR), has features that pose significant implementation barriers, at the patient- and organizational -levels.   
The long-term goal of this two -phase project is to reduce chronic pain and co-morbid conditions 
among Veterans, through scalable, non-pharmacologic evidence-based strategies that are “Veteran-Centric,” designed to optimize engagement, adherence and sustainability, and are 
deliverable to large numbers of Veterans. The current protocol describes Phase 2. We will 
conduct a 4- site 3-arm Pragmatic Clinical T rial (PCT) (N = up to 950) to test effectiveness of 
Mobile+Group and Mobile MBIs compared to usual practice.  Effectiveness will be assessed by [CONTACT_623809] 12-month follow -up (Brief Pain Inventory total score). W e 
will test the following primary hypotheses: (1) Mobile MBIs will be more effective at improving 
chronic pain (as measured by [CONTACT_32028] [INVESTIGATOR_623759] 12-month follow -up per iod) compared to 
usual practice, (2) Mobile+Group MBIs will be more effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by [CONTACT_32028] [INVESTIGATOR_623759] 12-month follow -up period) compared to usual practice, and 
(3)
M
obile+Group MBIs will be more effective at improving chronic pain (as measured by [CONTACT_141165] I
c
hange over the 12-month foll ow-up period) compared to Mobile MBIs without the gr oup
c
omponent. We will test the following secondary hypotheses: (1) Comparison of interventi on
gr
oup with secondary outcomes listed below, and (2) primary and secondary hypotheses
comparisons will be confirmed in gender -specific strata. The primary outcome will be measur ed
as
 change in BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623760] 12-month follow -up period. Secondary outcomes will
include measures captured in electronic health records (EHRs) (e.g., medicati on
pr

m
easures related to pain, comorbid mental health conditions and function, expected mediators
of treatment effects, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects. These outcomes will be assess ed

conditions that contribute to and are exacerbated by [CONTACT_623810]. Attainment of this 
goal requires scalable, non-pharmacological, “Veteran-Centric” interventions that fit Veterans’ 
needs and preferences, are designed to optimize engagement and sustainability, and can be 
readily implemented in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and in the community to reach 
the large number of Veterans with chronic pain. This endeavor also requires the capacity to implement large-scale multi -site clinical trials to test the effectiveness of these interventions 
across settings and across important patient subgroups, such as women.  
Chronic pain is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly national problem. Over [ADDRESS_830610] the nation $[ADDRESS_830611] produc tivity.
1 Chronic pain affects approximately up to 50% of 
Veterans and 45% of service members.2,3 Nearly half of Veterans of the recent conflicts in 
Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom; OEF) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom; OIF) 
receiving VA health care have at least one pain -related diagnosis.[ADDRESS_830612] decades.

 trend.7-11 Among OEF/OIF Veterans with pain diagnoses, 11% receive long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], 
with higher rates among those with comorbid PTSD and other mental health conditions.4 Those 
with PTSD a nd comorbid substance abuse problems were five times more likely to be 
prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (34%) compared to those without mental health diagnosis (7%), and those 
with comorbid mental health conditions also received higher -dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_623764].[ADDRESS_830613] become a major public 
health crisis.17 According to the US Centers for Disease Control, deaths from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_623765] 400% among women and 265% among men since 1999.[ADDRESS_830614] commonly involved in these deaths.13 Within the military, self-reported 
prescription pain medication misuse increased from 2% in 2002 to 11% in 2008,14 and drug 
toxicity deaths more than doubled between 2006 and 2011.15  
 Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is consistently the most common, disabling, and costly of all 
pain complaints in the civilian population and among Veterans.
16 Two Institute of Medicine 
(now the National Academy of Medicine) reports have summarized the enormous functional and economic impact of MSK pain on both the working and the retired population.
16,17 Indeed, two-
thirds of pain-related outpatient visits are due to MSK pain, accounting for nearly 70 million outpatient visits in the U.S. each year.
18 Painful MSK diagnoses are increasing in prevalence 
among Vete rans enrolled for care in the VHA, including back disorders —a particularly disabling 
condition that seems to be emerging at a younger age.19 Especially concerning is that, among 
Veterans deployed since 2001 in Afghanistan and Iraq, 62% have painful MSK disorders.20 
 
For many Veterans, their chronic pain co -exists with other mental and physical health conditions 
(insomnia, PTSD, substance abuse, depression) that contribute to and exacerbate their pain.2 
Of concern is that the prevalence of these comorbid mental health conditions among patients with MSK pain is increasing.
19 Within the Musculoskeletal Disorders  Cohort, developed to 
characterize variation in pain, comorbidities, treatment, and outcomes among patients with MSK 
disorders within the VHA (N = 5,237,763), the percentage of Veterans with a documented 
mental health diagnosis increased from 13.6% in 2000 to 19.9% in 2011.19  
 
Women Veterans experience elevated rates of painful MSK and mental health conditions. 
57% of female Veterans receiving care in the VHA have an MSK pain diagnosis, compared to 
49% of men, with MSK ranking as the top diagnosed medical condition among women Veterans.
[ADDRESS_830615] more than one MSK diagnosis.
22 46% of female Veteran VHA patients have a 
mental health/substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis, compared to 32% of men, and among 
Veteran VHA patients, women were more likely to use mental health/SUD services than men 
(38% versus 24%).21 Addressi ng the needs of women Veterans with chronic pain and mental 
health comorbidities is also aligned with broader efforts to advance the ability of the VHA to 
provide care focused on women Veterans’ unique needs, and to address barriers experienced 
by [CONTACT_623811].

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are evidence-based, non-pharmacological 
approaches that can empower Veterans to better manage their chronic MSK pain and 
comorbid conditions. Indeed, after reviewing the literature the workgroup from the 2016 VA 
Health Services Research and Development State of the Art (SOTA) conference, “Non-
pharmacological Approaches to Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Management,” concluded that 
there is strong enough evidence for the efficacy of MBIs to warrant hybrid 
effectiveness/implementation trials to determine their effectiveness in real -world settings and 
address implementation barriers.[ADDRESS_830616] provided a strong recommendation that MBIs (and other non-pharmacologic interventions) be considered prior to pharmacologic treatments 
for chronic low back pain.
24 
 
MBIs are among the top five commonly used complementary and integrative health (CIH) 
practices in the U.S,25 and there is increasing evidence of their effectiveness for chronic pain 
and comorbid conditions such as PTSD, insomnia, depression, and substance abuse.26,27 
Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is the most popular and formalized of the 
mindfulness programs, stemming from Jon Kabat-Zinn’s early work that introduced systematic, 
secular training in mindfulness.28 MBSR and many MBIs are offered as group format 
interventions focused on education, training, practice, and social support in mindfulness meditation. Described as “the awareness that arises by [CONTACT_623812], on purpose, and non-
judgmentally, to present moment experience,”
29 mindfulness is a skill that can be developed. 
Through meditation training, exercises and practice aimed at enhancing attention regulation, body awareness, emotional regulation, and shifts in self-perception,
30 pain sufferers can be 
become better equipped to manage pain and associated stress, which is a contributor to chronic pain.
31 By [CONTACT_623813]’s capacity to build and sustain awareness without judgement when 
confronted with pain and stressful events, automatic, maladaptive responses (e.g. 
hypervigilance, catastrophizing, etc.) may be decreased. According to the stress buffering 
model,[ADDRESS_830617] shown MBIs to be effective for improving pain outcomes, 
depressive symptoms, and mental and physical health quality of life, they also note the 
methodological limitations in a number of these studies (e.g., small sample sizes, high attrition 
rates, and lack of high quality pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow -up measures),
34,35 
underscoring the need for more methodologically rigorous studies.34-37 38  
 
VA Central IRB

LAMP Version 16 , March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012 Page 12 of 60 
 More recent Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), however, have provided stronger evidence 
of the effectiveness of MBIs for treating chronic pain. Indeed, a 2016 review of Mindfulness -
Based Interventions26 concluded that, “there is now compelling evidence in several large RCTs 
that mindfulness interventions improve chronic pain management relative to TAU (Treatment as 
Usual) and initial evidence that MBIs may be superior to some active treatments (support 
groups, health education programs) but not to other treatments CBT (Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy).” An RCT (Davis et al., 2015) of [ADDRESS_830618] of 109 patients with long-
term chronic pain (La Cour et al., 2015) found that, compared to a waitlist control, those 
randomized to MBSR had greater improvement in the primary outcome, the SF36 vitality scale 
(d=.39), and on secondary variables (improvements in general anxiety and depression, mental 
health quality of life, feeling in control of pain, and pain acceptance), directly after the intervention. Further, improvements in vitality, copi[INVESTIGATOR_54241], pain acceptance and mental 
health quality of life were sustained at the 6-month follow up.
[ADDRESS_830619] rigorous RCTs (Cherkin et al., 2016)
44 compared 8 weeks of MBSR to CBT 
relative to usual care among 342 adults with chronic low back pain. Co-primary outcomes at 26 weeks were percentage of participants with clinically meaningful ( ≥ 30%) improvement from 
baseline in functional limitations and in self-reported back pain bothersomeness. The percent of partic ipants with clinically meaningful improvement on both outcomes at 26 weeks was 
significantly higher for the MBSR group than for usual care (60.5% MBSR vs. 44.1% usual care 
for function; 43.6% MBSR vs. 26.6% usual care for pain bothersomeness). Importantly, these 
differences persisted at [ADDRESS_830620] of 242 older adults with low-back pain, (Morone, et al., 2016) compared a modified MBSR program to an active control 
group matched for time, group size, attention, homework, and facilitator time.
45 Outcomes were 
measured at 8 weeks and again at 6 months (with monthly booster sessions offered during the 
period between 8 weeks and 6 months). Significant group differences in favor of MBSR were 
observed for the primary outcome, pain-related disability, at 8 weeks (effect size = -.23),46 but 
not however at 6 months. This suggests greater attention needs to be paid to providing readily accessible support resources that participants can revisit in the long term, to enhance 
sustainability. 
 
Although these studies provide support for the efficacy of MBIs, none were focused on a 
Veteran population with chronic pain. This is critical because Veterans—and women 
Veterans in particular —differ in many ways from  the general population examined in 
chronic pain studies.
47,48 This includes a higher prevalence of chronic pain, depression, PTSD, 
and other co -occurring physical health conditions47 and, among women, high levels of military 
sexual trauma.49 In one study of Veterans participating in MBSR groups, nearly 75% met criteria

 for PTSD, 59% had a depressive disorder, and 67% had a chronic pain condition. [ADDRESS_830621] outcome 
response.38 
 There is evidence that Veterans and active duty military personnel find complementary 
and integrative health (CIH) approaches, including mindfulness, appealing for pain 
treatment.
50-53 54 For example, a recent qualitative study reported that many Veterans found 
MBSR beneficial for their pain and would recommend the program to others.48 Many of these 
Veterans turn to CIH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623766],50 with women Veterans being particularly receptive to CIH 
approaches.53 Importantly, CIH approaches, including meditation,55 are becoming widely 
endorsed by [CONTACT_309085], as part of a patient-centered approach to health care and more 
specifically, for addressing chronic pain.56 The importance of CIH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623767]’ pain has also emerged in a recent semi -structured interview study (Fletcher, 2016) 
examining facilitators and barriers to implementing CIH. Conducted with providers and administrators at six VAHCS ’s, this study found that CIH was viewed as essential for improving 
pain management and that there was a desire for gr eater availability of CIH pain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623768].
[ADDRESS_830622] of 55 Veterans with Gulf War 
Illness (GWI) found MBSR combined with TAU to be more effective than TAU on reducing 
symptoms of GWI at [ADDRESS_830623] of MBSR for Veterans with PTSD 
(N = 116) conducted by [CONTACT_15957]-I [CONTACT_623880] found a greater decrease in self-reported PTSD symptom severity and improved quality of li fe among those in the MBSR condition compared to 
those in person-centered group therapy, during treatment and at 2 month follow -up.
59  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_623769]’ 
and providers’ desire for alternative treatment approaches, including MBIs, there are 
important health care system -level barriers that impede widespread use, and limiting 
reach and ultimate impact . In the qualitative study by [CONTACT_623814]., (2016), providers and 
leaders vocalized the struggle “to meet veterans’ demands for delivery of CIH,” citing a lack of time, space, funding, and staff training. 
51 Further, MBSR programs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_623770] (e.g. 300+hours; $17,000 
- $25,000).62 Such training ensures standardization of essential mindfulness elements (see 
Table 1) and enhances participant safety. However, such stringent requirements sev erely limit 
the ability of VAHCSs to offer MBIs to all Veterans who would benefit from them. These constraints also limit the widespread dissemination of MBIs in other non-Veteran populations.
63 
Thus there is a need for creative formats of MBI delivery that mai ntain essential elements, but 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: April 8, 2024
LAMP Version 16 , March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_830624] MBSR approaches also pose a number of barriers at the patient -level,63 which 
can run counter to the VHA’s goal of providing Veteran-centered care,[ADDRESS_830625] MBSR (classroom attendance, including travel time, and 
home practice requirements of 45 minutes daily) makes these approaches inaccessible or unsustainable for many.
35 This problem is reflected in published studies by [CONTACT_623815] (up to 50% in some cases). Moreover, setting unrealistically 
high expectations for home meditation practice is likely counterproductive to establishing consistent, daily meditation practice, according to behavioral change theory.
[ADDRESS_830626] for many Veterans who are not able to easily travel 
to the main VHA facilities where MBIs are offered. Qualitative research on barriers to MBIs 
(including two studies of Veterans) provide converging evidence that time demands (classroom 
attendance and practice requirements) pose a major barrier. This includes affecting the 
likelihood of enrolling in and completing MBIs and adhering to home practice 
requirements .48,65,66 Time -intensive programs, which do not provide tools for incorporating 
mindfulness practice into one’s everyday life in the face of competing demands, may also negatively affect participants’ ability to maintain the skills they learn in [ADDRESS_830627] meaningful 
effects on outcomes important to patients, patients need to be able to continue their daily 
practice well beyond the 8-w eek intervention period, and to continue to use mindfulness skills in 
daily life, particularly when experiencing cues (such as pain and other stressors) that trigger maladaptive responses and behaviors. MBIs that include readily accessible tools and resour ces 
that encourage long term use are much needed.  
 
The group format can also pose a barrier, especially for female Veterans. Between 15-40% of 
female Veterans using VA services have experienced military sexual trauma (MST)67 (defined 
as “physical assault of a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment which 
occurred while the veteran was serving on active duty or active duty for training”), and a recent 
survey found that 24% experienced sexual harassment at their VA Healthcare System  
(VAHCS).[ADDRESS_830628] patients report discomfort participating in 
Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) classes with men47,48 and may experience 
difficulties during certain aspects of the course (e.g., closing eyes during meditation practice), 
particularly in a mixed-gender setting. Several studies (two of men and women Veterans, and 
one of civilian women with a history of PTSD) found the group format to be an impediment to 
MBSR participation, citing interpersonal dynamics and discomfort with the mixed-gender class environment.
42,48,66,69 Along with lack of time and schedule conflicts, “aversion to groups” was 
the most-common “deal breaker” in a study of Veterans’ experience with MBSR.48 Groups were 
cited as a major reason preventing women Veterans from enrolling in MBIs, affecting Veterans’ ability to engage in the program, and fueling drop out, with some stating that they would have 
preferred an all -women group.

example, there is evidence that abbreviated MBIs (with shorter in-class and at-home practice

week online MBI, consisting of 20 minutes of training per day, six days a week, compared to an active control.
72 It demonstrated an advantage for the MBI group, including increased 
mindfulness skills, reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference/suffering, heightened pain acceptance, lower affective distress and higher ratings of life satisfaction. For cancer 
survivors experiencing cancer -related fatigue, 20 minutes/day of mindfulness meditation led to 
significant improvement of fatigue interference and severity, and these improvements were 
maintained through [ADDRESS_830632] of a 4-session 
abbreviated MBSR program for VA primary care patients with PTSD (compared to TAU) found 
significant reductions i n cortisol58 and medium to large effect sizes on PTSD and depression,[ADDRESS_830633] that shorter 
MBIs yield important benefits. It is also possible that, by [CONTACT_623819], 
patients will be better able to sustain their practice over time, resulting in improved long-term pain self-management for these patients.

interventions delivered via self-help resources (including but not limited to internet-based

improvement on the primary measure (score on chronic pain acceptance questionnaire) and on 
measures of anxiety and depression that were maintained over 6 month follow -up period.75

intervention) with patients with fibromyalgia, consisting of [ADDRESS_830636] and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_623771] (but no improvement in daily pain).
78 Finally, the online MBI described above by [CONTACT_623818]. (2016) of chronic pain 
patients showed improvement on a number of pain outcomes; however this study was limited by [CONTACT_623820]-term follow -up measures).
[ADDRESS_830637]. Adapting 
online MBIs to mobile delivery fits with the recent National Academy of Medicine 
recommendation to create mobile applications for chronic pain treatment to overcome barriers 
to access and promote reach and accessibility.1 Recent estimates of Veterans and active 
military members with access to smart phones or tablets capable of running applications range 
from 71% to 83%, and those percentages are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_88150].79,[ADDRESS_830638] and Reserve, and Veterans concluded that 
“mobile devices may offer the ideal medium for accessible and portable health education and for 
intervention.”[ADDRESS_830639] among Veterans using mobile 
health (or mHealth) applications.79 Mobile, self-management interventions also address system -
level barriers associated with the current referral process, in which Veterans’ access can be 
limited by [CONTACT_623821], and lack of leadership support 
for CIH.51 Mobile MBIs  may also be a good alternative for women Veterans who would prefer 
not to receive care within VA due to military sexual trauma67 and other types of sexual 
harassment (including at the VA).68,81 Mobile MBIs also could be disseminated outside of the 
VHA, through trusted organizations that serve Veterans and their communities. 
  
In summary, results of emerging research leveraging technology and shorter 
intervention formats to address patient - and system -level barriers and facilitators to MBIs 
are very promising and warrant rigorous investigation in Veterans and VA settings.

 Conceptual Framework. The underlying conceptual framework for our MBI interventions, 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1, is drawn from the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and 
Behavior) model, stress buffering models,32 and the literature described above. The COM -B 
model represents a condensed and simplified version of the Theoretical Domains Framework, 
which has been extensively used to 
address the complex nature of 
human related behaviors, including 
self-management, for a variety of 
health conditions, including pain.83-85 
Importantly, this model is 
comprehensive in nature and 
incorporates the necessary 
conditions for addressing facilitators 
and inhibitors related to behaviors: 
this includes capabilities (or abilities 
required to enact behavior); opportunities (factors in the 
environment); and motivations 
(including emotional responses, 
impulses, etc.). When applied to the 
proposed study, it provides a 
framework that aligns Veteran and 
VA system -related needs with the 
intervention and target outcomes. Specifically, we aim to provide 
opportunities (e.g. using online and 
mobile formats, supportive resources) to overcome system - and patient-level barriers that 
prevent Veteran participation in MBIs, and to enable Veterans to engage in adaptive responses to triggering events (e.g., pain flare ups, stress -inducing situations) when they occur. Through 
mindfulness skill building, coupled with evidence-based behavioral strategies (e.g. pacing, value-based goal setting, etc.), Veterans can build their capacity and capability in mindfulness 
skills. This includes attention regulation, body awareness, emotional regulation, and shifts in self-perception.
30 These important skills can help address underlying motivations related to 
pain and stress that can activate adaptive pain and stress related responses and behaviors (e.g. acceptance, unemotional problem -solving, engaging in physical and social activities, attempting 
non-pharmacologic pain management strategies first, etc.) and inhibit maladaptive ones 
(catastrophizing, fear avoidance and hyper -vigilance, physical inactivity, social isolation, 
overuse and abuse of medications, substances) . This in turn is expected to lead to 
improvements in important pain and function-related outcomes.  
 
Rational for Proposed MBI Interventions. The Mobile+Group MBI c
 onsists of online training 
modules, delivered by a trained mindfulness instructor, which are delivered digitally, in group 
settings, and interspersed with group discussions. A trained facilitator (who is not required to be 
an expert in mindfulness) leads the group.

LAMP Version 16 , March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_830640] permits group meetings via platforms that are approved by [CONTACT_613841]. Following these 
guidelines, we plan to move the Mobile+Group MBI to an online format which will be delivered 
weekly, per the study protocol, using University of Minnesota (UMN) Zoom, a VA and HIPAA 
compliant videoconferencing software. Participants will be required to log into Zoom with a unique code. We will not be video or audio recording the Zoom sessions or collecting PHI or 
other sensitive participant info. This Zoom technology is on the VA Technical Reference Model  
(TRM), a list of VA -approved technologies .  The UMN Zoom platform is currently being used by 
[CONTACT_15957]-Investigators Evans and Haley (NIH #1R21AT009110-01A1), to deliver a Group MBI 
remotely, due to COVID- 19. 
The Mobile MBI consists of the same training modules delivered on an app (and available 
online), with no group interaction but with up to [ADDRESS_830641] the added benefit of groups, relative to its costs.48 Specifically, the 
Mobile MBI requires fewer VHA resources  (e.g., use of trained facilitators), reduces access 
barriers associated with scheduling  synchronous sessions  and reduces barriers associated with 
the group format. However, the Mobile+Group MBI affords benefits related to having a facilitator and a group (e.g., accountability, support, motivation, feeling of common humanity and shared 
struggle),
47,77 which may increase participation, engagement and lead to improved outcomes.77  
 Both MBIs address goals of scalability (availability of qualified instructors, uneven quality of 
instructors, consistency) and Veteran-centeredness (reduced class time and practice demands, 
more effective communication regarding how MBI will address outcomes of concern to 
Veterans). Given studies showing briefer formats of MBSR to be efficacious,
[ADDRESS_830642] MBSR, by [CONTACT_623822] (e.g., 
self-monitoring, feedback on performance) through mobile tools —an innovation that also will 
enable us to collect real time practice data and provide feedback to participants on their engagement (e.g., course participation and practice time).
87 These “motivational affordances” in 
online self- management interventions have been shown to contribute to adherence.88 Both 
programs will incorporate communication strategies, prior to and during the course, to ensur e 
that Veterans understand the expected benefits of the MBI, presenting a clear rationale 
explaining to participants how MBI is expected to lead to desired outcomes (reduction in pain 
functioning, improvements in fatigue). This is important as research has  shown that lack of 
communication, prior to and during the course of the program, about how the MBI will address outcomes of concern to Veterans, to be a barrier to enrollment and adherence.
[ADDRESS_830643] that the majority of individuals --80- 90% in recent surveys89,90—have

Once identified, they will be sent Veteran-centric materials informing them of the purpose of the study. This enables the researcher to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_105479] a large sample of potential participants, 
including important subgroups that can then be oversampled (e.g., women; those in the early 
stages of chronic pain), and avoids selection bias that occurs when providers are asked to refer patients or when patients must seek out the study. Centralized recruitment also allows for 
quality control so that the content and manner of recruitment are consistent.   
Within clinical practice, this project will provide tools and strategies for proactively 
delivering different types of non-pharmacological chronic pain treatment  to Veterans 
who would benefit. Current chronic pain treatment approaches require patients to request 
treatment or depend upon the health care provider to initiate care. This reactive approach 
dampens the potential reach of evidence-based non-pharmacologic al approaches to chronic 
pain, as many patients and providers are not aware of these approaches.[ADDRESS_830645] to increase the reach of a variety of different treatment approaches 
(including but not limited to MBIs) for Veterans who could benefit, and would allow for targeting 
of specific subpopulations. This approach has been successfully used in the VHA to increase 
the reach of smoking cessation interventions.[ADDRESS_830646] a package of different non-pharmacological modalities for chronic pain (e.g., exercise, CBT for pain), which could be offered proactively to Veterans.  
  
3.[ADDRESS_830647] is to reduce chronic pain and co-morbid conditions 
among Veterans, through scalable, non-pharmacologic evidence-based strategies that are 
“Veteran-Centric,” designed to optimize engagement, adherence and sustainability, and are 
deliverable to large numbers of Veterans.  
 This study, for which we are submitting this IRB application, comprises the multisite pragmatic  
clinical trial ( PCT), Phase 2, which will test the effectiveness of two MBIs at improving outcomes 
related to pain and mental health comorbidities.

 patients at the Minneapolis, Durham, Indianapolis, and Los Angeles VA s. Eligible participants 
for Aim 2b will be VA employees in the positions listed bel ow. 
 
Aim 1  
 
AIM 1 (EFFECTIVENESS): 4-site 3-arm Pragmatic Clinical Trial (PCT) (N = up to 950) to test effectiveness of Mobile+Group and Mobile MBIs compared to usual practice  
Primary hypotheses:   
1. Mobile MBIs  will be more effective at improving chronic  pain, as measured by [CONTACT_623829] ( BPI) over the 12-month follow -up period,  compared to usual  
practice. 
2. Mobile+Group MBIs  will be more effective at  improving chronic  pain, as measured by [CONTACT_32028] 
[INVESTIGATOR_623759] 12-month follow -up period,  compared to usual practice. 
3. Mobile+ Group  MBIs  will be more effective at  improving chronic  pain, as measured by [CONTACT_32028] 
[INVESTIGATOR_623759] 12-month follow -up period,  compared to Mobile MBIs without the group 
component.  
 
Secondary hypotheses:  
1. Comparison of intervention groups with secondary outcomes listed below.  
2. Primary  and secondary  hypotheses comparisons will be confirmed in gender specific 
strata.  
 
Endpoints:  Primary outcome: Change in BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623760] 12-month follow- up period. 
Secondary outcomes  will include measures captured i n EHR  (e.g., medication 
prescription/refills, health care visits for pain management), as well as patient-reported 
measures related to pain, comorbid mental health conditions and function, expected mediators 
of treatment effects, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects. These outcomes will be assessed 
at 10 weeks, 6 months  and 12 months. 
Randomization. Participants will be randomized to Mobile+Group MBI, Mobile MBI or Usual 
Care (UC; 1:1:1) after  all eligibility components are completed . (See 5.4 for eligibility component 
details.) During the phone call the participant will be randomized and will be told whether they 
have been selected to be in UC or one of the two intervention groups. The randomization list will 
be concealed from the research team within the tracking application, so team members will not know the next study assignment. Permuted block s will be used to aid in the concealment of 
treatment assignment while ensuring balance in treatment arms across time.  
Usual Care Control Condition. Participants assigned to the Usual Care (UC) condition will be 
told their group assignment during the randomization phone call described in the Randomization 
paragraph above. They will also be mailed a letter confirming their assignment.  
 
Intervention Conditions. Participants assigned to the Mobile MBI or Mobile+Group MBI 
intervention groups will be told their group assignment during the randomization phone call

 described in the Randomization paragraph above. Both groups will  be given their login ID and 
will be walked through the procedure for downloading the mobile app that contains the 
intervention. Both groups will be given logistical information about their interventions and will be 
given opportunities to ask question s.  Both groups will then be sent a welcome packet that will 
include tailored informational materials, including a letter, a study workbook, directions and a 
login ID for using the intervention on  the mobile application ( the video content of which will be 
the s ame in both intervention groups) , and directions to use the video conferencing platform if 
they’re in the Mobile+Group MBI.  Materials will include targeted messages to enhance 
persuasive appeal among men and women Veterans with chronic pain. S tudy staff wi ll be 
available via email and phone to provide support f or them to access the app , answer any 
questions, and, in the Mobile+Group condition, answer any questions related to the group 
sessions.  After welcome packets have been mailed, s tudy staff will contact [CONTACT_623830], video conferencing, or any other aspect of the 
study. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_623776], patients will not be asked to limit any other 
treatment.  
 Experimental Interventions. Both the Mobile and Mobile+Group MBIs are based on the MBSR 
framework successfully used in pain and Veteran populations.
44,59 Table 1 below depi[INVESTIGATOR_623777], and differ, among MBSR, Mobile MBI, and Mobile+Group MBI. 
The experimental interventions will take place over about a 9-week  period and cover the same 
components and mindfulness skill building addressed in standard MBSR programs. The program differs in mainly the dose and format of delivery, requiring less time and smaller doses 
of “practice” to enhance engagement and fit the n eeds of Veterans, and the addition of 
behavioral change strategies aimed at increasing treatment effectiveness. Additionally, the 
online and mobile format (used slightly differently between the Mobile and Mobile+Group) 
enhances accessibility and potential long-term  sustainability by [CONTACT_623831] 
a cost-efficient manner . Protocols have been informed by [CONTACT_39505] -AIM and PRECIS frameworks 
and discussions with administrators from participating health systems. Previous and ongoing 
studies by [CONTACT_473],
 including qualitative work of chronic pain patients’ 
perspectives,114,[ADDRESS_830652] also contributed to intervention design. 
 
Mobile MBI.  The Mobile MBI is an asynchronous intervention that is not delivered in real time. 
The training schedule for participants includes 8 weekly lessons  of approximately 30- 60 minutes  
(which can be spread out, to accommodate participants’ schedules), up to  20 minutes of 
mindfulness practice daily , and 3 scheduled calls with study staff (at the beginning, middle, and 
end of the program to check in and help guide participants) . Weekly lessons will be available on 
the app and online in a modular format, and aimed at cultivating mindfulness by [CONTACT_623832], attention, and attitude which are considered core components of MBSR training. 
Mindfulness skill building will involve instruction, practices, and exercises incorporating some of 
the same features and focus of MBSR, adapted to cultivate mindfulness -oriented pain 
management. Key topi[INVESTIGATOR_623778], stressors, presence, 
embodiment, habits, stress reactivity, maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cognitive reappraisal, c ommunity 
building, applicability to everyday life, and establishing accountability and resources. The

 platform of delivery will be on an  app, using narrated videos, readings, guided meditations and 
mindfulness exercises, presented by a trained mindfulness instructor. Each lesson will cover an 
introduction and exploration of key mindfulness related topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], guided meditations via narrated 
video and audio formats, readings, and written reflective exercises. The online mobile 
application will incorporate resour ces and strategies to increase adherence and practice (e.g., 
self-monitoring via daily diary, ability to engage in real -time mindfulness strategies, and guided 
meditations of varying lengths that can be performed during daily activities). It will also allow 
participants to work through the materials at their own pace and revisit topi[INVESTIGATOR_98510]. Study staff will schedule 3 calls with participants (at the beginning, middle, and end of the 8 weeks) as 
check -ins designed to increase engagement. Participants w ill have access to  email and 
telephone support lines , staffed by a trained team member, who will provide technical 
assistance and be able to answer basic questions related to mindfulness practices. We will 
continually update our protocol and training manual to reflect commonly asked questions.  
 Mobile+Group MBI. The Mobile+Group MBI offers the same weekly lessons as described for 
the Mobile MBI and also includes a group component delivered via UMN Zoom, a VA and 
HIPAA compliant videoconferencing software ( see description on p. 18). Participants in the 
Mobile+Group MBI will be enrolled in a group with other Veteran study participants with chronic 
pain, who will gather  about weekly (8 sessions, each approximately  1.5 hours long) to view 
online narrated videos , guided meditations and mindfulness exercises, presented by a trained 
mindfulness instructor. These online components will be interspersed with group discussions led 
by a facilitator. These facilitators will not be certified in MBSR but will have sufficient familiarity 
and understanding of mindfulness and MBIs to provide participant support (see Facilitator Training below). This has several advantages. First, it will facilitate consistency and fidelity 
across study cohorts. Second, by [CONTACT_623833] 
(which is what is required for MBSR instructor certification), there is a greater likelihood that the 
intervention can be adopted and sustained in VA settings. From a future implementation 
perspective, it will al low us to use existing VA staff as facilitators. We have already identified 
staff members who are interested in facilitating through a preliminary study at the Minneapolis VAHCS. Participants will also have access to the email and telephone support line s that those 
in the Mobile MBI condition will have access to (described in the section above).

Facilitator Training.  The investigators have previous experience successfully designing and 
delivering similar interventions. Training will occur prior to the start of recruitment and annually 
thereafter. Training will be provided by [CONTACT_15957]-I Haley (certified mindfulness instructor  and trained

 facilitator/coach); Co-I Evans (who has substantial experience training facilitators to deliver self-
care interventions for pain conditions); PI [CONTACT_409706] (who has experience training counselors to 
deliver a self-management intervention for Veterans with chronic pain), and Mallory Mahaffey, 
who was the primary facilitator for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The goals of the proposed facilitator training 
are to empower individuals within the VA system to be able to support MBIs in a sustainable 
fashion, and to ensure consistency and reliability in MBI delivery (treatment fidelity). We will 
provide standardized training to ensure facilitators have the necessary skills and comfort levels 
to deliver the intervention. Given that the facilitators will play a supportive role to the standardized mindfulness based online video recordings, focus will be placed on developi[INVESTIGATOR_623779]’ experiences with mindfulness (similar to what would occur in an MBSR program). Basic skill building will focus on establishing 
rapport; remaining on schedule and adapting as necessary; applying principles of the program 
to patients’ situations; encouraging patient involvement; pacing sessions effectively; using 
effective interpersonal skills ; and exercising professionalism and judgement. More advanced 
skills also will be addressed including effective communication such as using open- ended 
questions; providing affirming responses; reflecting; providing summaries; and dealing with 
resistance.
116 117 Initial training will include interactive workshops presented via videoconference 
(total of about 8 hours) scheduled at times convenient for facilitators. These will be 
supplemented by [CONTACT_623835] (total of about  8 hours). Videoconferences ( about 
monthly for 1 hour) will be held and led by [CONTACT_125699]. Haley, [CONTACT_21148], and [CONTACT_409720], to build a 
community of practice to problem -solve, facilitate consistency, and ensure adherence to study 
protocols, between facilitators and across sites. Annual refresher training will include workshops (total  of about 4 hours) with webinars and online training modules (total of about 2 hours). 
Fidelity  to group sessions will be assessed through structured fidelity checklists (adapted from 
those used previously)132 133 applied to random observation of intervention sessions (10%).    
 
Risk vs. Potential Benefit. The proposed research poses “minimal risk” to subjects. There are 
no experimental procedures involved in this study. The potential risks to study participants 
include loss of privacy and confidentiality. There are no economic and minimal social risks of 
participating in the study. The surveys will not ask  very sensitive questions and subjects can 
refuse to answer any question(s). The potential risks associated with the individual interviews include psychosocial stress (any research project with direct contact [CONTACT_623836]). This is true for both usual 
care as well as intervention groups.  
 Mindfulness -based interventions are regarded as relatively safe interventions. A [ADDRESS_830653] safety information, including severe adverse events (SAEs), unanticipated problems (UAPs), and adverse events (AEs). In the follow up questionnaires, participants will be asked to report 
side effects/adverse events related to the interventions by [CONTACT_215410] a list generated from 
the literature and the investigators’ experience (see below).

the study team will contact [CONTACT_623837].  
[CONTACT_409720] will be responsibl e for overseeing and ensuring an IRB-compliant process for 
reporting Adverse Events (AEs), including Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Unanticipated 
Problems (U APs), should any occur. If/when [CONTACT_409720] is unavailable (e.g., away from her 
post), Drs. Polusny and Meis wil l serve as backup persons responsible in [CONTACT_409720]’s stead.  
 
Behavioral health contact [CONTACT_623838]. Contact [CONTACT_623839] (1-800-273-
8255 [TALK] and press 1) and local VA Health Care System contacts. If the participant 
endorses self-harm ideation or is in emotional distress when in group or on the phone with a 
member of the study staff, staff will  follow  a mental health protection for human s ubjects 
protocol, on which all study staff will be trained.  
 
Our hypothesis is that participants in the Mobile and Mobile+Group MBIs will experience relief 
from chronic pain in terms of intensity and interference. It is possible participants in the U C 
group may also experience a decrease in pain intensity and interference. Still, it is possible that 
participants will experience no direct benefit from taking part in this research study. However, 
the information participants provide from this study might help us treat future chronic pain 
patients. This research will help guide the development of strategies to improve health care 
within the VA, particularly for veterans with chronic pain.  
 
Aim 2  
Data will be collected and described, guided by [CONTACT_623840], Effectiveness, Adoption, 
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE -AIM) framework.  
 
AIM 2 a (PRE-IMPLEMENTATION): We will use surveys with closed- and open-ended 
questions, aimed at understanding participants’ experiences (e.g., barriers and facilitators) with 
different intervention components. A final question will ask, “ Our team would like to share 
Veterans’ experi ences participating in the LAMP study. Would you be willing to be contact[CONTACT_623841]: April 8, 2024

 our research team in the future for this?”. Participants who say yes to this maybe be re-
contact[CONTACT_623842] , either with LAMP or wi th other 
research studies . A letter letting participants know about the re-contact [CONTACT_623843]-contact [CONTACT_623844]-contact [CONTACT_14386].  
   
AIM 2b (PRE -IMPLEMENTATION): The purpose of this study is to identify barriers and 
facilitators to the successful, long-term implementation of the LAMP program in the VHA, to 
inform future implementation efforts. Participants will be VA employees who could provide input 
to guide the future implementation of LAMP (such as providers involved in treating pain). We will 
identify these participants with input from our facility, VISN, and national partners, including our 
operational partners from the Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformati on 
(OPCC&CT) and the Pain Management, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_623780], Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PMOP). Recruitment, interviews, and data analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_464], including 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burgess.  
Risk vs. Potential Benefit. The proposed research poses “minimal risk” to subjects. There are 
no experimental procedures involved in the study. The potential risks to study participants 
include loss of privacy and confidentiality, and minimal economic and social risks. All efforts will  
be made to de-identify transcripts, keep data confidential and results anonymous. 
Participants will be assigned their position title or other general label instead of actual names in 
the field notes, interview transcripts, and interview file names. Other individuals referred to by 
[CONTACT_623845]. When 
disseminating results, whether oral or written, the research team will collapse information across 
stakeholders to ensure that no sensitive or identifiable information is included. 
 
We anticipate few direct benefits to participants in our pre-implementation study. However, the 
information participants provide from this study might help us treat future Veterans with chronic 
pain. This r esearch will help guide the development of strategies to improve health care within 
the VA, particularly for Veterans with chronic pain and underserved subgroups of Veterans (e.g., women, rural, and racial/ethnic minorities).  
 
Vulnerable populations. Stakeholders involved in our study may be considered vulnerable, 
either because they are from underserved populations, minority populations, are women, and/or 
are employees of the VA. All study subjects are expected to be 18 years of age or older (no 
children will be included). We will follow all required protocols when working with VA employees 
as study participants, including communication with employee unions.

LAMP Version 16 , March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012 Page 35 of 60 
 Aim 1  
 
We anticipate recruiting up to 95 0 participants from our 4 sites, using our proactive recruitment 
protocol  (see below). The subject population for our study will be chronic pain patients from the 
Minneapolis, Durham, Indianapolis, and Los Angeles VA medical centers They will be 18 years 
or older. Using this protocol, we plan to recruit up to 950 participants with about 40%  being 
female. Participants will be randomized to one of the 3 study arms and asked to participate in the subsequent intervention. Thus 250 participants will be in each arm (Mobile+Group, Mobile, 
and UC). All participants will be asked to complete the screener, and then complete the baseline 
and 10-week , 6-month, and 12-month follow -up surveys. Participants will be given $25 for each 
survey they complete (possible total of $ 100). Completion of the eligibility components will result 
in randomization to one of the three study arms, (Mobile+Group MBI, Mobile MBI, or UC (1:1:1)).  
 Proactive recruitment protocol.  
 
For the PCT, these patient study IDs will be imported into Qualtrics FedRAMP. Participants will 
be recruited using two different approaches.  All participants will  receive pre-notification of the 
study  by [CONTACT_623846].  In Approach #1 (“postal mail -only”), i ntroductory letters  will be mailed that 
include instructions for accessing the study website via a secure URL, an opt-out option, and 
information about the monetary incentive that study participants will receive. Participants will also be sent  an information sheet, informational newsletter, and general introductory brochure. 
In Approach #2 (“postal mail + email), participants will be notified about the study by [CONTACT_623847], 
which will: 1) inform them that they will be receiving an email inviting them to be in a research 
study for Veterans  and 2) provide instructions for opting out via email or phone. This postal 
mailing will be followed by [CONTACT_623848], using the email in the VA EHR, which will contain the same 
information (in email form) provided to those in paper form in Approach #1. This “email 
recruitment packet” will contain i nstructions for accessing the study website via a secure URL 
(which has been approved by [CONTACT_623849] a prior amendment) and direct links to the information sheet, informational newsletter, and general introductory brochure, which reside on the website. 
The email will also contain an opt-out option, information about the monetary incentive that 
study participants will receive, and information contained in the paper brochure. Emails will be 
sent using Qualtrics FedRAMP. 
Qualtrics FedRAMP is authorized by [CONTACT_623850].  
 
In Approach #1, participants who do not respond will be sent a reminder postcard to encourage 
a response of some sort. In Approach #2, participants who do not respond will be sent reminder postcards and/or emails to encourage a response of some sort. Participants who log into the 
study website will then be directed to the study screener. Study staff will  potentially follow-up 
with participants who start the screener and/or baseline but do not finish, as well as participants who do not respond in any way . Communications will include answering participant questions, 
encouraging people to do the screener and baseline online, reviewing what is coming next in 
the study (medical chart review, baseline survey, follow -up call for randomization, etc.), and

 asking questions about how to improve the recruitment process . Trained study staff will respond 
to participants who reach out via email or phone with questions. 
 
Refer to the 5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion section below for eligibility criteria.  
 Aim 2 a: Pre -implementation data will be collected from Veteran participants via survey. 
  
Pre-implementation data will be col lected from Veteran participants as an “extra” survey 
intervention participants can opt into at the end of their 10-week follow -up survey. The pre-
implementation survey will be administered using Qualtrics FedRAMP, as are the other surveys in this study. Participants will be paid an additional $25 for completing the pre-implementation 
survey. We will send them minimal text and email reminders if they indicate they would like to 
complete the extra survey but don’t do so within a few days.  
 Aim 2b: Pr e-implementation data will be collected from VA employee stakeholders using 
rapid qualitative analysis methods 
 
Recruitment protocol. We will recruit a total of n=30 employee stakeholders by [CONTACT_6968]. The 
email will come from the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_409720]) and will invite the participant to 
completed a semi -structured interview (lasting 30-45 minutes), conducted over video, aimed at 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_623781] a new mindfulness program for Veterans with chronic pain, within the VHA. Participants will also be asked to 
complete a short demographic questionnaire only using VA -approved Qualtrics FedRAMP. 
Limited reminder emails will be sent to non-responders. 
 
Study Procedures and Materials.  All qualitative interviews will be video and/or audio recorded 
using VA-approved technology  (e.g., Microsoft Teams). Meeting times will be agreed upon 
ahead of time between facilitators and stakeholders. All reasonable efforts will be made to work 
with each stakeholders’ schedule and preference for meeting. 
 
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
5.3a. Informed Consent Procedures for Veterans (Aims 1 and 2a)  
 
We will seek waiver s of both informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the initial search of 
EHRs for potential participants. The research meets all of the criteria for requesting a waiver of 
the informed consent process, including involving no more than minimal tangible or intangible risk to the participants, the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the 
participants, the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver, and when 
possible, participants will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.  
 The information requested in the waivers is needed on all identified subjects so that we are able 
to conduct analyses to assess and correct for non-response bias. Specifically, we plan to conduct analyses to determine whether the participants who responded to our request for 
VA Central IRB

 participation differ from those who did not respond, on a number of characteristics that are 
available through the administrative data set (e.g., age, healthcare comorbidity). If we do find 
that non-response bias exists, we would then be able to statistically adjust for this bias using the 
data on non -respondents available from the administrative dataset. Requiring HIPAA 
authorization for the VA administrative data requested in this waiver from subjects would not allow us to conduct thes e analyses. In addition to the initial search of EHRs, we are seeking a 
waiver of HIPAA authorization for the entire study.   
We are seeking a waiver of documentation of informed consent for the PCT portion of the study , 
the “pre-implementation”  follow -up surveys with a portion of intervention participants , and re-
contact[CONTACT_30697] a portion of the pre-implementation follow -up survey completers . We are not asking 
sensitive questions in this survey. Asking subjects to return signed consent and authorization 
documents for this minimal risk study would dramatically reduce response rates and introduce 
bias. Additionally, the signed consent form would potentially increase risk for loss of privacy as 
all identifying information will be destroyed as soon as feasibly possi ble. Participants  will receive 
mailed, pre-notification (postcard or letter, depending upon the recruitment approach; see 
Section 5.2)  that contains an opt-out option for those who do not want to be contact[CONTACT_623851] .  Participants in recruitment approach #1 (postal mail only)  will receive, with their pre-
notification letter, an information sheet containing: 1) information explaining the risks and 
benefits of study participation, 2) their rights as study participants and their privacy rights and 3) 
required elements of informed consent. Participants in recruitment approach #2 (postal mail + 
email) will be given a link to an electronic copy of the information sheet,  as part of their email 
recruitment packet. Randomized participants in recruitment approach #[ADDRESS_830655] person and explaining that study staff will do the following if they are 
concerned about a participant’s or others’ safety. Study staff will explain: If we are concerned for 
your immediate safety, we may try calling, and/or emailing you, contact[CONTACT_623852], and will then escalate further (for example, asking the Veteran Crisis Line staff 
to contact [CONTACT_10825], asking the Suicide Prevention team at your VA site to contact [CONTACT_10825], or asking 
your local police to do a wellness check) as it seems necessary to protect you or others. Only if 
participants agree to continue, they will be randomized a study group.  
 
5.3b. Informed Consent Procedures fo r VA employee stakeholders (Aim 
2b) 
We are requesting a waiver of documentation of informed consent for this portion of the study 
as it does not exceed minimal risk. Participants will be provided with an Information Sheet 
describing the same aspects of the study as an informed consent form would do. It will be 
explained that the recordings will  only be heard/viewed by [CONTACT_623853]-identified. Participants can stop the interview at any time. A copy of the VA 
CIRB information sheet will be provided to each stakeholder ahead of data collection. 
Stakeholders will have multiple opportunities to ask questions prior to data collection.

 5.4a. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Veterans (Aims 1 and 2a)  
Several evaluation components will be used to assess eligibility. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_623782], we will have minimal exclusion criteria.  
 
Participants  eligible to receive an introductory letter will be those have received a qualifying pain 
diagnoses on at least [ADDRESS_830656] 90 days part, within the same pain category, during the previous 2 years. The pain categories were initially  defined by [CONTACT_623854], Ninth or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes (ICD -9-CM/ICD -10-CM)  and updated based on our team’s participation in the PMC3 
Phenotypes and Outcomes Working Group. Participants must have received care at one of the 
study sites.  
 
Screener questions will be asked (online via Qualtrics FedRAMP or over the phone) to assess 
whether the following are true: 
• Eligible participants must have pain duration of ≥ 6 months, and moderate to severe pain intensity  (defined as a numeric rating score of ≥ 4 on a 0 to 10 scale).  
• Pa rticipants must have access to a smart phone that meets the requirements of the 
mobile app software (this is pragmatic as access to such devices would be required for participation in a non-research context). 
• Participants must have access to a device (e.g., smart phone, iPad, desktop computer) that enables them to participate in online UMN Zoom meetings). 
• Participants must be willing and able to download the mobile app onto their phone and agree to the app-required permission settings.  
• Participants must have adequate wireless or cellular internet access on a daily basis  in a 
private space (e .g., at home).  
• Participants must be willing to meet via Zoom  at the specific date and time that 
Mobile+Group sessions are held.  
• Participants must be willing to attend all sessions of the arm to which they are randomized. 
 
As part of the screener, participants will be asked whether they prefer to receive communication by [CONTACT_648], email , and/or text message. They will have the opportunity to 
provide their  phone number to allow phone calls,  email if they would like us to contact [CONTACT_623855] 
([EMAIL_11906]
), and they  can choose to provide their mobile phone number if they 
would like us to contact [CONTACT_623856]. 
Study staff will conduct a medical chart review in the electronic medical record of all participants who meet the screening criteria, in order to exclude any patients with active 
psychotic symptoms, suicidality, severe depression, and/or active manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_623783]. Some experts consider  these disorders as contraindications for 
MBIs.

5.4b. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for VA Employee Stakeholders (Aim 
2b) 
Participants will be VA employees who could provide input to guide the future implementation of 
LAMP (suc h as providers involved in treating pain). We will identify these participants with input 
from our facility, VISN, and national partners .  
 
5.5 Study Evaluations  
5.5a. Study Evaluations  for Veterans (Aims 1 and 2a)  
Data Collection. Data will be collected using Qualtrics FedRAMP  surveys,  paper surveys, 
telephone surveys, the mobile application, and EHRs. These measures are described below 
and in Table 2.  
 
Qualtrics  FedRAMP  electronic survey software accessed via the VA cloud will be used. 
Qualtrics FedRAMP  has been approved for use from the VA OIT Security standpoint (Authority 
to Operate or ATO). The ATO status is currently approved for 1 year and a full 3-year ATO is in 
the works. (See ORD IT Servic e Catalog 190530 memo for more details.)   Qualtrics  FedRAMP 
surveys will contain a study ID number, time of data entry  and limited individually identifiable 
information.  Within the VA firewall, the study team at the VA will create a custom -built tracking 
app that will track each participant’s enrollment and study status. Data will be routinely extracted 
from Qualtrics FedRAMP in the VA cloud and stored on secure CCDOR servers, using SQL 
database connections. All data will be stored and utilized within secure CCDOR servers that are 
part of the Minneapolis VAMC network and which operate behind the VA firewall. All data is 
tracked using a SQL database, with a GUI-front end system that restricts access to only those 
with approval to study data.    
Qualtrics  FedRAMP surveys will contain minimal individually identifying information. The only 
identifying information will be information that is self-reported by [CONTACT_3038] (e.g. name, 
phone, email, which is best method of contact). No sensitive data will be stored outside of the 
VA protected environment. Once data are transferred for data analysis, data will be maintained 
on password-protected VA computers in the VA environment and on secure VA servers.  
Study staff will monitor the functioning of the Qualtrics  FedRAMP application. Only staff affiliated 
with this research protocol will have access to Qualtrics  FedRAMP data collected for this study.

LAMP Version 1 6, March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template –  version 10/26/[ADDRESS_830658] not completed their assessments. To help decrease the number of participants who don’t complete their assessments, we will mail a newsletter between each 
survey and a reminder postcard shortly before each survey is emailed. After sending 
assessments, w e will contact [CONTACT_105]-responders via their specified preferred method and using 
additional contact [CONTACT_623857]. We will encourage online completion but mail 
paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_623785]. We will email, mail, call , and text 
participants with reminders to complete the surveys. The emails will be sent using the LAMP 
study email address  or via Qualtrics FedRAMP . Text messages  will be sent via Qualtrics 
FedRAMP. Participants will be c ontacted to follow -up on any missing data that doesn’t seem 
deliberate (e.g., if a couple of survey pages are completely blank but the rest of the survey is 
answered, it is likely the couple pages got stuck together rather than deliberately skipped). Participant flow data using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 
framework

device. However, we will not use this information in our research or transfer it to the VA . Co-I [CONTACT_56577] h as successfully conducted VA -funded studies using this data collection approach.   
 
Data coordination and management. Data collection and management will be overseen at the 
Minneapolis VA HSR&D Center of Innovation (COIN) by  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Brent Taylor. R egular meetings of 
investigators and study staff within and between sites will take place to routinely review data 
collection and management issues. To prevent improper use of any data collected for research 
projects conducted at the Minneapolis COIN we will use a combination of local Minneapolis VA secure servers as well as the national secure VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure 
(VINCI)  and the secure Qualtrics  FedRAMP system  in the VA cloud. The local VA secure 
servers facilitate data collection and provide a platform for the customized research tracking application, while the VINCI platform provides a robust environment for pooling the primary 
research collected data with direct connections to daily or weekly updated mirrors of nearly the 
entire VHA E HR. VINCI  also provides access to extensive storage area networks, drives, file 
shares, databases, SharePoint for collaboration and correspondence sites, SAS/Grid, and 
servers containing virtual machines with an extensive collection of software called the VINCI 
Workspace . We will request access to the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) in order to capture the

participants in a timely manner ; being able to access current address and phone numbers will 
help in tracking hard to reach participants.   A secure link between local VA secure servers, the 
data collected on the MEI designed mobile applications, and Qualtrics  FedRAMP will be 
created. Limited study specific data will be collected on the mobile applications  and Qualtrics 
FedRAMP  and will contain a study specific participant ID code. Only after the data are securely 
transferred to the local VA server environment will the mobile study data be linked to participant 
VHA data using the study ID. VINCI allows individual researchers and their staff the means to 
securely conduct their research projects within a secure and well controlled technical 
environment. All of these VA systems undergo backups  of the servers nightly and servers are 
updated when new security patches become available. All individuals with administrative 
privileges to the VHA servers have been screened and have been assigned security clearance 
putting them in trusted positions to work with patient-level data.

Baseline Measures will include demographic data (assessed by [CONTACT_6270]-report and the E HR) and 
clinical data (assessed by [CONTACT_941] E HR) to capture common mental health comorbidities ( e.g., 
depressive disorder, PTSD, anxiety, sleep-related disorders, and substance use disorders), 
medication use, and prior treatment for pain. These will be assessed by [CONTACT_623859] . We 
will also include the Pain Management Collaboratory Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID -19) 
Measures, comprised of seven items assessing the potential impacts of the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
 
Our Primary Outcome will be pain severity and functioning, defined as a change  in the Brief 
Pain Inventory (BPI) total score (assessed by [CONTACT_154700]) . The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assesses 
two key domains —intens ity and interference—recommended for pain studies99 and has been 
validated in primary care.119 The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623786]. The pain intensity score is an average of 4 ratings of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as 
you can imagine) for current, least, worst, and average pain in the past week. The pain 
interference score averages seven ratings, 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (interferes completely), of 
interference with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623787]

incorporated Common Data Elements (CDEs), for use in our patient surveys. Specifically, we 
will use measures from the PROMIS -29 Profile v2.0 Instrument ( www.nihpromis.org ) as 
recommended by [CONTACT_623860].123 This includes quality of life, emotional 
functioning and mental health-related outcomes (anxiety, depression), and outcomes related to 
fatigue and sleep. Self-reported data will also be collected on PTSD symptoms using the PTSD 
checklist (PCL), version C, DSM -V update,124 and patient satisfaction (using a short measure 
used by [CONTACT_623861]).[ADDRESS_830663] information encouraged to 
report exacerbation of symptoms or adverse effects to the class facilitators or study coordinator.

 We will use electronic medical data from VA health care records to assess other measures 
of chronic pain burden including change in analgesic use (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), and frequency and health care utilization (e.g. MRIs, injections, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgery). Among those prescribed

 of pain-related services outside of intervention visits will be estimated by [CONTACT_623862]-related 
specialty visits and pain- related mental health visits. Complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623790], but therapi[INVESTIGATOR_623791] (e.g., acupuncture) will be assessed. Other complementary services may be variably recorded under general codes; for 
example, yoga could be coded as a recreational therapy visit.  
 
Process Measures/Mediators will include items to assess Capabilities, Opportunities, 
Motivations, and Adaptive Pain-Related Behaviors  that the intervention is designed to address 
(delineated in our Theoretical Framework, see Figure 1). Mindfulness skills  will be assessed 
through the Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS), a 15-item validated scale will be used 
to assess the extent to which participants used mindfulness practice in their daily life (e.g., to “calm my emotions when I was upset,” “stop reacting to my negative impulses,” “relax my body 
when I was tense,” and “stop my unhelpful reactions to situations”).
85  Opportunities  will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_623863], captured by [CONTACT_623864]-report. Motivations  will be assessed by [CONTACT_623865]-efficacy and decreases in pain-related fear avoidance. Pain 
catastrophizing will be assessed with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Pain management 
self-efficacy  will be as sessed with the 8-item Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ),131 which 
has been used in numerous studies with chronic pain patients. Adaptive pain-related behaviors  
include reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] (assessed by E HR data) and increase in use of non-
pharmacologic pain management strategies (assessed by E HR data and self-report). We also 
will assess perceived stress, with the NIH Toolbox Perceived Stress Fixed Form Age 18+ v2.0 .

5.6 Analysis Plan  
 
AIM 1: EFFECTIVENESS  
Primary e ffectiveness will be assessed by  [CONTACT_623809] 12-month 
follow -up (Brief Pain Inventory total score). Secondary analyses  will examine the effectiveness 
of the intervention separately by [CONTACT_547].   
Secondary outcomes will include measures captured in health care records (e.g., medication 
prescription/refills, health care visits for pain management) as well as patient-reported measures 
related to pain, comorbid mental health conditions and function, expected mediators of 
treatment effects, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. We will also explore patient 
characteristics that may predict treatment response.  These outcomes will be assessed at 
baseline, 10 weeks, 6 months , and 12 months. Aim 2.1 methods involving recruitment, study 
design, intervention, data collection, and outcomes are described in the prior section. Methods 
related to expected participation, data analysis, and data coordination and management are 
described in the following section.  
Expected participation in Phase 2 t rial 
We base proposed estimates on our experience conducting previous successful trials with 
Veterans with chronic pain (ACTION, SPACE, EPOCH, ECLIPSE).   Study participants will be 
recruited from the Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Grea ter Los Angeles and Durham VA Health Care 
System s, using a process successfully used in prior studies by [CONTACT_244039], 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_623792] [ADDRESS_830664] about 8 0,000 patients who 
meet our initial eligibility criteria. We estimate from our Phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a randomization rate of 
2.5%  but an increased randomization rate when using approach #2, email recruitment. 
Therefore, we will need to screen approximately 100,000 patients in order to reach our 
recruitment goal of up to 950 randomized.  We want an approximately balanced sample of men 
and women. We estimate women will respond at up to 3 times the rate of men (approximately 
4.5% for women and almost 2% for men). If we screen a large portion of the sample of eligible 
women (about 20,000) and about 1/3 of the eligible men (about 80,000), then we should reach 
our recruitment goal of up to 950 randomized, with nearly balanced men and women. Among 
those randomized, we are conservatively planning that up to 20% might be missing complete follow -up data but based on past work we believe the actual level of missing data will be closer 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: April 8, 2024
LAMP Version 1 6, March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template –  version 10/26/2012 Page 45 of 60 
 to 10-15%. Ultimately, this would yield a randomized N= up to 950 and with retention of 600 or 
greater participants at 6 and 12 months.  
Power and Sample Size Estimate   
Our power calculation uses the total BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623793]. For our 
primary analysis we estimate there will be 200 participants in each of the three treatment arms 
with complete data for a total of 600 people with complete data from a total of up to 9 50 
randomized. Two hundred participants in each arm would yield 80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis of equal means if any of the three arms differed from each other by [CONTACT_623866] 
0.33 or greater. This is based on an alpha level of 0.0167 (Bonferroni correction of 0.05/3 = 
0.0167) for each of the three comparisons (Mobile+Group vs Usual Care, Mobile vs Usual Care, and Mobile+G roup vs Mobile). Using the same assumptions, there would be 90% power to 
detect differences of 0.[ADDRESS_830665] size of 
around 0.5.  
As a secondary analysis we will look at a categorical responder analysis, in which we define clinically significant changes as a 30% reduction in BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623794]. This is an accepted 
threshold for clinically significant improvement in clinical trials and recommended by [CONTACT_623867].  
Previous studies demonstrate that a 30% reduction on the BPI [CONTACT_832] a clinically important 
difference. Prior studies have shown that 15-20% of UC patients demonstrate a 30% reduction 
in pain function score from baseline to follow -up. With 200 people in each arm there would be 
80% power to detect absolute differences of greater than 13.3%, 14.3%, and 16%, respectively, based on assumptions of 15%, 20% or 35% in the comparison arms (accounting Bonferroni 
corrections for comparisons of Mobile+Group vs Usual Care, Mobile vs Usual Care, and 
Mobile+Group vs Mobile).  
Based on the conservative estimate of 20% attrition, we propose randomizing at least 250 per 
arm to ensure that we maintain a minimum effective size of 200 per group (250 people per 
group*.80=200). If we instead achieve the anticipated attrition rate of only 10% then our sample 
will be approxi mately [ADDRESS_830666] (e.g. medications, 
health care utilization related to pain treatment). In previous studies, we have observed outcome completion rates in excess of 90% at each assessment time- point. Initial analyses will use all 
VA Central IRB
Effective Date: April 8, 2024
LAMP Version 1 6, March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template –  version 10/26/[ADDRESS_830667] of treatment group differences (this will be done for all three comparisons of the Mobile, 
Mobile+Group, and Usual Care arms). Between-group differences will be estimated for each of 
the time points (e.g. 10 weeks, 6 months and 12 months). The secondary outcomes physical 
function, anxiety, depress ion, fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and 
activities, patient-ratings of improvement, and PTSD) will be similarly analyzed using the same 
linear mixed effect models for normal continuous measures and appropriate generalized linear 
mixed effect models for non-normal measures. For example, the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623795], which ever best fit the data, for the repeated dichotomous outcomes of a 30% reduction 
from baseline in BPI [INVESTIGATOR_623796] 12-month study period.  
Additional exploratory analyses involve the assessment of the extent to which amount of 
mindfulness practice, pain acceptance, pain-related fear avoidance, pain management self-
efficacy, mindfulness skills, and perceived stress mediate the effects of the intervention. The 
indirect effects of these potential mediators will be tested using the bootstrap approach to 
obtaining confidence intervals to avoid the often -violated ass umption underlying Sobel’s (1982) 
method that the sampling distribution of the indirect effect will be normal. Similar to the methods 
described above for the primary analyses, weighted selection model analyses will examine 
sensitivity of results to respons e biases. 
To assess the sensitivity of these initial analyses to response bias, we will fit a series of weighted selection model analyses. Each analysis will use an EM algorithm to estimate weights 
to assign to potential values of the missing outcomes for use in the regression model. Models 
will be varied to use different combinations of the following variables —intervention, observation 
and value of the outcome at various assessments, and baseline covariates together with pain measurements and services util ization over the follow -up period—as predictors to consider 
different potential missing at random and missing not at random mechanisms generating the 
missing data.  
It has been hypothesized that men and women may respond differently to the interventions and 
this might be particularly true for the group-based portions of the intervention. An interaction 
between treatment and gender will be assessed, however tests for interaction tend to be 
underpowered and this is an important area of concern, so gender stratified results will be 
presented in secondary analyses even if statistical evidence of interaction is not found.

demographic variables (age, military branch, race, ethnicity, sex), and COVID -19 questionnaire 
variables.  
A purpose of the Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) is to support analyses of data pooled 
from different studies.  We will contribute deidentified demographic and clinical data from the 
LAMP project in the PMC for analyses such as the COVID -[ADDRESS_830669] access to. We will combine data from the 
other studies with ours to create a combined dataset for analysis. Data will be transferred from 
our group electronically using email and PKI encryption. Data will be stored, managed, and 
analyzed in the VA environment (research investigator folder and VINCI e nvironment) by [CONTACT_623868].  We will enter into a data sharing agreement with groups sharing data that 
specifies (1) the information will only be used for research purposes and not to identify any 
individual participant; (2) the information will be secured using appropriate computer technology 
and (3) the data will be destroyed or returned after analyses are completed. This same request 
has previously been CIRB -approved for the Pain Management Collaboratory project with PIs 
Drs. Rosen and Martino. 
  
AIM 2 (PRE -IMPLEMENTATION):  data will be collected & described, guided by [CONTACT_549054], 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE -AIM) framework.  
 
Aim 2a:  Pre-implementation data will be collected from Veteran participants via survey 
We plan to collect “pre-implementation” data from a subset of intervention participants . We will 
conduct descriptive analyses of quantitative data separately by [CONTACT_53272] (Mobile, 
Mobile + Group); and explore differences that may emerge by [CONTACT_547]. Independent t -tests (for 
means) and z -tests (for proportions) will be used to assess group differences when appropriate. 
We will use Rapid Assessment Process (RAP) analyses to analyze open -ended responses      
Aim 2b:  Pre-implementation data will be collected from VA employee stakeholders using 
rapid qualitative analysis methods. 
Our qualitative data analysis strategy was developed specifically for rapid health services 
research.
139 Prior to conducting any interviews, we will use our interview guide to develop an 
analytic matrix template, organized by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_512107]. Interviews will be transcribed. Guided by [CONTACT_623869], we will complete a matrix for each individual interview. Matrix completion will involve 
summarizing the unique, substantive participant observations made during the interview for 
each topi[INVESTIGATOR_623797]-stamped participant quotations illustrating each 
summary. After an initial matrix is completed for each interview, a combined master matrix will 
be created. All identified observations and illustrative quotations will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_623798].

5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects   
Participants can withdraw or be terminated from the study at any point. They can 
withdraw from the study at any time they feel uncomfortable or choose to do so. We 
anticipate terminati ng participation if:  
1. The participant display s abusive behavior toward other participants and/or  the study 
staff.  
2. Study staff believe the participant cannot meaningfully participate in the study.  
3. Study staff believe it is not in the participant’s best interest to stay in the study.  
4. The participant becomes ineligible to participate . 
5. The participant does not follow instructions from the researchers . 
6. The study is suspended or canceled.  
7. Any other condition that renders patients unable to benefit from treatment. 
8. The participant chooses  to withdraw consent.  
 
  
6.[ADDRESS_830670] be reported 
(i.e. unanticipated serious adverse events  (U-SAEs), unanticipated problems (UAPs), 
protocol deviations/violations/noncompliance, and any changes with respect to the protocol ). 
The study staff will remain in regular contact (by [CONTACT_648], email, and face-to -face) to discuss 
study processes, progress, and any issue s encountered. Any issue s will be reported directly 
to the PI. Data will be reviewed regularly to e nsure accuracy and data privacy. In the case of 
problems , the project coordinator will immediately discuss with the study PI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_623799] y (e.g., completing forms 119 or 129) 
within 5 business days of learning of the problem(s). If there are modifications or 
amendments to the study the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_623800] 
(i.e., 116) and wait for approval prior to im plementation. Additionally, all unanticipated 
deaths that are related to a research study overseen by [CONTACT_623870] -free number (877) 354-
3130. 
 
The current application is for a lo w-risk clinical trial. The Study Coordinator and participants 
are not blinded to the study condition group assignment. Therefore, we believe, [CONTACT_409720], 
as the PI, can be responsible for carrying out the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) 
throughout the entire study period. [CONTACT_409720] will thus be responsible for overseeing and 
ensuring an IRB -compliant process for reporting Adverse Events (AEs), including Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs), and Unanticipated Problems (UPs), should any occur.

7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality 
 
• This study will utilize a combination of primary data collection via an MEI Research, 
Ltd. created app linked to secure cloud-based servers, a study participant tracking 
application housed on secure VA CCDOR servers , Qualtrics  FedRAMP , links to 
existing VHA administrative data using VINCI ( a Health Services Research & 
Development (HSR&D) Resource Center ), and audio/video/transcribed recorded 
qualitative interviews . 
• For each research project, National Data Services (NDS) authorizes limited access 
to VA data via the Data Access Request Tracker (DART). After obtaining CIRB 
approval, we will request as needed access to extracts of the Corporate Data 
Warehouse (CDW) that contains national data from several clinical and 
administrative systems in a common relational database.  
• Secure workspace will be allocated to the project for data extraction, processing, analyses and storage on a cluster of secure VINCI servers located at the Austin Information 
Technology Center (AITC). All access, processing, and analyses of VA E HR study data will 
be done within VINCI by [CONTACT_623871] & Data Group (CCDOR/SDG). Patient and provider identifiers will be used within VINCI when necessary to link records obtained from 
different files.  
• With the exception of the initial app  data, the entire study database (information retrieved 
from E HR data, recruitment outcomes) will be fully contained on secure VHA servers, 
behind the VA firewall (local CCDOR servers and National VA VINCI servers).  
• Initial screening and survey data will be securely stored on Qualtrics  FedRAMP VA cloud 
servers that are approved and fully compliant to house VA research data. Study participants 
have a study ID number will be used as the unique identifier for the Qualtrics  FedRAMP 
system. Participant self-reported data that are collected via the app will only be identifiable using this study ID. The participant’s preferred method of communication will be collected 
along with their email and phone number, if they choose to provide it. All crosswalk files that link the study ID to other participant identifiable data will be kept securely within the VA 
firewall. Data will be securely transmitted from the secure Qualtrics  FedRAMP VA cloud 
servers to the local VA platform. 
• Initial app data will be securely stored on MEI Research cloud-based servers that will be 
approved and fully  compliant to house VA research data. When study participants are 
enrolled into the study they will be given a unique study ID number. This study ID number 
will be used as the unique identifier for the app. Participant self-reported data and app 
usage data that are collected via the app will only be identifiable using this study ID. All 
crosswalk files that link the study ID to other participant identifiable data will be kept securely within the VA firewall. App data will be securely transmitted from the secure MEI Research 
cloud servers to the VINCI platform. 
• All typed field notes, electronic recordings, interview transcripts, and analytic notes will be 
stored on VA servers. During the data gathering process in the field, all entries will be made onto VA -sanctioned devices.

 • VHA CCDOR servers will be used for running the customized tracking application software 
that contains participant contact [CONTACT_3031]. EH R data will be extracted from within the 
VHA’s secure VINCI platform. Only once the app data are within the VA firewall will the app 
data be linked to the participant EH R data. Therefore, participant identifiable data will be 
robustly protected throughout the project lifecycle within the VA firewall. 
• Reminders to complete surveys will be sent to the participant’s preferred method of contact, 
phone, email , mail, or text. Continued non-response will activate reminders sent via other 
methods, including phone, email, mail, and text message. Email will be sent using the LAMP 
study email  or via Qualtrics FedRAMP. Text messages will be sent via Qualtrics FedRAMP.  
• ORD Guidelines regarding using email and text messaging for communicating with VA 
research participants, as drafted in the following document, will be followed: https://www.research.va.gov/resources/policies/guidance/draft-electronic -mailtext.pdf
. This 
includes : 
• No PHI or PII will be transmitted by [CONTACT_623872]. 
• The following text will be included in all emails and text messages  so as to try 
and prevent participants from including PHI or PII in their responses: “Email and 
texting is not secure. Please do not reply back to this message with any personal information or personal health information. Please call [PHONE_12974].”  
• Specific PHI or PII will not be shared in emails from VA staff, but if there is a 
concern for the participant’s immediate safety, and all other forms of 
communication (phone, emergency contact [CONTACT_9702]’s phone) are not successful, 
emails with general statements like the following will be sent:  “My role as your 
facilitator is to create a safe space to share and also to make sure you are safe. I 
have tried reaching you by [CONTACT_623873]. To make sure 
you are safe and doing ok, please reach out to me. My VA cell is 612-[ADDRESS_830671] the Veteran Crisis line directly by [CONTACT_3379] 1-800 -273-
8255 and Press 1.” 
• If a participant sends PII or PHI as part of a response using the individual’s personal email or text messaging, study staff will either respond by [CONTACT_623874].  
• Email  addresses of participants will be kept secure and not shared with other 
participants.  
• Emails and text messages sent and received for the LAMP study will be saved 
and maintained in accordance with the VHA Record Control Schedule.  
• CCDOR maintains strong protections for coded analysis datasets that will be stored on local 
VA server space. CCDOR provides protections for research data at least equal to that provided by [CONTACT_623875]’ private health information (PHI). Access to data is on a “need to know” basis. For example, data analysts will not have 
access to project data unless they can demonstrate that they are somehow needed for a 
particular analysis.  
• Access to project data is obtained through Windows authentication (i.e., PIV card and 
password to the network). It is virtually impossible for any person without a login name, PIV

LAMP Version 1 6, March 25, 2024 VA Central IRB Protocol Template –  version 10/26/[ADDRESS_830672] to the Minneapolis VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s domain network to access data on the 
Center’s servers. Thus, all data housed on the CCDOR Server is extremely secure. Access 
by [CONTACT_613846].  
• CCDOR maintains several secure servers that are located in the Minneapolis VA OIT server 
room. Physical access to the server room is limited to VA Office of Information and 
Technology staff. All individuals with administrative access privileges to the Center’s 
servers, including VA OIT  personnel and CCDOR  programmers , have been screened and 
assigned a security clearance putting them in trusted positions of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623801]-level data. VA OIT ’s access to the data is strictly limited to 
backing up server data, which prevents catastrophic loss of data. Backups are written to tapes that are stored in a secure location accessibl e only to OIT personnel. 
• VA regulations require that all investigators and individuals who work on the study 
undergo comprehensive training annually in research integrity and protection of 
human subjects. The CCDOR data group will ensure that all project s taff have proper 
access to the VA network (i.e., will assist local OIT  for project staff not in 
Minneapolis), so those who require access to study data will have permissions to the 
data they need.  
• Securing Other Physical Confidential Research Data: Primary data (e.g. interview transcripts and survey responses) are identified only by [CONTACT_38741]. The original data sources 
(e.g. encrypted digital recordings and paper notes) will either be kept in locked cabinets within a locked room or stored in a secure folder stored on the CCDOR server. 
• Only individuals with a need to access the data, as vetted by [CONTACT_46776]’s Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_623802]. Even then, only the absolute minimum number of data 
elements is released. This protects the integrity of the data as well as its confidentiality. 
• Study data will be destroyed in accordance with VA policy. Data will be handled in accordance with all VA and VHA privacy, confidentiality, and information security policies 
and procedures. 
• The current team and other VA investigators have used these procedures in previous 
studies, and they have proved both feasible to execute and acceptable to multiple 
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).

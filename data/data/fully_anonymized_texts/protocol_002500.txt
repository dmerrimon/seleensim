 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
  
Study Title  A Colorectal Cancer Educational Intervention in the Latino 
Community Assessing the Feasibility of Recruitment & Retention via 
a Church -Based Approach: Identification of Novel Barriers to Cancer 
Clinical Trial Enrollment  
Funder  NCTraCS   
Clinical Phase  N/A 
Study Rationale  Cancer is the leading cause of death in the US Latino community, 
with CRC accounting for 10% of overall Latino mortality.  Although 
Latino individuals are among the largest and fastest growing communities of color in the US, currently comprising 18.7%,
 their 
representation in CCTs remains low. This is of concern because: 1) 
advances arising from trials with limited Latino representation may not be applicable to the Latino population,
 and 2) decreased Latino 
participation in CCTs may delay Latino access to novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  We 
believe that low cancer -specific health knowledge may be impacting 
Latino representation and willingness to participate in CCTs and can be addressed through culturally and linguistically appropriate community- based educational interventions.  Since  Latino CCT 
underrepresentation is  likely to be a multifaceted phenomenon with 
potential contributing  barriers at the physician -, healthcare system- , 
and patient- level, understanding the multiple driving forces and 
barriers is essential to identifying potential targets for improvement and addressing our CTS roadblock of Latino underrepresentation in 
CCTs.   
Study Objective(s)  1. To identify novel Latino -perceived barriers to participation in 
CCTs.  
2. To assess the impact that CRC educational videos in Spanish 
have on participants’ CRC knowledge.  
3. To assess the potential relationship between an increase in 
health knowledge of a specific cancer via educational videos 
in Spanish and willingness to participate in CCTs.   
Test Article  The intervention in this study entails th ree CRC educational videos 
in Spanish . 
Study Design  
 To achieve our goals, Spanish speaking Latino individuals will be recruited  to participate in an educational intervention that will take 
place at STM  Church. On Study Day [ADDRESS_986243] Video CRC Knowledge Survey . After 30  +/- [ADDRESS_986244] participation.  (Study Day 3)  
Subject Population  
Key Criteria for Inclusion 
and Exclusion:  Participants should : 
1. Self-identify as Hispanic/Latino.  
2. Be Spanish speakers . 
3. Be 18 years or older . 
Participants will be excluded if they:  
1. Do not identify as Hispanic/Latino.  
2. Are not Spanish speakers . 
3. Are younger than 18 years old . 
Number Of Participants   
 60  
Study Duration  Every participant’s involvement  will require  at least two and a half 
hours over a 4 -month period (two hours to take the CRC Knowledge 
Survey , watch the videos and take the Post Video CRC Knowledge 
Survey  and thirty minutes to complete the 30 Day Follow Up CRC 
Knowledge Survey ). Participants willing to take part in a qualitative 
one-on-one interview will be asked to participate for an additional 
hour, totaling three and a half hours over a 6- month period . The 
entire study is expected to last 12 months . 
Study Phases  
A. Educational Video  
i. Screening  
ii. Study Intervention  
iii. Follow -Up 
B. Identification of 
Barriers 
Preventing Latino s 
from participating 
in CCTs  
                              A. Educational Video:  
(i) Screening:  Spanish speaking attendees at STM Church will be 
screened  for study  eligibility.  
(ii) Intervention  (Study Day 1 ): Consented p articipants will complete 
the CRC Knowledge Survey , watch three  CRC educational videos and 
complete  the Post Video CRC Knowledge Survey . Both surveys will 
be administered on paper form.  
(ii) Follow up  (Study Day 2 ): In order to assess retention of 
knowledge, p articipants will return to STM Church 30 +/ - 7 days 
after Study Day 1 to complete the 30 Day Follow Up CRC Knowledge 
Survey  on paper form.  
B. Identification of Barriers for Latino Participation in CCTs:  
(Study Day 3 ): 20 of the participants will be asked to participate in a 
qualitative one -on-one interview aimed at identifying barriers 
preventing Latinos from participating in CCTs . 
Efficacy Evaluations  Participants’ knowledge on CRC symptoms , risk factors , and general 
CRC facts  will be assessed using questions from t he “Bowel Cancer 
Awareness Measure” and from the “Colorectal Cancer Screening 
Decision Quality Instrument (CRC -DQI)”.

 Safety Evaluations  N/A, this study imposes minimal risk.  
Statistical And Analytic 
Plan  A. Identification of Barriers:  The top 2 conceptual themes within 
each section of the interview ( attitudes regarding general clinical 
trials, attitudes regarding CCTs, and perception of the 
Hispanic/Latino community) and the top [ADDRESS_986245] of the educational videos in 
Spanish on  CRC knowledge:  Use of repeated measures ANOVA with 
appropriate follow -up contrasts to compare total number of correct 
responses within three time points (baseline vs post- video; baseline 
vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow up; post -video vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up) 
accounting for multiple observations within participants .  
C. Exploration of the potential relationship between an increase in 
health knowledge of a specific cancer via educational videos in 
Spanish and willingness to participate in CCTs : Since questionnaires 
will be completed pre - and post- video, we will explore, in a 
preliminary fashion, the association between watching the video (X) and willingness to participate in CCTs (Y) using repeated -
measures/mixed -effects logistic regression on the paired responses 
of participants. The mediating effect of Study Day [ADDRESS_986246]- video 
health knowledge levels (M) on the relationship between X and Y (established in the preliminary step above) will be explored. Using a structural equation modeling approach, two mixed -effects 
generalized linear models will be carried out: one model uses both X and M to predict Y, while another uses only X to predict M. The two models will be compared and tested using the algorithm introduced 
by [CONTACT_722124] . The estimated average causal mediation 
effect (from X to Y, through M) will be tested
 using th e 
bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_413901] 1,[ADDRESS_986247]  to answer any questions that make them feel 
uncomfortable and may stop completing the questionnaires at any 
point.

 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
1.1 Introduction  
Cancer is the leading cause of death in the US Latino community, with CRC accounting for 10% of this 
overall mortality.[ADDRESS_986248] growing communities 
of color in the US, currently comprising 18.7%,2 their representation in CCTs remains low.3–5 This is of 
concern because: 1) advances arising from trials with limited Latino representation may not be 
applicable to the Latino population,6 and 2) decreased Latino participation in CCTs may delay Latino 
access to novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
We believe that low cancer -specific health knowledge may be impacting Latino representation and 
willingness to participate in CCTs and that this can be addressed through culturally and linguistically 
appropriate community -based educational interventions.7,[ADDRESS_986249] of three  educational video s in Spanish on participants’ CRC knowledge  
and willingness to participate in CCTs .   
1.3 Non -Clinical and Clinical Study Findings  
Potential benefits from participation in this study may include improvement in participants’  
knowledge  of CRC, a major healthcare problem for the Latino community . The pre - (CRC Knowledge 
Survey)  and post- educational video  (Post Video CRC Knowledge Survey)  questionnaire s will allow us to 
determine the impact of the educational video s on CRC knowledge and retainment as well as allow us 
to explore the potential relationship between an increase in knowledge on a specific cancer and 
willingness to participate in CCTs.  The follow -up questionnaire ( 30 Day Follow Up CRC Knowledge 
Survey ) will assess retention of information at 30 +/ - [ADDRESS_986250] participation  may be identified. 
The study requires completion of three questionnaires and a potential one -on-one interview. It  will be 
conducted in a familiar location  (namely , STM Church) , and we do not anticipate  any adverse events . 
There is minimal risk of emotional distress from answering questions related to CRC . However,  
Page [ADDRESS_986251] participation, will be significant.  
1.4 Rel evant Literature and Data  
Use of the Church- based Approach:  Approximately 7 5% of Foreign - and 55% of US -born Latino identify 
as Christian , respectively9 and 74% of Latinos attend Church at least [ADDRESS_986252] been evaluated in the C hurch setting11–25 including: breast cancer prevention;16,17,19  diabetes 
mellitus;14,23,24  cancer screening promotion;13,15 physical exercise promotion;18,21 HIV stigma 
reduction;20 stroke prevention;22 organ donation promotion;[ADDRESS_986253]: 1) educated Latinos  on CRC or 2) reported strategies for their 
recruitment and retention. We believe that our approach, if successful, may have broad  applicability 
for the recruitment of other ethnic minority groups with high religious beliefs across a multitude of 
denominations (e.g. 68% of Asians attend C hurch at least 1 -2/month10).  
Education of the general population/non- cancer afflicted individuals:  Most CCT educational 
interventions target individuals afflicted with the disease.27–33 While only a handful target the non-
affected general population,34–[ADDRESS_986254], a core value of Latino culture is familismo : 
“the concept of a broad network of familial support that extends beyond the nuclear family”.[ADDRESS_986255] participation,40,41 we believe that: (1) 
educating the general population and non -cancer afflicted Latino individuals and families will facilitate 
Latino CCT participation and (2) the C hurch setting, given the multiple familial generations attending 
mass, is a viable venue for educating the Latino general population.  
Education on a specific cancer & willingness to participate in CCTs:  Unlike other studies aimed at 
increasing willingness to participate in CCTs solely through general education about CCTs, our study 
focuses primarily on education on a specific cancer.27–37,42 Since education on CRC has been shown to 
Page 10 of 23 
 increase willingness to participate in CRC screening,43 we anticipate it could similarly increase 
willingness to participate in CCTs . This can be achieved by [CONTACT_722125] -making.27 
Questionnaire : Knowledge on CRC and willingness to participate in CCTs will be assessed using [ADDRESS_986256]. Perreira and 
Jessica Grant from the Odum Institute combine d the 3 subscales44–46 to form our Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722113].  This Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722114], hired through the UNC Clinical Research Support Office (CRSO), and revised, using an 
iterative process with input from the LCRB, for linguistic and cultural relevance and accuracy. The 
resultant Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722115] 29  items  that assess health knowledge levels and 1 that 
assesses  willingness to participate in CCTs ( 30 total questions). General knowledge on CRC will be 
assessed using the prompted 9 -item “Awareness of warning signs’’ (Yes/No) and the prompted 1 1-
item “Awareness of risk factors'' (5 point Likert agreement scale) subscales of the “Bowel/CRC Cancer 
Awareness Measure (Bowel/CRC CAM)”.45 Specific knowledge on CRC screening will be assessed using 
the 9-item “Knowledge on CRC screening” (mixed types of response options) subscale from the CRC 
Screening Decision Quality Instrument (CRC -DQI).46 Our outcome variable, willingness to participate in 
CCTs , will be assessed using a “Yes/No” item.28,36,42 Our Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722116], namely the CRC Knowledge Survey; Post Video CRC Knowledge Survey and 30 Day Follow Up 
CRC Knowledge Survey. Additionally, t he CRC Knowledge Survey , administered pre -video , includes 
seventeen questions  capturing demographic information  (47 total questions) , while  the 30 Day Follow 
Up CRC Knowledge Survey contains in addition to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_722117] , an open -ended  
question aimed at capturing barriers preventing Latinos from participating in CCTs  (31 total 
questions) . 
Video:  Previous studies demonstrate the superiority of a video -based approach compared to other 
educational tools in terms of knowledge acquisition and acceptance within the Latino 
population.42,43,47,48  Based upon strong recommendation from the UNC’s Audio and Video Production 
Team, we contracted  DWALT Media, which has filmed videos for UNC Medical Center and worked 
with local churches, for the production of our Spanish educational video s. Filming occurred  at UNC 
Medical Center and include d animations, figures and 3D models. The video s will educate the 
participants  on CRC symptoms, risk factors, screening and CRC facts. In addition, the third video will 
contain some information regarding CCTs.  Since Latino s consider physicians a trustworthy source of 
Page [ADDRESS_986257]  on participants’ CRC 
knowledge .  
2. Assess the potential relationship between an increase in health knowledge of a specific cancer 
via educational video s in Spanish and willingness to participate in CCTs.   
 
2 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
2.1 Study Design  
Type of Design: Single -arm intervention study  
Brief Overview of Study Phases: Following completion of the Hispanic Masses at STM Church on 
Saturday and Sunday, attendees will be approached by [CONTACT_722126] . They 
will be screened for their eligibility to participate in our study through an  Intake  Form which they  will 
be able to complete either in -person while they are at the Church,  or through the project website. 
Those  deemed  eligible will be prompted to complete the RIS  online, in -person , or via the phone. Those 
that complete the RIS  and enroll in the study will be scheduled to come to STM C hurch on future  Study 
Days . During Study Day [ADDRESS_986258] Video CRC Knowledge Survey.  On Study Day 
2 (30 +/- 7 days after their participation in Study Day 1 ), participants will return to STM Church in order 
to complete the [ADDRESS_986259] two and a half hours over a 4 -month period (two hours 
to take the CRC Knowledge Survey , watch the videos and take the Post Video CRC Knowledge Survey 
and thirty minutes to complete the 30 Day Follow Up CRC Knowledge Survey ). Participants willing to 
take part in a qualitative one -on-one interview will commit  an additional hour, totaling three and a half 
hours over a 6-month period. The entire study is expected to last 12 months.  We intend to enroll a 
total of 6 0 participants.  However, in order to recruit the necessary 20 for the qualitative interview, we 
may need to enroll more than 60 since not everyone participating in Study Days 1 and 2  will choose to 
participate in Study Day 3.  
2.3 Study Population  
Participants  should:  
(1) Self-identify as Hispanic/Latino.  
(2) Be Spanish speakers . 
(3) Be 18 years or older . 
Participants will be excluded if they:  
(1) Do not identify as Hispanic/Latino . 
(2) Are not Spanish speakers . 
(3) Are younger than 18 years .  
 
3 STUDY PROCEDURES   
3.1 Screening/Baseline Visit procedures  
Interested participants will be asked to complete an I ntake Form in Spanish  which captures name [CONTACT_13255] [CONTACT_722127] . Those  deemed eligible will 
be prompted to complete the RIS . In addition to in- person recruitment, interested participants will 
have the opportunity to complete the Intake Form using our study website, which will be readily 
accessible via a QR code found on the S tudy Flyer.

3.2 Intervention/Treatment procedures  
Study Day 1:  Consented p articipants come to STM Church. During Study Day [ADDRESS_986260] Video CRC Knowledge Survey in Spanish.  Both surveys will be administered on paper 
form.  
3.3 Follow - up procedures   
Study Day 2:  The participants return to  STM Church 30 +/ - 7 days after their participation in Study Day 
1. During Study Day 2 , they will complete the 30 Day Follow Up CRC Knowledge Survey  on paper form . 
Study Day 3:  A random subset of participants  from  Study Days [ADDRESS_986261] Completion/ Withdrawal procedures  
At the completion of Study Day 2 , participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_986262] and a study T -shirt from 
either our research assistant or one of the volunteers , all of whom will be Tango trained and enlisted 
on the study’s IRB. Participants interested in  participating  in qualitative one -on-one interviews aimed 
at identifying barriers preventing Latinos from participating in CCTs will be invited to participate in 
Study Day 3 . Following completion of Study Day 3 , these participants will receive  an additional $[ADDRESS_986263]  for their participation in the qualitative one -on-one interviews.  Participants choosing to withdraw 
from the study may do so at any point by [CONTACT_260565] [INVESTIGATOR_137095].  
3.5 Screen failure procedures  
At the beginning of each educational session, eligibility requirements (age ≥ 18 years of age; 
identifying as Hispanic/Latino and being Spanish speaker) will be confirmed  for each registered 
individual. In the unlikely event that an ineligible individual had been registered, this will be no ted and 
the involved parties reminded  of the eligibility requirements  and their inability to participate in the 
study .   
 
[ADDRESS_986264] of  the CRC educational video s in Spanish on participant’s knowledge o f CRC 
symptoms, risk factors, screening , and facts , this study will utilize questions obtained from 3 sub scales  
from 2 questionnaires previously validated in English .  
Page 14 of 23 
 1. Participants’ knowledge on CRC symptoms will be assessed using the “Knowledge of Warning 
Signs” questions from the “Bowel Cancer Awareness Measure” . Potential answers to these 
questions include “Yes”, “No” and “Don’t Know”. The overall score will range from 0 to 9 and it is anticipated that average scores will increase after the intervention. Higher scores imply greater knowledge of symptoms.  
2. Participant’s knowledge on CRC risk factors will be assessed using the “Knowledge of Risk Factors” questions from the “Bowel Cancer Awareness Measure”. This scale is measured using a Likert 1 -5 scale with “1” corresponding to “Strongly Disagree” and “5” co rresponding to 
“Strongly Agree”. The overall score will range from 11 to 55 and it is anticipated that the average scores will increase after the intervention. Higher scores imply greater knowledge of risk factors.  
3. Participant’s knowledge on CRC screening and general facts will be assessed using nine questions from the “Colorectal Cancer Screening Decision Quality Instrument (CRC -DQI)”. The 
overall score will range from 0 to 9 and it is anticipated that average scores will increase after the intervention. Higher scores imply greater knowledge of general facts . 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
4.2 Primary Endpoint  
Identify novel Latino -perceived barriers to participation in CCTs.  
4.3 Secondary Endpoints 
The Secondary Endpoints  of our study are to  assess the  association of :  
1. Educational videos on  knowledge of CRC symptoms.  
2. Educational videos on  knowledge of CRC risk factors.  
3. Educational videos on  knowledge on CRC screening and facts.  
4. Watching the video s and willingness to participate in CCTs.  
4.4 Methods  
Primary Endpoint : Twenty enrolled participants will participate in qualitative, semi- structured, one -on-
one interviews that will be performed in Spanish. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed. 
ATLAS.ti software will be used for the transcript analysis. The top 2 c onceptual themes within each 
section of the interview  (attitudes regarding general clinical trials, attitudes regarding CCTs, and 
perception of the Hispanic/Latino community ) and the top 3 higher -level, holistic themes across the 
sections will be reported in terms of percentage of participants.  
Page 15 of 23 
 Secondary Endpoint 1:  Use of repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate follow -up contrasts  to 
compare total number of correct responses within three time points (baseline vs post -video; baseline 
vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up; post -video  vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up) accounting for multiple  observations 
within participants . Knowledge pertaining to CRC symptoms will be assessed using the “Knowledge of 
Warning Signs” questions from the “Bowel Cancer Awareness Measure”. Potential answers include 
“Yes”, “No” and “Don’t Know”. T he overall score will range from 0 to 9 and it is anticipated that 
average scores will increase after the intervention. Higher scores imply a greater knowledge of 
symptoms.  
Secondary Endpoint  2: Use of repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate follow -up contrasts to 
compare total number of correct responses within three time points (baseline vs post -video; baseline 
vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up; post -video vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up) accounting for multiple observations 
within participants . Knowledge pertaining to CRC risk factors will be assessed using the “Knowledge of 
Risk Factors” questions from the “Bowel Cancer Awareness Measure”. This scale is measured using a Likert 1 -5 scale with “1” correspon ding to “Strongly Disagree” and “5” corresponding to “Strongly 
Agree”. The overall score will range from 11 to 55 and it is anticipated that the average scores will increase after the intervention. Higher scores imply higher knowledge of risk factors.  
Secondary Endpoint  3: Use of repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate follow -up contrasts to 
compare total number of correct responses within three time points (baseline vs post -video; baseline 
vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up; post -video vs 30 +/ - 7 days follow -up) accounting for multiple observations 
within participants . Knowledge of CRC screening and general facts will be assessed using nine 
questions from the “Colorectal Cancer Decision Quality Instrument (CRC -DQI)”. The overall score will 
range from 0 to 9 a nd it is anticipated that average scores will increase after the intervention. Higher 
scores imply greater knowledge of screening and facts . 
Secondary Endpoint  4: Since questionnaires will be completed pre and post video, we will explore, in a 
preliminary fashion, the association between watching the video (X) and willingness to participate in 
CCTs (Y) using repeated -measures/mixed -effects logistic regression on the paired responses of 
participants. The mediating effect of Study Day [ADDRESS_986265] -video  health knowledge levels (M) on the 
relationship between X and Y (established in the preliminary  step  above ) will be explored. Using a 
structural equation modeling approach,  two mixed -effects generalized linear models  will be carried 
out: one model use s both X and M  to predict Y , while another uses only X to predict M. The two 
Page [ADDRESS_986266] (from X to Y, through M) will be tested using the 
bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_413901] 1,[ADDRESS_986267] size. Lastly, in order to explore an adjusted approach, the same steps used for the mediation model will be replicated, w hile incorporating demographic variables as covariates.  
4.5 Sample Size and Power  
A traditional “power analysis” is not directly applicable to the primary endpoint of the study which is qualitative in nature. Based on published methodologies to assess the adequate sample to reach “saturation” ,
52–54 we chose to invite 20 participants for qualitative interviews . 
For our quantitative, secondary endpoints, a traditional “power analysis” was performed. A total of [ADDRESS_986268] the null hypothesis  will be over 80%. If the differences  in our study 
popul ation  are more extreme, our sample size will have even more power to reject the null hypothesis.  
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTION (DEVICE, DRUG, OR OTHER INTERVENTION)  
The study  intervention consists of three  CRC educational video s in Spanish. The aim is to assess the 
potential impact of the intervention on participants’ CRC knowledge and willingness to participate in 
CCTs . 
 
[ADDRESS_986269] access to . (e.g. secure drive on the UNC network, UNC 
SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams , REDCap ). Intake information obtained on paper form will be initially 
stored in the file tote, transcribed into REDCap, and subsequently stored in a secure file cabinet in the 
Page 17 of 23 
 PI’s academic office.  In addition, every participant will be assigned a unique deidentified study number 
that will be used during Study Days 1  and 2 (completion of questionnaires) as well as during Study Day 
3 (performance of qualitative one -on-one interview).  In addition, there  is minimal risk of emotional 
distress from answering questions related to CRC. Participants will be informed that they do not have to answer any questions that make them feel uncomfortable and may stop completing  the 
questionnaires  at any point.  
7.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
In case of a breach of confidentiality, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_722118]. No 
serious adverse events are anticipated. However, any unanticipated problems will be reported to our IRB in a timely fashion.  
7.2. Entity Responsible for Monitoring  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_722119].  
7.3. Data Monitoring  
 Monitoring of data quality entry will be performed by [CONTACT_722128] 5 registrants and then after every 10.  In order to assure accuracy in 
transcription of information from paper form to REDCap, a member of the study team other than the individual initially entering the data into REDCap, will confirm the accuracy of the entered data into REDCap by [CONTACT_722129] 5 registrants. On subsequent data monitoring effor ts (every 10 subsequent registrations), data entered into REDCap on [ADDRESS_986270]- video survey responses for each participant 
will be uploaded to REDCap. Paper surveys will be stored in a secure file cabinet in the PI’s academic 
office. Similar procedures will be followed for the paper surveys collected during Study Day 2 . 
On Study Day 3  (one -on-one qualitative interview), the audio of the interview will be recorded using a 
recording device and transcribed by [CONTACT_503259]. ATLAS.ti software will be used for the analysis  of the 20 deidentified transcripts.  The deidentified transcripts will be stored in a secure file cabinet in 
the PI’s academic office.  
 
9.        RECRUITMENT STRATEGY  
Participants will be recruited in -person on the premises of STM  Church. Members of the study team  
along with  CHW  from El Centro Hispano and  UNC -Chapel Hill students that are members of the 
Carolina Latinx C enter  or Comprehensive Advanced Medical Program of Spanish (CAMPOS)  will be 
present at STM every Saturday and Sunday for [ADDRESS_986271] the opportunity to enroll via  our 
study website, which will be readily accessible via a QR code found on the Study Flyer . While on the 
study website, participants  will be prompt ed to fill out the Intake Form, which captures demographics , 
preferred mode of communication (phone/text or email),  contact [CONTACT_3031], and assesses eligibility .

11.     PLANS FOR PUBLICATION   
Our study is designed to capture novel data in multiple  fields  of research including the identification of 
barriers preventing Latinos from participating in CCTs as well as the mediating effect that an increase in CRC knowledge may have on the willingness to participate in CCTs . We envision publishing multiple 
impactful papers.

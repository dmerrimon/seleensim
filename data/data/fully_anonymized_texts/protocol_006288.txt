3. Background  
 
Food allergy (FA) presents a major societal health burden because it impacts over 
5 million (8%) children  in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and grows more common every year 1-3. 
FA causes food anaphylaxis, a deadly, systemic allergic reaction causing  over 200,000 
US emergency room visits per year 4-6. FA also causes childhood nutritional and growth 
deficiencies 7-10, severe anxiety for patients and caregivers 11-13, and high healthcare and 
family costs due to the need for epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injectors, healthcare visits, and food 
avoidance 14-18. An accurate diagnosis is therefore crucial to avoiding a “disaster of 
misdiagnosis” where the consequences of perceived FA are realized due to false positive 
testing in the absence of true disease 7,19.  
FA diagnosis relies on clinical history. FA testing such as food -specific skin and 
blood immunoglobulin E (IgE) assays has high false positive rates up to 30- 50% and fail 
to predict FA reaction severity 20-22. The oral food challenge (OFC), where a patient ingests 
a potential food allergen and real -life results are observed in the allergy office, is the 
diagnostic criterion standard but carries a substantial risk of anaphylaxis 22,23. During an 
OFC, the patient ingests a food allergen in a graduated fashion up to a total dose until a full serving is eaten without incident or until an allergic reaction, typi[INVESTIGATOR_605693], occurs; to be clear, anaphylaxis currently relies purely on a clinical diagnosis through 
physician observation as there is no monitoring device for anaphylaxis.
24 Allergists face 
barriers to performing OFCs, and families may decline OFCs due to anaphylaxis anxiety 
25-31. Thus, FA over -diagnosis via testing without confirmatory OFCs leads to FA anxiety, 
increased costs, and growth/nutrition deficits from food avoidance 7,14- 19,32. Performing 
OFCs give s clear benefits, including improved quality  of life, an expanded and more 
nutritious  diet, and/or clarifying a diagnosis 24,29,33,34. However, the perceived risks and 
benefits of OFCs may still tilt toward OFC avoidance for many physicians and patient families; therefore, a novel method of improving OFC safety and tolerability is sorely 
needed.   
Young children have increasing rates of FA 
19,35- 37; clinical trials and related 
international guidelines support OFC administration even under age 1 38,39. In young 
children, the lack of expressive language delay s anaphylaxis symptom detection, thereby 
[CONTACT_605734] 24,40- 42.  
No objective monitoring device for OFC -induced anaphylaxis exists. Early 
treatment of anaphylaxis reduces the severity of food reactions and minimizes adverse 
outcomes 43-45, providing rationale for developi[INVESTIGATOR_605694]. 
Therefore, a method of safely diagnosing clinical food allergy in this young age group is 
critical. 
PrePARE Trial v 2.2, 30 November 2022 
 10 We propose to use the transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044] (TEWL) as a safe and specific 
method to monitor outcomes in OFCs  in young children aged [ADDRESS_802159] probes to give real 
time results 
48,54 (Figure 1). TEWL is well-
reported as a measurement among infants and 
young children.55-[ADDRESS_802160] the 
long- term development of FA 55-57.  
TEWL in real -time anaphylaxis:  
TEWL has not yet been 
implemented in the real -time, 
continuous monitoring of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. 
Anaphylaxis induces rapid blood 
vessel dilation, causing cutaneous heat and water loss.
58-62 We 
evaluated histamine- induced skin 
hives via TEWL, the positive control for skin testing.63,64 When a hive is induced on skin 
via histamine, a red flare arises followed by a wheal, a pale raised area. TEWL rises over both the flare (< 1- 2 minutes) and wheal (< 10 minutes) of a hive ( Figure 2A). Most 
patients present with cutaneous manifestations of anaphylaxis,
65-67 lending support to 
evaluating continuous TEWL measurement during anaphylaxis. Furthermore, TEWL likely does rise with anaphylaxis; during a peanut -induced anaphylaxis epi[INVESTIGATOR_605695], TEWL rose significantly from a baseline of 7.75 g/m
2/h to 12.2 g/m2/h (Figure 2B), even on skin without visible hives. There was a trend 
toward a decrease after epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. This increased TEWL does not occur in non -
reactors.  Since this initial observation, we have developed this technique and begun 
testing continuous TEWL monitoring as an anaphylaxis predictor. We have found that 
TEWL rises substantially in the 20 minutes after food dose 1 among anaphylaxis reactions. 
These data are shortly to be published.  
In summary, we propose that deploying TEWL during OFCs with young children 
will facilitate detection of anaphylaxis prior to dangerous symptom development. We

ichthyoses, hyper -IgE syndromes.  
 
 
b. Recruitment Plan and Study Design 
i. Number of Subjects  
N=[ADDRESS_802165]  
We will scree n and recruit individuals  that meet the above enrollment 
criteria from our food allergy clinic visits for peanut food allergy . Individuals ’ 
parents/guardians  will be contact[CONTACT_605737] a member of the study team in 
clinic , over the phone , and/or email. A posting on UMHealthResearch.org will 
also be created.    
 
iii. Method of Consent  
Individuals’ parents/guardians will be contact[CONTACT_605738]. Individuals’ 
parents/guardians approached for the study will be provided the consent 
document for review and offered background on the study. This process may 
take place in person during a clinical visit , over the phone, or via video (such as 
Zoom)  by a member of the study team.   Eligible individuals’ parents/guardians 
will be provided the informed consent document and a thorough review of the 
document will take place.  Participant  parent/guardians  will have as much time as 
needed to ask questions and decide if they  would like to participate in the 
study.   In most cases, consent will be provided to the participant  electronically 
and they will be asked to sign using the University of Michigan’s FDA 21 CFR 
Part 11 compliant e -signature [CONTACT_503946] (“SignNow”).   This service automatically 
provides a copy of the fully signed document to all parties and a copy will be 
placed in the participant’s medical record.   There may be circumstances where 
a participant is able to complete the consent process in person during a clinical 
visit; sufficient time for review and questions will be provided for in person 
consenting as well.   Rarely, consents may send via postal mail for ink 
signatures.   In any  case no study procedures will take place until the consent 
has been signed by [CONTACT_605739] a copy of the fully signed document is 
provided to the participant. The method, location, and individuals involved in the 
consent process will be documented in the study records.

Pre-OFC  Visit/Interaction  
1. Collect demographics from the participant and/or electronic 
medical record. 
2. Review medical history and prior peanut food allergy testing  
with participant and within the electronic medical record by a 
study physician . 
3. Assessment of concomitant medications . 
4. Obtain written informed consent . 
5. Participant will then be scheduled for an OFC visit  
 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
We have allowed for multiple methods of contact [CONTACT_605740] v 2.2, 30 November 2022 
 13 socioeconomic status can be included. In addition, we will compensate 
participants $100 total to participate in this study for time, travel, and 
parking. $50 will be provided based on arrival to the study site (to 
compensate for screening time, travel and parking) and the other $50 will 
be provided based on finishing the challenge protocol (to compensate for 
time spent during the challenge).   
Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_605700]  a convenience sample. Our food allergy patients are evenly split 
by [CONTACT_4321], and our population represents Washtenaw County and southeast Michigan ethnically  and racially. We expect a reasonably diverse sample 
for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], though the lower enrollment number (n=40 total) means 
there is a possibility of randomly asymmetric enrollment across groups. 
Ultimately, ensuring a diverse sample will be even more feasible once we 
move to broader ages and (hopefully) multi -site studies after this pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] .  
 Research OFC procedure.   
OFCs will be conducted by a food allergy OFC -trained nurse; 
Bridgette Kaul, RN, is a member of our food allergy research team and has conducted numerous clinical OFCs. OFCs will be conducted exactly 
according to the clinical OFC parameters (see appendix)  and final allergy 
diagnosis will be made per standard of care . Briefly, individuals will come 
to the clinical research area. They will have vital signs  (height, weight, 
temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and SpO2 on 
room air)  and a r eview of any additional symptoms or new medications 
since screening. The TEWL monitor will be applied to the volar forearm and monitoring initiated. Food doses will be given in a graduated fashion up to a defined single serving for the food in question and the age/size of the 
participant (see appendix table for food dosing). The OFC will proceed until 
a full dose is consumed without symptoms or a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151586] 
(below). Most OFCs require 2- 4 hours. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , 1-2 hours is required for 
intake and food ingestion, followed by 1- 2 hours of monitoring and/or 
treating reactions that arise.  
This will be an open OFC, meaning participants will know they are 
eating a likely reactive food. To be clear, an alternative approach is to perform double- blinded, placebo- controlled (DBPC) OFCs; this means the 
participant does two OFCs in which they receive placebo and the food in 
question in two separate challenges (usually a day to a week apart) and 
are blinded to which is done on each day. Blinding food compounds are 
used to obscure the food, such as applesauce  or mint chocolate. While the 
DBPC OFC is considered the most definitive OFC method, the open OFC is considered an appropriate criterion standard and is in fact the method 
used clinically across the US 
69,70. Thus, given the markedly increased 
costs of DBPC OFCs and the lack of their use in FA clinics, we will to use 
the open OFC in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
Blinding procedures.  
Participants and families, the food allergy nurse administering the 
OFC, and the allergist physician assessing and treating the patient will be blinded to the study arm status (i.e., TEWL stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605701] v 2.2, 30 November 2022 
 14 or control group). The study coordinator monitoring TEWL during the OFC 
will need to know the intervention arm vs control arm status to declare the 
OFC ceased when stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605702]; this person will have no say 
in assessment or treatment of react ions. The study coordinator monitoring 
TEWL will be in the same room as the participant but will be behind a screen so that the screen displaying the TEWL results and the study coordinator’s face will not be immediately visible to the other team 
members. All subjects will have TEWL monitored throughout to control for 
confounding factors associated with having a monitoring device on the skin. At the end of the OFC, after the determination of OFC outcomes, the 
participants and families will be made aware of the overall OFC determination of allergy status.  
Regardless of group assignment (TEWL stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605703]), we expect 
that participants will be able to use the results of the OFC to reliably define 
true clinical food allergy status. Diagnosis will rely on standard of care in 
both cases.  
 Randomization.   
Participants will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_802166] to randomization software that will produce the randomization, which will be performed at visit 1 (initial screening visit) or 
no later than the day of the research food challenge. The TEWL study 
coordinator will learn the group designation for each participant at the start 
of that participant’s challenge by [CONTACT_19915].   
 
TEWL measurement methods.   
All subjects will undergo continuous TEWL measurement 
48,54. We 
will use a Tewameter VT310 device (Khazaka, [LOCATION_013]); these probes 
and supporting software were  supplied at no cost and with no obligation 
except mention of material support in publications by [CONTACT_3455]. Measurements are taken using a small adhesive to attach the probe to the 
skin. Measurements are taken on the volar forearm. Data are collect ed in 
MPA CT Plus software (Khazaka, [LOCATION_013]) which provides note- taking 
functions and exports data into Microsoft Excel (Seattle, WA) for analysis.  
 
Adjudication of OFC results.   
A FA physician will adjudicate reactions and diagnose anaphylaxis 
identically to usual care in the FA clinic. The Brighton anaphylaxis likelihood 
scale will be used to assess anaphylaxis likelihood. The decision tree is 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_605704]  (next page , Figure 3) . The CoFAR anaphylaxis severity scale 
will be used for anaphylaxis severity
71 and is below in the adverse event 
grading section of the protocol . The Brighton score gives a 0- 3 score of 
anaphylaxis likelihood (0 = no anaphylaxis, 3 = highly likely). The CoFAR 
severity scare gives a grade of 1- 5 of anaphylaxis severity (where 1 = mild, 
5 = death).  
 Any symptom typi[INVESTIGATOR_605705] (see Brighton and CoFAR 
scales) will count as a reaction, consistent with standard of care diagnosis 
for peanut allergy. Note that this is distinct from anaphylaxis.

anaphylaxis criteria 71, then weight -based anaphylaxis epi[INVESTIGATOR_605707], with a follow- up dose 5 minutes later if symptoms do not 
resolve. Albuterol via nebulizer or inhaler/mask (depending on age) and 
liquid diphenhydramine and cetirizine (both are antihistamines and use 
weight -based dosing) will be available and used after epi[INVESTIGATOR_605708]. All doses will be calculated prior to the challenge. If a participant has a reaction not meeting anaphylaxis criteria (i.e., they only have hives but no  additional symptoms), the physician may choose to stop 
the OFC and give an antihistamine. If the TEWL- based stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605709], the OFC will be stopped (no more food doses given); if the 
participant meets anaphylaxis criteria at that time, epi[INVESTIGATOR_605710], otherwise an antihistamine dose will be given per standard of care .  
 
 
Outcome measures.  The outcome measures collected for each group in 
Table [ADDRESS_802169] lower anaphylaxis rates 
and/or severity via earlier OFC stoppage and earlier time to or more frequent treatment with non- epi[INVESTIGATOR_605711] (such as 
antihistamines). We suspect the overall reaction rate will remain the same, but that these reactions will not devolve into anaphylaxis in the intervention 
group due to the above factors. Anaphylaxis will be defined according to 
current practice parameters 
72, which is broadly considered to be at least 
two symptoms consistent with allergic reactions (cutaneous, 
gastrointestinal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], elevated heart rate, among others) or a 
decrease in blood pressure.  
 Post-OFC

OFC  will receive a follow- up phone call 1 day after the OFC  to 
follow up on any additional symptoms or concerns.    Table 2: Outcome measures  Definition

Risks & Benefits  
a. What are the risks and what will be done to monitor the risks?  
b. What is the likelihood of each risk (common, likely, infrequent, or rare)?  
 
Potential Risks  
• Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., 
rash, flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema), diarrhea, vomiting do occur 
during positive OFCs . Given the goal of this study is to enroll participants who 
are likely to have a reaction, this is deemed LIKELY  
• If a participant experiences a systemic allergic reaction, the site will provide the 
participant with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injector 2- pack  if they do not have one. In 
addition, participants  who experience a systemic allergic reaction will receive 
a Food Allergy Action Plan at the OFC  visit if one does not exist. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_605714], including training on how to 
use the epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- inject or, with the participant prior to discharge. If a 
participant has an allergic reaction, he/she may need oral, IM, or IV medications. The investigators for this trial are allergists, trained to recognize, 
PrePARE Trial v 2.2, 30 November 2022 
 19 and familiar with the treatment of anaphylaxis, and will be available within 60 
seconds in the event of a reaction. Emergency medications, oxygen, and 
equipment will be available to treat any allergic reactions.  POSSIBLE  
• Treatment of individual acute allergic reactions during the conduct of the study 
should be with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], IV fluids, β -adrenergic agonists (e.g., albuterol), 
oxygen, antihistamines, and steroids, as indicated for the severity of the 
reaction according to the standard of care .  POSSIBLE 
o Risks of these common medications are summarized below:  
 Antihistamines: drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, stomach upset, blurred vision, or dry mouth/nose/throat 
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]: tachycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], nervousness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, trouble breathing, headache, 
dizziness, anxiety, tremors, or pale skin  
 β-adrenergic agonists: nervousness, shaking (tremor), 
headache, or dizziness  
 Steroids: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, heartburn, 
trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], increased sweating, or acne  
• Risks associated with TEWL measurement could conceivably include skin 
irritation. RARE  
• Participation in this study could cause distress due to the experience of anaphylaxis. LIKELY.  
• Participation in this study poses a risk for breach of confidentiality.  RARE  
• Taking part in more than one research study may be harmful to the subject.  If subjects are already taking part in another study, we ask that they let us know. 
Subjects should not take part in more than one study at the same time, unless 
the subject and the investigators agree that the subject is not likely to be harmed, and the outcome of the study will not be disturbed.  RARE  
• As with any research study, though, there may be additional risks of participating that are unforeseeable or hard to predict. RARE  
 What will be done to reduce or monitor these risks? 
• Any information sharing would only be done in the context of a new IRB review 
and in concert with UM’s Data Management Office. To minimize the breach of 
confidentiality risk, information shared outside of the University of Michigan will 
not use the subject’s name [CONTACT_82888][INVESTIGATOR_7965], but rather a unique study number , and would only occur under a data use agreement supported by [CONTACT_605741] . Any publications that result from this work will only report de-
identified data.  
• The site investigators for this trial are allergists. They are  trained to recognize 
symptoms and are expert in the treatment of anaphylaxis. They  will be 
available within 60 seconds in the event of a reaction. Emergency medications, 
oxygen, and equipment will be available to treat any allergic reactions.   
• The clinical team will provide prescriptions for epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injectors for 
participants that experience systemic allergic reactions who do not have them . 
In addition, participants will receive Food Allergy Action Plan at the OFC  visit if 
they do not have one already. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_605715], including training on how to use the epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injector, with 
the participant prior to discharge.  
 
PrePARE Trial v 2.2, 30 November 2022 
 20 c. What are the benefits?   
iii. To the individual  
Individuals and their families who undergo OFCs experience greater 
peace of mind and improved quality of life, even when the OFC leads 
to a reaction, due to improved certainty and a clarified diagnosis. 
Individuals and their families  who pass the OFC (estimated to be 20% 
of both groups) will learn that they do not have a clinical food allergy, 
which has profound psychological, nutritional, cost, and overall health 
benefits, allowing the family to incorporate that food back into the diet. 
Overall, we expect that individuals  and their families  who 
participate will have an accurate determination of food allergy 
status for the food challenged  (peanut) , which can be used 
clinically to define allergy, or the lack of allergy, for that food, per the standard of care. 
 
In addition, our co- investigator Kelly O’Shea, MD, who will conduct 
many of these research challenges, is the peanut oral immunotherapy clinic expert here at U -M. She can provide a brief  discussion of the risks 
and benefits of OIT (which is the only FDA -approved peanut allergy 
preventative therapy available) for individuals who do have a peanut 
reaction during this clinical trial. If that therapy option is of interest, they 
can be streamlined into the OIT clinical practice based on the results of 
this OFC. 
iv. To society   
This data is valuable for evaluating a novel detection/prediction method 
for anaphylaxis . We expect results from this project to show that TEWL 
can detect evolving anaphylaxis  and that  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605716]. This would reduce the risk and potentially the cost of an OFC, 
thereby [CONTACT_605742], the OFC. Furthermore, TEWL measurement may ultimately 
have a role in anaphylaxis measurement in additional contexts such as 
the ambulance, emergency room, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This is an unmet need, as anaphylaxis frequently goes unrecognized, leading to absent or 
delayed lifesaving epi[INVESTIGATOR_130630], even in the emergency 
room . 
 Data & Safety Monitoring  
a. Will there be a board your study will report adverse events and other problems 
to? 
 Yes, the study will have a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The 
DSMB has a charter, which defines the membership, responsibilities, meeting schedule, and meeting substance/materials in detail. This charter is attached.  
 
Briefly, the DSMB will meet at study initiation, every [ADDRESS_802171] an interim meeting to 
PrePARE Trial v 2.2, 30 November 2022 
 21 discuss the event.  We anticipate 4- 5 scheduled DSMB meetings during the 
12–24-month  study period.  
 
b. Adverse Events  
Adverse Events (AEs): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention related. AEs include expected and unexpected harmful effects, and 
unexpected risks of an interaction or an intervention.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator:  
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE is considered “life- threatening” if, in the 
view of the investigator, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. For the purposes of this study, which 
is expected to include anaphylaxis during the majority of these food challenges, if the anaphylaxis event is treated during the study visit and does not require escalation to Emergency Room care, this would 
NOT be considered an SAE.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.  
 
The investigator must report adverse events regardless of relationship to study 
therapy regimen or study mandated procedures.  
 
 
i. Method of Identifying, Recording, Monitoring and Reporting Adverse 
Events  
 Identifying:  
For this study, an adverse event will include the following associated 
with the oral food challenge: 
All AEs occurring within 1 day of the OFC visit.  
 
Collecting Adverse Events : Adverse events may be discovered through 
any of these methods:  
Observing the participant  
Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant /family. 
Participants/families will have study contact [CONTACT_605743] a monitored phone number to report AEs. We will also provide advice 
on whether urgent medical attention is required, even though this 
would be expected to be a rare event.  
Follow up phone call above.

Grading of Adverse Events Other than Systemic Allergic Reactions : 
The study sites will grade the severity of non -allergic adverse events 
experienced by [CONTACT_605744] (September 2007); hereafter, referred to as the FDA 
Toxicity Grading Scale. Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 
1 to 5 according to the following standards in the FDA Toxicity Grading 
Scale : 
Grade 1 = Mild  
Grade 2 = Moderate  
Grade 3 = Severe  
Grade 4 = Life -threatening  
Grade 5 = Death  
 
Grading of Systemic Allergic Reactions:  
 
The investigator will grade severity of systemic allergic reactions on a 
scale of 1 to 5 according to criteria set forth in the CoFAR Grading 
Scale.  
 
CoFAR Grading Scale for Systemic Allergic Reactions Version 3.0: 
 
Grade 1 : Reaction involving one of the following organ systems in which 
the symptoms are mild:

OR  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_605720]  
• Cardiovascular : Reduced BP with associated symptoms of end -
organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope) defined as: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from 
baseline 
 
Grade 5: Death

nebulizer or epi[INVESTIGATOR_605721]. Please see attached supporting documents in Section 44.   
 
Recording/ Monitoring: 
Throughout the study, the investigator will record adverse events and serious adverse events  on the appropriate AE/SAE electronic Case 
Report Form  (eCRF) regardless of the relationship to the OFC  or study 
procedure. Once recorded, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or the AE/SAE stabilizes, or until 1 days after 
the participant’s OFC , whichever occurs first.

Reporting:  
We will report any adverse events and other reportable incidences and 
occurrences (ORIO) to the IRB.  Any adverse event or ORIO will be documented of that event including a description, subject number, date, 
outcome, and follow- up. Reporting of adverse events and ORIOs will 
follow IRBMED’s reporting timetable and will occur at least yearly.    
 
Statistical Design   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The anaphylaxis prediction threshold used in the study [ADDRESS_802172] medication use, and time to epi[INVESTIGATOR_107563]. 
To avoid overfitting, these analyses will use a 2:1 derivation: validation random 
split. Corrections will inc lude baseline TEWL value and variance. A minimum 
sustained timespan meeting the threshold (such as 30- 60 seconds) may be 
needed to minimize the effects of noise in the measurement. 
 
Endpoints. The primary endpoint will be anaphylaxis rate among the intervention 
group versus the control group  and will be reported with a 95% confidence interval. 
Secondary endpoints will include anaphylaxis severity and overall reaction rates. Exploratory endpoints may include but are not limited to time to first treatment, time 
to first symptom, epi[INVESTIGATOR_107563], any medication use, and time to meeting a 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] (regardless of whether it was implemented); all will be reported with 95% confidence int ervals. Exact p -values will be calculated using Fischer’s test.   
 Descriptive analyses. Descriptive analyses will be reported. Continuous baseline 
measures will be reported using either mean (or geometric mean) with 95% 
confidence interval or median with first and third quartiles, as appropriate. Categorical baseline and demographic characteristics and study disposition will be 
reported as frequencies and proportions.    
 Population size. To achieve 80% power with two- sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_802173] a 
minimum 50% absolute difference in anaphylaxis rate reducing in anaphylaxis between the intervention group (anticipated anaphylaxis rate 30%) and the control 
group (80%) using a Fischer’s exact test and at a ratio of 1:1 for both groups, 38 total subjects (19 per group) would be needed for this phase. To account for 5% 
drop- out, we will enroll 40 total subjects (20 per group). This is achievable with the 
enrollment -eligible population available to us.  The Food Allergy clinics at the 
University of Michigan see approximately 500- 1000 peanut allergy patients 
annually age 5 and under at the Domino Farms clinic site alone. Over 18 -24 
months and with a 2.5- 5% rate of enrollment, enrollment of [ADDRESS_802174] of Parent -

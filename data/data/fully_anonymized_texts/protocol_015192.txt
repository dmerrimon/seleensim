2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted ?
Botulinum toxins act selectively at the neuromuscular or neuroglandular junction to reversibly block 
presynaptic acetylcholine release. OnabotulinumtoxinA is the active drug substance in BOTOX/BOTOX 
Cosmetic and in OnabotA X. BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) was first approved for aesthetic treatment 
in the [LOCATION_002] for glabellar lines ( GL)in 2002 and forforehead lines (FHL) in [ADDRESS_847188] clinicians agree 
that concurrent treatment of the glabellar area is recommended to reduce the risk of undesirable 
aesthetic outcomes (e .g., eyebrow malposition and ey ebrow or eyelid ptosis) .7,8As a result, the 
treatment regimen proposed for this FHL study is the treatment of the frontalis muscle in conjunction 
with the glabellar complex.
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
OnabotulinumtoxinA is the active drug substance in BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmetic a nd in OnabotA X; 
therefore, safety data from prior studies of BOTOX are relevant to the benefit/risk assessment for 
Study M21- 606.

STUDY M21 -606  |  Version 2.0  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The clinical safety and efficacy profile of BOTOX has also been demonstrated in multiple Allergan and 
non-Allergan sponsored clinical trials across several indications, with favorable benefit/risk profiles.  In 
general, adverse reactions occur within the first few days following injection of BOTOX, and while 
generally transient, may have a duration of several months or, in rare cases, longer. Below is a brief 
summary of safety for BOTOX utilized in the treatment of FHL, multiple facial areas (including FHL, GL, 
and lateral canthal lines [LCL] ),and GL. More detailed information about the known and expected 
benefits an d risks and reasonably expected adverse events ( AEs)of OnabotA X may be found in the 
Investigator's Brochure (IB)and the subject's informed consent form (ICF).
Safety data for BOTOX treatment of FHL come from 3 double -blind, placebo -controlled trials conducted 
in North America and Europe (  
). A total of [ADDRESS_847189] 1 BOTOX treatment
), the majority 
of whom received either 40 U (N = 749) or 64 U (N = 746), the doses approved for treatment of FHL and 
of FHL and LCL, respectively.
The most frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs )were commonly occurring 
conditions in the general population (e .g., headache [11.1% of all BOTOX -treated subjects, ] 
and nasopharyngitis [7.9%, ]) or events commonly occurring following injections to 
vascularized areas (e .g., injection site bruising [6.9%, ]). Most of these events were mild or 
moderate in severity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For further details, please see findings fro m completed studies, including safety data in the current 
OnabotA X Investigator's Brochure.
Considering the coronavirus disease –2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, and based on the information to 
date, no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of OnabotA X.  While [COMPANY_013] 
does not consider COVID -19 to be a safety concern for Onabo tA X due to its mechanism of action and 
route of administration, the Marketing Authorization Holder is monitoring COVID -19 events during the 
pandemic closely. Arecent review of COVID -19 events for the period of 01 January 2019 through 
31December 2021 did not identify any new or significant safety findings for the patients receiving 
BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) treatment. Overall, the clinical course and presentation of patients with

OnabotulinumtoxinA is approved as a safe and effective treatment for GL and FHL at doses of  each 
and FHL treated simultaneously with GL ( ). However, facial lines and wrinkles are strongly 
influenced by [CONTACT_634618], with some individuals requiring a higher dose to meet desired results .
21Intheliterature, higher cosmetic neurotoxin doses were reported 
to show greater efficacy and longer duration of effect in treating facial aesthetic indications including FHL.

Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events:  Onab otA X
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such a n event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misus e, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormali ties and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
 
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedu re is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), th en the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmac ovigilance or Clinical Research Organization (as appropriate) as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to 
Section 4.2 of the Operations Manual [Appendix FAppendix E] for reporting details and contact 
[CONTACT_3031]):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interfer es with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the sub ject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incap acity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event along with any suspected transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product if no other serious criterion 
is applicable.  Examples o f such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration will be collected for at least [ADDRESS_847205] signs the study -specific informed consent.
 
 
 
 
 
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
requirements.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  Safety evaluations include AEs , 
abbreviated physical examination, neurological assessment ,and change from baseline in vital signs
(body temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and bloo d pressure [systolic and diastolic]).   Safety 
endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics and/or shift tables, as applicable.  For each 
safety endpoint evaluating change from baseline, the last nonmissing safety assessment before study 
interv ention administration will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that endpoint.
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as any AE with theonset that is after the first dose of study 
drug.   Events where the onset date is the same as the study drug start d ate are assumed to be 
treatment -emergent.
An overview of AEs will be presented consisting of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
at least one event for each of the following AE categories:
Any treatment -emergent AE
Any treatment -emergent AE related to study treatment according to the investigator
Any treatment -emergent AE related to study procedure according to the investigator
Any treatment -emergent AE related to study drug according to the investigator
Any severe treatment -emergent AE
Any serious treatment -emergent AE
Any treatment -emergent AE leading to death
Any PDSOT AEs
All deaths
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and PT; by [CONTACT_17191] (e.g., re asonable possibility or no reasonable 
possibility) and SOC and PT; by [CONTACT_17192]; and by [CONTACT_17193].  Specific treatment -emergent AEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating percentages, 
unless stated o therwise.  In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times within a subject, the highest 
severity and closest relationship to investigational product will be reported.
SAEs (including deaths) will be summarized by [CONTACT_17194].
PDSOT AEs will be identified in the SAP and summarized by [CONTACT_6214].  
Vital sign will be summarized for changes from baseline at each assessment timepoint.

Page 31 of 75 
STUDY M21 -606  |  Version 2.[ADDRESS_847207].  Further details are provided in DMC 
Charter. 
Key efficacy analyses will be perf ormed for the interim analysis, as well as summaries of key safety 
variables.
The SAP will describe the planned interim analyses in detail.  No separate SAP will be prepared for the 
interim analyses.
7.7 Overall Type I Error Control
Analyses will be conducted using a Type I error rate of α=0.05 for each OnabotA X group.  The p -values 
will be presented as unadjusted p -values that are deemed statistically significant if p≤ 0.05.
7.8 Sample Size Determination
Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (30 in each group) 
yielding approximately 90 subjects receiving OnabotA X in the frontalis muscle for treatment of FHL.
The sample size of 120 is chosen empi[INVESTIGATOR_634614] X for this indication.
The primary efficacy endpoint is the achievement of ≥ 1-grade improvement from baseline on the 
investigator -rated FWS- FHL at maximum contraction at Day 30.  
Assuming  
 the sample size of 
N =30 per group will provide 97% power.
All calculations are based on a 2 -sided t ype I error rate of 0.05.

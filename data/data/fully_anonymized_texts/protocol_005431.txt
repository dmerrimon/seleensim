Background , Rationale  and Context  
There is evidence that the current design and content provided by [CONTACT_641089]  (Denzen et al., 2012).   The need for revisions to the 
informed consent document design is supported by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_48718].  Joffe et al. found in their 2001 
study of 200 people in the [LOCATION_002] participating in cancer trials that 70% of those interviewed  did 
not realize that the treatments the y were undergoing had not yet been proven effective, and 63% did not 
understand that additional risks were posed by [CONTACT_173150].  In a manuscript published in 
2008, Bergenmar, Molin, Wilking, and Brandberg reported that over half of the [ADDRESS_858040] pi[INVESTIGATOR_207636] a novel consent form design that incorporates a modi fied version of the 
“chunking” theory of learning.  Clifton A. Casteel (1990) found that chunking sentences or phrases in  text 
into related groupi[INVESTIGATOR_641079] a positive significant improvement in reading comprehension among 
students with poor reading skills .  Because the information contained in consent documents in large 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_641080], detailed, and novel for potential research participants, the use of a 
modified form of chunking (groupi[INVESTIGATOR_641081]), may be an 
effective and low cost way of improving comprehension of the elements of consent.

Template updated 9.24.14  3 Objective s 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_641082]  (NEAT ) 
form when used in the consent process for individuals participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study .  Specifically, the primary objective  of the study is to:  
 
1. Determine if participants who receive the NEAT  form report greater comprehension (as measured 
by [CONTACT_641090] ) at the end of the consent process , than 
participants who receive a standard form . 
 
The secondary objectives are to:  
1. Determine what types of characteristics participants value in a consent form, via a qualitative 
analysis of responses to the question “ What do you like best, if anything about this consent form?  
and What do you like least, if anything about this consent form? ” 
2. Determine  what types of characteristics study team members find helpful or burde nsome when 
utilizing a consent form during the consent process.   
 
Participation in the NEAT study will involve randomization of study participants to either the traditional 
consent form (detailing the ARIC study ) or the NEAT  form and the materials that accompany it (also 
detailing the ARIC study ).  The consent process will be conducted in the usual manner using the 
document to which the participant was randomized ( NEAT  or Traditional).  Following the consent 
process, the interviewer will administer the Com prehension tool , a questionnaire which will  measure 
participants’  comprehension  (Part 1) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_641083] (Part 2).  A q ualitative 
analysis of  the open -ended question s  (Part 2) will provide subjective data on participant’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_641084], or other factors that they consider important.   The Comprehension tool  
score and the qualitative data about the consent form qualities make up the outcomes  to be measured .  
Ultimately, these data will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_641085].  
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
This study will be conducted  in conjunction with the consent process for the ARIC study in the Division 
of Public Health Sciences . The IRB approved consent forms will be presented to ARIC participants  by [CONTACT_641091].  The consent form will be either 
Protocol version:  3/2/17  
Template updated 9.24.14  4 the regular IRB approved version, or the same for m presented in components placed within a bi-fold 
folder.  The consent form wording will be unchanged  between the two versions . 
 
The NEAT  form consists of a clear and concise overview document containing information satisfying all 
elements of consent.  This is made up of IRB -approved wording from the regular consent form.  More 
detailed information, such as specific clinic measures  are provided as additional material and are 
discussed during the consent process after the general overview has been provided w ith the NEAT  form.  
The HIPAA Authorization is provided as a separate document.  
 
Approximately 200 participants will be  randomized (via birth month ) to receive either the regular  form or 
the NEAT form.  Following the consent process, each participant will be interviewed using the 
Comprehension tool  measure.  This design provides an opportunity to test a new consent form design in a 
real-world environment with all of the accompanying uncertainty that affects comprehension during the 
clinical research consent  process.  
   
If a participant scores poorly on the c omprehension tool,  elements of consent  will be revisited in order to 
ensure appropriate understanding of the study  information.  A copy of the Comprehension tool is included 
as an appendix to this protocol.  
 
Setting  
This study will take place at a place consistent with the plan approved by [CONTACT_641092]  .  
Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_641093].    
 
Subjects selection criteria  
 
• Inclusion Criteria  
Individuals  who are eligible for the ARIC study,  with which this pi[INVESTIGATOR_641086].   
 
• Exclusion Criteria  
Any individuals  not eligible for the ARIC study .   
 
• Sample Size  
Protocol version:  3/2/[ADDRESS_858041] of a novel consent 
form methodology on participant comprehension.  The proposed enrollment is 100 
participants in each arm of the study for a total of 200. 
 
All s tudy team members  will be trained to administer the NEAT form and the comprehension tool . 
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
Following the consent process, participants will be administered  the Comprehension tool  to measure their 
comprehension. The summary scores will be used to address the primary aim of whether or not the NEAT  
consent form improves participant comprehension.    In addition , subjects will be asked  the qualitative 
questions about what they liked and disliked regarding the consent form.   The study team member 
qualitative data about their opi[INVESTIGATOR_641087] .  The 
comprehension  score and the qualitative data about the consent form qualities as perceived by [CONTACT_641094].  
 
Analytical Plan  
Study participants will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_858042] (assuming the assumptions of the test are met) and 
compare the summary scores.  The qualitative feedback will be reviewed to see if any consistent themes 
are present, both overall and by [CONTACT_19313].

Informed Consent  
A waiver of the requirements for signed  informed consent  is requested  for the study team members who 
will provide anonymized feedback on the pros/cons of using the two consent forms .  The justification for 
a waiver of signed consent is presented below.  
The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures 
for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context .  Study team 
members  are simply providi ng information on the effectiveness of a form to communicate 
information ( ARIC participants ) and the usability of the form.   
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_117689], 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify 
subjects, and maintaining  all study information in a secure manner .  To help ensure subj ect privacy 
and confidentiality, no identifying information will b e collected with the Comprehension tool form or 
likes/dislikes feedback .  Subject  identifiers will not be linked to any personally identifiable 
information .  The comprehension tool will be conducted on paper directly after the consent process.  
After the tools are collected, they will be scored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_641088] R EDCap for analysis .  
Data access to the data collection forms and the transcribed information in the electronic system will 
be limited to study team members .  Data and records will be  kept on the WF  School of Medicine  
Protocol version:  3/2/[ADDRESS_858044] protected  and secured on the WFBH 
network .  No reference to any individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or 
publications that may arise from the study.

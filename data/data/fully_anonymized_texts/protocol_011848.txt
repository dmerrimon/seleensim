Study Protocol  
 
Description of the Study  
In the [LOCATION_002], hypertension (HTN) is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease 
and a more significant problem among Black women. About 46.1% of Black women over the 
age of [ADDRESS_837270] HTN compared to White (30.1%) and Hispanic (29.9%) women. Cu rrently, the 
prevalence of HTN in Black women is highest in the [LOCATION_002] and is expected to increase 
underscoring the relatively ineffective prevention and management efforts for blood pressure 
(BP) control. Black  adults  tend to develop HTN earlier in  life with greater severity and more 
organ damage when compared to Whites and uncontrolled HTN increases the risk of heart 
failure, myocardial infarction, stoke, and kidney disease. Black females experience a 
substantially higher death rate from HTN at 2.[ADDRESS_837271] them in a unique position to view healthcare with 
skepticism that differs from all other racial/ethnic groups. Thus, accepted approaches to HTN 
management have not been optimally effective in producing sustained B P control for Black 
women. Since nonadherence occurs in the context of everyday living, strategies are needed that 
encourage more active individual engagement in health care behaviors and self -care activities, in 
the physical and social environment where patients can perform them  independently. This 
research study evaluated community -based interventions designed to control hypertension using 
interactive self -care strategies with coaching and technology .  
This study includes a sample of community dwelling Bl ack women with uncontrolled HTN. All 
participants meeting study eligibility requirements will receive the Chronic Disease Self -
Management Program (CDSMP) workshop for 6 weeks. Participants from this pool will be 
randomized to the treatment and control arm.  All study participants will continue to receive usual 
care for their HTN.  
The intervention will be divided into three steps. At Step 1 for 3 months, the treatment arm will 
receive electronic monitoring (of participants' BP, weight, physical activity, food  diary, and 
medication -taking) with weekly Interactive Technology Enhanced Coaching (ITEC) while the 
control arm will receive usual care with manual BP measurements monthly. At Step 2 for three 
months, the treatment arm will receive electronic monitoring w ith ITEC biweekly, and the 
control arm will receive electronic monitoring only. At Step 3 for three months, both the 
treatment arm and the control arm will receive electronic monitoring only.  
Information from this study may be used to enhance self -care ma nagement, control blood 
pressure, and increase the quality of life for Black women who are burdened with the adverse 
effects of HTN and its high disability and mortality rates.  
Our sample of n=45 participants per arm (N=90 in total), will be measured (elec tronic 
measurements, anthropometric measurements, and data collection tools) at baseline, [ADDRESS_837272] CDSMP. A hierarchical, mixed -effects repeated measures design 
will be used to analyze the data.  
 
Objective  
 
The specific aims for this study evaluated  the effectiveness of an established Chronic Disease 
Self-Management  Program (CDSMP) plus an interactive technology -enhanced coaching (ITEC) 
intervention  on improving 1) BP control, and 2) medication adherence and life style 
modifications (physical activity, diet, and weight management) compared to the CDSMP and 
interactive technology  (IT) alone.  
 
Design  
 
The proposed project is a two -arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), repeated measures design . 
We hypothesize d that participants who receive d the CDSMP and ITEC would have lower 
systolic/diastolic BP and better adherence to antihypertensive medication(s) a nd lifestyle 
recommendations post intervention compared to participants receiving the CDSMP  and IT alone.  
Measurements were obtained over [ADDRESS_837273] in Charlotte, NC, and surrounding areas. T he state of NC lies in the 
southeastern area of the [LOCATION_002], an area known as the Stroke Belt because of the high 
incidence of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The study sample consist ed of 90 
community -dwelling Black women who had a medical diagnosis of hypertension and meet the 
study  criteria.  
 
Study criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria  included  1) self-identified as Black or African American; 2) 18 -70 years of age; 
3) English speaking; 4) had to live in the study community or surrounding area; 5) systolic blood 
pressure (BP) greater than or equal to 130 and/or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 80  at 
screening; 6)  prescribed to take one or more antihypertensive medication(s); and 7) smartphone 
with provider network or Wi -Fi connectivity. Exclusion Criteria  included  1) self-report of mental 
illness that interferes with daily functioning; 2) unable t o be physically active; 3) current 
pregnancy; 4) plans to move from the study community during the project; 5) systolic BP greater 
than or equal to160 and/or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 100; 6) uncontrolled diabetes 
(HbA1c >8.5), hemodialysis, hi story of stroke (within past year with residual effects such as 
weakness, paralysis, and speech difficulty), cancer treatment (for spread of cancer to other places 
in the body), or heart attack (within the past year); and 7) concurrent participation in ano ther 
research study and/or taken any Stanford self -management program.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_837274] the research staff (P I or trained RAs) who are registered nurses, via 
telephone or email. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_628294] a face to face or telephone screening 
interview. After an explanation of the study and answering questions, potential participants w ere 
(1) screened for incl usion/exclusion; (2) uncontrolled BP (systolic and/or diastolic greater than or 
equal to 130/80 but less than 160/100 mmHg; interviewees had their BP checked and report ed 
the numbers when called  for screening; BP was taken later to confirm eligibility befo re the 
consent form was signed and baseline data collected); and (3) ability to participate in physical 
activity using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR -Q). Those who were  eligible 
and agree to participate in the study w ere visited by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_628295]. At that time, the participants BP w as taken to confirm eligibility for 
the study. If the BP criteria was met, the  participant provide d informed consent and baseline data 
were obtained. If the BP  criteria were  not met, participants w ere thanked for their time and told 
that any collected information during the screening process would be discarded by [CONTACT_40223].  
 
Baseline data  
 
In the privacy of the participant’s home or a preferred private location, baseline data were 
collected and included demographic data (such as age, education, income, and medical history) 
and manual measurements (such as blood pressure, height, and weight ), along with a series of 
study questionnaires (such as the Hill -Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy 
Scale, Self -Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease, Healthcare Utilization, and the Self -Care 
of Hypertension Inventory). To manage data, a secure,  web-based application called the 
Research Electronic Data Capture  (REDCap) was used to record data via an iPad. The 
REDCap System provided a secure web -based application using a Cloud provider. If REDCap 
was not operational, data were collected by [CONTACT_628309].  
 
Baseline Measures  
 
Screening Questions and Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR -Q). 
Screening questions reflected the eligibility criteria for inclusion and exclusion in the study. 
The 2017 PAR -Q+ was used as a screening tool to assess possible exercise safety risk before 
the start of a physical activity p rogram (Warburton et al., 2017) . Answers were based on 
specific health history questions (Warburton, Gledhill, et al., 2011) . Sensitivity and specificity 
of the PAR -Q+ in individuals with and without HTN was 0.90 and 1 .0 respectively, and 
reliability was 0.99 (Warburton, Bredin, et al., 2011) . 
 
Demographic  Data Tool . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_628296]. The tool included information such as age, education, income , and medical  history.  
5 
 
 
Baseline and Repeated Measures  
 
Manual Blood Pressure . Using a home BP monitoring procedure (Muntner et al., 2019) , 
participants were seated quietly for at least 5 minutes with their back supported and feet flat on 
the floor. A manual BP measurement was taken with a Welch Allyn Tycos (DS58) hand aneroid 
sphygmomanometer in the bare left upper arm while supported at he art level. Three consecutive 
BP measurements were taken, one minute apart and averaged (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_116281]., 2005; Whelton et 
al., 2018) . Manual BP measurements were taken at baseline and then at month 3, 6, and 9 to 
verify readings from the digital Omron oscillometric BP monitor used for the technological data 
in the study (Abel & DeHaven, 2021) . To maintain c onsistency with the Omron BP 
recommendation, the left upper arm was used for BP measurements (Omron Healthcare, 2015a) .  
 
Body Mass Index. A portable platform Seca [ADDRESS_837275] 0.1 centimeter. Weight and height data were used to calculate the 
body mass index (BMI) using the metric system formula, weight in kilograms divided by 
[CONTACT_55739], expressed as: w eight (kg) / [height (m)]2 (Healthy weight: Body mass 
index , 2015) . 
 
 
Waist Circumference. Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_837276] and 
slightly above the level of the umbilicus from the “0” end of the tape to the intersection of the 
waist  measurement number. The Gulick tape measure includes a mechanism to ensure 
consistent tension when measuring. The participant stood in an upright position without 
sucking the abdomen in while the tape was pulled taut without squeezing into the skin (Frey, 
2019, September, 2; "Waist measurement," n.d.) .  
 
Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale (Hill -Bone 
CHBPTS) . The Hill -Bone CHBPTS was designed to asse ss medication compliance /adherence  
(Kim et al., 2003) . The scale is a 14 -item assessment tool is a 14 -item tool designed to assess 
medication compliance/adherence. Of the tools three subscales, this study focused on 
medication taking, 8 -items plus one item that addressed prescription refills totaling 9 -items. 
Responses are scored on a 4 -point Likert scale from 1 = none of the time to 4 = all of the time. 
Scores ranged from [ADDRESS_837277] adherence . Cronbach’s 
alpha f or the Hill -Bone CHBPTS medication compliance subscale was .77, and the total scale 
was .75 (Kim et al., 2000) . 
 
Self-Efficacy for Managing C hronic Disease (SEMCD) . The SEMCD is a 6 -item scale 
used to measure perceived ability to manage salient aspects of life with chronic disease such as 
symptom control, role function, and emotional functioning (Lorig et al., 2001) . Responses are 
scored on a 10 -point numeral rating scale (1= not at all confident to 10 = totally confident) with 
higher values i ndicating self -efficacy. For the SEMCD, the Cronbach’s alpha across eight 
studies ranged from .88 to .91 (Ritter & Lorig, 2014) .  
 
[ADDRESS_837278] reliability for Healthcare Utilization ranges from .76 
to .97 (Lorig et al., 1996) . 
 
Communication with Healthcare Provider . Commu nication with Physicians is a 3 -item 
scale used to monitor changes in the key behaviors taught in the CDSMP with items related to 
prepared questions, understanding treatment, and personal problems. Responses are recorded on 
a Likert scale (from 0 = never t o 5 = always), scored, and averaged. A higher score indicates 
better communication with providers. Internal consistency reliability for the Communication 
with Physicians scale is .73 (Lorig et al., 1996) . 
 
The Self -Care of Hypertension Inventory (SCHI) . The SCHI is a 23 -item tool designed 
to measure self -care intervention effectiveness and self -efficacy in self -care. The SCHI consists 
of three subsca les: self -care maintenance, 11 items; management, 6 items; and confidence, 6 
items (Dickson et al., 2016) . Each subscale has a differently worded 4 -point Likert scale 
ranging from 0 to 4. Each subscale was scored separately and then transformed to a 
standardized score that ranges from 0 to 100. Scores of 70 or grea ter indicate self -care 
adequacy. Internal consistency reliabilities for the SCHI three subscales are .83 for 
maintenance; .78 for management; and .94 for confidence (Silveira et al., in press) .  
 
Chronic Disease Self -Management Program (CDSMP)  
 
After collecting baseline data, all participants were enrolled in a 6 -week Chronic Disease Self -
Management Program ( CDSMP ) that was held in a classroom at a local church. The CDSMP 
focused on disease management skills related to decision making, problem -solving, and action 
planning with topi[INVESTIGATOR_628297] ( such as assessing nutritious foods, improving physical 
activity, managing excess weight, reducing stress, adhering to medications, communicat ing with 
providers, and dealing with depression). P articipants receive d a copy of the book entitled, Living 
a Healthy Life with Chronic Conditions , 4th Ed. with reading assignments to prepare for weekly 
sessions.   
 
As a standardized curriculum, fidelity wa s maintained through the use of trained leaders who 
followed teaching materials without modifications to provide consistent and specific 
interventions to all participants. The CDSMP was conducted by [CONTACT_628310] - a nurse and 
a layperson (peer) with the hypertension diagnosis, who served as a role model to participants 
and was able to address non -medical concerns. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_30647] a registered nurse who completed the 
CDSMP training along with the layperson who had the hypertension diagnosis. The trained 
layperson received an incentive/fee for working with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_628298]. The 
layperson was not a member of the research team.  
 
Participants attended weekly 2½ -hour classes for six weeks. The group size was uniform per the 
CDSMP recommendatio n for 10 -16 participants per session with six classes scheduled to 
accommodate the 90 participants. In addition to class activities, participants made specific action 
plans each week that were consistent with the study aims. For example, a physical activit y action 
plan may specifically address, “what” (this week, I will walk), “how much” (around the block), 
7 
 
“when” (before lunch), and “how often” (three times). All participants continued to receive usual 
care for HTN throughout the study period.  
 
Technology  
 
After completing the CDSMP sessions, study participants w ere randomly assigned to either the 
treatment ( ITEC)  or the control arm ( IT).  
 
The technology component of the study was linked to Fitbit Plus, a cloud -based collaborative 
care platform that was designed to store and track data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_628299], synchronizing data collection devices, instructing partici pants in the use of equipment, 
monitoring participant data, and interactive coaching messages. In the privacy of their homes, or 
another preferred location, each study participant received individualized instruction (about 45 to 
90 minutes) to Fitbit Plus and all study tools accommodating various technological skills.  
 
Study equipment included three wireless tools (Omron BP monitor, Fitbit activity tracker, and 
Fitbit weight scale) and five apps (Omron Connect, Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Apple Health if 
iPhone user or Google Fit if android user, and Fitbit Plus). Apps were installed and tools 
synchronized to the participant’s smartphone. Apple Health and Google Fit allowed Fitbit Plus 
to import app data from Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, and Omron. Participant action pl ans were set up 
in Fitbit Plus to correspond to the study aims. As participants wore their Fitbit activity tracker, 
took their BP, stepped onto the weight scale, or entered food intake, their measurement data 
were transmitted in real time via Wi -Fi and Blu etooth Smart technology to the Fitbit Plus 
dashboard. In the dashboard, participants could view their data along with the PI. Two 
exceptions were the manual BP recording for Android users and the manual self -reported 
medication -taking for all participants,  as described under Fitbit Plus Measures . The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_628300] a two -week trial period to allow participants an 
opportunity to adapt to using the wireless tools and apps. Once the orientation period was over, 
data were monitor ed via the Fitbit Plus platform for study purposes.  
 
Fitbit Plus Technology Measures  
 
Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor.  The Omron 10 wireless Bluetooth home BP monitor 
(Model BP786N) is clinically validated for accuracy according to international guidelines 
(Omron: Why validation is important , 2019) . Participants were trained to measure their BP two 
times per day (morning and night)  after they had been seated for at least five minutes with feet 
flat on the  floor and back supported. The easy -wrap ComFit cuff (fits standard to large arms, 9 to 
17 inches in circumference) was placed directly on the bare skin of the left upper arm ½ inch 
above the elbow with the air tube on the inside of the arm and aligned wit h the middle finger 
(Omron Healthcare, 2015b) . Three consecutive BP meas ures were automatically taken with the 
left arm supported at heart level with one minute between measurements (Whelton et al., 2017) . 
Omron home BP monitors are designed for use on the left arm because v alidation during clinical 
studies used the left arm (FAQs: Blood Pressure Monitors , 2020) . All BP readings were 
recorded, analyzed, automatically averaged, and synchronized to the Omron Connect app on 
smartphones. However, real -time tracking in the Fitbit Plus dashboard only occurred fo r iPhone 
users. Because Android phones did not automatically transmit Omron BP data to Fitbit Plus, 
[ADDRESS_837279] recorded medication -taking and tracked self -
reported adherence. This study examine d changes in the calculated value of average adherence 
based on the participant’s  self-report  (Lagasse, 2018, September 19) .  
 
Physical Activity tracker.  Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_228141] (Diaz et al., 2015; Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_628301], 2019)  is a physical activity tracker and acceler ometer that measures steps, distance, 
calories burned, and active minutes. The Fitbit was worn on the non -dominant wrist to monitor 
physical activity during waking hours.  Steps in the Fitbit app were synchronized  to the Fitbit 
Plus dashboard. The outcome o f interest for this study was changes in the number of steps.  
 
MyFitnessPal Food Diary.  MyFitnessPal app is used with smartphones to log food 
intake using a comprehensive food database (Van Horn et al., 2016) . MyFitnessPa l calculates 
calories, macronutrients ( such as  carbohydrates, fats, proteins), and micronutrients ( such as  
vitamins, and minerals) from the food intake. Caloric and sodium intake were synchronized  to 
the Fitbit Plus dashboard. Because sodium is known to in crease BP, it was monitored to provide 
insight to the participant’s dietary patterns. Participants were instructed to log their food intake 
immediately after eating.  The outcome of interest in this study was changes in caloric intake . 
 
Weight Scale . The Fitbit Aria 2 weight scale (Wi -Fi Smart Scale) was used to measure 
weight, BMI, and body fat percentage. Participants were instructed to weigh every morning 
after emptying their bladder.  Weight measurements were synchronized via the Fitbit app to the 
Fitbit Plus dashboard. This study examine d changes in body weight .   
 
Fitbit Monitoring  
 
With smart monitoring of connected devices in Fitbit Plus, data were tracked, analyzed, and 
transparently displayed to provide opportunities for participants to better understand their 
condition and self -manage by [CONTACT_628311]. In the CDSMP, all 
participants were taught to write action plans and report if they were successful, partially 
successful, or not successful in achieving their plan bas ed on participant self -tracking of their 
data. Fitbit Plus allowed real -time adherence tracking. If participants were adhering to their 
action plan, study measures displayed a green color indicating a positive trend and if they were 
not adhering, measures would display a red color indicating a negative trend, alerting the PI [INVESTIGATOR_628302] -care.  
 
Only the treatment arm  action plans were monitored with individualized coaching messages 
(ITEC) via secure text messaging in the Fitbit Plus dashboard with real -time participant 
feedback. Coaching messages focused on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_88488]’s problem -solve barriers to goal 
9 
 
achievem ent with relevant dialogue to encourage BP control, medication adherence, and 
lifestyle modifications (physical activity, caloric intake, and weight management). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_628303] t 
tailored ITEC messages via Fitbit Plus to treatment arm participants weekly for mo nths 1 -3, 
biweekly for months 4 -6, and no ITEC messages for months 7-9 (to assess for sustainability) .  
 
During months [ADDRESS_837280] every three months for about 30 minutes provided a human element to the 
Fitbit Plus technology component and allowed the PI [INVESTIGATOR_628304].  
 
Gift cards were given to participants for time expended for baseline assessment ($20) and 
repeated measures at 3 - ($30), 6 - ($40), and 9 -months ($60) totaling $150.  
 
If study participants complete d all parts of the research study, then as a completion bonus, they 
were allowed to  keep all measurement tools including the blood pressure monitor, Fitbit, and 
weight scale, along with the CDSMP book  at the conclusion of the study. After Fitbit Plus access  
ended, participants were able to continue to monitor themselves through the corresponding apps 
on their smartphone. For those study participants who do not complete the study, the blood 
pressure  monitor, Fitbit, weight scale, and book w ere returned to the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_628305].   
 
At the completion of the study, Fitbit Plus transmitted  a copy of all collected data at the request 
of the PI. Both  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_628306] .  
 
A summary of the overall results of the project in ‘lay’ language w as shared with participants in  
their preferred format ( such as  email, letter, or in-person) while ensuring confidentiality of 
individual responses after  the study has ended.  
 
Data safety and Monitoring  
 
The Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) ensured the safety of research participants and 
protection of the integrity and confidentiality of the clinical trial study data. Because this is a 
small study with low risk, the PI, me ntor, and biostatistician provided oversight of this study. 
The DSMP was reviewed monthly (and more frequently as needed). Progress reports, including 
participant  recruitment, retention/attrition, and adverse events (AEs), were addressed at each of 
[ADDRESS_837281] (IRB) 
and to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) as applicable.  
 
Statistical Analys is Plan 
 
Sample size and power. All participants meeting study eligibility requirements received 
the CDSMP classes for 6 weeks. Participants from this pool were randomized to the treatment 
arm (with ITEC and electronic  devices such as the home BP monitoring, weight  scale , and 
physical ac tivity  tracker ), and the c ontrol arm , with IT monitoring only. Our sample of n=45 
participants per arm ( N=90 in total), measured at baseline, and at 3-, 6-, and [ADDRESS_837282] 
CDSMP, has approximately 80% power (assuming 5 dropouts per arm) to detect an effect size of 
~0.205 or greater at the α=0.05 level of statistical significance, given a realistic range of 
simulated unstructured covariance matrices. Assuming an 11% rat e of attrition, the enrollment 
target was set at [ADDRESS_837283] . This model, which allows for 
heterogeneous variances across time points, is preferred over a simple univariate model that 
requires compound symmetry (i.e., the correlation between a measurement at time Ti and any 
other measurement within the same patients at Tj, is equal for all i and j). A mixed -effects model 
is more efficient for handling missing at random (MAR) data than, for example, a generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) repeated measures approach, which requires the more restrictive 
assumption that missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR). We perform ed a 
sensitivity analysis using both a GEE mode l and sequential application of the EM algorithm to 
impute missing data. Data from participants (n=7) who dropped out of the study before their first 
post-CDSMP visit were not included in the analysis. However, baseline information for these 
participants w ere compared with participants who continued in the study.  
 
When appropriate a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model was used, assuming 
the same baseline mean for treatment and referent arms with missing baseline data. The cLDA 
model examine s treatment differences over time. Coffman et al. (2016)  cite the cLDA as the 
method of choice for longitudinal RCTs  because it yields robust estimates of treatment effect 
differences under reasonable missing data assumptions.  
 
Both models are valid for repeated measures if data are missing at random (MAR). Little’s test 
was used to determine if variables were missing completely at random (MCAR) while significant 
covariate -dependent missing values were identified by [CONTACT_259572] a dichotomous indicator 
variable for missingness against key models factors . (Li, 2013)  That is, if the missing values 
were non -randomly asso ciated with the latter variables of interest, the mechanism was deemed to 
be missing at random (MAR). A sampling of observed vs. non -unobserved items were 
subjectively scrutinized for signs of a ‘missing not at random (MNAR)’ pattern for the data. 
Overall,  no relevant violation of the MAR assumption was evident in our analyses.   
 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic data ( such as marital status, 
education, and income) of study  participants.  
11 
 
 
An independent (unpaired) samples t -test was used to determine the difference between the 
means of the treatment and referent  groups. The dependent (paired) sample t -test was used to 
determine the mean differences between variables (systolic and diastolic BP and weight/BMI ) 
for treatment and referent  group participants from baseline ( post-CDSMP) to month 3, from 
month [ADDRESS_837284] versus non -parametric methods for nonnormally distributed data 
has been debated in the literature (le Cessie et al., 2020) . In general, the former is reasonable 
robust to departures from normality, providing that the sample sizes are sufficiently large, and 
the underlying variances are finite (with no extreme outliers) (Lumley et al., 2002)  
 
All data collection tools (except the Hill-Bone CH BPTS  medication subscale) were converted to 
a [ADDRESS_837285], the mixed model tends to yield valid estimates 
of treatment effects even when the missing values are not completely missing at random  (Detry 
& Ma, 2016) . Rounding was based upon significant digits rather than a fixed number of decimal 
places  (i.e., Goldilocks method) (Efird, 2021) . Data were analyzed using SAS - v 9.4 (Cary, NC).

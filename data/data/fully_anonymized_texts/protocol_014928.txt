Douglas Simonetto   CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
This document is a clinical research protocol for a human research study. This study will be 
carried out in accordance with the applicable  [LOCATION_002]  government regulations and Mayo 
Clinic  research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common condition with a lifetime and 12 -month prevalence of 
29.1% and 13.9%, respectively, identified in the US population (Grant et al., 2015). Although 
several effective treatments are available, less than one -fifth of ind ividuals seek treatment over 
their lifetime; most seek help from physicians to manage comorbidities related to AUD (Grant et 
al., 2015; Lyon, 2017). Alcohol -related liver disease encompasses a wide spectrum of disease, 
ranging from steatosis and minimal fi brosis to alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis and sequelae of portal 
hypertension. Hepatic steatosis is common, seen in approximately 90% of longstanding heavy 
drinkers with recent binging (Edmondson et al., 1967). Ongoing alcohol consumption may result 
in stea tohepatitis in one third of patients and an estimated 16% of those with steatohepatitis will 
develop cirrhosis over five years (Barrio et al, 2004; Deleuran et al., 2012). Individuals with 
alcohol -related cirrhosis are at high risk for complications from l iver disease and death; these risks 
are increased in the setting of ongoing alcohol use ( Jepsen et al., 2010; Jepsen et al., 2012).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_342029], there are few prospective  clinical 
studies  evaluating the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments to promote abstinence and prevent 
relapse. Naltrexone and acamprosate have been found to be effective for AUD; however, 
naltrexone carries a significant  risk of hepatocellular injury, and it is contraind icated in those with 
acute hepatitis or liver failure  (Jonas et al., 2014; Alkermes, Inc., 2010). Other promising 
medications that require further study include baclofen, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], gabapentin, varenicline and 
ondansetron, of which baclofen is the only dr ug that has been evaluated in liver disease 
(Addolorato et al., 2007).  
 
Acamprosate has not been evaluated formally in individuals with AUD and liver disease. It is an 
N-methyl -D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist approved by [CONTACT_342047] (Frye et 
al., 2016). Acamprosate has an unclear mechanism of action, although it is thought that its effect 
on decreased alcohol craving intensity is mediated through a reducti on in glutamate levels (Frye 
et al., 2016). The efficacy of acamprosate has been demonstrated in several meta -analyses, most 
recently exhibiting a number needed to treat of 12 to prevent return to any drinking (Jonas et al., 
2014; Rosato et al., 2015). Aca mprosate is not metabolized by [CONTACT_342048] a potential therapeutic option in those with liver disease. However, as acamprosate 
antagonizes the glutamate receptor, there have been concerns it may increase the risk of hepatic 
encephalopathy. Previously, a single dose of acamprosate 666 mg was administered to 12 patients 
with Child -Pugh A or B cirrhosis with no identifiable induction of subclinical hepatic 
encephalopathy; however, transient diastolic hypotension was noted (Delgran ge et al., 1992). No 
further studies on acamprosate have been performed in individuals with liver disease.  
 
To evaluate the safety of acamprosate in individuals with AUD and alcohol -related liver disease, 
an initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_342030] a Mode l for End Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD -
Na) score less than 20  will be conducted . If no safety concerns are identified, the study will then 
Acamprosate for alcohol use disorder in alcohol -related liver disease  Version 3.0 
  Revised 04/25/2022  
Page 7 of 31 
Douglas Simonetto   CONFIDENTIAL  be performed in five patients with ME LD-Na scores of 20 or more . If again no safety concerns are 
identified, a la rger, placebo -controlled efficacy study is planned and will be submitted as a separate 
protocol.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Per the manufacturer, [COMPANY_006] (2005): “ CAMPRAL® (acamprosate calcium) is supplied in an 
enteric -coated tablet for oral administration. Acam prosate calcium is a synthetic compound with 
a chemical structure similar to that of the endogenous amino acid homotaurine, which is a 
structural analogue of the amino acid neurotransmitter γ -aminobutyric acid and the amino acid 
neuromodulator taurine. Its  chemical name [CONTACT_342060]. Its 
chemical formula is C10H20N2O8S2Ca and molecular weight is 400.48.  
 
Each CAMPRAL tablet contains acamprosate calcium 333 mg, equivalent to 300 mg of 
acamprosate. Inactive ingredients in CAMPRAL tablets include: crospovidone, microcrystalline 
cellulose, magnesium silicate, sodium starch glycolate, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium 
stearate, talc, propylene glycol and Eudragit® L [ADDRESS_423577] will 
appear in table t form. ”  
 
Acamprosate is now available as a generic in the [LOCATION_003].

1.[ADDRESS_423578] recently exhibiting a number 
needed to treat of 12 to prevent return to any drinking (Jonas et al., 2014; Rosato et al., 2015) .  
 
Previously, a single dose of acamprosate 666 mg was administered to 12 patients with Child -
Pugh A or B cirrhosis with no identifiable induction of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy; 
however, transient diastolic hypotension was noted (Delgrange et al., 1992). No further studies 
on acamprosate have be en performed in individuals with liver disease.  
 
1.5 Dose Rationale  
 
Acamprosate will be dosed at 33 3 mg TID, increased to 666  mg TID after 1 week if tolerated. If 
GFR is 30 -50 ml/min, dosage will remain at 33 3 mg TID throughout the study.  The dosing and 
dose regimen  of acamprosate has varied in prior trials; however, the regimen  used herein is largely 
considered standard for use  in AUD ( Plosker, 2015; Higuchi, 2015).  Based on prior studies and 
for practical purposes, route of administration will be by [CONTACT_1966].

Douglas Simonetto   CONFIDENTIAL  1.6 Risk s and Benefits  
 
Individuals with alcohol -related cirrhosis are at hi gh risk for complications from liver disease and 
death; these risks are increased in the setting of ongoing alcohol use ( Jepsen et al., 2010; Jepsen et 
al., 2012).  A profound difference in five -year survival after an epi[INVESTIGATOR_342031], with rates of 75% and 21 -27%, respectively ( Potts et al., 2013 ).  
 
Adverse events associated with acamprosate use  are considered minimal and primarily  have 
included anxiety, diarrhea and vomitin g (Jonas et al., 2014 ; Reus et al., 2018 ). Specific rates of the 
following adverse events have been reported:  pruritus (4%), diarrhea (17%), flatulence (3%), 
nausea (4%), dizziness (3%), insomnia (7%), anxiety (6 %) and depression (5%)  ([COMPANY_006], 2005) . 
More rare risks include cardiomyopathy, deep thrombophlebitis, heart failure, mesenteric arterial 
occlusion, shock and s uicide ([COMPANY_006], 2005) . There has been no increased risk of withdrawal from 
trials  with acamprosate  due to adverse events (Jonas et al., 2014). Given  the high risk of adverse 
outcomes associated with ongoing alcohol consumption in this patient population, including death, 
the risks of acamprosate use are reasonable in comparison.   
2 Study Objectives  
Primar y Objective : 
 
To assess the safety and tolerability of acamprosate for treatment of AUD in alcohol -related liver 
disease as measured by [CONTACT_329566].  
 
Secondary Objective : 
 
To assess treatment effect of acamprosate on alcohol relapse  in alcohol -related liver disease as 
measured by [CONTACT_342049] (PACS) scores and reporting of alcohol use . 
 
3 Study Design  
 
This study is a phase IIa trial of the safety of acamprosate in treating AUD in alcohol -related liver 
disease. Subjects will be screened for eligibility at outpatient clinic visits and during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participati on in this 
trial. At study enrollment, initial MELD -Na score must be less than [ADDRESS_423579] month, 
followed by [CONTACT_342050] a monthly basis thereafter. A final  clinic  
visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be conducted at th e end of the study  at 3 
months . Patients will be contact[CONTACT_342051] 13 and 24  after study enrollment for final 
follow up assessment s off of study medication .

  Revised 04/25/[ADDRESS_423580] based on 
history of regular and excessive alcohol cons umption in the absence of other causes of liver 
cirrhosis or acute hepatitis, compatible clinical, imaging and laboratory findings and typi[INVESTIGATOR_342032], if performed. Underlying liver disease may include alcoholic hepatitis, 
advanced (F3 -F4) fibrosis, and/or portal hypertension. The diagnosis of AUD will be determined 
by a hepatologist based on history obtained that is consistent with DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for 
AUD (all categories of mild, moderate and severe considered eligible).  
 
Patie nts need not be  abstinent from alcohol prior to initiating acamprosate treatment  (but not 
abstinent for more than 6 months) . At study enrollment, initial MELD -Na score must be less than 
[ADDRESS_423581] phase of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_157688]. The second 
phase of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_342033] a MELD -Na of 20 or more at  
enrollment. Patients with heart failure (NYHA class II or higher) or hypotension requiring the use 
of vasoconstrictors (i.e. midodrine)  will be excluded. Individuals with a glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) of less than 30 ml/min will be excluded. Acampros ate will be dosed at 33 3 mg TID, 
increased to 666  mg TID after 1 week if tolerated. If GFR is 30 -50 ml/min, dosage will remain at 
333 mg TID throughout the study.  Acamprosate will be administered for a total of 3 months.  
 
Prior to enrollment, known risks a nd benefits of acamprosate in treating AUD will be discussed 
with patients including  pruritus (4%), diarrhea (10% to 17%), flatulence (3%), nausea (4%), 
dizziness (3%), insomnia (7%), anxiety (6%) and depression (5%). More rare risks include 
cardiomyopathy , deep thrombophlebitis, heart failure, mesenteric arterial occlusion, shock and 
suicidal intent (1%).  
 
At enrollment, c ollected baseline characteristics will include patient age, sex, race, martial and 
employment status, education level, social support, p resence of children, age of children, 
underlying liver disease etiology, MELD -Na score, presence of ascites, esophageal varices, 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, diabetes, corticosteroid or other medical treatment for alcoholic 
hepatitis (Maddrey and Lil le scores if relevant), medical comorbidities, prescription a nd non -
prescription medications. With regard to alcohol use, patients will have the 11 DSM -5 questions 
regarding AUD answered  at screening  (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), as well as the 
following history obtained:  duration of excess alcohol consumption in years, level of alcohol 
consumption prior to study enrollment, interval of alcohol abstinence prior to study enrollment, 
family history of alcoholism, history of alcohol -related legal issues, psychiatric comorbidity 
(requiring medication, outpatient care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), other addictions including smoking and 
number of prior rehabilitation attempts f or alcohol or other addictio ns. The PACS questionnaire 
will be administered. Vital signs and a physical examination will be performed. West Haven HE 
score will be graded and modified telephone version of MMSE completed. Blood work will be 
completed including a complete blood count, e lectrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, INR, AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase. A urine ethyl

current medications. At enrollment, during phone calls and  at the follow up visit, patients will be 
asked standardized questions to assess for HE based on the abbreviated telephone version of the 
mini-mental state examination (MMSE) . Follow up telephone visits at 13 and 24 weeks will be 
conducted, primarily to monitor for adverse events and alcohol relapse . 
 
The Pennsylvania Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) will be applied before treatment initiation, 
weekly for the first month on treatme nt, then monthly thereafter. This will include the need severity 
scale (mild, moderate, severe) at baseline and at each assessment by [CONTACT_342052].  
 
Alcohol use relapse  will be monitored. Any amount of alcohol use as revealed during follow -up 
considered a relapse event. Alcohol use will be captured and categorized as none, slip (no longer 
drinking at most recent follow up) or sustained alcohol use (minimum 100 days drinking). Slips 
and sustained alcohol use will be categorized as binge drinking,  frequent drinking, or both (binge 
drinking as more than 6 units/day for men and 4 units/day for women and frequent drinking as 
alcohol use in 4 or more days/week regardless of quantity per day) (Lee et al., 2018).  
 
Basic descriptive statistics and a quali tative analysis will be performed. Analyses will be 
performed using SPSS 25 (Chicago, IL). Results will not contain any patient -specific information.

5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 
Per [COMPANY_006] manual (2005):  
“CAMPRAL® (acamprosate calcium) is supplied in an enteric -coated tablet for oral 
administration. Acamprosate calcium is a synthetic compound with a chemical structure similar 
to that of the endogenous amino acid homotaurine, which is a structural analogue of the ami no 
acid neurotransmitter γ -aminobutyric acid and the amino acid neuromodulator taurine. Its 
chemical name [CONTACT_342060]. Its chemical formula is 
C10H20N2O8S2Ca and molecular weight is 400.48.  
 
Acamprosate calcium is a white, odor less or nearly odorless powder. It is freely soluble in water, 
and practically insoluble in absolute ethanol and dichloromethane. Each CAMPRAL tablet 
contains acamprosate calcium 333 mg, equivalent to 300 mg of acamprosate. Inactive ingredients 
in CAMPRAL tablets include: crospovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium silicate, 
sodium starch glycolate, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate, talc, propylene glycol 
and Eudragit® L [ADDRESS_423588] will appear in tablet form.  
 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Pharmacodynamics  
The mechanism of action of acamprosate in maintenance of alcohol abstinence is not completely 
understood. Chronic alcohol exposure is hypothesized to alter the normal balance between 
Acamprosate for alcohol use disorder in alcohol -related liver disease  Version 3.0 
  Revised 04/25/[ADDRESS_423589] em (CNS) activity in animals outside of its effects on alcohol 
dependence, exhibiting no anticonvulsant, antidepressant, or anxiolytic activity.  The 
administration of acamprosate calcium is not associated with the development of tolerance or 
dependence in  animal studies.  CAMPRAL is not known to cause alcohol aversion and does not 
cause a disulfiram -like reaction as a result of ethanol ingestion.  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption: The absolute bioavailability of CAMPRAL after oral administration is about 11%. 
Steady -state plasma concentrations of acamprosate are reached within 5 days of dosing. Steady -
state peak plasma concentrations after CAMPRAL doses of 2 x 333 mg tablets three times daily 
average 350 ng/mL and occur at [ADDRESS_423590] -dose. Coadministration of CAMPRAL with food 
decreases bioavailability as measured by [CONTACT_64072], by [CONTACT_3450] 42% and 23%, 
respectively. The food effect on absorption is not clinically significant and no adjustment of dose 
is necessary.  
Distribution: The volume of distribu tion for acamprosate following intravenous administration is 
estimated to be 72 -109 liters (approximately 1 L/kg) . Plasma protein binding of acamprosate is 
negligible.  
Metabolism: Acamprosate does not undergo metabolism.  
Elimination: After oral dosing of 2 x 333 mg of CAMPRAL , the terminal half -life ranges from 
approximately 20 - 33 hours. Following oral administration of CAMPRAL , the major route of 
excretion is via the kidneys as acamprosate. ” 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Acamprosate will be dosed at 333  mg PO TID, increased to 666  mg PO TID after 1 week if 
tolerated. If GFR is 30 -50 ml/min, dosage will remain at 33 3 mg PO TID throughout the study.  
Treatment duration is 3 months.

Douglas Simonetto   CONFIDENTIAL  8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) breach of confidentiality 
and (6 ) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, 
interim findings, product labeling change) tha t in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_342041], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially 
compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A proble m or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable e xperience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events include ; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant  disability or incapacity  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_342042], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially 
compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any o f the criteria for serious , will be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as [ADDRESS_423597] 
administration of study treatment.   
Acamprosate for alcohol use disorder in alcohol -related liver disease  Version 3.0 
  Revised 04/25/2022  
Page 21 of 31 
Douglas Simonetto   CONFIDENTIAL   
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examin ation Findings  
At screening, any clin ically significant abnormality will  be recorded as a preexisting condition.  
At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the 
definition of an adverse event must also be recor ded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last  scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report , to the investigator, any subsequent 
event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related 
to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal L aboratory Values  
Determination of whether worsening of liver biochemic al tests is due to the alcohol -related  
hepatitis or study drug induced liver injury (DILI) is difficult. An AST or ALT increase >500 
IU/L would be considered an indication that the patient might have DILI since AST and ALT are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 300-400 U/L in AH. Such an increase of > 500 IU/L would  trigger prompt evaluation 
and consideration of discontinuation of the study drug. Considering how difficult it is to 
distinguish potential DILI from worsening of the underlying liver disease, we have incorporated 
an external adjudication of all suspected DILI events.  An increase in MELD -Na score >5 points 
from baseline, or doubling bilirubin (2 times the baseline level at enrollment) would warrant 
urgent review by [CONTACT_4318].   
 
The study will be stopped if three  or more patients develop AST or ALT > 500 U/L  or as or as 
determined by [CONTACT_4318].  
. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342043] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  
Any condition responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition 
meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting condi tion.  Surgery will not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.

[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event section  of the case rep ort form (CRF ).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic , laboratory or  procedure results should recorded in the source document . 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable  cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up  to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting 
Period  and is considered to be at leas t possibly related to the study tr eatment or study 
participation will  be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
Adverse events will be class ified per the CTCAE Version 5.0, November 27, [ADDRESS_423599] the study participant and then co mplete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet  
and log.  The investigator will evaluate the event and determine the nece ssary follow -up and 
reporting required.

Douglas Simonetto   CONFIDENTIAL  The investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports need to be 
made to the IRB.  The investigator will sign and date the adverse event report when it is 
reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly r elated SAEs /UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] s will be reported to the IRB.  
 
* Relationship Index  
The relationship of an AE to the Investigational Drug is a clinical decision by [CONTACT_1961] (PI) based on all available information at the time of the completion of the  CRF and 
is graded as follows:  
 
1. Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology  is 
unrelated to the study drug; the subject did not receive the study medication or the temporal 
sequence of the AE onset relat ive to administration of the study medication is not reasonable or 
the event is c1early related to other factors such as the subject' s clinical state, therapeutic 
intervention or concomitant therapy.  
 
2. Unlikely : a clinical event, including laboratory te st abnormality, with a temporal relationship 
to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, 
chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
 
3. Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the  drug but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_64758]; information on drug withdrawals may be lacking are unclear.  
 
4. Probable: a clinical event  including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (de -
challeng e): re -challenge information is not required to fulfi1 this definition.  
 
5. Definite: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug, or in which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissues, that fo llows a 
known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug, and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_342054][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure (re -challenge).  
 
Severity Index  
The maximum i ntensity of an AE during a day will  be graded according to the definitions below 
and recorded in details as indicated on the CRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a number 
of days, then separate entries should be made having distinct onset dates.  
 
1. Mild: AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere with 
patient’s  daily activities.  
 
2. Moderate: AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconvenience or conce rn to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities, b ut are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].

8.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_342044]:  
1. The participant decides to withdraw from the study.  
2. The participant experiences a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he 
investigator, is possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug utilizing the 
National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE system as a guide.

4. The participant experiences a grade [ADDRESS_423600] or ALT >500 U/L  
 
Determination of whether worsening of liver biochemical tests is due to the alcoholic hepatitis or 
study drug induced liver injury (DILI) is difficult. An AST or ALT increase >500 IU/L would be 
considered an indication that the patient might have DILI sinc e AST and ALT are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 
300-400 U/L in AH. Such an increase of > 500 IU/L would trigger prompt evaluation and 
consideration of discontinuation of the study drug. Considering how difficult it is to distinguish 
potential DILI from worsening of the unde rlying liver disease, we have incorporated an external 
adjudication of all suspected DILI events.  An increase in MELD -Na score >5 points from 
baseline, or doubling bilirubin (2 times the baseline level at enrollment) would warrant urgent 
review by [CONTACT_4318] .  
  
The study will be put on hold for review with the DSMB if one patient experiences a serious 
adverse event.  The study will be restarted if the DSMB considers the serious adverse events to 
be unrelated to study drug.  
 
The study will stop overall if any of the following occur:

4. If recommended  by [CONTACT_3433] e DSMB.  
 
In the event of a SAE, the site will report this to the Mayo Clinic study team. If the SAE  is 
attributable to study drug, the Mayo Clinic study team will report the event to the  Institu tional 
Review Board . 
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibili ty of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a sit e data and safety -
monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting ”).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_423602] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulatio ns require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that informat ion 
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are co ntained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
Acamprosate for alcohol use disorder in alcohol -related liver disease  Version 3.0 
  Revised 04/25/[ADDRESS_423603] files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories , and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All 
data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be ex plained.  If a space on 
the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write 
“N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be 
printed legibly in black ink.  If any en try error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a 
single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  Do not erase or use “white -out” for errors.   For clarification 
of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.   If 
the reason for the correction is not clear or needs additional explanation, neatly include the 
details to justify the correction.  
 
Data Management  
 
Source documents will be kept that include, but are not limited to, medical records, charts, 
appointment books, patient questionnaires, original laboratory records, equipment printouts. All 
source documents must be made available to the CR A. The following data must be included in 
the source data:  
- Consent to participate in Trial  
- Letter to Primary Care Physician, if applicable  
- Patient visit dates  
- Screening Numbers  
- Demographic Information  
- Medical history

This is a single center study. Flow of data will be between study coordinators and PIs. De -
identified data will be available to DSMB.  
 
Acamprosate for alcohol use disorder in alcohol -related liver disease  Version 3.0 
  Revised 04/25/[ADDRESS_423604] to the patient will be 
regarded as confidential and confidentiality of all patients will be maintained. Clinical monitors 
(e.g. CRAs), auditors and inspectors will require access to a pa tient’s medical notes for the 
purpose of source document verification source document verification but the patient’s 
confidentiality will be maintained at all times. An agreement for disclosure of any such 
information will be obtained in writing and is inc luded in the statement of informed consent. The 
trial data shall not be disclosed to a third party (with the exception of auditors and/or regulatory 
authorities) without the written consent of the PIs. All data shall be secured against unauthorized 
access.  
 
Apart from the investigators, no one will have access to participant’s identity. The site will 
securely maintain the code that links participants’ identity to their study numbers to prevent 
access to unauthorized third parties. Participants will be identified according to their study 
numbers in th e data management system  and by [CONTACT_342055].  
 
Data Quality Assurance  
 
Logic and consistency checks will be performed on all data entered into the CRF to ensure 
accuracy and completeness.  
 
Training sessions, regular monitoring of the trial, instruction manuals, data verification, cross -
checking and data audits will be performed to ensure quality of all trial data.  
 
Data Clarification Process  
 
The data manager for the study will conduct periodic data queries.  
9.[ADDRESS_423605] case histories and regulatory documents.  The investigator 
should retain all correspondence relating to this trial in the Investig ator Site File (ISF).  
 
All research documentation during the duration of the study will be kept in both secured binders 
by [CONTACT_342056] a secured electronic environment (electronic data capture). 
Documents stored in the secured binders will  be kept for the duration of the study. Once the 
study has been completed, the information in these binders (should it be less than 15 years since 
the start of the study) will be sent to a medical record warehouse as indicated by [CONTACT_342057] a  locked research cabinet in the clinical area for at least [ADDRESS_423606] maintained by [CONTACT_342058] (clinic number, unique patient number), this will not be given to monitors. Those 
who require access to patient records will be require d to sign an agreement for disclosure of any 
Acamprosate for alcohol use disorder in alcohol -related liver disease  Version 3.0 
  Revised 04/25/[ADDRESS_423607] de -identified data from s ubjects as qualified 
patients will be assigned a unique four -digit number and their initials. This electronic system will 
be secure meeting the federal requirements and access will be limited only on an authorized basis 
from the system administrator for pu rposes of the study.  
 
All documents relating to the trial including the ISF itself, source documents and patient medical 
files (retained per country specific regulations), completed trial patient log and confidential 
patient identification list will be re tained by [CONTACT_1732] a minimum period of 15 years, in 
accordance with regulations  as above  
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will 
also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to 
all the study -related documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.), and has adequate space to conduct  the monitoring visit.  
 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audi ts, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201],  and 
government regulatory agencies, of a ll study related documents (e.g. source documents, 
regulatory documents, data  collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure 
the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic

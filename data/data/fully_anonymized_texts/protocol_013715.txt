Protocol  Number/  
Title Protocol  Number  WVU010516  
Use of Response -Adapted Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy to 
Potentiate  the Systemic  Immune  Response  to Checkpoint  Inhibitors  in 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Study  Phase  Phase  II 
Brief  Background/ 
Rationale  Preclinical  data suggest  that radiation  therapy  may be uniquely  suited  to 
combine  with immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  since  radiation  can disrupt 
a tumor’s physical barriers to T -cell infiltration and augment antigen 
presentation, thus serving as an "in sit u personalized vaccine" to 
activate the immune system and potentially enhance the systemic 
response. However, the optimal way to combine immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and radiation therapy is poorly understood, and there is little 
prospective data evaluatin g the efficacy in patients. The rationale for 
this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of combined  immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and radiation therapy in metastatic non -small cell 
lung cancer patients.  
Primary  Objective  Primary  Endpoint:  Best overall  response  rate (ORR)  (complete  and 
partial),  measured  on follow -up imaging  as per immune -related 
Response Criteria (irRC) after initiation of therapy.  
Secondary 
Objective(s)  Secondary  Endpoint(s):  Progression -free survival  (PFS),  overall  
survival  (OS),  toxicity  using  CTCAE  v4.0,  quality  of life using  FACT - 
L. 
Exploratory 
Objective(s)  Exploratory Endpoint(s): Univariate and multivariate analysis will be 
used to correlate the presence of response with radiotherapy variables 
(biologic effective dose, number of fractions, duration of radiotherapy, 
sequence  of radiation  and immune  therapy),  tumor  variables  (irradiated 
tumor  site, size, histology,  local  response,  extent  of prior  chemotherapy  
use),  and patient  variables  (age,  smoking  status,  and biologic 
correlates).  
Correlative 
Objective(s)  Correlative Endpoint(s): In consenting patients peripheral blood 
samples will be collected before initiation of radiation therapy, at the 
time of the first follow -up imaging study, and for any change in response 
status on reimaging to assess levels of circ ulating CD4+, CD8+ and 
Treg T -cell subsets, as well as iNOS+/CD80+ macrophages. We will 
also assess  immune  cell trafficking  by [CONTACT_483977]  (HGF,  TGF -β) and chemokines  (CCL2  for M1 macrophages, 
and CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 f or T-cells). We will also 
determine changes of the  
circulating T -cells immune -repertoire (i -repertoire) by [CONTACT_483978]3  region  of the T-cell receptor  (TCR).

Version  Date:  09/09/[ADDRESS_622057] overall  response  rate (ORR)  (complete  and partial),  as measured  on 
follow -up CT or PET/C T imaging after initiation of radiation therapy.  
 
1.2. Secondary  Objective(s)  
To determine 1 -year progression -free survival (PFS); 1 -year overall survival (OS); 
safety/toxicity using CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_622058]; 
quality  of life using  FACT -L and FACIT  Fatigue  Scale  at 3 month  intervals  until the time 
of systemic disease progression. In order to determine factors predictive of response to 
therapy, we will correlate the presence of response with radiotherapy variables (biologic 
effective dose, number of fractions, duration of radiotherapy, sequence of radiation and 
immune therapy), tumor variables (irradiated tumor site, size, histology, PD -L1 status, 
local response, extent of prior chemotherapy use), and patient variables (age, smoking 
status, and biologic correlates).  
 
1.3. Correlative  Objective(s)  
Peripheral blood samples will be collected before initiation of radiation therapy, at the 
time of t he first reimaging study, and with each subsequent change in response status to 
assess levels of circulating CD4+, CD8+ and Treg T -cell subsets, iNOS+/CD80+ 
macrophages, cytokines (HGF, TGF -β) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, 
CXCL11). We will also dete rmine changes of the circulating T -cells immune -repertoire 
(i-repertoire)  by [CONTACT_483979]3  region  of the T-cell 
receptor (TCR).  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Background  of Study  Disease  
An estimated  221,[ADDRESS_622059] common malignancy in men and women. It is also the leading cause of 
cancer death in the [LOCATION_002].1 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 
approximately three -fourths of new lung cancer diagnos es, the majority of which are 
locally advanced or metastatic at presentation. Patients with metastatic NSCLC often 
decline  relatively  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375],  with one-year overall  survival  on the order  of only 15-20%.[ADDRESS_622060] invasive organisms 
and diseases. However, a dysregulated immune response can also be detrimental in the 
form  of autoimmunity  or excessive  inflammation.  As such,  several  immune  checkpoi nts 
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/[ADDRESS_622061] emerged as a novel therapy for a 
variety of human malignancies.6-11 One well characterized checkpoint being targeted in 
metastatic NSCLC clinical trials is PD -1/PD -L1, with monoclonal antagonist antibody 
pharmaceuticals, such as Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Atezolizumab, resulting in 
respo nse rates  of 19-25% and median  response  duration  of 12.5-17.[ADDRESS_622062] been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration for treatment of advanced NSCLC in second line therapy and 
beyond. Pro mising clinical outcome data continue to emerge from clinical trial studies 
suggesting activities of PD -1 blockade in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 
mesothelioma as well.  
 
2.3. Rationale for Combining Radiation Therapy with Immune therapy  
While these finding s are encouraging, the fact that only a minority of patients will 
respond to checkpoint inhibitors alone highlights that other barriers to immune 
stimulation exist. Radiation therapy has been combined with immune therapy  to 
overcome  some  of these  barriers  in both preclinical  and clinical  studies.12-[ADDRESS_622063] an abscopal/systemic e ffect on cancer outside 
of the irradiated area.13-[ADDRESS_622064]  that a shorter  course  of hypofractionated  radiation  therapy  in 5 
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/[ADDRESS_622065].22 As such, for the 
purposes  of this study,  we will use a dose of 6-12Gy  per fraction  in 3 fractions  (total  dose 
18-36 Gy) or 4 -10 Gy per fraction in 5 fractions (total dose 20 -50 Gy) to be completed 
over the  course of  3-21 days. This variety of  regimens offers a biologically effective dose 
(BED) range of 28 -100 for early responding tissue (which correlates with tumor cont rol) 
and 47 -217 for late responding tissue (which correlates with side effects). This will give 
the treating physician a full range of options, such that an adequate dose can be given to 
the tumor while meeting all dose constraints of normal organs. The op timal 
hypofractionated radiation regimen is unknown, and there is some evidence that lower 
dose (and thus less ablative) regimens that would result in inferior local control may 
actually be more systemically immune -stimulating.[ADDRESS_622066] the favorable consequence of reducing 
the morbidity of therapy. Visceral metastases or metastases in organs involved in the 
immune system  (e.g. liver) will be targeted  preferentially over  bone metastases due to  the 
increased likelihood of an abscopal effect that has been previously reported for tumors in 
these  sites.13-14, [ADDRESS_622067] that treatme nt of multiple lesions with 
SBRT in the metastatic setting has a survival benefit in lung cancer,26 and scheduled 
radiation therapy has improved survival in other malignancies as well.27 
 
2.5. Background  and rationale  of correlative  studies  
In consenting patients, peripheral blood samples will also be collected at the time of any 
change in response status as assessed on follow -up imaging studies in order to correlate 
the biological effects of treatment to response, and potentially help charac terize optimal 
treatment delivery. Preclinical data suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors increase 
the quantity  of the activated  cytotoxic  T-cell subpopulation,  with a higher  CD8/Treg  ratio 
correlating with more robust immune activation.28-29 Additionally, M1/TH1 pro - 
inflammatory  iNOS+ macrophages  may also be recruited  to a tumor  and involved  in cell- 
killing in this clinical context.30-[ADDRESS_622068] erize  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021  
11  
  
levels of circulating CD4+, CD8+ and Treg T -cell subsets, as well as iNOS+/CD80+ 
macrophages. Changes in cytokine and chemokine levels specific for immune cell 
trafficking have not been  well studied  in patients receiving immune checkpo int inhibitors 
or radiation, so we will also evaluate for levels of circulating cytokines (HGF, TGF -β1, 
TGF -β2, TGF -β3) and chemokines (CCL2 for M1 macrophages, and CXCL9, CXCL10, 
and CXCL11  for T-cells).  Finally,  the clonality  and diversity  of the T-cell receptor  (TCR) 
CDR3 region may help determine the specific lung cancer antigens and host immune 
response that was triggered by [CONTACT_483980]. We will use next 
generation sequencing of  the circulating T -cells immune -repertoire (i -repertoire)  to better 
understand the evolution of tumor response during the course of treatment.  
 
 
3. STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1. Study  Design  
This will be a Phase II prospective non -randomized clinical trial, with the primary 
objective being to assess the efficacy  of combined checkpoint inhibitor immune therapy 
and hypofractionated radiation therapy in patients with Stage IV NSCLC. Toxicity is a 
secondary endpoint since the doses of radiotherapy to be used are within the realm of 
standard of care, and a vailable medical literature suggests that the combination of 
radiation therapy with various immunomodulatory agents does not lead to excessive 
safety issues that would warrant a Phase I study. 14, 20, 23, 32-37 Since there is limited 
prospective  clinical d ata on this approach in patients we felt that a randomized Phase III 
approach is not justifiable at present. Patients may be enrolled into this study before 
initiation  of immune  therapy  (with  radiation  administered  to one target  lesion,  starting  at 
any tim e between the first and second cycles of immune therapy).  
 
3.2. Number  of Subjects  
Approximately  [ADDRESS_622069]’s response to prior treatment. There is no 
specific maximum number of cycles of immune therapy if a patient continues to  respond 
to treatment, or courses of radiation therapy if a patient has persistent stable disease on 
imaging.  Progressive  disease  will be defined  per irRC  criteria  as assessed  by [CONTACT_483981] > [ADDRESS_622070] progression if clinically 
indicated.  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021  
12  
  
The radiation  therapy  or immune  therapy  may be cancelled  or discontinued  at any point  if 
no longer medically advisable due to intercurrent illness, toxicity/adverse event, decline 
in performance status, pregnancy, the best interests of the patient, or death. Subjects may 
also withdraw consent from treatment (partial consent) or from the study (full  consent).  
 
3.4. Duration  of Follow -Up 
Follow -up of subjects should continue for 30 days after systemic disease progression or 
initiation  of an alternate  systemic  therapy  (whichever  comes  first).  After  the study  period, 
the sponsor -investigator may still obtain data from a subject’s m edical records or by 
[CONTACT_483982]. Any adverse 
events experienced after a patient has discontinued the study treatment will be followed 
until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determin ed that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of 
the study period will necessitate follow -up to determine the final outcome. Any serious 
adverse  event  that occurs  after the study  period and is considered  to be possibly  related  to 
the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
3.5. Overall  Duration  of the Study  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF. The primary analysis will occur 
when  all subjects  have  completed  the surveillance  period  and the last subject  experiences 
progressive disease. Complete enrollment is expected over a [ADDRESS_622071] (IRB)/independent et hics 
committee  (IEC)  in writing  of the study's  completion  or early  termination,  send a copy  of 
the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain [ADDRESS_622072]’s 
eligibility.

• Serum  Creatinine  ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_622079]  from  study enrollment.  
 
  4.2.1 Subjects with active autoimmune disease (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, 
rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, or autoimmune 
vasculitis),  primary  immunodeficiency  syndrome,  HIV/AIDS,  or hepatitis  B or C. 
Acknowledgement of  any of these conditions is sufficient to exclude the patient 
from the study and no specific testing to exclude these conditions is required 
unless the patient expresses uncertainty about their presence.  
  4.2.2 Subjects with oral corticosteroid dependency . Use of immunosuppressive 
doses  of systemic  medications  within  7 days prior  to starting  study  drug.  Subjects 
are permitted to enroll if lower doses of systemic corticosteroids (< 10  mg/day

  4.2.3 Prior treatment with any antibody or drug targeting T -cell costimulat ion or 
immune checkpoint pathways (anti -PD-1, anti -PD-L1, anti -PD-L2, anti -CTLA -4, 
etc), or subjects  actively  receiving  any other  investigational  cancer -directed  agent, 
Interleukin -2, or immunosuppressive agents.  
  4.2.4  Subjects  with uncontrolled  or untre ated active  brain  metastases/CNS  disease 
will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and 
because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would 
confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients with 
previously treated brain metastases (by [CONTACT_483984]/or stereotactic 
radiosurgery) are eligible if the treatment was greater than [ADDRESS_622081]  any worsening  neurologic  symptoms. 
Of note, if  brain metastases develop  while the patient is enrolled on this study and 
they are treated, the patient may continue participation in this study at t he 
discretion of the treating physicians.  
  4.2.5 Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, 
ongoing  or active  infection,  symptomatic  congestive  heart  failure,  unstable  angina 
pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric  illness/social situations that would 
limit compliance with study requirements.

Virginia minority ethnic group (e.g., not limited to African American and Hispanic) 
population  is 3.6%  Black  (national  average  13.2%)  and 1.5%  Hispanic  (national  average 
17.4%). The majority of Black West Virginians live in the central and southern part  of 
the state and Gilmer County is the only county in WV whose Black population 
approaches the national average.

5. TREATMENT  PLAN  
5.1. Initial  Radiation  Therapy  
5.1.1 Dose -fractionation: The initial course of radiation therapy will be 
administered  in 3 or 5 fractions  over 3-21 days,  at a recommended  dose of 6-12 Gy per 
fraction for 3 total fractions (total dose 18 -36 Gy) or 4 -10 Gy per fraction for 5 total 
fractions (total dose 20 -50 Gy). Dose -fractionation schemes with a lower BED will be 
favored, with the exception of situations in which improved local control to p alliate 
symptoms is also a priority for a given patient. Higher BED regimens may also be 
considered for larger size tumors and more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_483962].  
5.1.2 Targeted Site: Visceral metastases or metastases in organs involved in the 
immune  system  (e.g. liver, lymph  nodes)  will be targeted  preferentially.  If a bone  or brain 
metastasis develops while the patient is enrolled in this trial and requires treatment for 
palliative purposes, we advise also treating a visceral metastasis.  
5.1.3 Radiotherapy Technique: Stereo tactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) will 
be the favored treatment delivery technique due to its high conformality to a target 
volume and avoidance of organs -at-risk (OAR) of toxicity. Other techniques, like 3 - 
dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) an d intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT), will be permitted with the caveat that the patient will, irrespective of technique, 
undergo CT simulation for treatment planning using SBRT immobilization devices, 
undergo daily image guidance to confirm the positioning of the tumor prior to treatment, 
and the plans  must  meet  standard  [ADDRESS_622084] and respi[INVESTIGATOR_483963].  
5.1.4 Treat ment Planning: All patients will undergo CT simulation using SBRT 
immobilization  devices.  Target  volumes  (i.e. GTV,  CTV,  ITV,  PTV)  will be delineated  at 
the discretion  of the treating  physician.  In general, minimal  or no margin  should  be added  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/[ADDRESS_622085] 6MV  will be used for 
all treatment plans. Ideally 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) should receive 
100% of the prescribed dose, and all OAR constraints detailed in Appendix B  must be 
achieved in order to minimize the risk of toxicity. In patients receiving multiple c ourses 
of radiation therapy, there will be an assumption of no tissue recovery, and the total dose 
to any organ  from  the sum of all radiotherapy  courses  will need  to achieve  the dose limits 
for a single course of hypofractionated radiation therapy as descr ibed in Appendix  B. 
5.1.5 Treatment Delivery: The thoracic radiation oncologist or his/her 
designated physician is required to be present at the console to review the daily CT and 
projection  images prior to each  treatment. A brief documentation of the patient se t up is 
required  in the treatment  monitoring  system  of each institution  by [CONTACT_56951].  
5.1.6 Coordination  of Radiation  with Immune  Therapy:  The first course  of 
radiation  will be initiated  at any time point  between  the date of cycle  [ADDRESS_622086]’s discretion, and include:  
- Nivolumab  240 mg once  every  2 weeks  (14 day cycle)  or 480 mg once  every  4 
weeks (28 day cycle)  
- Pembrolizumab  200 mg once  every  3 weeks  (21 day cycle)  
- Atezolizumab  1200 m g once  every 3  weeks  (21 day cycle)  
These agents should be continued per standard of care until either disease progression or 
unacceptable  toxicity.  In the case of Pembrolizumab,  it is also recommended  that patients 
should be on the drug for no more than [ADDRESS_622087]'s 
malignancy.  
 
5.3. Subsequent  Response -Adapted  Radiation  Therapy  
Any patient  who completes  the initial  course  of radiation  therapy  and continues  on one of 
the immune checkpoint inhibitors described above will be eligible for subsequent 
course(s) of radiation therapy to a different lesion that was not previously irradiated 
based on the results of follow -up imaging studies detailed below and in section 11.  
- Patients  with a partial  or complete  response  per irRC  criteria  will be observed 
without any further radiation therapy until progression.  
- Patients  with stable  disease  per irRC  criteria  will undergo  an additional  course  of 
radiation therapy given concurrentl y with the next cycle of immune  checkpoint  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/[ADDRESS_622088] 2 months after completion of the 
prior course of radiation therapy, but is left at the discretion of the treating 
physician depending on the patient’s palliative needs. Day 1 of radiation should 
be on Day 1 of the next cycle of immune therapy.  
- Patients  with progressive  disease  at any time per irRC  criteria  will undergo  a final 
course of radiation therapy. This may be given concurrently with a final cycle of 
immune therapy or as stand -alone treatment within 6 weeks after discontinuation 
of immune therapy but before an alternative systemic therapy is  initiated.  
Please see Se ction 5.5 below regarding situations in which these subsequent courses of 
radiation therapy may be withheld. Each subsequent course of radiation therapy should 
be given in a similar style as detailed for the initial course of radiation therapy above. In 
patients  with a mixed  response  to therapy,  preference  will be given  to an enlarging  tumor 
(rather than one that is stable or decreasing in size) as the site of treatment. Reimaging 
will again be obtained after completion of the radiation therapy with timing at the 
discretion  of the treating  physicians,  and the same  response -adapted  approach  to decision 
making for further courses of radiation therapy will be carried out as described above.  
 
5.4. General  Concomitant  Medications  and Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
product s, antibiotics,  antiemetics,  corticosteroids  (see section  6.2), etc when  appropriate.  
 
 
 
6. DOSE  DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
6.1. Radiation  Therapy  
A range  of dose-fractionation  schemes  is available  to the treating  radiation  oncologist  as 
part of this study.  Most  treated  lesions  will not require  deviations  in dose from  the stated 
ranges, with some exceptions:  
• Brain  metastases  that develop  while  the patient  is enrolled  in this study  may be 
treated with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or 3 Gy X 10 fractions  as 
indicated.  
• If only less conformal techniques are available to a patient for the treatment of 
vertebral  lesions  and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_483964],  lower 
dose regimens of [ADDRESS_622089]  of care. All dose 
modifications or missed treatments should be recorded for analysis but no specific dose 
modification parameters will be used since the immune therapy is not the experimental 
component in this study. For treatment of moderate or severe immune r elated adverse  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021  
18  
  
events (irAEs), we advise interruption of the checkpoint inhibitor and the use of 
corticosteroid immunosuppression. For grade 2 (moderate) immune -mediated toxicities, 
treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor should be withheld and should not be resumed 
until symptoms or toxicity is grade 1 or less. Prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day or equivalent 
should be started if symptoms do not resolve within a week. For grade 3 or 4 (severe or 
life-threatening) immune -mediated toxicities, treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor 
should be permanently discontinued. Prednisone 1 -2 mg/kg/day or equivalent should be 
given  immediately.  When  symptoms  subside  to grade  [ADDRESS_622090] one month. If symptoms do not im prove within 3 days of starting 
steroids, administer infliximab 5 mg/kg (may repeat 2 weeks later if no improvement in 
symptoms). If the immune therapy is withheld for a period of greater than 14 days at a 
time when a course of radiation therapy was planne d to be given, the course of radiation 
therapy may be initiated prior to resuming the immune therapy.  
 
 
7. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
7.1. Definitions  
7.1.1.  Adverse  Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended event, physical or 
psychological, associated with a research study, which causes harm or injury to a  
research participant as a result of the participant’s involvement in a research study. The 
event  can include  abnormal  laboratory  findings,  symptoms,  or disease  associated  with the 
research  study.  The event  does not necessarily  have  to have  a causal  relationship  with the 
research, any risk associated with the research, the research intervention, or the research 
assessments.  
 
Adverse events may be the result of the interventions and interactions used in the 
research;  the collection of  identifiable private information in the research;  an underlying 
disease,  disorder,  or condition  of the subject;  and/or  other  circumstances  unrelated  to the 
research or any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject; and/or other 
circumstances  unrelated  to the research  or any underlying  disease,  disorder,  or condition 
of the subject.  
 
7.1.2.  Serious  Adverse  Events  
Serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  or serious  suspected  adverse  reaction : An adverse  event 
or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  “serious”  if, in the view  of the investigator  or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
 
• A life-threatening adverse experience. The term life -threatening in the 
definition of serious refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at 
immediate  risk of death  at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an adverse 
event which in a more severe form might have caused death.  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021  
19  
 • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] . Any adverse  event  leading  to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483965], UNLESS at least one of the 
following expectations is met:  
o The admission  results  in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154075]  24 hours  OR 
o The admission  is pre-planned  (e.g.,  elective  or scheduled  surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study) OR  
o The admission  is not associated  with an adverse  event  (e.g.,  social 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933].  
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483966] “medically  important”  and as such may be reportable  as 
a serious adverse event dependent on clinical judgment. In addition where local 
regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local 
regulation takes precedent.  
 
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct life’s normal functions.  
 
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
 
• Is an important  medical  event . Important  medical  events  that may not result 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a 
serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of t he outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
o Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive  treatment in an emergency room  or at home, blood 
disease or disorders, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
The development of a new cancer is always considered an important 
medical event.  
 
7.2. Adverse  Event  Evaluation  
The investigator or designee is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (both 
serious and non -serious) observed by [CONTACT_483987]’s 
medical records. Source documentation must be available to support all adverse events. 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the subject to 
withdraw  from  the study,  requiring  treatment  or causing  apparent  clinica l manifestations, 
result in a delay or dose modification of study treatment, or judged relevant by [CONTACT_1275]), should be reported as an adverse event.  
The investigator  or sub-investigator  (treating  physician  if applicable)  will provide  the 
following  for all adverse events (both serious and non -serious):  
• Event  term (as per CTCAE  version  4.0) 
• Description  of the event  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021  
20  
 • Date  of onset  and resolution  
• Expectedness  of the toxicity  
• Grade  of toxicity  
• Attribution  of relatedness  to the investigational  agent - (this  must  be assigned 
by [CONTACT_2413], sub -investigator, or treating physician)  
• Action taken as a result  of the event, including but not limited to; no changes, 
dose interrupted,  reduced,  discontinued,  etc. or action  taken  with regard  to the 
event, i.e. no action, received con -med or other intervention, etc.  
• Outcome  of event  
 
The most  common  adverse  event  from  the short  courses  of focal  radiation  therapy  used in this study  will 
be fatigue. This may be accompanied by [CONTACT_483988], changes in taste, or weight loss. Since 
radiation is a focal, localized treatment to a specific targeted tumor, the likelihood of all other side 
effects is dependent on the part of the body th at is treated, as described in the table below. Unknown 
side effects  may also arise due to  the combination of  radiation therapy  and immunotherapy in  this study.

7.2.1.  Adverse  Event  Grading  
Descriptions  and grading  scales  found  in the NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 will be utilized for AE reporting.  
 
Grade  Description  
 
0 No AE (or within  normal  limits).  
 
1 Mild ; asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 
2 Moderate ; minimal,  local  or noninvasive  intervention  (e.g.,  packing 
cautery) indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities 
of daily living (ADL).  
 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life - 
threatening;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483967]; di sabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 
4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
 
[ADDRESS_622091].  The event  is usually  listed  in the Investigator  Brochure,  consent  form  or research 
protocol.  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/[ADDRESS_622092].  
 
Attribution  is the relationship  between  an adverse  event  or serious  adverse  event  and the 
study treatment. For the purposes of this study, adverse events may be differentiated as a 
radiation -induced AE or an immune -related AE (irAE). Attribution will be assigned as 
follows:  
 
• Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study  drug.  
• Probable  – The AE is likely related  to the study  drug.  
• Possible  – The AE may be related  to the study  drug.  
• Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully  related  to the study  drug.  
• Unrelated  – The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  drug.  
 
Protocol  must  specify  if attribution  is required  for individual  components  of the treatment 
regimen or the treatment regimen as a whole.  
 
7.3. Adverse  Event  Reporting  Procedures  
 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with 
immune therapy . It is the responsibility of all investigators to assess AEs during the 
subject’s participation in the study. Subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_622093] be 
documented in the study database/case report forms (OnCore or other PRMC approved 
database), subject’s medical records, and as required per additional instituti onal 
standards.  Source  documentation  must  be available  to support  all reported  adverse  events.  
 
A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the subject to 
withdraw  from  the study),  requiring  treatment  or causing  apparent  clinical  manifestations, 
or judged relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an adverse event.  
 
This protocol will use the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE)  version  4.0 available  at http://ctep.cancer.gov  for adverse  event  reporting.  
 
7.4. Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  Procedures  
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE)  requiring  expedited  reporting  within  24 hours  will also be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_483989]. For immune -related SAE’s attributed 
to FDA approved standard of care immune therapy, FDA MedWatch will be used only 
for unexpected related events (not on package insert). All serious adverse events due to 
radiation therapy will be reported int o OnCore and internally reviewed. All subsequent 
SAE documentation will be submitted to the DSTC once available. The DSTC will 
determine if further action is required.  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021

9. CORRELATIVE  STUDIES  
9.1. Correlative  Study  #1 
Use flow cytometry  to characterize  levels  of circulating  CD4+,  CD8+  and Treg  T-cell 
subsets, as well as iNOS+/CD80+ macrophages in peripheral blood samples.  
 
9.1.1.  Background  
Preclinical data suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors increase the quantity of the 
activated cytotoxic T -cell subpopulation, with a higher CD8/Treg ratio correlating with 
more robust immune activation.28-29 Additionally, M1/TH1 pro -inflammatory 
iNOS+ /CD80+  macrophages  may also be recruited  to a tumor  and involved  in cell-killing 
in this clinical context.30-[ADDRESS_622099]  the potential  to help

better  determine  which  patients  will benefit  from  therapy.  The data from  these  correlative 
studies will be used as part of a univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to 
assess the association between response to treatment and several variables related to the 
radiotherapy, tumor, and patient characteristics.  
 
9.1.3.  Collection  of Specimens  
After consenting patients, peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline before 
initiation of treatment and at the time of any change in response status as assessed on 
follow -up imaging studies. All attempts will be made to draw the blood with cur rently 
scheduled  venipuncture,  but it will also be permissible  to draw  specifically  for this study 
if necessary.  
 
9.1.4.  Handling  of Specimens  
Approximately 10 -16 mL of blood will be obtained from the patient in two 10 ml EDTA 
(purple top) tube. These tubes of bl ood will serve as the specimen for both correlative 
study  #1 and #2. In order  to facilitate  the subsequent  analyses  all research  samples  will be 
collected on Monday -Thursday from 8:00am -3:00pm. Specimens will be put on ice after 
collection and transported to the Biospecimen Processing Core Laboratory (Room 1826 
MBRCC) within 30 minutes of acquisition. All subsamples will be labeled with only the

9.2. Correlative  Study  #2 
Evaluate levels of circulating cytokines (HGF, TGF -β1, TGF -β2, TGF -β3) and 
chemokines  (CCL2  for M1 macrophages,  and CXCL9,  CXCL10,  and CXCL11  for T- 
cells).  
 
9.2.1.  Background  
Immune cell  infiltration into malignant tumors is thought to be an important component 
of a patient having a response immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiation, however, 
mechanisms of T -cell and macrophage trafficking have not been well studied in patients 
receiving  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  or radiation.  Changes  in cytokine  and chemokine 
levels specific for T -cells and macrophages may correlate with levels of circulating 
immune cells and tumor response to therapy.  
 
9.2.2.  Rationale  for Analysis  
As above, biomarkers predictive of response to immune therapy are currently not well 
develope d. Levels  of circulating  cytokines  and chemokines  for T-cells and macrophages 
before  and during  therapy  have  the potential  to help better  determine  which  patients  will 
benefit from therapy. The data from these correlative studies will be used as part of a 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression model to assess the association between  
WVU010516

 response  to treatment  and several  variables  related  to the radiotherapy,  tumor,  and patient 
characteristics  
 
 
9.2.3.  Collection  of Specimens  
After consenting patients, peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline before 
initiation of treatment and at the time of any change in response status as assessed on 
follow -up imaging studies. All attempts will be made to draw the blood with cur rently 
scheduled  venipuncture,  but it will also be permissible  to draw  specifically  for this study 
if necessary.  
 
9.2.4.  Handling  of Specimens  
Approximately 10 -16 mL of blood will be obtained from the patient in two 10 ml EDTA 
(purple top) tubes. These tubes of b lood will serve as the specimen for both correlative 
study  #1 and #2. In order  to facilitate  the subsequent  analyses  all research  samples  will be 
collected on Monday -Thursday from 8:00am -3:00pm. Specimens will be put on ice after  
collection and transported  to the Biospecimen Processing Core Laboratory (Room 1826 
MBRCC)  within  30 minutes  of acquisition.  All subsamples  will be labeled  with only the 
following: patient research ID (obtained from the PI/study coordinator), date/time of 
collection, type of sample. The labeled sample for correlative study #1 and #[ADDRESS_622102]. Tim Eubank (HSC 5602) for furt her 
processing and analysis.  
 
9.2.5.  Analytical  Laboratory  
The specimens will be processed and analyzed in Health Sciences Center (HSC) 
laboratory 5602, under the direction of [CONTACT_484005]. [CONTACT_484006] and his personnel 
will provide technical support for the iso lation of  both the serum  and cellular component 
of the samples,  and provide  overall  guidance  in experimental  design  and interpretation  of 
results.  
 
9.2.6.  Methods  
In our sterile  biosafety  cabinet  in lab 5602  HSC,  patient  whole  blood  will be diluted  1:2 
with steri le phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The mixture will be layered atop 15 mL 
Ficoll and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 20 minutes (no break). After, the serum will be 
collected from the top layer and aliquoted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and frozen at - 
80C unt il further analysis for cytokines/chemokines by [CONTACT_483990].  
 
Determination  of chemokines  in plasma:  
An aliquot (100 L in duplicate) of patient serum will be thawed form -80C storage and 
subjected to ELISA analysis specific for human CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 
(R&D  Systems, Duoset  Kits)  as described  by [CONTACT_3455].  Validity  of the assay:  We 
will be using standa rd “sandwich” ELISA kits sold by R&D Systems, Inc. Each kit is 
built specifically for the detection of human CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 
from cell supernatants, homogenized tissue extract, plasma, and serum. The kit is 
composed of a specific monoclonal  “capture” antibodies for the protein of interest. After 
incubation  of the sample  and binding,  a polyclonal  “detection”  antibody  is incubated  with 
the sample followed by a signaling molecule that allows for detection. A standard curve  
is generated using re combinant protein for quantitative comparison. These samples will 
be run in duplicate and averaged to minimize error. This is a well -accepted and highly - 
published method in the literature.

scheduled  venipuncture,  but it will also be permissible  to draw  specifically  for this study 
if necessary.  
 
9.3.4.  Handling  of Specimens  
Separately from the blood collected for correlative studies #1 and #2, approximately 7 -8 
mL of blood will be obtained from the patient in one 10 ml EDTA (purple top) tube for 
correlative study #3. Specimens will be put on ice after collection and transport ed to the 
Biospecimen Processing Core Laboratory (Room 1826 MBRCC) within 30 minutes of 
acquisition. All subsamples will be labeled with only the following: patient research ID

11.1.1.  Imaging  Modalities  
At baseline and follow -up, systemic response (for unirradiated lesions) and local 
response  (for irradiated  lesions)  will be assessed  using  FDG -PET/CT  (preferred)  or CT 
scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. Ideally IV contrast and CT slice thickness < 5mm 
will be used  for either type of study. Images will be acquired  according to  the standard 
of care schedule  used for patients  receiving  immune  checkpoint  therapy,  at interv als of 
[ADDRESS_622113] 
millimeter. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_147877](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_119382].  
11.1.2.  Definition s 
Evaluable for objective response:  Only those patients who have received at least one 
course  of radiation  therapy,  and have  had their disease  re-evaluated  by [CONTACT_483991] 
[ADDRESS_622114] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
 
Immune -Related Response Criteria (irRC)43-44: Novel criteria for the evaluation of 
antitumor responses with immunotherapeutic agents, as described in Wolchok et al. 
The patterns of response to immune therapy agents differ from those of cytotoxic 
therapy in several ways: There may be a transient wors ening of disease before 
stabilization or regression, responses can take months to become apparent and may 
continue long after completion of the initial therapy, and prolonged periods of stable 
disease  are common.  For the purposes  of this study,  irRC  will be used for evaluation  of 
all non-irradiated index lesions and the unit of measure will be the sum of the 
products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) for all index lesions.  
 
Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  Version  1.145: Method  for the 
evaluation  of antitumor  responses  to cytotoxic  agents,  as described  by [CONTACT_46453]. 
For the purposes of  this study, RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_622115] diameter.  
 
Measurable  lesions  on initial  imaging:  Measurable  malignant  lesions  on initial  imaging 
are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as ≥10 
mm (≥1.0 cm) with CT or PET/CT scan. Lymph nodes will be considered malignant 
(and thus measurable lesions) if their short axis is ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) by [CONTACT_3610]. All 
other lesions will be consi dered non -measureable disease. Bone lesions without a soft

tissue component, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pneumonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by C T or MRI), are considered non -measurable. Simple cysts are by 
[CONTACT_483992]-malignant  and non-measureable,  but cystic  metastases  can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the size cutoff of measurability described above.  
Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  areas  are not considered 
measurable.  
 
Measureable  lesions  on follow -up imaging:  Per irRC  specifications,  new measureable 
lesions on follow -up imaging will be defined as being > 5 x 5 mm in size  
 
Index lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 10 visceral lesions ( < 5 per 
organ)  and 5 cutaneous  lesions,  should  be identified  as index  lesions  and recorded  and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case tha t, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected. It is preferable to exclude cystic metastases as index lesions if other  non- 
cystic lesions are available. Prior to selecting index lesions a decision should be made 
on which lesion will receive an initial course of radiation therapy, as this lesion is not 
eligible to be considered as an index lesion to assess response to imm une therapy. If 
any subsequent course(s) of radiation therapy are given to what was previously 
considered  an index  lesion,  this lesion  will no longer  be considered  an index  lesion  for 
subsequent systemic response assessment. The rationale for this is that including 
irradiated lesions in response assessment would bias the assessment of a systemic 
effect.  
Tumor Burden:  At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the t wo 
largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all index lesions is calculated. At each 
subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable 
lesions  are added  together  to provide  the total tumor  burden:  Tumor  Burden  = SPD index 
lesions + SPD new,  measurable  lesions. 
 
11.2. Response  Criteria  
The irRC  criteria  for assessing  systemic  disease  response  (including  only non-irradiated 
lesions) can be seen in the following table:  
New,  measurable  lesions 
(ie, > 5 x 5 mm)  Incorporated  into tumor  burden  
New,  non-measurable  lesions 
(ie, < 5 x 5 mm)  Do not define  progression  (but preclude  irCR)  
Non-index  lesions  Contribute  to defining  irCR  (complete  disappearance 
required)  
irCR  Disappearance  of all lesions  in two consecutive  observations 
at least 4 weeks apart  
irPR  > 50% decrease  in tumor  burden  compared  with baseline  in 
two observations at least 4 weeks apart  
irSD  Neither  sufficient  decrease  in tumor  burden  to qualify  as irPR 
WVU010516

 nor sufficient  increase  in tumor  burden  to qualify  as irPD.  
 
irPD  > 25% increase  in tumor burden  compared  with nadir  (at any 
single  time point)  in two consecutive  observations  at least 4 
weeks apart.  
 
Examples  of irRC  overall  response37: 
 
RECIST  version  1.[ADDRESS_622116] diameter:  
Complete  Response 
(CR)  Disappearance  of the irradiated  lesion  
Partial  Response 
(PR)  > 30% decrease  in the single largest  diameter  of the irradiated  lesion  
Stable  Disease 
(SD)  Neither  sufficient  decrease  in diameter  to qualify  as PR nor 
sufficient increase in diameter to qualify as PD  
Progressive  Disease 
(PD)  > 20% increase in the single largest diameter of the irradiated  
lesion.  In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm).  
 
 
11.2.1.  Best Overall  Response  
The best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response 
assignment  will depend  on the achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation 
criteria.  
 
11.2.2.  Progression -Free  Survival  
The duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. For those patients with a CR or PR, the reference for 
progre ssive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started).  
 
11.2.3.  Response  Review  
All responses  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_483993]/or  radiation  oncologist  at 
the study’s completion, with simultaneous review of the patients’ files a nd

12.2.5.  Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Plan 
This protocol  will adhere  to the policies  of the WVU  Mary  Babb  Randolph  Cancer 
Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 
13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Study  Design/Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is the best overall response rate (complete and partial) after the 
initial course of radiation therapy with concurrent immune therapy. The secondary 
objectives  include  determination  of the progress ion-free and overall  survival  at 1 year, 
toxicity, and quality of life. Correlative objectives include an assessment of levels of 
circulating CD4+, CD8+ and Treg T -cell subsets, iNOS+ macrophages, and the 
chemokines CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in relat ion to clinical response.  
 
13.2. Sample  Size/Accrual  Rate  
The primary analysis will be for patients enrolled at time -points (A) and (B) above, 
whereas  patients  enrolled  at time-point  (C) will be included  in observational  analysis  only 
(see section 3.1). The prim ary endpoint of this study is the overall response rate  
(complete + partial response) and the efficacy will be assessed using the Simon’s two - 
stage Minmax design. A sample size of 33 patients is chosen to differentiate between the 
response rate of 20% and  40% with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05. In 
particular, [ADDRESS_622119] disease progression prior to any response, the trial will be terminated; 
otherwise an additiona l [ADDRESS_622120] 
80% power to detect a 50% change/difference on biomarker data between response and 
non-response groups using a two -sided two -sample t -test at 0.05 significance  
level,  assuming  that the response  rate is 35% or higher  and the coefficient  of variation 
(CV) of biomarkers is 0.45.  
 
Approximately [ADDRESS_622121]  to baseline  characteristics  and safety  measurements 
using descriptive statistics (quantitative data) and contingency tables (qualitative data).  
The safety analysis will consist of AE summaries (frequency tables based on CTCAE 
grades)  and laboratory  abnormalities  summary.  For the primary  endpoin t, the response 
rate and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated with a binomial distribution.  
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression model will be used to assess the 
association  between  response  and several  radiotherapy  variables  (biologic  effective  dose,  
WVU010516  
Version  Date:  09/09/2021

number of lesions treated, sequence of radiation and immune therapy), tumor variables 
(irradiated  tumor  site, size, growth  rate, histology,  PD-L1 status,  local  response,  extent  of 
prior chemotherapy use, and biologic correlates), and patient variables (age, smoking 
status, and other factors associated with secondary immunode ficiency). A predictive 
nomogram for response will be developed based on the outcome of the multivariate 
analysis. In the data analysis on the secondary endpoints, the Kaplan -Meier method will 
be used to estimate overall survival and progression -free survi val. Wilcoxon signed -rank 
test for paired  data will be used to assess  the change  of quality  of life scores  between  two 
visits. Since the lung cancer score (LCS) of the FACT -L focuses on lung cancer 
symptoms, this will be used for the primary QOL endpoint; however, the more general 
subscales  of physical  and functional  well-being  on the Trial  Outcome  Index  (FACT -TOI) 
will also be collected. A difference of 3 LCS points will be considered clinically 
significant.12-13 Where  applicable,  comparison  will be made  to previous  randomized  trials 
assessing immune checkpoint inhibitors alone in a comparable patient population.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Background 
One of the original limitations of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was 
restenosis, which occurred in 20% to 40% of patients.2,3 The loss of luminal diameter resulting in 
restenosis is primarily due to 2 mechanisms: elastic recoil of the vessel and neointimal hyperplasia. 
Coronary stenting reduced restenosis compared to balloon angioplasty alone by [CONTACT_864065].4,5 However, stents still provoke increased neointimal hyperplasia with a consequent 
incidence of late luminal loss.6,7 New bare-metal stent (BMS) designs with thinner struts are 
associated with restenosis rates around 12% to 15% in patients undergoing single-vessel revascularization and higher rates of restenosis in longer lesions, smaller vessels, multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, and in patients with a diagnosis of diabetes. Adjunct therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, pharmacological therapy, coronary radiation, and coronary debulking) do 
not reduce restenosis more than stent placement alone. 
Localized drug elution, in particular of - limus drug analogues, from stents coated with polymer 
loaded with inhibitory drugs has further reduced restenosis rates compared to bare metal platforms. 
A substantial body of evidence has emerged demonstrating that local delivery of cell cycl e 
inhibitors from the stent surface dramatically reduces neointimal hyperplasia and subsequent restenosis. The longest historical data available are with stents using the drug sirolimus. More than a decade ago,  Sousa, et al.
8,9 reported the safety and feasibility of a sirolimus-eluting stent; in this 
cohort of [ADDRESS_1204879] myocardial infarction (MI) (unrelated to the target lesion), 1 coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292] (CABG) for an ostial left circumflex coronary artery progression, and 1 target-vessel revascularization (TVR) for lesion progression. Follow-up extended up to 39 months demonstrated 
that no new events had occurred. Event-free (death, MI, CABG, repeat PTCA) survival at 
[ADDRESS_1204880]- in-man patients was 90.1%. 
In the SIRolImUS-Eluting Stent in De Novo Native Coronary Lesions (SIRIUS) trial, 556 patients were randomized to receive the sirolimus-eluting Cypher
® stent and 545 to receive a bare metal 
Bx Velocity stent. Mean follow-up minimal luminal diameter on angiography was significantly different at 2.50 mm in the sirolimus group and 1.68 mm in the control. This led to a 10.5% mean diameter stenosis at follow-up vs 40.1% for the control group and a late loss reduction from 1.00 mm in the control to 0.17 mm in the sirolimus group. In-segment restenosis occurred in 8.9% of the sirolimus group and in 36.3% of the control group (p < 0.001). Stent thrombosis occurred in 2 patients (0.4%) in the sirolimus arm and in 4 patients (0.8%) in the control arm. The primary 
endpoint, target-vessel failure (TVF), was reduced by 59%, from 21.0% in the control group to 8.6% in the sirolimus group.
10,11 
While drug-eluting stents (DESs) have decreased the rates of in-stent restenosis compared with BMSs,
12,[ADDRESS_1204881]-elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI), and death were widely reported in 200614,[ADDRESS_1204882] led to 
extended use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) despi[INVESTIGATOR_864017]. Mechanisms associated with stent thrombosis, in addition to early interruption of DAPT, include strut malapposition or fracture, inhibition of endothelial cell recovery by [CONTACT_490700] (mTor) inhibitors or paclitaxel, and persistent 
OrbusNeich Medical  Protocol 
HARMONEE  Protocol Number: VP-0601  
 
Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, [ADDRESS_1204883] of all of these 
mechanis ms is a thrombotic nidus consisting of incomplete reendothelialization within the stented 
segment, ie, the failed recovery of healthy neointima within the stented site.14,16– 18  
Thus, while effectiveness of DES platforms has reduced restenosis to less than 10%, concerns with 
late and very late stent thrombosis with these permanent coronary implants has led to a focus on 
long-term safety of these permanent implants in more than [ADDRESS_1204884] focused on 
design features intended to augment safety without negating current high levels of effectiveness. 
A number of engineering modifications emerged in second-generation DES platforms, including 
the selection of more inert, biocompatible durable polymers (Endeavor, Endeavor Resolute, 
Xience V) and bioabsorbable polymers applied only to the abluminal stent surface (Nobori, 
Biomatrix, Combo ).[ADDRESS_1204885]-generation DES platforms showed inferior late loss but noninferior clinical outcomes and 
superior safety (stent thrombosis) over 3-year follow up.22–[ADDRESS_1204886]-generation DESs in multiple independent cohorts showed superior clinical outcomes 
and superior safety 3 to 5 years after PCI.25–27 
Even with such improved outcomes, stent thrombosis rates of 0.3% to 0.6% per year over a 
pa
tient's lifetime and the use of prolonged DAPT following more than 1 million stent procedures 
performed per year remains significant unmet clinical challenges. Dual antiplatelet therapy for 
12 months or longer results in bleeding complications as well as elevated costs of care associated 
with 
PCI. Finally, the histopathological trauma associated with stent implantation continues to 
generate early stent thrombosis events at a rate of about 0.9% to 1.3% in the first [ADDRESS_1204887] demonstrated. 
Ne
w design features include DES platforms that do not use polymer at all; DES platforms that are 
completely made of bioabsorbable polymer; new metal alloys that support thinner struts but are 
resistant to strut fracture; and technologies designed to enhance the speed, completeness, and 
qua
lity of reendothelialization following PCI. Of all currently advancing, safety-oriented designs , 
the 
OrbusNeich Medical Combo stent  (Identification Mark: OMKK02 in Japan), combining 
abluminal only, bioabsorbable polymer with CD34 endothelial progenitor cells (EPC s)-capture 
technologies represents a unique potential to advance both short- and long-term safety with PCI.  
B
one marrow-derived EPCs circulate in the peripheral blood and migrate to areas of vascular 
injury. It is hypothesized that the EPCs differentiate into mature endothelial cells, contributing to 
the vascular repair and formation of a functional endothelium.28,29 
The ability to capture circulating EPCs was demonstrated by [CONTACT_864066]™ Endothelial Progenitor 
Cell Capturing Stent (OrbusNeich Medical Technologies, FL), a bare-metal stainless-steel stent 
coated with antihuman CD34+ antibodies that bind circulating EPCs. In animal studies, a rapid 
enhancement of EPCs binding to the stent struts was observed, and a confluent monolayer of 
adherent CD34+ cells was approached after 60 minutes of incubation.30 In humans, the safety and 
e
fficacy of the bare-metal EPC-capturing stent was demonstrated in the nonrandomized Healthy 
OrbusNeich Medical  Protocol

Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, [ADDRESS_1204888] in Man (HEALING-FIM) 
study,[ADDRESS_1204889]- in-Man study included 16 patients. At the 9-month clinical follow-up, the 
c
omposite of cardiac death, stroke, MI, and TVR was 6.3%, and no cases of stent thrombosis were 
reported. In the nonrandomized HEALING II study, 63 patients with noncomplex lesions were 
enrolled. At the 18-month clinical follow-up, no stent thrombosis was observed, and the composite 
of 
cardiac death, MI, and target-lesion revascularization (TLR) was 7.9%, mainly attributed to a 
relatively low (for a BMS platform) clinically driven TLR rate of 6.3%. In a subsequent single-
center registry of 405 unselected patients treated percutaneously with the Genous bare-metal/EPC-
capturing stent,33 the primary endpoint, defined as the composite of cardiac death, MI, and TLR at 
1 year, was 13.3%, mainly attributable to TLR, which was 10.9%—again, relatively encouraging 
for
 a BMS platform. The occurrence of definite and probable stent thrombosis was low, 0.5% and 
0.7%, 
respectively. The data available today suggest that the use of the EPC-capturing stent 
technology is safe and that the results from nonrandomized trials can be replicated in patients with 
a variety of clinical and angiographic characteristics. 
The OrbusNeich Combo platform advances this experience with CD34Ab on a bare-metal 
platform to the use of this technology in a safety-oriented (abluminal, bioabsorbable polymer) DES 
using sirolimus, the -limus analogue with the longest-standing experience in coronary stenting 
worldwide. In the REMEDEE study, Combo randomized 2:[ADDRESS_1204890] TAXUS in 183 patients 
showed noninferior late loss, restenosis, and clinical outcomes (see Figure 1, Ta ble 1, and T able

The Combo stent, along with the constituent components of polymer-matrix and immobilized antibodies applied to stents, has been found to be well tolerated in preclinical implant studies. Further, the Combo stent 
has been shown in preclinical implant studies to be efficacious in sustained drug delivery to the 
local implant site tissue through PK studies, in controlling neointimal proliferation, and in 
enhancing reendothelialization of implanted stents. 
In the preclinical studies, the Combo stent demonstrated significantly lower neointimal 
hyperplasia, while also showing improved endothelial coverage relative to other commercially available DESs. There was also a noticeably lower presence of inflammation and foreign-body reaction. Thus, the Combo stent appeared effective at inhibition of neointimal growth while enhancing endothelial coverage. These features might potentially result in low rates of in-stent

 28 restenosis comparable to those of commercially available DESs and in reduced rates of late stent 
thrombosis. 
 Clinical Experience with Study Device 
The study device has been previously evaluated in a Prospective, Randomized Study to Evaluate 
the Safety and Effectiveness of an AbluMinal Sirolimus CoatED Bio-Engineered StEnt (Combo Bio-Engineered Sirolimus Eluting Stent) Compared with a TAXUS
® Liberté® Stent Control Arm 
for Treatment of Stenotic Lesions in Native Coronary Arteries (REMEDEE) trial. This study randomized 183 patients in a 2:1 fashion to Combo or T AXUS  Liberté stents. 
In the 12-month follow-up data set, the clinically driven target-lesion failure (TLF) rate was 8.9% for patients treated with the Combo stent, compared with 10.2% for those treated with the TAXUS stent. Clinically driven TLF was defined as a composite of death, MI, and clinically driven TLR. In addition, the rate of clinically driven TLR was 4.9% for patients treated with the Combo stent, 
compared with 8.5% for those treated with the TAXUS stent. There was no stent thrombosis in 
either of the groups. 
 Rationale 
This study is intended to demonstrate that the Combo stent platform shows superiority to an imputed BMS performance goal, noninferior effectiveness and safety vs best- in-class second-
generation everolimus-eluting stent (EES) (Xience V, Xience Prime, Xience Xpedition, Xience Alpi[INVESTIGATOR_864018] ; [Abbott Vascular/Abbott Vascular Japan]), and evidence of mechanistic activity of 
the anti-CD34-Ab EPC capture technology with healthy level of intimal tissue coverage superior to that of the best- in-class EES.  
To ensure the robustness and interpretability of results, the current proposal includes a number of unique design features: 
 Largest randomized DES study ever performed in Japan 
 Enriched population, including stabilized non-STEMI (NSTEMI) subjects with greater 
likelihood of plaque rupture associated with their clinical syndromes 
 Collaboration between with Japan and the [LOCATION_002] as a “Proof of Concept” program under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_864019], WG 1, including concomitant 
enrollment in U.S. A. sites as an FDA-approved IDE study 
 Head -to-head randomization against state-of-the-art EES platform control, analyzed for 
clinical noninferiority 
 Statistical analysis vs imputed BMS analyzed for clinical superiority 
 Fractional flow reserve ( FFR) follow-up of 100% of subjects enrolled, providing clinically 
relevant physiologic assessment of all subjects for 1-year ischemia-driven TVR analysis 
 Mechanistic OCT imaging observations in 140 subjects using 6 French catheters as 
follows: 
o Cohort A (30 subjects, 1:1 Combo and EES) : Mechanistic imaging observations to 
provide serial 6-month and 1-year OCT evaluation of healthy intimal tissue 
coverage, intracoronary thrombosis, and stent malapposition and quantitative coronary angiographic (QCA) analysis to assess 1-year late loss.

C
ombined with the 12-month imaging of Cohort A, this study will provide OCT 
and QCA observations at 1 year in 140 patients, half with Combo and half with 
EES.  
 I n the [ADDRESS_1204893] s in Cohort B, baseline, 30-day and 1-year human antimurine antibody

EES considered mechanistically related to the activity of anti-CD34 Ab EPC capture and 
analyzed in an independent, blinded core laboratory (Cohorts A and B combined) 


 Evaluation of angiographic late lumen loss at 1 year (Cohorts A and B combined) 
 To assess the safety of Combo by [CONTACT_864067] 1 year (Cohorts A and B combined) 
 Serial observation of both Combo and EES at 6 and 12 months in the same patients (Cohort 
A) 
 To assess the change in HAMA plasma levels at 30-day and 1-year follow-ups compared with baseline 
 Comparable rates of death, MI, and stent thrombosis at 1 year

 STUDY DESIGN 
This study will be conducted in accordance with current Ministerial Ordinance on Good Clinical 
Practice for Medical Devices. Ordinance of the Ministry of Health and Welfare No. 36 (J-GCP) 
(Japan) guidelines, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on GCP (ICH E6, the principles of which have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki), and all other applicable national and local laws and regulations. 
 Overview of Study 
This is a multi-center, single-blind, randomized, active-controlled, clinical trial in PCI subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive the Combo stent as the investigational treatment arm or an  
EES as the active-control arm, in a noninferiority study.  
Up to 50 sites are proposed in Japan and the [LOCATION_002] to enroll 286 subjects (271 evaluable) 
in each of 2 arms, for a total sample size of 572 subjects (542 evaluable) who are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a planned (elective and urgent) percutaneous coronary artery intervention procedure . 
Investigators must declare an intended oral antiplatelet regimen and intended duration of anti-platelet therapy before randomization; postprocedure, subjects will receive aspi[INVESTIGATOR_864021] P2Y12 inhibition for a minimum of 6 months (12 months for acute coronary syndrome [ACS] diagnosis), according to recommended regional standards of care. After stent implantation, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_51095]-up at 30 days; 6 months; and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. A t 
12 months a clinical evaluation will be completed before cardiac catheterization and angiographic assessment.  
There will be 3 consecutively enrolled cohorts of study subjects: 
1. Cohort A: 30 subjects (15 subjects per arm) will undergo all clinical follow-up assessments; 
receive OCT and angiographic assessments at 6 months; and receive OCT, FFR, and QCA 
assessments at [ADDRESS_1204906] cohort to enroll.  
2. Cohort B: 110 subjects (55 subjects per arm) will undergo all clinical follow- up 
assessments, with OCT, FFR, and QCA assessments at 12 months after device implantation. Cohort B will be the second cohort to enroll.   
3. Cohort C: 432 subjects (216 subjects per arm) will undergo all clinical follow-up assessments with FFR and angiographic assessments at [ADDRESS_1204907] completed 12 months of follow-up. A total of 572 subjects (30+110+432) are enrolled to ensure that 542 subjects are evaluable for the primary clinical endpoint, across all cohorts.

u For subjects with non-ST -elevation MI and abnormal serum markers, sufficient measurements should be obtained to show a 
decreasing trend in at least one serum marker consistent with stabilized NSTEMI. 
 
 Screening and Prerandomization Procedures  
Patients to be admitted for a planned (elective or urgent) percutaneous coronary artery intervention 
procedure should be screened for study eligibility by a member of the study team (physician and/or research coordinator) previously trained to the study protocol. Subject selection factors to be assessed should include judgment regarding risk of antiplatelet therapy. Subjects who meet general 
eligibility criteria will be asked to sign an ICF.  
After eligible subjects have signed the ICF, the following assessments should be completed as part 
of standard of care, from time of implant procedure:  
 Medical history, including previous MI, previous PCI, previous CABG, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, chronic renal failure, hypercholesterolemia, angina status, and family history of coronary 
artery disease. If already completed within the past 30 days, those findings may be used. 
 Physical assessment, including vital signs (height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure). 
 Angina class 
 Stable Angin a: Current Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS], where class 
0=asymptomatic, class I=angina during strenuous physical activity without 
limitation, class II=slight limitation from angina only during vigorous physical 
activity, class III=moderate limitation from symptoms from everyday living activities, and class IV=severe limitation with inability to perform any activity without angina or angina at rest. 
 Unstable angina:
 Braunwald Classification where severity is new onset of severe 
angina or accelerated angina; no rest pain, angina at rest within past month but not within preceding 48 hours (angina at rest, subacute), angina at rest within 48 hours (angina at rest, acute).  Clinical circumstance where develops in presence of extracardiac condition that intensifies myocardial ischemia (secondary unstable angina); develops in absence of extracardiac condition (primary unstable angina); or develops within 2 weeks after acute MI (postinfarction unstable angina).    
 12-lead ECG; if already completed within the past 24 h ours, this measurement may be 
used. 
 Concomitant medications. 
 Pregnancy test (serum or urine), performed within 7 days before the angiographic 
procedure.  
 Troponin I or T, creatine kinase-myocardial band ( CK-MB); if already completed within 
the past [ADDRESS_1204914] one serum marker consistent with stabilized NSTEMI.

 Protocol-required medications. 
 Diagnostic angiogram  (digital, all cohorts). 
Subjects may qualify for enrollment based on prior 
angiographic data obtained within the last 3 months.  If a prior diagnostic angiogram is not available 
(within 3 months) a screening diagnostic angiogram is required prior to enrollment/randomization and can be completed at the same time as the Pre-Implant, target vessel(s) baseline angiogram. 
Randomized subjects’ angiograms are to  be provided to the central image data center. 
 
 Pre-Implant, target vessel(s) (baseline) angiogram (all qualifying subjects, digital) will be 
used for the final assessment of subject eligibility. If a subject does not have a prior 
diagnostic angiogram, the preprocedure and diagnostic angiogram can be completed in one angiogram assessment for final eligibility assessment immediately prior to enrollment. Randomized subjects angiogram are to be provided to the central image data center.  Subjects who do not meet angiographic inclusion criteria, including measurements that are taken after predilation, will not be randomized in this study but will be documented on a screening log.  
A screening log will be provided to each study site to maintain a record of all of the subject s 
screened. This screening log must be completed and email (pdf) or faxed to the Data Coordinating Center on a weekly basis. 
 Enrollment and Randomization/Implantation 
 Enrollment  
Subjects who have given written informed consent and meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible to be enrolled in this study. 
 Randomization/Implantation 
After informed consent is obtained and it is confirmed that all clinical and angiographic inclusion 
criteria have been met and that no exclusion criteria are met, an interactive web response system (IXRS) will be used to randomize those subjects into [ADDRESS_1204915] a unique 
identification (ID) number, and identify the randomization arm for the subject. The study coordinator will access the IXRS system to obtain th e randomization arm after the angiogram has 
confirmed that the subject meets all angiographic eligibility criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_1204916]. If subjects are

 STUDY DEVICE 
 Description of Study Device 
The Combo stent™ (Figure 3) is a coronary balloon expandable vascular prosthesis, consisting of 
a 316L–stainless-steel alloy platform coated with a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer containing sirolimus (also known as rapamycin). Covalently attached to this matrix is a layer of murine, monoclonal, antihuman CD34 antibody. The immobilized antibody surface specifically targets CD34+ cells from the circulating blood, of which EPCs are CD34+. The base platform for the Combo stent is the OrbusNeich Medical R stent, which has a proprietary dual-helix stent design 
with a strut thickness of 0.0040”. The 316L stainless-steel base platform (R stent) is coated sequentially with the drug/polymer matrix on the abluminal surface, then treated to immobilize antibody on the coated stent surface, and then finally treated with a stabilization treatment to preserve the antibody activity in the dried immobilized state on the stent. The treated stent is 
machine-crimped onto a low-profile, rapid-exchange PTCA dilation catheter, and then the crimped 
stent is subjected to visual inspection, verification of the outer diameter profile, and leak tested. Once found to be within specification, the mounted stent delivery system is placed into a high-density polyethylene hoop dispenser which in turn is placed into a Tyvek™/Mylar™ pouch. The pouch is heat-sealed and then labeled on the outside to maintain stent identity. Units are individually serialized to maintain unit identity, and the complete traceability of the manufacturing process flow is documented. The product is sterilized via an ethylene oxide sterilization process. Poststerile lot release testing includes total drug content, elution profile, antibody activity, endotoxin, and functional performance tests. The OrbusNeich Medical full quality assurance system is compliant to ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2003, Medical Device—Quality Management Systems—Requirements for Regulatory Purposes and Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (3) as verified by [CONTACT_149467]/American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition Certification Services Limited (0473). The Combo stent conforms to the relevant provisions of the International Council 
of Electronic Commerce Consultants Council Directive 93/42/European Economic Communit y 
for Medical Devices dated 14 June 1993 and is in accordance with Annex II Conformity 
Assessment Procedure.

Sirolimus (rapamycin), the active ingredient in Rapamune® (Wyeth), has been tested extensively. 
The following is a brief summary of the available data; complete drug safety information is available through FDA.gov:

Its molecular formula is C51H79NO13, and its molecular weight is 914.2. The structural formula 
of sirolimus is shown in Figure 4 below. 
 
Figure 4 . Structural Formula of Sirolimus 
Sirolimus inhibits T-cell activation and smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation in response to cytokine and growth-factor stimulation. Sirolimus binds to the immunophilin known as intracellular FK-binding protein (FKBP)12. The rapamycin-FKBP-[ADDRESS_1204919] in the late Gap 1 phase and preventing progression to the synthesis phase. 
The safety and efficacy of oral sirolimus (Rapamune, Wyeth), used as a prophylaxis of organ

mechanism of immunosuppressive activity, prevention of acute renal allograft rejection, clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), concentration-effect relationships, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Sirolimus has also been safely used in clinical studies as an antirestenotic drug component in the 
Cypher sirolimus-eluting coronary stent. Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. 
In an 86-week female mouse study at sirolimus doses 30 to 120 times higher than the 2-mg daily clinical dose (adjusted for body surface area), there was a statistically significant increase in

 46 malignant lymphoma at all dose levels compared with controls. In a second mouse study at dosages 
that were approximately 3 to 16 times the clinical dose (adjusted for body surface area), 
hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in males were considered sirolimus related. In the 104-week rat study, at dosages equal to or lower than the clinical dose of 2 mg daily (adjusted for body surface area), there were no significant findings. Sirolimus was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Fertility was diminished slightly in both male and female rats following oral administration of sirolimus at doses approximately 10 times or 2 times, respectively, the clinical dose of 2 mg daily (adjusted for body surface area). In male rats, atrophy of testes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612], prostate, seminiferous tubules, and/or reduction in sperm counts were observed. Reduction of sperm count in male rats was reversible upon cessation of dosing in one study. Testicular tubular degeneration was also seen in a 4 week intravenous study of sirolimus in monkeys at doses that were 
approximately equal to the clinical dose (adjusted for body surface area). 
 Bio-Engineered  Drug -Eluting Coating 
The Combo stent has a single-layer sirolimus-eluting coating that is applied to the abluminal stent 
surface. An anti-CD34 antibody surface modification is then applied to the entire stent surface (Figure 5 ). 
 
Figure 5 . Combo Stent Surface Modification  
To prevent restenosis, the drug/polymer coating consists of sirolimus loaded in the biodegradable SynBiosys™ polymer. The total drug content is approximately half the dose of the commercially available Cypher stent, but with the same release profile. The degradation of the polymer occurs in approximately 90 days. To promote healing, the anti-CD34 surface modification is applied to the entire stent such that the luminal surface of the deployed stent presents an immuno-affinity surface to promote the capture of circulating EPCs for the contact[CONTACT_864072]. 
Figure 6 (below) shows the in vivo elution profile of the final sterile Combo stent product 
compared with the commercially available Cypher stent.

over time) 
 SynBiosys™ Multi-Block Copolymer 
The polymer coating of the Combo stent consists of a blend of the antiproliferative drug sirolimus 
with 2 bioabsorbable polymers, GLL01 and GPCGL01 (SynBiosysTM Polymer, Technology 
Transfer Specification, SurModics, December 2008). These copolymers, also referred to as SynBiosys copolymers, belong to a new class of proprietary bioabsorbable urethane-linked multi-block copolymers provided to OrbusNeich Medical by [CONTACT_864073], Inc. Both copolymers are composed of prepolymers based on glycolide (GA), lactide (LA), and ε-caprolactone (CL), combined in various ratios and initiated with butanediol (BDO) or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The 
prepolymers are linked together by 1,4-butane diisocyanate (BDI) to create the multi-block architecture characteristic of these materials. 
 Polymer In Vitro Degradation 
The SynBiosys GLL01 and GPCGL01 are synthetic bioabsorbable urethane-linked multi-block copolymers, which degrade mainly by [CONTACT_864074]. The hydrolytic degradation proceeds via a bulk erosion mechanism. First, the water diffuses into the material, which may induce a slight swelling of the polymer coating. Second, the ester and urethane bonds are randomly cleaved without producing soluble components. Third, the progressive chain scission leads to the formation of oligomers and monomers that are released from the coating layer, resulting in the actual mass loss of the material. 
The degradation products of SynBiosys copolymers are mainly lactic acid, which is a naturally 
occurring compound in the human body, and glycolic acid. Both compounds degrade into pyruvic 
acid, which in turn is metabolized into carbon dioxide and water via the Krebs cycle. Caprolactone degrades into ω-hydroxyhexanoic acid, which is then eliminated via the urinary pathway. Polyethylene glycol and BDO are both excreted as such through the urinary pathway. Finally, the urethane moieties engendered by [CONTACT_864075] 1,4-butanediamine, also known as putrescine, which is also a naturally occurring compound in the human body. Putrescine is eliminated via the urinary pathway. 020406080100

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Polymer Biocompatibility 
Both the SynBiosys copolymers GLL01 and GPCGL01 are solely composed of biologically safe 
monomers and polymers already employed in numerous regulatory-approved and marketed biomedical implants and drug-delivery systems. These polymers are also widely used in fully bioabsorbable coronary stents and stent coatings.
35 The coating material of the BioMatrix® DES 
system (Biosensors International Group)36 and the fully bioabsorbable Igaki-Tamai® stent (Kyoto 
Medical Planning) are based on poly(LA). The Igaki-Tamai stent and BioMatrix DES system were given their CE mark approvals in [ADDRESS_1204921] the endothelial cell viability.
38,39 Similarly, Asplund et al. showed that 
polymers based on BDI and CL did not release toxic products. The in vivo (subcutaneous) study 
of the materials revealed a typi[INVESTIGATOR_864025]-body response such as the formation of macrophages 
and collagen after the first week and confirmed their biocompatibility over at least 6 weeks.40 Van 
Minnen et al. showed that polymer foams based on D, L-LA, CL, BDO, and BDI that were implanted subcutaneously also induced a temporary increase in macrophages and giant cells upon implantation, but overall the foams remained biocompatible during a degradation period of 3 years.
41 The cytotoxicity, irritation, sensitization, and hemocompatibility of GLL01 and 
GPCGL01 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo upon implantation of polymer-coated stents. 
 Anti-CD34 Antibody 
The Genous Bio-engineered Surface Technology is a surface treatment comprising a composite layer of covalently bound base matrix and a top layer of monoclonal antihuman CD34 antibody. The surface modification produces a cell binding immuno-affinity surface for capture of 
circulating CD34+ cells, including EPCs. Endothelial progenitor cells are a class of circulating, 
bone marrow-derived blood cells. The capture of circulating EPCs is the prohealing approach to reendothelialization.  
The antibody used for the Genous Technology is a murine, monoclonal antibody directed towards 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_864026]34. The human CD34 is a monomeric cell surface antigen with a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa that is selectively expressed on human hematopoietic progenitor cells. The anti-CD34 antibody is produced and purified under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines for production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. 
 Antihuman CD34 Antibody Component 
The antibody is a highly purified 1324-amino acid antibody that has an approximate molecular mass of [ADDRESS_1204922] IgG2a immunoglobulin containing light and heavy 
chain variable and constant regions ( Figure 7 ). The anti-CD34 antibody is current GMP produced 
in a hollow-fiber bioreactor perfusion system using a murine hybridoma in a nutrient medium 
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The hybridoma was produced by [CONTACT_864076]34 immunized BALB/c mouse sarcoma virus spleen cells with NS-[ADDRESS_1204923] impurities using protein A affinity chromatography, pH treatment, cation and anion exchange chromatography, filtration, and diafiltration.

Figure 8 . Endothelial Progenitor Cell Capture 
By [CONTACT_864077]’s own EPCs to the site of vascular injury (eg, the site of a 
coronary stent implant), an acceleration and enhancement of the normal endothelialization process occurs. Functional endothelium is known to reduce inflammation; prevent thrombosis; and inhibit 
smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation, and the expression of extracellular matrix, along with 
functioning to maintain blood flow through vasodilation of the vessel. Rapid establishment of a functioning endothelial layer should help to promote the transformation of the injured site to a healthy state and reestablish vascular homeostasis. 
 Pharmacokinetics of the Combo  Stent  
The PK of sirolimus when released from the Combo stent were studied in a porcine model. Each 
animal had 5 stents implanted per time point. Whole-blood sirolimus PK parameters for this study are outlined in Table 4. Preclinical studies show that an equivalent amount of drug is delivered to 
blood vessels compared to commercially available sirolimus-eluting stents. However, the Combo stent releases less drug into the blood and downstream organs.

 Implantation of Study Device  
Use of a coronary stent and delivery system requires advanced angioplasty skills. Please refer to 
the Combo stent instructions for use (IFU)/investigator brochure (IB) for detailed technical guidance and instructions (Section 17.0). The following information provides general guidance but does not obviate the need for the physician to have undergone formal training as well as follow the IFU/IB for the treatment or control stent in the use of coronary stents and delivery systems.  
Predilation with a balloon shorter than stent is required to avoid “geographical miss” (ie, balloon 
injury to any segment of the vessel that will not be entirely covered by [CONTACT_13732]) during the

Following intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin (dose per standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707]), baseline angiography of the involved vessel will be performed for at least [ADDRESS_1204929] be sent to the Angiographic Core Laboratory per specified delivery 
method. 
If there is more than 1 target vessel, operators will be asked to declare 1 target vessel as a primary 
target vessel before randomization. The primary target vessel will be analyzed with FFR at the 1-year follow-up visit for all subjects. 
Angiography of nontarget vessels (if required) may be performed per site standard. 
 Left Ventriculography 
Subjects presenting without documentation of prior LVEF assessment (echocardiography, single photon emission-computed tomography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or left ventriculography) within the previous 14 days that meets enrollment inclusion criteria (30% or greater) will be required to undergo ejection fraction assessment at the time of the angiogram 
to determine enrollment eligibility. Documented left ventriculography should be performed with 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_3835] (even with radial access), ensuring that the left ventricle is fully opacified. At least 2 consecutive nonpremature ventricular contraction (PVC) or post-PVC beats must be present; otherwise, the ventriculogram should be repeated. 
 Predilation of Target Lesion 
Predilation is to be performed per study stent IFU/ IB, as follows:  
 Predilation can be performed with an angioplasty balloon only (no cutting balloons, 
AngioSculpt balloons, or atherectomy). 
 Predilation balloon must be shorter than the planned stent length to limit predilation injury within the area to be stented. 
 It is recommended that a predilation balloon that is 0.[ADDRESS_1204930] after the “Use By” date. Do  not use if any defects are noted.

Although a bailout procedure is not considered an endpoint event (unless the subject experiences death, MI, or CABG), bailout procedures should be avoided unless required 
for safe subject management. Use of bailout procedures should be uncommon. Ordinarily, each target lesion should be covered by a single stent, with a maximum of [ADDRESS_1204932]. Patients at high risk for bailout procedures (especially procedures exceeding [ADDRESS_1204933], or more than 2 vessels) should be excluded from the protocol.  
If a bailout stent is required for a target lesion (as in the case of edge dissection), a device from the 
assigned treatment group (Combo or EES) should be used. The bailout device should be a Combo stent if the target lesion has been treated with a Combo stent. Similarly, the bailout device should be an EES if the target lesion has been treated with an EES. The bailout device should overlap the previous device by 1 to 2 mm. If a stent of appropriate length and diameter of the same treatment assignment is not available, a commercially approved stent should be selected. Mixing different kinds of stents should be avoided unless there is no alternative. Other approved devices or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864028]’s discretion. 
 Postdeployment Angiography 
In all subjects, the postprocedure target lesion angiography will be performed according to the Angiographic Core Laboratory Guidelines and must be captured in the similar manner used for the 
preprocedure images. These angiographic images should be performed after guide wire removal 
and intracoronary nitroglycerin if spasm is suspected. Two orthogonal views should be obtained using the same methods as the preprocedure angiogram. The procedure is considered complete after final angiographic recording of the treatment area and the guide catheter has been removed from the subject. Angiographic images of all target vessels for Cohorts A and B must be sent to the core laboratory per specified delivery method. 
 Risks 
Risks associated with using the Combo stent are believed to be the same as those associated with percutaneous treatment procedures for a stenosed coronary artery using any other DES. There are potential additional risks of using this investigational device compared with a currently approved DES in that the frequency of AEs associated with stenting could possibly be increased with the 
Combo stent, although no such safety concerns have surfaced in the studies to date. 
Use of this type of device is known to be associated with the following risks: 
 Coronary or stent thrombosis 
 Increased vascular and/or bleeding complications (due to anticoagulation)

 56 The occurrence of the above complications may lead to a repeat catheterization and/or PCI, MI, 
emergency by[CONTACT_4897], or death. Since the Combo stent is an investigational device, risks are 
not entirely known, but are believed to be similar to those that are associated with the standard, 
customary stenting of a stenosed coronary artery. 
All efforts will be made to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_864081]/ IBs. 
The Cypher sirolimus stent is approved for use, and the risks associated with sirolimus are well 
documented. It is believed that the side effects with sirolimus on the Combo stent will be similar 
to those associated with sirolimus on the Cypher stent, but they may be slightly different (higher 
or lower) than those with the Cypher stent. The EES comparator stent contains everolimus, which 
is the 40-O- (2-hydroxyethyl) derivative of sirolimus and works similarly to sirolimus as an 
inhibitor of mTOR. Everolimus is approved in the [LOCATION_002] under the name [CONTACT_864135]

Approved vascular closure devices may be used after femoral arteriotomies at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions. 
 Follow- up Assessment Procedures  
There are 3 overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_864031].  
1. Cohort A: [ADDRESS_1204935] assessment of primary target vessel, and FFR assessment of primary target vessel only. Operators should follow the appropriate IFU/IB for the OCT system.  
2. Cohort B: [ADDRESS_1204936] assessment of primary target vessel, and FFR assessment of primary target vessel . 
Use of a 6 French guide catheter is recommended for these assessments. Operators should follow the appropriate IFU/IB for the OCT and FFR systems.  
3. Cohort C: 432 subjects will receive all clinical assessments, angiographic assessments of all study vessels, and FFR assessment of the primary target vessel only at 12 months. Fractional flow reserve assessments may be obtained using a 4 French catheter. Operators should follow the appropriate IFU/IB for the FFR systems.

For protocol-mandated angiograms at 12 months, FFR evaluation of the primary target vessel is 
required for all patients. Please also reference the FFR Core Laboratory Guidelines.   In patients with more than one target vessel, FFR evaluation of the nonprimary target vessel is strongly recommended if the angiographic stenosis is ≥ 50% diameter reduction.

performed.  
 If an angiographic stenosis is ≥ 50% diameter reduction, revascularization should not be 
performed if the FFR is > 0.80. This rule applies even in patients with typi[INVESTIGATOR_864032], patients with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_153759], or subjects without chest pain but documented ischemia on noninvasive testing, based on the FAME 2 results that show that FFR-directed PCI is appropriate in this setting.  
 If the angiographic stenosis is ≤ 60% diameter reduction, the patient is asymptomatic, and 
there is either no noninvasive testing or the noninvasive testing has equivocal results, 
revascularization should not be performed regardless of the results of the FFR.

For catheterizations performed at times other than the scheduled angiographic study visits (12 months for subjects in Cohorts A, B,  C; 6 months for subjects in Cohort A): 
 If angiographic stenosis is < 50% diameter reduction, revascularization should not be performed.  
 If an angiographic stenosis is ≥ 50% diameter reduction, FFR assessment of the lesion is 
strongly recommended. Revascularization should not be performed if the FFR is > 0.80.

 Potential Benefits of Combo  Stent  
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty has been widely used as an alternative to medical 
or surgical treatment in selected subjects with symptomatic coronary artery disease. The major limitations of PTCA (abrupt closure, intimal dissection, and restenosis from elastic recoil) are overcome to a significant extent with coronary stents. 
The Combo stent can be expected to provide the same radial support as other coronary stents to 
minimize closure of a stenosed artery as is commonly indicated for coronary stenting. 
Additionally, the potential benefit of the Combo stent is its effectiveness in inhibition of neointima 
while enhancing endothelial coverage that may reduce rates of stent thrombosis or support shorter routine use of DAPT without increasing rates of restenosis compared with other commercially available DESs. Well-known components supporting these features include the elution of sirolimus and the use of abluminal, bioabsorbable polymer. The most novel feature of the Combo platform is the use of CD34 antibody coating, providing a unique endothelial progenitor cell-capture technology mechanistically targeted to promote faster, more complete healing of the stent site and struts.

following the index PCI, then reduced to 81 to 325 mg daily, at the discretion of the investigator. 
 Platelet Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Antagonists 
Platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist preloading therapy is mandatory, using only approved agents at the time of enrollment. In subjects undergoing PCI, the platelet ADP receptor antagonist must be given before the start of the interventional procedure. The following schedule is recommended: 
 Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_864034] 75mg —600 mg more than 6 hours before PCI or 300 mg more than 
12 hours before PCI (even if the subject is on chronic clopi[INVESTIGATOR_60469]), according to regional standards of care therapy; or 
 Prasugrel at least 20 mg  more than 1 hour before PCI, according to regional standards of 
care therapy; or 
 Other approved adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists, designated before randomization. In the US, this includes ticagrelor, [ADDRESS_1204938] be recorded before randomized stent assignment. 
 Other Medications 
The use of other medications (eg, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) before PCI is left to the discretion of the treating physicians. Best medical practice is recommended.  
As additionally noted in the AC C/AHA PCI guidelines,
[ADDRESS_1204939] be recorded on the electronic case report 
form (eCRF). 
 Medications During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
During the procedure, subjects will receive appropriate anticoagulation medications according to 
standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707]. The use of any approved anticoagulant agent at the discretion of the investigator is acceptable.

 61 The use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors is allowed per the discretion of the investigator 
as long as the agents are approved for use in the participating country. 
 Postpercutaneous Coronary Intervention Medications 
It is very important that the subject is compliant with the po stprocedure antiplatelet 
recommendations. Premature discontinuation of prescribed antiplatelet medications could result 
in a higher risk of thrombosis, MI, or death. Before PCI, if a surgical or dental procedure is anticipated that requires early discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy, the interventionalist and subject should carefully consider whether a DES and its associated recommended antiplatelet therapy is the appropriate PCI choice. If a DES is not appropriate, the subject should not be enrolled in the trial. Following PCI, should a surgical or dental procedure be recommended, the risks and benefits of the procedure should be weighed against the possible risk associated with premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. Subjects who require premature discontinuation 
of antiplatelet therapy secondary to significant active bleeding should be monitored carefully for 
cardiac events and, once stabilized, have their antiplatelet therapy restarted as soon as possible per the discretion of their treating physician. 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_864035] [ADDRESS_1204940] of care therapy, with the choice of agent left to the discretion of the investigator, either: 
 Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_864034] 50 mg per day; or 
 Ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 250 mg every 12 hours; or 
 Prasugrel at least 3.75 mg per day; or 
 Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily (if this drug is approved by [CONTACT_864084]) 
  
Adenosine diphosphate antagonists should not be discontinued within the first [ADDRESS_1204941] of care, unless absolutely necessary due to major bleeding, major trauma, or major surgery (eg, intracranial surgery) necessitating discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. Many surgeries can safely be performed while the subject 
is on DAPT. If a subject on DAPT requires surgery, strong consideration should be given to 
performing the surgery without antiplatelet agent discontinuation. 
 Packaging 
The study device will be packed and shipped to sites and resupplied on an as-needed basis. EES 
comparator stents will be selected from the local clinical supply. The label of the study device includes the following information: 
 Device is used for the clinical trial

 Name [CONTACT_864138] [CONTACT_864085][INVESTIGATOR_320]. Study devices are to be stored separate ly from 
clinical supplies and accessible only to those who have appropriate authorization. 
 
 Product Stability and Shelf-L ife 
A stability study was conducted on the Combo stent, where total drug content and antibody activity 
were evaluated out to 12 months real-time aging. The total drug content and antibody activity for 
the Combo stent were found to remain stable and within the acceptance criteria for up to 12 months 
stored at 25°C/60% relative humidity. The Combo stent clinical product will have a product shelf-life of 12 months. 
 Blinding of Study 
Single blinding practices for the study will include the following: 
 Subjects: Subjects will be informed of the 1:1 randomization between the 2 stent systems 
(Combo: EES) but will remain blinded as to which stents they actually receive until after 
the 12-month follow-up. 
 Implanting physician: It is not possible to blind the implanting physician due to the differences in the implant procedure for the treatment and the control stents. 
 Follow-up physician: There will be no requirement that follow-up be performed by a physician other than the implanting physician. In follow-up reports, the follow-up 
physician will refer to either stent as a study stent so that these reports will not unblind anyone reviewing the report. 
 Clinical research coordinators: Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) will not be blinded. 
In follow-up notes, the CRC will refer to either stent merely as a “study stent” so that these 
notes will not unblind anyone reviewing them. Clinical research coordinators will be 
instructed not to unblind subjects until after the 12-month follow-up visit. 
 Monitors: Monitors will not be blinded. Monitoring reports will refer to either stent as the 
study stent to preclude inadvertent unblinding of those reading the reports. 
 Data Management and Operations: Clinical trial operations at the Duke Clinical Research 
Institute (DCRI) currently utilize standard operating procedures (SOPs) for confidential 
data management that prohibit investigators, sponsor staff, subjects, families, or others from access to descriptor or outcomes data and/or its relationship to treatment assignment. 
 Angiographic Core Laboratory: The angiographic core laboratory reviewers will be blinded to the treatment and the control stents.  
 Clinical Events Classification Committee : The Clinical Events Classification Committee 
(CEC) may receive core laboratory reports regarding angiographic findings or blinded

 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee: The DSMC will be blinded to treatment arm 
assignment. If it is determined by [CONTACT_864086][INVESTIGATOR_864036], this information will be disclosed to the DSMC. Material contained in each DSMC review is confidential, and all documentation is controlled in accordance with DCRI SOPs. The only exception to this policy is in the event that the DSMC recommends alteration to the trial and it is deemed essential that the Executive Operations Committee receive information that would implicitly result in their knowledge of treatment assignment. 
 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing, and Return 
 Receipt of Study Device 
Upon receipt of the study device supplies, an inventory must be performed and a device receipt log filled out and signed by [CONTACT_17247]. It is important that the designated study staff counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or unusable study devices in a given shipment will be documented in the study files. The investigator must notify the study sponsor of any damaged or unusable study devices that were supplied to the investigator’s site. 
 Return of Study Device 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of study devices shipped, devices used, and devices remaining. This reconciliation will be logged on the device reconciliation form, 
signed, and dated. Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented before 
the return of unused study devices. Any unused study devices are to be returned to the sponsor.

 Definitions 
 Adverse Event 
The reporting and recording of adverse events (AEs) is crucial to the evaluation of an investigational device and to the development of labeling information that appears in the IFU/IB . 
During a clinical trial, the reporting of adverse experience information can lead to important design changes in the new device, as well as provide integral safety data. The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs throughout the trial.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Any pre-existing condition known to the investigator will not, in general, be reportable as an AE, 
unless the investigator believes that the participation of the subject in this study contributed to the 
progression of that condition. 
When an AE has, by [CONTACT_5942], a prolonged course, the event will be considered a single event and 
not multiple events; for example, if a subject develops end-stage renal failure requiring regular 
dialysis, the event is considered end-stage renal failure, not multiple single renal event s. 
 Serious Adverse Event 
Any AE that:  
 Led to death 
 Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in 
o Life-threatening illness or injury or  
o Permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function or 
o In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body 
structure or a body function 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
o The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110152]/SAEs: 
 Visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561659] 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or “event life threatening”). 
OrbusNeich Medical  Protocol 
HARMONEE  Protocol Number: VP-0601  
 
Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, 2015 
 65  Elective surgery, planned before signing consent. 
 Admissions per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure. 
 Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of 
health status (eg, routine colonoscopy). 
 Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and planned before entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases. 
 Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative). 
 Anticipated Adverse Device Effects 
A serious adverse device effect (ADE) that by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has been previously identified as noted in the protocol risks section (6.3.6) or I FU/IB. 
 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects 
Per [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Part 812.3, an unanticipated ADE (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application) or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
Unanticipated ADE s will include events meeting either A or B as stated below: 
A. Events meeting ALL of the following criteria: 
 Not included in the list of anticipated events (see IFU/IB) 
 Possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational device per the site 
investigator 
 Serious (meets any of the following criteria): 
o Life-threatening illness or injury 
o Results in permanent impairment of a body structure or a body structure 
o Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment of a body function or a body structure 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
o Led to death 
 (Permanent means irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or 
function, excluding trivial impairment or damage.)

 66 B. Any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the investigational device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 Device Failure and Device Malfunction 
A device has failed or malfunctioned if it is used in accordance with the IFU/ IB but does not 
perform according to the IFU/ IB and negatively impacts the treatment. Device failures include: 
 Inability to position at desired location 
 Incorrect deployment of device 
 User Error  
A device is used by [CONTACT_9916] a manner that is an act or omission of an act that results in 
a different medical device response than intended by [CONTACT_3460]. 
The term "user error" refers to an error made by [CONTACT_864087], for example an error 
of use of the device outside of the IFU/IB.

 Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of an AE will be rated as follows: 
 Mild:  AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does not 
interfere with everyday activities. 
 Moderate:  AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities; intervention may be needed. 
 Severe:  AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other intervention 
usually needed. 
 Reporting 
It is understood that complete information about an event may not be known at the time the initial 
report is submitted. The investigator must assess the relationship of the event to the investigational device (including the rationale for the assessment) and should make every attempt to obtain as much information as possible concerning the event. Additional information pertaining to an event should be reported in the eCRF as it becomes available. Specified cardiovascular endpoint events will be reported on the eCRF endpoint pages only.

All S AEs, except events listed as protocol-specific endpoints (Section 7.6),  occurring from 
randomization through the 1 year follow-up visit will be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.  
All events that lead to or result in death, device-related SAEs and UADEs occurring after 
randomization through the 5-year follow-up will be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. If required, the site investigator or their delegate is responsible for notifying the site director of a reported SAE within the expected time frame. The investigator or qualified designee will enter the required information about the SAE into the AE/SAE page of the eCRF, which will be distributed to the appropriate sponsor contact. If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. As follow-up information becomes available, it should be entered into the eCRF within 24 hours.  
If the eCRF reporting capability is not available, the SAE should be reported on the paper back-
up SAE form and faxed or e-mailed to DCRI Safety Surveillance. If eCRF, e-mail, and FAX are not available, the event should be reported by [CONTACT_756] (see contact [CONTACT_31307]). If the report is initially given by e-mail, FAX, or telephone, then the required information about the SAE will be entered into the appropriate module of the eCRF immediately after the eCRF system is available by [CONTACT_779].

 All SAEs will be followed to resolution or stabilization. Resolution means that the subject has 
returned to a baseline state of health. Stabilization means that the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. 
Safety data will be periodically reviewed to monitor subjects safety through the study period, Study leadership will be notified if any events are occurring at an unexpected rate for this study population. Risks will be continually assessed to determine if a protocol or ICF revision is warranted. 
  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects, Device Failures, Device Malfunctions, and User Error  
In the case of a device failure or malfunction related to the investigational device, the Combo stent device must be returned to the manufacturing company, if possible. Device failure, device malfunctions, and user error will be reported on the device deficiency eCRF form within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. If the eCRF reporting capability is not available, the paper back-up device deficiency from should be emailed or faxed to DCRI Safety Surveillance as noted in section [IP_ADDRESS] within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.

 Regulatory Reporting of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects 
There are situations that may necessitate rapid communication of the occurrence of AEs to the 
regulatory authorities. The DCRI Safety Surveillance medical monitor will determine if a device-
related event meets “unanticipated” criteria (ie, is not identified in the IFU/IB or literature), 
reporting all findings to OrbusNeich Medical for the duration of the trial. All device-related AEs will be reported to OrbusNeich for the duration of the trial. Unanticipated ADE s will be reported 
by [CONTACT_864088] (PMDA) (Japan), FDA, all reviewing ECs/IRBs, and all participating investigators within 10 working days of when DCRI Safety Surveillance was initially notified of the event or within accordance of country regulations.  
In accordance with local regulations, OrbusNeich Medical will notify investigators of all SAEs 
that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously 
described in the IFU/IB). OrbusNeich Medical will immediately conduct an evaluation of any 
UADEs. If OrbusNeich Medical determines that a UADE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, all investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk shall be terminated as soon as possible. Termination shall occur no later than [ADDRESS_1204944] or within accordance of country regulations. 
OrbusNeich Medical retains a ll regulatory reporting responsibility to the PMDA and the FDA.  
Investigators are responsible for reporting UADEs to their reviewing EC/IRB within 10 working

In addition, FFR assessment to evaluate the physiology of target vessels in the entire population will augment the endpoint definition of ischemia-driven TVR. Finally, key safety considerations will be augmented with a subpopulation in whom imaging with OCT for strut coverage, late strut malapposition, and plaque volume, as 
well as serial HAMA assessments, will be reported. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, this study will include both an imputed BMS control 
performance goal and a randomized concomitant active-control EES stent cohort as reference comparators for superiority and noninferiority, respectively. The population studied will require enrollment of 572 subjects to get 542 evaluable (assuming a 5% lost- to-follow-up rate), 
randomized evenly to the 2 study arms, admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a planned (elective) percutaneous coronary artery intervention procedure. Each subject will be followed for 5 years. 
The primary analysis sample will be based on the principle of intention- to-treat. For this study, all 
subjects who meet the study-entry criteria, sign the written informed consent, and are randomized 
to a treatment arm will be counted in the primary analysis. 
A secondary analysis will also be performed on the per-treatment population, defined as subjects 
with a successful procedure and follow-up information. 
All statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS), version 9.[ADDRESS_1204949] completed 12 months of follow-up. Target-vessel failure analysis will show noninferiority to an EES and superiority to an imputed BMS control (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Clinical endpoints will be assessed before any protocol-mandated angiograms,

Anti-CD34 antibody stents have been shown in acute human ex vivo shunt studies to have rapi[INVESTIGATOR_864038], which express endothelial markers while showing less thrombus formation. In preclinical studies, conventional DESs treated with the immobilized anti-CD34 antibody have been shown to have an enhanced endothelial coverage and expression of endothelial functional markers over the DES alone. Likewise, the Combo device has also been shown in preclinical studies to have an enhanced endothelial coverage and expression of endothelial functional markers over conventional DESs while showing similar modulation of the neointimal response expected from a DES.

 Angiographic Late Loss Analysis 
 Introduction 
As a surrogate endpoint, late loss has provided useful information on the range of long-term 
luminal dimensions that mechanistically correlate with clinical outcome. Direct comparisons between stent platforms, however, may yield statistically significant p-values whose clinical relevance is unclear. Logistic regression models have reliably estimated TLR rates for DES and BMS based upon angiographic late loss measures.
[ADDRESS_1204961] statistically significant differences in angiographic late loss, but small expected differences in TLR risk, especially at the lower ranges 
of late loss.  
Thus an objective performance goal for late loss is highly relevant to interpretation of angiographic 
late loss in new DES platforms. In this study, both the Combo and EES platforms are compared to a performance goal to ensure that performance of the Combo is comparable to currently approved DES (and superior to BMS). 
 Performance Goal Justification 
To understand the relationships between late loss among approved DESs, (a network meta-analysis was performed evaluating DESs, including Cypher, T AXUS , Endeavor, Xience, Nobori, Resolute, 
and Combo to estimate the overall expected differences among each of the stents with regard to in-segment and in-stent late loss using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, treating all BMSs as 
a single therapy (data on file, OrbusNeich Medical). The results are displayed in Figure 11 and 
Figure 12.

Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, [ADDRESS_1204962] relationships in the existing evidence.  
Based upon the lower 95% credible limit observed for BMS in the network meta-analyses, the 
maximum difference (delta) relative to EES that would still preserve superiority to BMS is -0.54 mm for in-stent late loss and -0.34 mm for in-segment late loss. This boundary constitutes the performance goal for the HARMONEE late loss analysis. 
If we assume the mean late loss is similar to the results observed in SPI[INVESTIGATOR_864039], 
and a 1-sided alpha of 0.025, then a subsample of 80 subjects (40 per arm) would have 91% power to detect noninferiority for in-stent late loss and 62% power to detect noninferiority for in-segment late loss and satisfy the performance goal. The primary analysis of late loss will include subjects from cohorts A and B evaluated using this performance goal. As a sensitivity analysis, 
angiographic late loss will be assessed including all subjects who have QCA performed as a study 
procedure. 
While late loss measured as a continuous variable may report highly statistically significant 
differences of no clinical relevance, physiologic measurement of lesion severity using FFR dichotomously analyzed at the 0.81 threshold has been shown in 2 independent, prospective randomized trials to be highly predictive of later clinical events. Thus, for this study, although late loss will be reported as a mechanistic observation, abnormal FFR will provide a unique and reliably unbiased component of the ischemia-driven TVR secondary endpoint. 
 Human Anti-Murine Antibody Analysis 
Up to 55 patients assigned to the Combo stent will submit blood samples at baseline, at 30 days, and at 12 months for measurement of HAMA levels. All patients will provide written informed consent for collection of the plasma samples. A core laboratory will provide binary determination 
of changed HAMA antibody levels indicative of anti-antibody response. 
 Introduction 
Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have proved tremendously useful. However, when used in 
the treatment of patients with various ailments, their effect is not always sustained. This is often due to the development of human anti-mouse antibodies, leading to clearance of the murine mAb and adverse events.
[ADDRESS_1204963] 
classified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_864040]-antibody response was reported in less than 2% of patients.
52 Immunogenicity this low represents an ideal, with very 
reassuring safety. Immunogenicity is tolerable if detectable in 2% to 15% of patients, with use of the antibodies warranted for catastrophic or life- limiting disease. Immunogenicity with anti-
antibody response greater than 15% are usually clinical failures with regulatory concerns likely to preclude clinical use.  
HAMA antibody levels have been obtained in at least [ADDRESS_1204964] been no significant changes in HAMA levels detected in previous studies (data on file, OrbusNeich Medical).

The samples obtained from the 55 patients assigned to the Combo stent in Cohort B will assure a minimum of 40 complete sets of samples in case of missed visits, losses to follow-up, or nonevaluable samples. 
Sampling procedure: 
1. Recommended sampling device: Vacutainer red, without additives. 
For example: Becton Dickinson No. 367812 (4 mL) 
2. Centrifuge clotted samples immediately and separate serum into the PP tubes supplied by

3. Storage temperature: < -20°C until delivery. 
4. Hemolyzed and lipemic samples are to be avoided. 
 Human Anti-M urine Antibody Data Analysis Plan 
Analysis of the HAMA prespecified endpoint will include the frequency of increased HAMA antibody levels, as determined by [CONTACT_89709]. A minimum sample size of 40 patients is 
designed such that assuming alpha = 0.05 and an underlying seroconversion rate of 5 per thousand, 
there will be 86.5% power to exclude an anti-antibody response ( AAR ) upper bound of 8.0%. 
Further, when a total of 160 device exposures is considered (120 from previous studies and 40 from the present substudy), the upper 95% binomial confidence limit will exclude an AAR rate greater than 2.28% if no anti-antibody response is detected.

 Analysis of Baseline Characteristics

variables will be tested using unpaired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, depending on 
variable distribution. Statistical significance on baseline variables will be declared if the 2-sided P-value is less than 0.05.

 85 The PLATINUM noninferiority trial comparing the Promus Element stent to the Promus/Xience 
stent used an absolute difference delta of 3.5%, assuming a 1-year TLF rate of 5.5% and 1-sided 
alpha of 0.05.53 The Resolute noninferiority trial comparing the Resolute stent to a historical 
control of Endeavor stents used an absolute difference delta of 3.3%, assuming a 1-year TLF rate of 6.5% and 1-sided alpha of 0.05.
54 The LEADERS trial comparing a biolimus stent to Cypher 
used an absolute difference delta of 4%, assuming a 9-month TVF rate of 8% and a 1-sided alpha of 0.05.
55 Finally, the TWENTE trial of Resolute vs Xience stent used an absolute difference delta 
of 4.48%, assuming a 1-year TVF rate of 12.8%, as observed in Endeavor III. Again, the noninferiority boundary was expressed for the upper limit of a 1-sided 95% CI assuming a 1-sided alpha of 0.05. These boundaries have been determined empi[INVESTIGATOR_864041]. 
To investigate whether Combo is noninferior to EES, the appropriate null hypothesis is that EES 
is better than Combo by [CONTACT_864098] (delta). The alternative hypothesis is that 
Combo is not worse than EES by [CONTACT_864099] (delta). The quantification of delta 
should be clinically relevant and statistically feasible. Selection of an appropriate delta value, while ideally based on prior data and expectations of performance, should be determined by [CONTACT_864100]. 
In addition to EES, there are several DESs that are approved for clinical use in Japan, including 
Cypher, Nobori, T AXUS , and Endeavor. There are several studies that have compared these DESs 
to each other and to BMS in various combinations. The effect size of each of the currently approved DESs in subjects similar to those in the proposed study population can be summarized in a network meta-analysis. The 95% upper credible limit (a Bayesian parameter analogous to the upper 95% confidence limit) of these estimates relative to EES indicates a maximum reduction in therapeutic response that has already been considered acceptable by [CONTACT_425014].

Figure 13.  Relative Risk (95% credible interval) of Currently Approved Drug-Eluting 
Stents vs Everolimus-Eluting Stents 
Each of the DESs has a 95% credible interval consistent with superiority to BMS. Clinical 
acceptance by [CONTACT_864101], T AXUS , and Nobori stents in this patient 
population on the basis of currently available studies indicates acceptance of an upper 95% credible limit greater than 1.80 relative to EES. Relative to EES, an upper bound of 1.77 would be more conservative than the upper bounds for 3 of the 5 approved DESs (Endeavor, T AXUS , and 
Nobori). If the TVF rate is 9% for the EES control arm, a relative upper bound of 1.77 corresponds to an absolute margin (delta) of 7%. Based on this evidence, this analysis shows a margin (delta) of 7% is clinically justified. 
In the Combo study, we are assuming a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. For a trial population of 
542 evaluable subjects (271 per arm), the study has 81% power to detect noninferiority using an absolute difference delta of 7%, assuming a 1-year TVF rate of 9% (Figure 14).

 Comparison to an Imputed Bare Metal Stent Control 
An important statistical consideration for the noninferiority evaluation of next-generation DESs is “drift”—the risk that a series of active-control trials might push the general therapy in the wrong direction by [CONTACT_864102][INVESTIGATOR_864042]. In order to evaluate Combo stent effectiveness and assay sensitivity, the analysis should examine whether the effect of Combo on TVF is superior to the effect of a BMS on TVF, had a BMS arm been present. The evaluation of Combo as a third-generation product requires [ADDRESS_1204970] comparisons (Xience vs TAXUS, TAXUS vs bare metal) in addition to the direct comparison observed in the trial 
(Combo vs EES). In this particular circumstance, the mandate for assay sensitivity is actually more 
stringent (requiring a risk ratio [RR] difference between 1.1 and 1.3) than the requirement for noninferiority (estimated as an RR difference between 1.35 and 1.40). 
The techniques for creating indirect comparisons of a new treatment to placebo have been 
described by [CONTACT_223684], including Eddy et al. (1992),
60 Bucher et al. (1997),61 Fisher 
(1998),62 Hauck and Anderson (1999),63 and Hasselblad and Kong (2001).64 Simon (1999)[ADDRESS_1204971]

had a BMS arm been present. The method takes into account the uncertainty in the trial of the 
investigational stent (Combo) as well as the uncertainty about the active-control stent (EES). The 
imputed control calculations for the trial will be based on the results of the TAXUS IV, TAXUS 
V, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_591969], SPI[INVESTIGATOR_591970], and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_864043].  
First consider the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_591969], SPI[INVESTIGATOR_591970], and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_864043], which evaluated Xience V vs 
TAXUS Express stents, with 1-year TVF rates available in the Xience V IFU. The trial results can 
be summarized as a combined estimate using an Empi[INVESTIGATOR_864044]-effects model as 
described by [CONTACT_864103] (1985).[ADDRESS_1204973]*PRO

Next consider the TAXUS IV, and TAXUS V trials, which compared TAXUS Express to bare 
metal controls in a variety of anatomic settings11 (TAXUS IFU68; personal communication). The 
1-year TVF results can be summarized as a combined estimate using an Empi[INVESTIGATOR_864044]-

The following method is taken from Hasselblad and Kong (2001).64 From these estimates, we can 
obtain an imputed comparison of EES to BMS by [CONTACT_864104] (ORs): 
Odds of TVF for EES  =  Odds of TVF for EES        x   Odds of  TVF for TAXUS 
Odds of TVF for BMS     Odds of TVF for TAXUS      Odds of TVF for BMS 
 
B
ecause these are all independent estimates, the variance of the imputed EES vs BMS estimate is 
the sum of the variances of the EES vs TAXUS estimate variance of the TAXUS vs BMS estimate. 
OrbusNeich Medical  Protocol 
HARMONEE  Protocol Number: VP-0601  
 
Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, 2015 
 91 Using the meta-analytic estimates above, the OR for EES BMS is 0.395 with 95% CI 0.275, 0.567. 
Next, consider the relationship between Combo and bare metal:  
 
Odds of TVF for Combo =  Odds of TVF for Combo  x   Odds of TVF for EES        x   
 Odds of TVF for BMS      Odds of TVF for EES            Odds of TVF for TAXUS  
Odds of TVF for TAXUS 
 Odds of TVF for BMS  
 
Odds of TVF for Combo  =  Odds of TVF for Combo  x  Odds of TVF for EES  
Odds of TVF for BMS         Odds of TVF for EES           Odds of TVF for BMS 
 
Again, because these are all independent estimates, the variance of the imputed Combo vs BMS 
estimate is the sum of the variances of the Combo vs EES trial and the estimates for EES vs 
TAXUS and TAXUS vs BMS.  
Using these methods, for any particular control event rate and sample size, we can define a delta 
boundary where there is superiority over BMS (and assay sensitivity). For example, if one selects 
a
n RR delta of 1.2, assay sensitivity is preserved over the following range of sample sizes, 
de
pending on the control event rate ( Table 12 ).

 DATA MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 Required Data 
The full study dataset will be collected for subjects who enter the randomization phase of the study. 
All required data for this study will be entered into the eCRF. 
 Data Collection and Tracking 
Qualified study staff at each site will perform primary data collection from source document reviews. OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate will perform clinical monitoring, including review of eCRFs with verification to the source documentation. 
This study will use Web-based e-CRFs developed through a validated platform that enables 
electronic-reporting-electronic-signatures–compliance platform (21 CFR Part 11). Before initiation of the trial, each site will be assessed as to computer availability, hardware specifications, 
and Internet connectivity, to evaluate the site’s capability to use this type of data-collection system. 
The investigator's site staff members who will be entering data will receive training on the system, after which each person will be issued a unique user ID and password. 
For security reasons, and in compliance with regulatory guidelines, it is imperative that only those 
persons trained in the system use the system, and each must do so using his or her own unique access code. Access codes are nontransferable. Site personnel who have not undergone training may not use the system and will not be issued user ID and password until appropriate training is completed. 
During monitoring visits, the site will ensure that system access is available to the clinical research 
associate (CRA), so that the CRA may verify the data entries against source documentation. At the conclusion of the study, each enrolling site will be provided with a copy of its own subjects’ data that includes entries and changes made by [CONTACT_779] (ie, the audit trail of changes made to the 
database). This will be maintained at the site according to the requirements for records retention.

 97 Periodic monitoring visits will be made at all active investigational sites throughout the clinical 
study to assure that the investigator obligations are being fulfilled and all applicable regulations 
and guidelines are being followed. These visits will assure that the facilities are still acceptable, the protocol and investigational plan are being followed, the EC/IRB has approved protocol changes as required, complete records are being maintained, appropriate and timely reports have been made to OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate and the EC/IRB, study device and study device inventory are controlled, and the investigator is carrying out all agreed-upon activities. 
During monitoring visits, the monitor will perform a review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
informed consent, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) authorization (U.S.), events meeting criteria for expedited event reporting, as well as safety and efficacy endpoints. Additional review will be performed on a site- by-site basis, as warranted by [CONTACT_746092]. Any discrepancies will be noted and resolved. 
During monitoring visits, the site will ensure system access is available to the CRAs so that they 
may verify the data entries against the source documentation. 
 Study Documentation 
Study documentation includes all eCRFs, source documents, monitoring logs, appointment schedules, sponsor-investigator correspondence, and regulatory documents (eg, signed protocol and amendments, EC/IRB correspondence and approvals, approved and signed subject consent forms, Statement of Investigator form, and clinical supplies receipts and distribution records). 
The investigators will prepare and maintain complete and accurate study documentation in 
compliance with U.S. and Japan GCP standards and applicable country, federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations; and, for each subject participating in the study, promptly complete all eCRFs and such other reports as required by [CONTACT_864108].
 
By [CONTACT_12142], the investigator acknowledges that, within legal and regulatory 
restrictions and institutional and ethical considerations, study documentation will be promptly and fully disclosed to OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate by [CONTACT_185394]’s site upon request for inspection, copying, review, and audit at reasonable times by [CONTACT_864109].

 98 Whenever possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the source 
document; however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and exact 
duplication of the original document. 
Regulations require that investigators maintain information in the study subject’s medical records 
that corroborate data collected on the eCRF. In order to comply with these regulatory requirements, the following information will be maintained and made available as required by [CONTACT_864111]’s monitors and/or regulatory inspectors: 
 Medical history/physical condition of the study subject before involvement in the study 
sufficient to verify protocol entry criteria. 
 Medical record documenting that informed consent was obtained for the subject’s participation in the study. 
 Dated and signed notes for each subject visit, including results of examinations. 
 Notations on abnormal laboratory results and their resolution. 
 Dated printouts or reports of special assessments (eg, ECG reports). 
 Description of AEs and follow-up of the AEs (minimally, event description, severity, onset date, duration, relation to study drug/device, outcome, and treatment for AE). 
 Notes regarding concomitant medications taken during the study (including start and stop dates). 
 Subject’s condition upon completion of or withdrawal from the study. 
 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is defined as an event where the investigator or site personnel did not conduct 
the study according to the investigational plan or the Investigator Agreement. 
Investigators are required to obtain approval from the OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate’s 
medical monitor before initiating deviations from the investigational plan or protocol, except where necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. Significant deviations and approval will be documented in writing and maintained in study files. Unless OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate has consented to any such deviations in writing, OrbusNeich Medical will not assume any resulting responsibility or liability. Preapproval is generally not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the investigator’s control, (eg, subject did not attend scheduled follow-up visit, blood sample lost by [CONTACT_13754]); however, the event is still considered a deviation. 
Deviations will be reported to OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate regardless of whether 
medically justifiable, preapproved by [CONTACT_7195], or taken to protect the subject in an 
emergency. Subject-specific deviations will be reported. Nonsubject-specific deviations will be reported to OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate in writing.  
The EC/IRB will be informed of all protocol changes by [CONTACT_864112]/IRB’s established procedures. No deviations from the protocol of any type will be made without complying with all the EC/IRB’s established procedures.

 99 Investigators will maintain documentation of the dates and reasons for each deviation from the 
protocol, in compliance with J-GCP guidelines and U.S. 21 CFR 812.140. 
 Study Supply Accountability 
The investigator (and in Japan, the Device Storage Manager) will maintain records of the receipt 
and disposition of all investigational devices. When the enrollment is complete, the investigator (and in Japan, the Device Storage Manager) will be notified by [CONTACT_864113], in a timely manner, will return all study devices as directed by [CONTACT_864111]. 
 Data Transmittal and Record Retention 
Required data will be entered in the eCRF at the time of or as soon as possible after the subject visit or the availability of test results. Study sites will transcribe subject source data into eCRFs 
using a computerized electronic data capture (EDC) system. The EDC system is compliant with 
all relevant aspects of GCP. Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trails are built into the system to ensure accurate and complete data collection. Data will be transmitted via the Internet from investigational sites to a central site, utilizing state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms to ensure security and confidentiality. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_187994]-specified source documents (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], 
operative/procedural reports, and other source documents, as applicable) will be provided to the Data Coordinating Center as necessary. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_111027]-related documentation will also be retained at the site. 
The investigator will maintain the records of device disposition, final eCRFs, worksheets, and all 
other study-specific documentation (eg, study file notebooks or source documentation) until notified by [CONTACT_407729]. OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate will 
be contact[CONTACT_864114], so that arrangements can be made for 
the transfer of records. If a marketing application is not filed or is withdrawn, the investigator will maintain the records for at least [ADDRESS_1204976] retain the relevant records for the specified period. 
As this study is being conducted under a U.S. Investigational Device Exemption application, FDA 
regulations require all investigators participating in clinical drug trials to maintain detailed clinical data for one of the following periods: 
 At least 2 years following the date on which an Investigational Device Exemption 
Application is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA  
 2 years after OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate notifies the investigator that no further 
application is to be filed with the U.S. FDA 
The investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to this study without either (1) obtaining 
written permission from the sponsor or (2) providing an opportunity for the sponsor to collect such records. The investigator takes responsibility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard-copy source documents of all observations and data generated during this study. Such documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_864115], as provided by [CONTACT_2371].

the sponsor’s general responsibilities (21 CFR 812.40) and other responsibilities as agreed between 
DCRI and the sponsor, eg, selection of investigators (21 CFR 812.43), monitoring (21 CFR 312.46), and protocol amendments (21 CFR 312.35). OrbusNeich Medical and DCRI will ensure compliance with relevant local regulations and guidelines in the conduct of the study in centers outside of the [LOCATION_002]. 
 Informed Consent 
The investigator has both ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusion in this study is given a full explanation of the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects (or their LAR) before any study-related procedures (including any pretreatment procedures, such as preprocedure sedation) are performed or given.  
Written informed consent will be documented on an ICF approved by [CONTACT_864118]/IRB 
responsible for approval of this protocol. The ICF will conform to J-GCP regulations, FDA 
regulations in [ADDRESS_1204979] or his or her LAR will sign and date the EC/IRB-approved written ICF. The subject will receive a copy of the signed ICF. The original signed and dated ICF will be kept in the site’s regulatory file. Documentation of the subject’s informed consent for and 
participation in this trial will be noted in the subject’s medical record. 
 
If the subject is illiterate, an impartial witness is required to be present during the entire informed 
consent reading and discussion. Afterward, the subject should be asked to sign and date the ICF, if capable. The witness should also sign and date the ICF along with the individual who read and discussed the informed consent (ie, study staff personnel). 
OrbusNeich Medical  Protocol 
HARMONEE  Protocol Number: VP-0601  
 
Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, [ADDRESS_1204980]’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The 
communication of this information to the subject will be documented. 
 Confidentiality of Subjects 
Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the clinical study in a way that ensures the information can always be tracked back to the source data. For this purpose, a unique subject ID code (ID number and subject name [CONTACT_104846]) will be used that allows identification of all data reported for each subject. 
Subject information collected in this study will comply with the standards for protection of privacy 
of individually identifiable health information as promulgated by U.S. HIPAA and as mandated in Title 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 (U.S.) and J-GCP (Japan) . All records will be kept confidential, 
and the subject’s name [CONTACT_546161]. Subject records will not be released to 
anyone other than OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate or its designees and responsible regulatory 
authorities when requested. In all cases, caution will be exercised to assure the data are treated confidentially and that the subject’s privacy is protected. 
 Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information (HIPAA) 
An authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR § 164.102 et seq ) will be obtained from every trial subject before or at the 
time of enrollment. It will be presented to, and signed by, the subject at the same time as the ICF. The investigator is responsible for obtaining subjects’ (or their LARs’) authorizations and signatures and for explaining the elements of the HIPAA authorization form if necessary. 
HIPAA authorization may be either a separate form or included in the study ICF, dependent upon 
local requirements.  
The HIPAA authorization form will contain all elements required under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
By [CONTACT_2371], site IRB approval of the sponsor-provided authorization form for use in this study is not required, and no such approval will be sought or requested..
 
The investigator or the site will promptly inform OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate of any restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI of any subject to which the site or the investigator have agreed under the Privacy Rule. The investigator or the site will also promptly inform OrbusNeich Medical or their delegate of any written revocation of any subject’s HIPAA authorization.

 APPENDIX 1: OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IMAGE 
ANALYSIS PARAMETERS 
 Neointimal Quantification 
 Neointimal thickness: Strut level analysis of the neointimal thickness will be 
performed by [CONTACT_864131]. This measurement will take into consideration every strut available in a cross-section image at every 0.6-mm longitudinal interval. 
 Neointimal area and neointimal volume (mm
2 and mm3, respectively) will be 
obtained at 0.6-mm interval. 
 Binary strut coverage (%) obtained at 0.6-mm interval. 
 Stent Apposition 
 Malapposition and how prevalent along the stent (defined as space greater than the 
strut thickness between stent strut and vessel wall) 
 Malapposition length (mm): Malapposition length is defined as the longitudinal 
length of the OCT pullback with consecutive cross sectional frame with at least 1 malapposed strut in every frame. (Every frame interval is 0.2 mm.) 
 Longest malapposition distance (mm): Longest malapposition distance is defined 
as the longest distance from lumen contour to malapposed strut in each 
malapposition length. 
 Identification of the occurrence of segments with malapposition greater than 
20 microns in length (%). 
 Lumen Quantification 
 Lumen a rea (mm
2): Lumen area is defined as an inside area of luminal surface in 
cross sectional frame within stented segment. Lumen area of all analyzable cross 
sectional frames is measured. Maximum, minimum, and mean lumen area are collected in each pullback. 
o Stented segment is defined as the segment from distal stent edge to proximal stent edge. 
o Distal stent edge is defined as the first frame with stent struts visible in [ADDRESS_1204984] frame with stent struts visible in 3 
out of 4 quadrants. 
 Lumen diameter (mm): Lumen diameter is defined a diameter of the lumen area. 
Lumen diameter of all analyzable cross sectional frames in stented segments is 
measured. Maximum, minimum, and mean lumen diameter are collected in eac h 
pullback.

Confidential Amendment 1.02/March 16, 2015 
 113  L umen volume (mm3): Lumen volume is defined as inside volume of luminal 
surf
ace within stented segment. Lumen volume is calculated from lumen area and 
leng
th of stented segment in each pullback. 
 R eference area (mm2): Reference area is defined as an inside area of luminal surface 
in cross sectional frame within reference segment. 
o Dist al reference segment is defined as the segment of 5.0 mm distal from 
distal stent edge. 
o P roximal reference segment is defined as the segment of 5.0 mm proximal 
from proximal stent edge. 
o R eference area of all analyzable cross sectional frames in distal and 
proximal reference segment is measured. Maximum, minimum, and mean 
r
eference area are collected in each pullback. 
 R eference diameter (mm) 
o R eference d iameter is defined as a diameter of the reference area. 
o R eference d iameter of all analyzable cross sectional frames in d istal and 
proximal reference segment is measured. 
o Ma ximum, minimum,  and mean reference d iameter are collected in each 
pullback. 
 R eference volume (mm3)  
o R eference v olume is defined as inside volume of luminal surface within 
reference segment.  
o Reference v olume is calculated from reference area and length of reference 
segment in each pullback. 
 Stent Expansion 
 S tent expansion (%) vs reference vessel diameters. Optimal stent expansion is 
defined based on established intravascular ultrasound criteria of optimal stent 
expansion (in-stent minimal lumen area ≥ 90% of the average reference lumen area 
or ≥ 100 % of lumen area of the reference segment with the lowest lumen area). 
 I
ntrastent Residual Stenosis  
 Ma ximal stenosis within the stent. The region of interest/reference will be defined 
between the proximal and distal stent edges, and the minimal cross-section area will 
be
 automatically detected.  
 Minimal Lumen Area 
 I dentification of cases with minimal lumen area < 4 mm2. 
 Stent Length 
 I maged stent length (mm): Imaged stent length is defined as the length from distal 
stent edge to proximal stent edge in the OCT pullback.

 114  Edge Dissection  
 Edg e dissection: Edge dissection is defined as a disruption of the luminal vessel 
surface in the distal or proximal reference segment.  
 Any dissection on adjacent stent edge is documented in each pullback. 
 Dissec tion length (mm): Dissection length is defined as longitudinal length with 
dissection on adjacent stent edge.  
 Thrombus 
 P resence of thrombus: Thrombus is defined as intraluminal mass ≥ [ADDRESS_1204985] continuity with the surface of the vessel wall or a highly backscattered 
luminal protrusion in continuity with the vessel wall and resulting in signal-free 
shadowing. 
 Stent Deformation/Gap 
 S tent elongation or compression will be evaluated primarily by [CONTACT_864132]. 3D reconstructions may be 
informative as well as detail angiographic review.  
 S tent gap will be defined as the presence of any cross-section with at least 
2 quadrants without any stent strut in a region of supposed overlap.  
 P
resence of Neoatherosclerosis ( Figure 15) 
 Qua litative analysis of the intrastent material will be performed in order to 
differentiate between homogeneous predominantly fibrotic tissue (neointima) vs 
the presence of neoatherosclerosis, defined as tissue with characteristics suggestive 
of lipid and/or calcium.

 115  Semi-quantitative approach for detecting fibrin by [CONTACT_864133] 
(OD) of the tissue will be applied in representative frames of the proximal, mid, 
and distal thirds of the stent. Values of OD < 0.6 will be considered as positive for the presence of fibrin.

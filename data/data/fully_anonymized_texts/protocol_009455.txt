Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI ) is a widely used a unidimensional 15 -item scale that measures 
gastrointestinal symptom -specific anxiety (GSA). Preliminary and follow -up studies have found high 
internal consistency for the VSI, reporting a Cronbachs of about 0.93 and a mean inter -item c orrelation of 
0.47 (26, 27). Criterion and construct validity tests showed the VSI, when compared to the ASI and the 
HAD, to be the strongest predictor of current IBS symptom severity (26). Studies have also shown the VSI 
to have good concurrent, divergent  and discriminant validity (27).  Gastrointestinal Cognitions 
Questionnaire (Hunt, M., Ertel, E., Coello, J. & Rodriguez, L. (2014). Development and validation of the 
GI-Cognitions Questionnaire. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 38(4), 472 -482.) - The GI -Cog consists of 
18 self -report items that are rated on a 5 -point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Hardly) to 4 (Very much). The 
questionnaire consists of three subscales. The pain/life interference subscale (e.g., When I feel my GI 
symptoms acting up, I'm afrai d the pain will be excruciating and intolerable), the social anxiety subscale 
(e.g., If I have to get up and leave an event, meeting, or social gathering to go to the bathroom people will 
think theres something wrong with me), and the disgusts sensitivity subscale (e.g., The thought of fecal 
incontinence is terrifying. If it happened, it would be awful). The GI -Cog has been shown to have excellent 
internal consistency ( = .92) and test re -test reliability (r = .87, p .001) (Hunt, Ertel, Rodriguez et al., 20 12).

Standard questionnaire covering symptoms of depression, anxiety and tension/stress. Demographic 
survey - Participants will be asked to complete a survey of demographic information, that will help to 
determine whether the sample is representative and detect an y underlying differences between the wait -
list group and the intervention group. It will also aid the investigators in examining whether the effects of 
the intervention differ according to demographic characteristics. All questionnaires are standardized 
questionnaires that are readily available for use. Thousands of studies found in the literature utilize the 
DASS and PHQ9 to measure anxious and depressive symptoms, while a number of articles found in the 
literature have assessed and tested the reliability of the Visceral Sensitivity Index, the GI -Cog, the IBSQol, 
and the GSRS. The paper on the development and validation of the Fear of Food Questionnaire is currently 
in development. Thus, all measures being used are reliable standard questionnaires which hav e been tested 
and retested in empi[INVESTIGATOR_2292], and are the standard measures used to assess symptom severity and 
quality of life in patients with IBS.

Administration of Surveys and/or Process  
Describe the approximate time and frequency for administering surveys and/or evaluations. For surveys, 
questionnaires and evaluations presented to groups and in settings such as hi gh schools, focus group 
sessions or community treatment centers explain how the process will be administered and who will 
oversee the process. For instance, discuss the potential issues of having teachers and other school personnel 
administer instruments t o minors who are students especially if the content is sensitive in nature. Describe 
the procedure for audio and videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_405567]/or focus groups and the storage of the

Background  
Irritable Bowel Syndrome  is a functional GI disorder that responds poorly to traditional medical 
management. Various psychosocial, mind/body treatments have been shown to be quite efficacious when 
delivered in person, in group format, via the internet with limited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_721725]. These interventions include cognitive -behavioral therapy, gut directed hypnotherapy, mindfulness 
and acceptance based interventions and interoceptive exposure therapy. With the population increasingly 
interested in digital,  interactive interventions, the time is ripe to develop and test a digital app that can be 
downloaded to smart phones. Bold Health has developed such an app that combines the best of many 
treatment modalities. (For example, [CONTACT_558395], the develope r of gut directed hypnotherapy, wrote 
and recorded all the hypnotherapy imagery scripts for them.) They are interested in subjecting their app to 
rigorous testing to determine its acceptability and efficacy. They have agreed to make the app available at 
no cost to research participants in this trial.  
Study Design  
Phase*  
Not applicable  
Design  
The aim of the current study is to test the acceptability and efficacy of a novel digital app for IBS patients. 
The design of the study is experimental. There will be t wo experimental groups, an immediate treatment 
group and a waitlist control group. Once consented and enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned 
to either the immediate treatment group or the waitlist control group by [CONTACT_721729]. org. 
Participants in the immediate treatment group will be able to download the app at no cost.  At 8 weeks 
after enrollment, all participants in both groups will receive a battery of followup questionnaires (the same 
that they answered directly after cons enting in the beginning of the study as baseline measures). Upon 
receipt of the [ADDRESS_985776] -treatment follow -up questionnaires. Th e research method is 
experimental (randomized controlled trial) with a waitlist control. Participation in the study will last 
approximately 4.[ADDRESS_985777] with participan ts will be over the Internet via e -mail and electronic questionnaires through 
Qualtrics. All study questionnaires and use of the app will be completed at the subjects' convenience and 
in their own home. All electronic questionnaire responses will be gather ed via Qualtrics secure servers. 
Questionnaire responses will be de -identified from participants contact [CONTACT_558381] a 
code number in the main data file. Responses will be incorporated into a master database for further 
analysis. The m aster database will be password protected and only study investigators and the study PI

There are no documents attached for this item.  
If there is subject compensation, provide the schedule for compensation per study visit or session and 
total amount for entire participation, either as text or separate document  
If subjects are in the immediate treatment group, they will be compensated $20 for complet ing the 
posttreatment follow -up questionnaires in the week or so after they complete the program. They will be 
compensated a further $20 for completing the follow -up questionnaires 3 months after completing the 
program. Thus, their total compensation could  be as much as $40.  If they are in the waitlist control group, 
they will be compensated $20 for completing the follow -up questionnaires 8 weeks after the initial 
questionnaires. They will be compensated a further $20 for completing another set of follow -up 
questionnaires in the week or so after they complete the program. Finally, they will be compensated a 
further $20 for completing the follow -up questionnaires 3 months after completing the program. Thus, 
their total compensation could be as much as $60. P eople who are randomly assigned to the waitlist control 
group will be compensated more money to help make up for the fact that they had to wait for two months 
to access the app, and have to fill out the questionnaires one extra time.

Data confidentiality  
Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved in 
the study.  
x Computer -based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the 
use of access privileges and passwords.  
Prior to access to any study -related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
x Wherever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information.  
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at risk 
of criminal o r civil liability or cause damage to the subject's financial standing, employability, or 
liability.  
A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the subject 
and the study would be the consent document and the prima ry risk is a breach of confidentiality. 
(This is not an option for FDA -regulated research.)  
x Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because 
the research involves web -based surveys.  
Audio and/or video recor dings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects.  
Subject Confidentiality

Risk / Benefit  
Potential Study Risks  
There are some risks to taking part in this study. Participants may find themselves more aware of physical 
sensations and IBS symptoms for a period of time after using the app. They will also be asked to think in 
new ways about problems and situations that  might come up in their life, including IBS itself. Sometimes 
it can be uncomfortable or even scary to think about things differently, or to practice new skills. In the 
event that a subject indicates active suicidal ideation on the PHQ9 (a score of 2 or 3 on item 9) they will 
be contact[CONTACT_165480] [INVESTIGATOR_721727] a risk assessment and offer referrals to local mental health 
resources.  
Potential Study Benefits  
There are a few potential benefits of participating in this research study. Subjects will have the opportunity 
to use an evidence based digital self -help app for IBS at no cost that incorporates elements of a number of 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_721728]. The treatment may help reduce levels of depression, anxiety, 
and symptom severity as well as increase their overall quality of life. The purpose of this study is to test 
the acceptability and efficacy of a novel digital self -help app.  Apps like this one are proliferating in the 
digital space, and it is incredibly important that they be tested for actual efficacy.  The results of the study 
will provide researchers and clinicians with better understanding of whether or not digital self -help apps 
can be another treatment option for those with IBS.

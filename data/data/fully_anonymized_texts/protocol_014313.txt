VI. Study Information 
This study is designed to determine if the drug Zonisamide is more effective than placebo in 
decreasing alcohol use and PTSD symptoms when used in combination with Enhanced Cognitive 
Processing Therapy (E-CPT-C) in veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and 
comorbid alcohol dependence. 
 
VII. Study Design 
Background 
 In the general adult population, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has a lifetime 
prevalence rate ranging from approximately 5 - 10 % (Berlant 2004; Breslau 2001; Kessler et al 
1995).  It is a serious psychiatric disorder that tends to be chronic with one third of sufferers 
having symptoms more than ten years after experiencing the traumatic event (Berlant 2004; 
Iancu et al 2002). The symptom profile for PTSD includes clusters of symptoms that fall into 
three categories:  avoidance, arousal and re-experiencing.  Some groups are more likely than the 
general population to suffer from PTSD, and that includes veterans particularly those who have 
experienced combat. There has been an increase in the number of veterans served per year, and 
the rate of those with PTSD is increasing at a greater rate than other mental disorders (Hermes et 
al 2012). In FY 2011, 604,719 veterans treated in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
nationally were diagnosed with PSTD. In FY 2010, 485,843 veterans were treated in Mental 
Health Clinics with the diagnosis of PTSD, representing 42% of those treated in mental health 
clinics (Hermes et al 2012). This increase in numbers is accompanied by [CONTACT_615158]. 
 There is a high rate of comorbidity with alcohol dependence in individuals with PTSD 
(Jacobsen et al 2001). Among veterans, 11.8% of those returning from the recent conflicts 
reported alcohol misuse (Milliken et al 2007) and the rates were higher at post deployment than 
pre deployment. Individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD and alcohol dependence tend to be 
more impaired and have poorer treatment prognosis than those diagnosed with PTSD or alcohol 
dependence alone. While there are established pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_615118], there are no medications established to treat the patients who 
have comorbid disorders. 
Given the high priority for the treatment of PTSD, the Veterans Administration and the 
Department of Defense (DoD) have invested in making access to evidenced based treatments a 
priority. This includes Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), (CPT; (Resick and Schnicke 1992) ) 
which is based on an information processing theory of PTSD and is an integration of 
psychoeducation, cognitive therapy and imaginal exposure therapy. Currently, CPT is being 
rolled out nationally in a large dissemination project by [CONTACT_941] U.S Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA) and the DoD as one of the gold standard treatments for PTSD.  However, it's use in 
veterans with comorbid alcohol use disorders and in conjunction with pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_615119]. 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 3 
  
Alcohol Dependence: 
Limitations of Current Medications to Treat Alcohol Dependence: There are currently four Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications in current use for the treatment of 
alcoholism (disulfiram, naltrexone oral and naltrexone intramuscular, and acamprosate).  
However, all four have clinical limitations.  Disulfiram is an aversive agent and has been used 
clinically in the management of alcohol dependence for over 50 years.  Although our group 
found that disulfiram did improve some outcomes compared to no medication, in terms of 
alcohol use the only difference was in the consecutive days of abstinence (Petrakis et al 2005). 
Further, it is not accepted by [CONTACT_16983], and does not treat the comorbid condition. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_615120] 
(Mark et al 2003; Petrakis et al 2003; Thomas et al 2003).  In the most recent and largest trial to 
date, the COMBINE trial, naltrexone had only a modest effect on alcohol consumption (Anton et 
al 2006). The third medication, acamprosate, received FDA approval largely on the basis of 3 
large European trials (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2004). However, in the COMBINE 
trial, there was no advantage of acamprosate over placebo (Anton et al 2006).  An intramuscular 
version of naltrexone (Vivitrol) was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2006; studies suggest it is effective 
and well tolerated for treatment seeking alcohol dependent individuals (Garbutt et al 2005).  
However, as it is given intramuscularly, severe reactions at the site of injection have been 
reported; it is also prohibitively expensive. 
 Pharmacologic strategies using medications to treat alcohol use disorders in patients with 
comorbidity of PTSD and alcohol dependence have also been tried. A study using adjunctive 
naltrexone or disulfiram or the combination (Petrakis et al 2005) suggested that these agents 
confer a modest advantage over no medication to treat alcoholism in individuals with PTSD. In a 
study of antidepressants for veterans with PTSD, naltrexone did not add additional benefit to 
antidepressant treatment for alcohol consumption (Petrakis et al 2012). The medications to treat 
alcoholism have not been embraced by [CONTACT_615159] (Harris et al 
2010; Petrakis et al 2003); disulfiram in particular has limited patient and clinician acceptability.  
 Clearly, the development of new medications to treat alcohol dependence in veterans with 
PTSD is of high clinical importance and a high priority for the Departments of Defense and the 
Veterans Administration. Medications to treat alcohol dependence must be compatible within the 
context of the health care system where veterans are treated. Ideally, medications to treat 
alcohol dependence will also attenuate symptoms of PTSD or be able to be delivered in 
conjunction with other treatments for PTSD, such as the Evidence Based Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (EBT).  
 
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder : 
Zonisamide and other anticonvulsants in treatment for PTSD : The use of anticonvulsants 
represents a novel approach to treatment that may target symptoms of both alcohol dependence 
and PTSD. Chronic stress, as that experienced by [CONTACT_615160], can alter the 
balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes regulated by [CONTACT_615161].  
Heightened glutamate activation unregulated by [CONTACT_615162] (Armanini, Hutchins et al. 1990; Thomas 1995).  It has been hypothesized that 
such alterations can lead to frequent reexperiencing and arousal symptoms in individuals 
suffering from PTSD.  Using animal models, studies show topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (Khan and Liberzon 2004) 
and lamotragine (Mirza, Bright et al. 2005) attenuate anxiety responses in rats.   
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 4 
  A small clinical literature exists as well. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_615121]-on 
agent to treat veterans with refractory symptoms of PTSD (Akuchekian and Amanat 2004), and 
as a mono therapy to treat combat (Alderman, McCarthy et al. 2009), and non-combat symptoms 
of PTSD (Tucker, Masters et al. 2004; Andrus and Gilbert 2010).  A meta-analysis of studies 
using valproate in PTSD (Adamou, Puchalska et al. 2007) also suggests that anticonvulsants can 
be used successfully to treat PTSD.  While zonisamide has not been formally tested for PTSD, a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_615122]’s efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms.  
Given zonisamide’s similarity to topi[INVESTIGATOR_615123] a mood stabilizing and anxiolytic, zonisamide is worth 
exploring as a potential pharmacotherapy for symptoms of PTSD.  
 
Enhanced Cognitive Processing Therapy E-(CPT)-C: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT; 
(Resick and Schnicke 1992)) was developed for the treatment of PTSD for rape victims.  It is 
based on an information processing theory of PTSD and is an integration of psychoeducation, 
cognitive therapy and imaginal exposure therapy.  CPT has shown to be effective in reducing 
symptoms of PTSD in both individual and group therapy formats (Resick, Nishith et al. 2002) 
and improvements in PTSD symptoms appear to be sustained over time (Chard 2005).  Although 
CPT was originally developed and tailored for sexual assault victims, it has been successfully 
used among military veterans (Monson, Schnurr et al. 2006), incarcerated adolescents (Ahrens 
and Rexford 2002), and refugees (Schulz, Resick et al. 2006).  Currently, CPT is being rolled out 
nationally in a large dissemination project by [CONTACT_941] U.S Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
U.S. Department of Defense as one of the gold standard treatments for PTSD.   
 Traditional administration of CPT includes two imaginal exposure therapy sessions that 
utilize written accounts.  In order to facilitate emotional processing of traumatic experiences, 
patients are asked to write about their traumatic experiences, and to read them out loud.  Through 
the use of Socratic questioning, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_615124]’ erroneous conclusions about the 
events.  In the course of conducting a dismantling study, Resick et al. (Resick, Galovski et al. 
2008), developed CPT-C, the cognitive therapy only version of CPT. In CPT-C, the two sessions 
devoted to the writing and sharing of trauma accounts are eliminated and there is greater focus 
on Socratic questioning. Results from this dismantling study demonstrated that all three 
treatments (i.e., standard CPT, CPT-C, and imaginal exposure through written accounts) were 
effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD in the long run.  However, CPT-C was associated with 
the quickest reduction of depression and PTSD symptoms.  Additionally, a significant reduction 
in PTSD symptoms was observed for patients in the CPT-C condition at week 2.  This was not 
the case for patients in the standard CPT or the imaginal exposure treatment groups (Resick, 
Galovski et al. 2008).   
 Given the demonstrated efficacy of CPT-C for treating PTSD symptoms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_615125], it is fitting to develop a standardized treatment 
manual that integrates these treatment approaches.  Our group has been developi[INVESTIGATOR_106423] 
“Enhanced CPT-C (E-CPT-C)” a new standardized 12-week therapy that integrates CPT- C 
(cognitive therapy only version of CPT) with copi[INVESTIGATOR_615126]. In pi[INVESTIGATOR_615127], our group has developed a manual for its use and is rigorously testing its efficacy 
with standardized scales evaluating symptoms for PTSD (Clinician Administered PTSD 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 5 
 Symptom Scale-CAPS) and alcohol consumption using the Timeline Follow-back Method 
(TLFB), as well as mood ratings and quality of life data. The study has now enrolled 9 subjects 
to participate in treatment with this modified therapy. Our experience has shown that E-CPT- C 
can be used safely and effectively in veterans with PTSD and comorbid alcohol dependence.  
Findings from our preliminary data (please see preliminary data section with n=5 completers) 
has shown that E-CPT-C is effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD (significant decrease in 
CAPS from 60.5, sd=9.6 at baseline to 20.3, sd=19.[ADDRESS_815852] treatment; p=0.03).  Unfortunately, 
its efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption is less robust.  However we have reported on its 
effective use in combination with an established pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence, 
disulfiram; E-CPT-C was effective in treating symptoms of PTSD, and alcohol use decreased 
after initiation of disulfiram (see pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]). 
Based on those findings we propose to conduct a 12-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_615128] (400mg) as an adjunct to E-CPT-C for veterans with PTSD 
and comorbid alcohol dependence.  We propose to compare zonisamide to placebo in 
conjunction with E-CPT-C to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability and side effects - including 
cognitive effects.  
 
Significance: 
Veterans, especially those with combat experience, are at increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_615129]. Rates of PTSD among previously deployed Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring 
Freedom (OIF/OEF) veterans range from 14% to 21%. Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are the 
most common comorbid conditions among veterans with PTSD, and as many as 75% of combat 
veterans with lifetime PTSD also meet criteria for AUDs. Evidence suggests that the emerging 
pattern of PTSD and AUD comorbidity among OIF/OEF combat veterans is similar to that of 
combat veterans from previous wars. Veterans diagnosed with comorbid PTSD and alcohol 
dependence tend to be more impaired and have poorer treatment prognosis than those diagnosed 
with PTSD or alcohol dependence alone.   
 The study we are proposing has the potential to influence the way treatment of PTSD and 
alcohol dependence is delivered across the VA Healthcare Administration (VHA) and the 
Department of Defense.  The population we are going to study are veterans that have served in 
the military and may have participated in past or current military conflicts.  All participants will 
have current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) 
diagnoses of PTSD and alcohol dependence, two of the most common diagnoses among veterans 
particularly those who have experienced combat.   
 Currently Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and CPT-C (CPT without imaginal 
exposure) are being rolled out nationally in a large dissemination project by [CONTACT_615163] (VHA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) as one of two gold standards for 
the treatment of PTSD. Unfortunately, neither CPT nor CPT-C address the needs of patients with 
comorbid alcohol dependence.  Our study will further test a newly developed enhanced CPT- C 
(E-CPT-C) for veterans with PTSD and comorbid alcohol dependence. The study will test E-
CPT-C in combination with a new pharmacotherapy for veterans with PTSD and alcohol 
dependence. Zonisamide is a promising new pharmacotherapy for alcoholism. If effective, it has 
the potential to be prescribed as a first line medication for alcoholism for veterans. 
 
Overview:  
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 6 
  This is a randomized, controlled trial with 100 veterans diagnosed with PTSD and comorbid 
alcohol dependence. Veterans will be randomized to receive either zonisamide (400 mg) or 
placebo for 12 weeks in a double blind fashion. Randomization will be done using 3:1 ratio and 
will be performed by [CONTACT_615164] a random assignment in blocks of 4- 3 will be 
assigned to active medication and 1 to placebo.. Medication will be titrated over a 6 week 
titration phase followed by a 6 week treatment phase.  All veterans will receive E-CPT-C therapy 
for the 12 weeks of treatment; E-CPT-C will be provided by [CONTACT_615165] E-CPT-C. Veterans will be recruited primarily through 
advertisement, but also through the clinical facilities at the VA and from other collaborators.   
 
Experimental subjects:  
 Fifty veterans aged 21- 65 years old, with a current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, 
TR (DSM-IV) diagnosis of PTSD, assessed by [CONTACT_615166] (SCID) & Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS), and alcohol 
dependence (assessed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) will be enrolled.   
 
 
Study Procedures:   
Overview: After signing informed consent, participants will undergo an initial assessments and 
screening.  The screening will consist of careful psychiatric and medical evaluation that will also 
include screening for a veteran’s potential to develop alcohol withdrawal.  Those veterans who 
need treatment for alcohol withdrawal will be referred to our detoxification clinic as a first line 
of treatment.  Initial assessments will include a careful diagnostic evaluation completed by 
[CONTACT_615167], as well as collection of baseline assessments 
of alcohol use, PTSD symptoms and other characteristics.  Veterans will be randomized to 
zonisamide 400mg or placebo for [ADDRESS_815853] an interview with a member of theresearch staff whom 
is not providing the E-CPT-C training, receive a supply of medication, and complete self-report 
measures.  Veterans will be compensated for their participation using a schedule outlined below.  
There will be one follow up session 3 months after completion of treatment. 
 
Initial Assessments/Screening : In order to qualify for participation, veterans will complete the 
following: (I) Diagnostic  interview with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders ( 
SCID I), a comprehensive psychiatric interview schedule designed to assess psychiatric disorders 
in adults (First et al 1996). The SCID interview schedule covers the major Axis I psychiatric 
disorders defined in DSM-IV.  The SCID permits comprehensive assessment of substance use as 
well as comorbid psychiatric disorders.  (2) Drinking patterns will be assessed using The TLFB 
method (Sobell and Sobell 1992). This will allow documentation of the degree and frequency of 
daily alcohol consumption and smoking pattern.  (3) PTSD symptom will be assessed using the 
Clinician Administered PTSD Assessment (CAPS ), and  (4) Veterans will have a medical history 
and physical examination by [CONTACT_54858], blood tests (including SMAC-20, serum 
gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GGT), CBC with differential, thyroid function tests,and  TSH), 
urinalysis, urine toxicology, and an electrocardiogram (EKG).  It is anticipated, however, that 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 7 
 mild to moderate elevations in liver function tests will be common in alcohol dependent subjects. 
Veterans with LFT abnormalities that do not exceed 3 times normal values will be included.  
 
Study Treatments:  
Medication Treatment : Zonisamide, (target 400 mg) will be titrated upward over 6 weeks. 
Dosing will be given once daily and veterans on placebo will be given identical number, color 
and consistency of capsules as those on active medication. Below is the proposed dosing 
schedule, although we will make adjustments if side effects occur: 
 
Zonisamide 400mg/day  
Week 1:  Days 1-7 ZON 100mg, +      = TOTAL 100mg  
Week 2:  Days 1-7  ZON 200mg, +    = TOTAL 200mg 
Week 3:  Days 1-7 ZON 200mg,  +    = TOTAL 200 mg 
Week 4:  Days 1-7 ZON 300mg,  +    = TOTAL 300 mg  
Week 5:  Days 1-7 ZON 300mg,  +     = TOTAL 300 mg 
Week 6:  Days 1-7  ZON 400mg,  +    = TOTAL 400 mg 
Week 7-12:  Days 1-42 ZON 400mg,  +    = TOTAL 400 mg 
Week 13-14 : TAPER by 100 mg every 3 days for a total of 2 weeks. 
 
Medication Adherence:  We employ a number of strategies to insure maximum compliance with 
the medication regiment. Before starting medication each participant meets with the nurse to go 
over medication regiment, possible side effects and importance of compliance with study 
medication. All medications will be dispensed in blister packs, clearly labeled with date and time 
(am or pm) for administration.  Within the first week, each participant will receive an additional 
courtesy phone call from the nurse inquiring about any problems or issues relevant to taking the 
study medication.  Participants will be given the option to come in within the first week and 
discuss with the nurse any issues relating to medication.  Before each visit each participant will 
receive a reminder phone call about his appointment and is also reminded to return the blister 
pack with the study medication regardless of whether any medication is left over.  At the 
beginning of each study visit the left over medication will be counted and the participant will be 
prompted to report any doubling of dose or missing days of study medication.  As a final 
measure of compliance participants are told that a medication blood levels may be drawn.   
 
Justification for zonisamide dose: Zonisamide is approved for the adjunctive treatment of partial 
seizures in adults with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Zonisamide has shown efficacy or potential efficacy in treating 
bipolar depression or subtypes of bipolar disorder (Anand et al 2005; Baldassano et al 2004; 
Ghaemi et al 2006; Kanba et al 1994; McElroy et al 2005; McIntyre et al 2002), and 
demonstrated efficacy in weight reduction in overweight individuals, and potential efficacy in 
the treatment of binge eating (Gadde et al 2003; Li et al 2005; McElroy et al 2004). It has been 
used as a potential treatment for alcohol use in several clinical trials, including the pi[INVESTIGATOR_615130]. The usual dose of zonisamide is 200-[ADDRESS_815854] its efficacy at 400 mg, and a large ongoing 
clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov) is using [ADDRESS_815855] chosen a dose of 400mg. 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 8 
  
Pharmacy Procedures: Veterans will start study medication on the day of randomization. The 
authorized prescribers of zonisamide for the study are Ismene Petrakis, M.D., Louis Trevisan, 
M.D., Albert Arias, M.D., Kevin Severino, MD and Ellen Edens, M.D. The research pharmacy 
will dispense the medications and will take back any medications that are not used, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
record of used and unused medications.  In addition to that we will record at each visit that the 
medication was dispensed, the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], and if any medications were missed during the 
previous week. The study nurse will administer the first dose and veterans will be asked to stay 
in the research office for approximately 1 hour after the dose is administered. The zonisamide 
will be started at a low dose (see schedule above) and titrated upward based on the outlined 
schedule.  The target dose for the zonisamide will be 400mg/day. Veterans will meet with the 
study nurse every visit to discuss any side effects of the medications, and will do study 
assessments with the research personnel. If veterans experience side effects that cannot be 
managed by [CONTACT_615168] (i.e. taking at bedtime, etc.), veterans 
may have their medication titration either held or the medication dose may be decreased. The 
study psychiatrist (who is blinded to the condition, but may request a dose decrease to the next 
lowest dose) and the research pharmacist (who is not blinded, but who has no contact [CONTACT_615169]) will do this. The psychiatrist will contact [CONTACT_615170] a decrease in dose.  
In case of an emergency, the blind will be broken and appropriate medical care initiated.  Since 
this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the proposed dosing schedule will be evaluated and may be modified 
depending on the findings from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
CPT:  Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a manualized 12-session therapy that combines 
cognitive and exposure-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_615131] (Pettinati 
et al 2000).  The stated goal of CPT is “to assist the client in refraining from assimilating 
(distorting the event to fit prior beliefs) and in accommodating schemas to the new information 
without over-accommodating" (p. 17; Resick & Schnicke, 1996 (Resick and Schnicke 1996)).  
CPT uses Socratic questioning targeting distorted cognitions such as self-blame, hindsight bias, 
and other guilt cognitions.  CPT-C is focused on the cognitive components of the therapy without 
exposure.  CPT-C was chosen over CPT for the following reasons: 1) the exposure component of 
CPT may place participants at greater risk of increased drinking to cope with increased PTSD 
symptoms, 2) CPT-C appears to have a higher retention rate and more rapid decline in PTSD and 
depressive symptoms.  
  
E-CPT-C: Based on previous work by [CONTACT_116225], CPT- C (Resick et al 2007) will be 
enhanced in the following ways to address alcohol use:  
1) Additional psychoeducation about alcohol use as an avoidance of PTSD symptoms and the 
importance of not avoiding thoughts and feelings. 
2) Clinician administered weekly breathalyzer to measure blood alcohol level (BAL). 
3) Integration of alcohol use as an avoidance of PTSD symptoms (e.g., A-B-C, challenging 
beliefs, patterns of problematic thinking worksheets to be completed on alcohol use) and 
role of drinking throughout treatment. 
4) Use and collection of daily diaries of alcohol use. 
 
Version 1_1/24/ [ADDRESS_815856] the therapy or train other members of our team. Independent 
assessment of veterans’ PTSD and alcohol dependence symptoms will be obtained by [CONTACT_615171]; this is being done to ensure that we obtain unbiased ratings of 
PTSD and alcohol dependence symptoms. 
 
Justification for use of E-CPT- C: This intervention will be used for the following reasons: (1) 
CPT-C with modification is able to provide an integrative intervention throughout treatment; (2) 
both CPT and CPT-C have been effectively adapted for use in veterans, and are part of a national 
dissemination project; and (3) most importantly, the efficacy of CPT has been established in four 
separate randomized controlled trials.   
 
Confirmation of self reported alcohol use: Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) (B,T,F) provides a sensitive 
and reliable biomarker of recent alcohol consumption and is detectable in urine for up to three 
days after drinking depending upon the amount consumed (Jatlow and O'Malley 2010; Sarkola et 
al 2003; Wurst et al 2006; Wurst et al 2004). Comparison of urine EtG levels during treatment at 
weeks 4, 8, [ADDRESS_815857] for extremes in urinary dilution.  
 
  
Research Objectives: 
Specific Primary Aim # 1 : To determine if zonisamide is more effective than placebo in 
decreasing alcohol use when used in combination with E-CPT-C in veterans with PTSD and 
comorbid alcohol dependence.  
 
  1a. We hypothesize that zonisamide will be more effective than placebo when used in 
combination of E-CPT-C, in reducing heavy drinking days measured by [CONTACT_9859]-
back Method (TLFB). 
 1b. We hypothesize that zonisamide will be more effective than placebo when used in 
combination of E-CPT-C, in reducing drinks per week as measured by [CONTACT_9859]-back 
Method (TLFB). 
 1c. We hypothesize that zonisamide will be more effective than placebo when used in 
combination of E-CPT-C, in reducing craving for alcohol using the Obsessive Compulsive 
Drinking Scale (OCDS). 
 
Exploratory Aim #1 : To determine if the combination of zonisamide with E-CPT-C is more 
effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of PTSD. PTSD symptoms will be assessed weekly 
using the PCL, and biweekly using the CAPS. 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 10 
  
Exploratory Aim #2: To determine if zonisamide can be prescribed safely and effectively in 
veterans who are receiving E-CPT-C. Treatment retention as well as side effects will be 
monitored.

4) Veterans taking Clozaril and lamotrigine.  Veterans taking more than one anticonvulsant 
will ha
ve an additional blood draw at week 2 to more closely monitor their health. 
5) Veterans with a history of allergy to zonisamide or hypersensitivity to sulfonamides.  
6) Veter
ans already receiving CPT. 
 
IX. Subject Recruitment and Screening 
 The target sample is 100  veterans diagnosed with PTSD and comorbid alcohol dependence. 
Veterans will be recruited from: 1) advertisement, 2) from PTSD clinics and patient units at VA 
Connecticut Healthcare System (VACT), and 3) from the group of patients entering treatment for 
alcohol use disorders at VACT Substance Abuse Treatment Program. We  will review existing 
medical records to identify potential participants.  Outreach will also be conducted to local 
Veteran Centers, where staff from VACT consults. The PTSD staff has also been involved in 
outreach to the community for returning OIF/OEF veterans.  Each veteran will be carefully 
screened and assessed using the inclusion and exclusion criteria found above in Section 8. 
 
X. Informed Consent Process 
Version 1_1/24/ [ADDRESS_815860] questions answered. Staff (at several time points before starting medication) 
will question the subject about key ethical concerns and risks of the study to ascertain whether or 
not the subject actually understands the risks of the study and their rights. Informed consent w ill 
be obtained in private, and subjects will be reminded that they should only participate if they 
truly feel motivated to do so of their own volition, and not out the influence of other parties, 
including their regular treatment team. Subjects will be reminded that they have the option to 
stop participation in the study at any point with no fear or concern about retribution from any 
parties. Veterans will be given a post consent test to evaluate their understanding of the 
procedure. For subjects who provide incorrect answers to any of the test items, the research staff 
will review the correct answers with the subject and show the subject where the correct answers 
are found in the consent form. Those who get more than 60% of the questions wrong and are stil l 
unable to understand the procedure after reviewing it with the research staff will be excluded 
from the study.  
 
XI. Data Collection and Analysis 
Initial assessment will include the following measures: (1) Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) 
(Skinner and Allen 1982)  is a self-report measure of alcohol dependence consisting of 25 items 
and will be used to measure the degree of dependence and control for possible group differences 
in alcohol dependence. (2) Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Scale (CIWA, Ar) (Sullivan 
et al 1989) is an interviewer driven measure of alcohol withdrawal consisting of 10 items rated 
on a scale from 0 to 7 and will be used to rule out withdrawal symptoms requiring medical 
treatment. (3) Demographic information will be collected including contact [CONTACT_615172]-
designated racial and ethnic data, in accordance with National Institute of Health guidelines. 
 
Study Assessments will include the following: (all  measures – except the CAPS which will be 
used every two weeks - will be administered on each study visit, every week).   
(a)  The Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) method (Sobell and Sobell 1992) will be used to 
document the degree of daily alcohol consumption and to monitor the use of other substances 
during 12 weeks of treatment. 
(b) Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) (Anton et al 1995)) will be used to 
measure alcohol craving throughout the study.  The OCDS consists of two subscales and 
measures obsessive and compulsive thoughts related to drinking. 
(c)  Clinicians Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) will be used to obtain data on the 
frequency and severity of PTSD symptoms and will be administered every two weeks. 
(d) Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) (Hamilton 1960) will be used to assess the degree 
and severity of depressive symptomatology.  Given the overlap of PTSD and depression this 
scale will serve as another measure of psychiatric symptomatology.    
(e)  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-C) will be used to measure PTSD 
symptoms every week on each visit.  The PCL-C is a self-report scale that shares similar 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 12 
 reliability with the CAPS. (Weathers et al 1996) 
(f)  Modified Version of the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events 
(SAFTEE) will be used to collect information on emergent side effects and their severity (weeks 
1-12).  This modified version will include, among other side effects, symptoms associated with 
zonisamide including: fatigue, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, nausea, and 
agitation/irritability.  
 
Lab Assessments will include 12 -lead electrocardiogram, complete blood count, comprehensive 
metabolic profile, thyroid function testing, SMAC-20, urinalysis, urine toxicology screening for 
drugs of abu se, rapid plasma regain, gamma glutamyl transferase (γ -GGT), and serum pregnancy 
testing (for women of child bearing age). Blood will be drawn at baseline and weeks 4,8,12, and 
25.  Additionally, blood will be drawn at week 2 for veterans taking multiple anticonvulsants in 
order to more closely monitor their health. Urine will be measured weekly for pregnancy tests 
and toxicology screening.  
 
EtG Storage and Analysis:  The EtG assays will be performed at Yale in [CONTACT_615179]’s laboratory. 
The Yale group is currently characterizing the relationship between EtG concentration over time 
and their inter-individual and within individual variation over a range of ethanol doses 
(RO1AA018664) to develop more definitive cut-offs that can be used to confirm no heavy 
drinking. However, current knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of EtG allows the following 
conclusions. A concentration <100 ng/mL indicates that any alcohol consumption, even very 
light drinking, during the past 12 hrs. (e.g. the night before) is unlikely (Wurst et al 2006). A 
concentration >500 ng/mL, on the other hand refutes a self report of "no heavy drinking" in the 
past 1-3 days (Helander et al 2009) wi th several unavoidable limitations intrinsic to the 
pharmacokinetics of EtG. A low EtG concentration could be either consistent with light drinking 
during the prior 24 hours or with heavy drinking several days previously. Even light drinking on 
the day of the clinic visit, a short time prior to sample collection, could exceed 500ng/mL. Thus, 
final interpretations regarding heavy drinking for biochemical confirmation of self-report require 
integration with information from self-reports about the recency and quantity of alcohol 
consumed. [CONTACT_615179] and a second reviewer will make these determinations without knowledge 
of the veteran’s clinical course or treatment condition.    
Aliquots of spot urine samples will be stored at -20 degrees within one hour of collection 
and subsequently transferred to a -70 degree freezer for longer-term storage. EtG will be 
measured using LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in the negative ion mode 
with deuterium labeled EtG as internal standard. This procedure, modified from published assays 
(Weinmann et al 2004; Wurst et al 2004) is validated and running.

Data Analysis: 
 Descriptive statistics and graphs will be used to summarize the data on all randomized 
veterans. All continuous variables will be examined for adherence to the normal distribution 
using normal probability plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Transformations will be applied 
if needed. If normality is not satisfied and transformations do not help with achieving normality 
alternative analytic strategies will be considered such as generalized estimating equations (GEE) 
or nonparametric methods for repeated measures analysis (Brunner et al 2002). For the primary 
hypotheses we will use mixed effects models to assess change in alcohol consumption and 
craving over time. Study medication (zonisamide vs placebo) and time (in weeks and months) 
will be used as a within-subject factors. The primary outcome drinking variable will be heavy 
drinking days and drinks per week calculated from the timeline data.   
 If significant differences between groups are observed Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc tests 
will be performed to test group differences at each time point.  The same model will be used to 
examine changes in craving (using the OCDS) and PTSD symptoms (using the PCL every week 
and the CAPS every two weeks) over time.   
 
XII. Labeling and Storage of Data and Specimens 
All data and blood specimens will be stored without direct identifiable information, but 
will be identifiable via a linking code. Blood will not be used for the purpose of establishing cell 
lines. Any hard copy records associated with the study will be kept in locked offices.  The 
secured research records are labeled with code numbers only (names and other identifying 
information are kept separate from research records). Access to hard copy data is only given to 
Version 1_1/24/ [ADDRESS_815861] access to the samples and their storage.  Coded blood samples are stored in 
clinic-specific refrigerators and freezers, which are located in secure rooms. As per routine all 
electronic files (e.g., database, spreadsheet) will be password protected.  Any computer hosting 
such files will have a BIOS password to prevent access by [CONTACT_50000]-authorized users. Furthermore, for 
systems not running Windows 2000/XP, a password-protected screen saver will be installed and 
configured to activate ten minutes after the computer has been idle.  
 
XIII. Risk and Injury 
Zonisamide   
 Zonisamide is approved for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Zonisamide has shown efficacy or potential efficacy in treating bipolar depression or 
subtypes of bipolar disorder (Anand et al 2005; Baldassano et al 2004; Ghaemi et al 2006; Kanba 
et al 1994; McElroy et al 2005; McIntyre et al 2002), and demonstrated efficacy in weight 
reduction in overweight individuals, and potential efficacy in the treatment of binge eating 
(Gadde et al 2003; Li et al 2005; McElroy et al 2004). It has been used as a potential treatment 
for alcohol use in several clinical trials, including our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The usual dose across studies 
is 200-[ADDRESS_815862] zonisamide is effective at 400 mg - a large ongoing clinical trial 
(clinicaltrials.gov) is also using [ADDRESS_815863] common adverse events observed in clinical studies (that were more common than 
placebo) were: fatigue (17% vs. 7% for placebo), decreased appetite (13% vs. 6%), dizziness 
(13% vs. 7%), headache (10% vs. 8%), nausea (9% vs. 6%), and agitation/irritability (9% vs. 
4%).   Although psychosis occurred at a rate of approximately 2% in trials involving patients 
with a seiz
ure disorder, this was likely related to the patients’ seizure disorder. There were no 
reports of psychosis in a trial of zonisamide for obesity. Rare or less common effects associated 
with zonisamide include a sensation of numbness, tingling, or prickling in parts of the body (less 
than 1%), a distorted sense of taste (2% vs. 0%) difficulty concentrating or remembering (4% vs. 
0%), vomiting (3% vs. 0%), and trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (3% vs. 0%).  Less common, but not rare, side 
effects include kidney stones, which were reported in 4% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_615134]-seizure medication in clinical trials.  No kidney stones were 
reported during a small trial of zonisamide in the treatment of alcohol problems. Drinking an 
adequate amount of fluids is recommended while taking zonisamide. This may reduce the risk of 
kidney stones. Rare but potentially serious reactions that occurred more often than with placebo 
in epi[INVESTIGATOR_615135], and severe allergic or toxic 
reactions. There are anecdotal reports of zonisamide worsening mood symptoms in psychiatric 
patients, including those with bipolar disorder.  Therefore, we will monitor symptoms frequently 
and closely in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]. 
Sometimes zonisamide may cause a condition known as “metabolic acidosis” in some 
patients, which is a dangerous change in the acid and base balance of the blood. Generally, 
z
onisamide will cause this condition early in treatment if it is going to occur at all, but it may 
develop at any time during treatment. Symptoms of metabolic acidosis are; breathing fast 
(hyperventilation), fatigue, and loss of appetite. More severe symptoms and risks of this 
condition include symptoms include an irregular heart beat, unconsciousness, and death.  
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 15 
  
 
Placebo 
 There are approved medications for the treatment of alcohol dependence and they include 
disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and intramuscular) and acamprosate.  However, all have potential 
limitations, including low patient acceptability (disulfiram), modest efficacy (naltrexone), high 
cost and poor acceptance in treatment programs (IM naltrexone)  (Petrakis et al 2003), and 
questionable efficacy (acamprosate).  Nevertheless, in accordance with IRB policy, the 
alternatives to participation will be clearly described to potential veterans and those that would 
prefer to take these medications will be referred to an appropriate facility. Additionally, all 
efforts will be made to monitor adverse consequences, and to withdraw veterans from the study 
if clinically appropriate. 
 
CPT  
 Previous research shows that PTSD symptoms may increase somewhat during the early part 
of CPT-C.  This is expected because participants are thinking and talking more about their 
traumatic experience(s). However, in most instances this is a transient effect.  If there is an 
increase in PTSD symptoms participants may receive additional support.  They will be provided 
with a wallet card that has contact [CONTACT_615173], and will be encouraged to call 
their clinician for assistance. 
 
 
Venipuncture and Urine Collection   
The risks of blood drawing include pain, bruising, blood clots and rarely infection. The 
risks are substantially decreased when performed by [CONTACT_615174]. Urine specimens are collected primarily as safeguards to veterans and should add no 
risks other than those normally associated with these procedures.  
 
Measures to minimize risks 
 As required by [CONTACT_615175] a clear and detailed plan for monitoring the 
safety of veterans participating in this study.  This protocol follows the standard VA and Yale 
IRB format for reporting any adverse event to the IRB and other researchers, which includes a 
grading system to determine if an adverse event is related to the study medication, and its 
severity.  In addition, the PI (Ismene Petrakis, MD) will conduct a review of all adverse events 
upon completion of each study veteran as well as the frequency and severity of the adverse 
events on a quarterly basis. Frequent (weekly and more if needed) monitoring and assessment of 
subjects by [CONTACT_615176]. Adverse events will be monitored and tracked, recorded, and reported as required to the 
IRB, and other oversight entities if required. Strict separation of research and clinical 
components of the study will help to reduce bias from such sources as patients wanting either to 
deny continued problems, and/or to please the treatment team. Multiple sources of information 
will be used to detect such biases as it may occur. 
 This study will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_615177] (CTNA) (a NIAAA funded grant, PI= John Krystal, 
MD) on a twice yearly schedule. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the CTNA has 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 16 
 procedures that follow the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, and consists of the 
following individuals.  Robert Swift, MD, PHD of Brown University, an expert in the clinical 
neuroscience of alcoholism and a practicing psychiatrist is the head of the Committee.  The othe r 
members include Robert Stout, PhD of Decision Sciences Institute, Robert Hitzemann, PhD of 
the University of Oregon Health Center, Lisa Newton, PhD Professor of Applied Ethics in the 
department of Philosophy at Fairfield University and Howard Zonana, MD, Professor of 
Psychiatry at Yale University and Lecturer, Yale Law School. 
 In addition, [CONTACT_615180] will serve as the Research Monitor and her functions will 
include the following: 
1.     observing recruitment and enrollment procedures and the consent process for 
individuals, groups or units,  
2.     overseeing study interventions and interactions,  
3.     reviewing monitoring plans;  
4.     overseeing data matching, data collection, and analysis 
5.  discussing the research protocol with the investigators, interview human subjects, 
and consult with others outside of the study about the research;  
6.     shall have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual 
human subjects from a research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary 
to protect the safety and well-being of human subjects until the IRB can assess 
the monitor's report.  
7.     shall have the responsibility to promptly report their observations and findings 
to the IRB or other designated official.  
 
As noted ab ove, precautions for pregnant or reproductive age women are in accordance 
with VA and Yale IRB (HIC) requirements and this will be monitored as part of the DSMP. All 
adverse events in the taper/follow-up time-period will be reported to the IRBs, with serious 
adverse events being reported within 48 hours. If during the study or at the time of tapering off 
of the medication the participant requires more significant care for worsening of either drinking 
or other psychiatric symptoms he/she may be referred to: 1) outpatient services, specific for 
either PTSD and/or drinking (evidence based therapy, pharmacotherapy, substance abuse 
services), 2) acute inpatient unit, 3)day program, 4) residential program, 5) psychiatric 
emergency services.  
All unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse events  
related to participation in the study and subject deaths related to participation in the study will be 
promptly reported by [CONTACT_648] (301-619 -2165), by [CONTACT_6968] ( [EMAIL_145] ), or by 
[CONTACT_6972] (301-619 -7803) to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC, Office of Research Protections, Human Research 
Protection Office.  A complete written report will follow the initial notification.  In addition to 
the methods above, the complete report will be sent to the U.S. Army Medical Research and 
Materiel Command, ATTN: MCMR- ZB-PH, [ADDRESS_815864], Fort Detrick, Maryland [ZIP_CODE]-
5012.” 
 
 
XIV. Benefits 
This study will not be of direct benefit to subjects. However this study may be of help in 
the future to veterans who have comorbid AD and PTSD. 
Version 1_1/24/ 15 Page 17 
  
XV. Compensation 
 All veterans will be compensated for their participation.  Veterans will receive a check/ 
direct deposit payment at the end of each appointment: $20 at the screening appointment, $30 
baseline appointment, $30 at each weekly appointment, $50 for the Week 12 assessment, $30 for 
the Week 13 assessment, $30 for the Week 14 assessment, and $30 for the follow-up. Veterans 
can receive up to a total of $[ADDRESS_815865] data collection forms. Subjects will be informed that 
medical evaluations, including physicals, EKGs, and urine/blood tests will be administered 
through the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615136]. Finally, subjects will be 
informed that a hard copy of the consent form will be placed in their paper record. An electronic 
progress note citing their participation in this research study will be entered in their electronic 
chart upon entry into and exit from, the study. 
Accurate and complete study records will be maintained and made available to 
representatives of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. These 
representatives are authorized to review research records as part of their responsibility to protect 
human research volunteers. Research records will be stored in a confidential manner so as to 
protect the confidentiality of subject information.

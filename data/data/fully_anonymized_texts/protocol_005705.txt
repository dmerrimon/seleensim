PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Protocol Number/Title Phase II Study of Pembrolizum ab plus SurVaxM for 
glioblastoma at first recurrence 
 
Study Phase Phase 2  
Brief 
Background/Rationale 
 Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 
(IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high specific ity of 
binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) recep tor, thus 
inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell dea th ligand 
1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2 ) .  
Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab h as high 
affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1.   
 Survivin is a 16.5 kDa intracellular protein that b elongs to 
the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. It  acts in 
concert with the mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_191164] o rganizing 
center (MTOC) during the G2/M phase of cell cycle 
progression. Survivin has also been shown to modula te the 
function of a number of terminal effector cell deat h 
proteases (caspases) leading to an inhibition of ap optosis. 
Although expressed during fetal development, surviv in is 
rarely detectable in the normal tissues of adult or ganisms.  
This will be a phase II clinical study with a 10 pa tient, 
toxicity run-in. The study follows upon the recentl y 
completed clinical study I-171010, entitled: Phase I study 
of safety, tolerability and immunological effects o f SVN53-
67/M57- KLH (SurVaxM) in patients with survivin-
positive malignant gliomas. All patients will recei ve the 
study drug combination consisting of SurVaxM and 
pembrolizumab (PEM) with no randomization, 
stratification or dose escalation.  
Agent Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM. 
Disease Sites/Conditions Recurrent glioblastoma in the CNS. 
Objectives Primary : Assess clinical activity of Pembrolizumab and 
SurVaxM in patients with recurrent glioblastoma 
using progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) . 
Secondary : Assess safety and tolerability of  
Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM in patients with 
recurrent glioblastoma. 
Tertiary : Measure both cellular and humoral immune 
responses during concurrent administration 
of Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM in patients with recur rent 
glioblastoma.  
Estimated Study Duration 3 years 
Duration of Participation 3 years

[ADDRESS_227322] common type of primary bra in cancer [Venur, 2015]. The 5-year 
survival rate for patients with glioblastoma is 3.3 % substantiating the great need for improved 
therapy. Following first recurrence, progression fr ee survival with second-line therapy at six 
months (PFS6) is about 15% [Venur, 2015].  There is  no therapy in recurrent glioblastoma that 
is associated with any survival benefit and there i s an urgent need for better therapeutic options. 
Immunotherapy is one promising option for patients with cancer. This is being explored in 
glioblastoma and a number of forms of active specif ic vaccination and immune checkpoint based 
approaches have been devised and are being investig ated in glioblastoma.  
1.2 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting 
its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1  (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 
(PD-L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembr olizumab has high affinity and potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD-1.  Pembrolizumab has an a cceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunot herapy for advanced malignancies.  
Keytruda ® (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
indications because of its mechanism of action to b ind the PD-[ADDRESS_227323] immune surveillance functi on in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades [Disis, 2010].  Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells to FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (T-regs) corre lates with improved prognosis and long-term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as: ovarian, c olorectal, and pancreatic; hepatocellular and 
renal cancers and  malignant melanoma.  Tumor-infil trating lymphocytes can be expanded ex 
vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumo r responses in cancers such as melanoma 
[Dudley et al., 2005; Hunder et al., 2008]. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_227324] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on  the cell surface of activated T-cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or  excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) 
superfamily member related to cluster of differenti ation 28 (CD28) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) that has been shown t o negatively regulate antigen receptor 
signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and /or PD-L2) [Greenwald et al., 2005; 
Okazaki et al., 2001]. 
The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved [Zha ng et al., 2004].  PD-1 and its family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins cont aining an Ig-variable–type (IgV-type) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytopla smic tail responsible for the binding of 
signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
12  
switch motif.  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 r ecruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and 
SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to 
the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as  CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C-theta 
(PKCθ), and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (Z AP70), which are involved in the CD3 T-
cell signaling cascade [Okazaki et al., 2001; Chemn itz et al., 2004; Sheppard et al., 2004; and 
Riley, 2009].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]-[ADDRESS_227325] from, that of CTLA-4, because both molecul es regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_55509] [Parry et al., 2005; Francisco, 2010].  As  a consequence, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention in r ecurrent glioblastoma.  
PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL PROPERTIES AN D 
FORMULATION 
For each individual trial, clinical supplies are to  be stored in accordance with specific 
instructions on the label. 
Chemical Properties 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized anti-PD-1 mAb of the I gG4/kappa isotype with a stabilizing 
S228P sequence alteration in the fragment crystalli zable (Fc) region.  Pembrolizumab binds to 
human PD-1 and blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands.  The theoretical molecular 
weight of the polypeptide is 146,288 daltons, and i ts theoretical isoelectric point is7.5.  The 
parental murine antihuman PD-1 antibody (hPD-1.09Ǻ)  was produced by [CONTACT_191203]-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).  The pembrolizum ab antibody was generated by 
[CONTACT_191204] l Research Council (Cambridge, United 
Kingdom) using complementarity determining region g rafting technology (US Patent No. 
5,225,539).  The gene segments encoding the variabl e heavy and light chains of pembrolizumab, 
as well as human IgG4, were codon-optimized, synthe sized, and ligated into a vector. 
A single expression plasmid, pAPD11V1-GA, was const ructed for the expression of both the 
heavy and light antibody chains of pembrolizumab.  The nucleotide sequences encoding the 
heavy and light chains, along with their respective  promoters and poly A signal sequences, have 
been confirmed by [CONTACT_191205].  The pAPD1 1V1-GA expression vectorwas 
subsequently used to transfect CHO-DXB-11 cells for  the development of the pembrolizumab 
producing cell line.

Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized mAb d esigned to block the interaction 
between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  Pem brolizumab is an IgG4/kappa isotype 
with a stabilizing sequence alteration in the Fc re gion.  The theoretical molecular weights of 
the heavy and light chains derived from the amino a cid sequences, excluding glycosylation, 
are 49.4 kiloDaltons (KDa) and 23.7 KDa, respective ly.  The antibody is heterogeneously 
glycosylated at asparagine 297 within the Fc domain  of each heavy chain, yielding a 
molecular weight of approximately 149 KDa for intac t pembrolizumab. 
 
Physio-Chemical Properties  
 
Pembrolizumab drug substance (DS) is produced at se veral locations to yield:  a partially 
formulated aqueous solution stored under refrigerat ed (2°C to 8°C) conditions at a 
concentration of 40.0 to 50.0 mg/mL in 10 millimola r (mM) histidine buffer, pH 5.2 to 5.8, 
and a fully formulated aqueous solution stored froz en (–40°C°±5°C) at a concentration of 
22.5 to 27.5 mg/mL in 10 mM histidine buffer, pH 5. 2 to 5.8, containing 7% sucrose and 
0.02% polysorbate 80.  The drug substance solution from both sources is a clear to 
opalescent liquid. 
 
The manufacturing process for pembrolizumab is a su spension cell culture process that uses 
commercially available animal component-free medium .  The contents of the production 
bioreactor are depth filtered to remove intact cell s and cell debris and then 0.2 micron (μm) 
filtered into pre-sterilized bags. 
 
 
14  
The purification process for pembrolizumab drug sub stance consists of the following steps: 
3 chromatography steps, 1 viral inactivation step, 1 viral filtration step, 1 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration step, 1 formulation s tep (only for the fully formulated DS stored 
frozen), and [ADDRESS_227326] (DP) dosage forms are available fo r pembrolizumab:  a white to off-white 
lyophilized powder, 50 mg/vial, and a liquid, 100 m g/vial, both in Type I glass vials intended 
for single use only. The drug products are manufact ured using facilities and practices under 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements. 
 
• Pembrolizumab Powder for Solution for Infusion, 5 0 mg/vial is a lyophilized powder that 
is reconstituted with sterile water for injection p rior to use.  It is manufactured using 
either the fully formulated DS or the partially for mulated DS.  The fully formulated DS 
uses L-histidine as a buffering agent, polysorbate 80 as surfactant, and sucrose as 
stabilizer/tonicity modifier.  Pembrolizumab DP usi ng the partially formulated DS is 
formulated with L-histidine as a buffering agent, p olysorbate 80 as a surfactant, and 
sucrose as a stabilizer/tonicity modifier, and may contain hydrochloric acid and/or 
sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment (if necessary).  
• Pembrolizumab Solution for Infusion 100 mg/vial i s a liquid DP (manufactured using the 
fully formulated DS with L-histidine as a buffering  agent, polysorbate 80 as a surfactant, 
and sucrose as a stabilizer/tonicity modifier). 
 
 
Both DP dosage forms are stored under refrigerated conditions (2°C to 8°C). 
 
The lyophilized DP after reconstitution with steril e water for injection and the liquid DP are 
clear to opalescent solutions, essentially free of visible particles.  The reconstituted 
lyophilized product and the liquid product are inte nded for IV administration.  The 
reconstituted DP solution or the liquid DP can be f urther diluted with normal saline or 5% 
dextrose in the concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/m L in IV containers made of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) or non-PVC material.  Reconstituted vials should be used immediately to 
prepare the infusion solution in the IV bag, and th e infusion solution should be administered 
immediately.  Diluted pembrolizumab solutions may b e stored at room temperature for a 
cumulative time of up to 4 hours.  This includes ro om temperature storage of admixture 
solutions in the IV bags and the duration of infusi on.  In addition, IV bags can be stored at 
2°C to 8°C for up to a cumulative time of 20 hours.   This recommendation is based on up to 
24 hours of room temperature and up to 24 hours of refrigerated stability data of diluted 
pembrolizumab solutions in the IV bags.

EFFECTS IN HUMANS  
Efficacy data for the [COMPANY_006]-sponsored clinical tria ls were used to support approvals in the US 
for the following indications:  melanoma, NSCLC, HN SCC, cHL, UC, and MSI-H tumors. 
 
Pharmacokinetics Studies  
Pembrolizumab PK samples have been obtained from mu ltiple trials for various tumor types 
including melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, UC and microsatel lite instability high (MSI-H) 
tumors.  The doses tested in these tumor types incl ude one or more of the following doses: 
2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W), and 200 mg Q3W. 
 
Absorption  
Pembrolizumab is administered intravenously and is therefore immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
 
Distribution  
Consistent with a limited extravascular distributio n, the volume of distribution of 
pembrolizumab at steady state is small (6.0 L; coef ficient of variation [CV%]:  20%).  As 
expected for an antibody, pembrolizumab does not bi nd to plasma proteins in a specific 
manner. 
 
Metabolism  
Pembrolizumab is catabolized through non-specific p athways; metabolism does not 
contribute to its CL. 
 
Elimination  
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geomet ric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 
40%]) after achieving maximal change at steady stat e compared with the first dose (252 
mL/day [CV%: 37%]); this decrease in CL with time i s not considered clinically meaningful.  
The geometric mean value (CV%) for the terminal hal f-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state.

Dose of pembrolizumab for the proposed study: The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is  200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).  Based on the totality  of data generated in the 
Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the app ropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across al l indications and 
regardless of tumor type.  As outlined below, this dose is justified by: 
 
 Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrati ng flat dose- and exposure-efficacy relationships f rom 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 
mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W),  
 Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in ben efit-risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W across multiple 
indications, and 
 Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in  both systemic circulation (inferred from pharmacok inetic [PK] data) and 
tumor (inferred from physiologically-based PK [PBPK ] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W 
Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a t otal of 2262 participants were enrolled with melano ma and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings  (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD-L1 enrich ed, and all-comers) and different 
treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy).  Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and  KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus  10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006).  All of these studies demonstrated flat dose- and exposu re-response relationships 
across the doses studied representing an approximat e 5- to 7.5-fold difference in exposure.  The 2 mg/ kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W 
provided similar responses to the highest doses stu died.  Subsequently, flat dose-exposure-response re lationships were also observed in 
other tumor types including head and neck cancer, b ladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin  Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg 
Pembrolizumab MISP Protocol Template  
Version 9: 1-Nov-[ADDRESS_227331], PK data in KN001  evaluating target-mediated 
drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated s aturation of PD-[ADDRESS_227332] tu mor PD-1 saturation over a wide range of tumor pene tration and PD-1 expression.  
This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200  mg Q3W achieves full PD-1 saturation in both blood  and tumor. 
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, w hich characterized the influence of body weight and  other participant covariates 
on exposure, has shown that the fixed-dosing provid es similar control of PK variability as weight base d dosing, with considerable 
overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 2 00 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose.  Support ed by [CONTACT_131877], 
and given that fixed-dose has advantages of reduced  dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed-
dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrol izumab protocols. 
 1.3 Survivin Expression in Gliomas Survivin is a 16.5 kDa intracellular protein that b elongs to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. It acts in concert with the 
mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_191165] g center (MTOC) during the G2/M 
phase of cell cycle progression 
(2, 3). Survivin has also been shown to modulate the func tion of a number of terminal effector cell death 
proteases (caspases) leading to an inhibition of ap optosis (4, 5). Although expressed during fetal development, surv ivin is rarely detectable 
in the normal tissues of adult organisms (6). Malignant gliomas express survivin at high levels ; whereas, low grade gliomas and normal 
glial cells do not (7). In fact, survivin is considered to be one of the most specific cancer molecules yet identified (3), despi[INVESTIGATOR_191166], some lymphocytes, neutrophils and vascular endo thelial cells (8). High-level 
survivin expression is associated with a poor progn osis (9, 10). Survivin expression in tumors is also associated with a high rate of disease 
recurrence and resistance to therapy (11). Consequently, survivin confers growth and surviva l advantages to cells that express it. A large 
number of human glioma specimens have been examined  using several different techniques and survivin ex pression has been found in 
at least 90% of human malignant gliomas. Immunization Patients with cancers, including malignant gliomas,  have immunologic responses to survivin. Antibodies  to survivin and T cells that are 
specifically reactive to survivin epi[INVESTIGATOR_191167] n detected in cancer patients 
(12-15). Therefore, survivin is clearly immunogenic and 
stimulation of memory responses might be elicited b y active specific vaccination to survivin epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  Since survivin is an intracellular 
protein, it is processed by [CONTACT_191210] I pathway. Peptide epi [INVESTIGATOR_191168] 9: 1-Nov-2017

are presented at the cell surface by [CONTACT_79906] I mo lecules leading to CD8+ T-cell-mediated immune resp onses. In addition, the survivin 
molecule itself has recently been shown to be expre ssed on the outer surface of the tumor cell membran e where it is accessible to 
antibody-mediated immune attack (Clin Cancer Res. 2 018 Jun 1;24(11):2642-2652. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432. CCR-17-2778. Epub 2018 
Mar 14). There is substantial experimental evidence  that survivin vaccination leads to anti-tumor immu ne responses in tumor-naive and 
tumor-bearing animals (16-20). 
SVN53-67/M57-KLH (SurVaxM) Peptide selection for SurVaxM The survivin peptide in SurVaxM is a defined, 15 am ino acid antigenic peptide capable of binding sever al human MHC class I molecules, 
as well as murine H2-Kb molecules (as a model of th e human response). SurVaxM contains a core epi[INVESTIGATOR_191169]56-64/M57 modified 
by [CONTACT_191211] 57, with flanking amino acids 53-56 and 65-67. This allows the core 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_191170]-type survivin peptide in humans since it binds  HLA-A*02 molecules to a 
much greater extent 
(16). While SurVaxM was designed to bind HLA-A*0201, co mputer algorithms predict its binding to numerous 
MHC class I molecules that collectively represent a  large patient population. Thus, SurVaxM is predict ed to be effective at generating 
CTL in a diverse patient population with limited HL A restriction. 
Immunization against intracellular proteins Epi[INVESTIGATOR_191171], if correctly pr esented on the surface of tumor cells with MHC clas s I expression, and recognizable by 
[CONTACT_191212] T cells, can serve as targets for  cytotoxic antitumor responses. Thus, cell-surface expression of an entire tumor antigen 
is not required for effective anti-tumor immunologi c responses. Instead, intracellular proteins like s urvivin are processed by [CONTACT_191213][INVESTIGATOR_191172] I molecules on the tumor cell’s surface where  they are recognizable by 
[CONTACT_191214]. The immune system of cancer patients is often prime d to recognize survivin epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  Circulating anti -survivin antibodies have been 
detected in vaccine-naïve patients with cancer, but  not in normal volunteers. Peptide epi[INVESTIGATOR_191173]-associated antigens (TAA), 
including survivin, can be recognized by [CONTACT_28746] T lymphocytes (CTL) in the context of MHC molecules . In a first-in-human phase I 
clinical study, vaccination with the survivin immun ogen SurVaxM produced specific anti-survivin CD8+ T  cells and anti-survivin 
antibodies in patients with recurrent malignant gli omas, primarily glioblastoma.

 MHC class II ligands and CD4+ helper support for va ccines 
To activate a CD4+ T-cell response, antigens must b e presented to CD4+ T cells in conjunction with an MHC class II antigen 
(21). Once 
CD4+ cells have been activated, they proliferate an d produce cytokines (e.g. IFN-α, IL-2, and IL-4) th at enhance the immune response 
(22, 23). These cytokines are essential to provide a fully activated CD8+ antitumor CTL response (24). The presence of MHC class II-
restricted CD4+ T cells that are specific for tumor  associated antigens has been recognized to be an i mportant element for providing 
essential helper factors to elicit and sustain cyto toxic CD8+ responses against tumors (25, 26) . Vaccination with SurVaxM produces 
cytokine support as well as specific CTL responses and has the potential to stimulate more effective a ntitumor immunity than peptide 
vaccines that contain only class I epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Altered peptide antigens T cell clones with the capacity to be activated by [CONTACT_6270]-proteins are frequently preserved following ne gative selection of higher affinity, 
self-recognizing clones in the thymus 
(27). These potentially self-reactive cells remain tole rized under normal conditions (28). Altered 
peptide ligands (mimics) can provide a way to break  tolerance to the natural self-epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]. Altered pep tide ligands generated by 
[CONTACT_191215] a peptide ep itope can markedly alter immune responses. This str ategy may be used to increase 
the affinity of the peptide for MHC-I via alteratio ns in the binding anchor residues (29, 30). Effects of this manipulation can range from 
the induction of TCR antagonism, to T cell anergy, to enhancement of T cell responses (31). A number of investigators have used altered 
immunogens (mimics) to enhance the immunogenicity o f tumor-associated antigens. The cysteine-to-methio nine substitution present in 
SurVaxM greatly enhances binding to HLA-A*0201 mole cules leading to increased immunogenicity that is c ross reactive to the wild 
type survivin molecule present in tumor cells. Thus , the design of SurVaxM incorporates several strate gies to create an effective 
antitumor immunogen: 1) multiple T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], 2 ) peptide mimicry, 3) antigen-specific cytokine sup port, and 4) anti-survivin 
antibody production. Montanide ISA [ADDRESS_227333] similar to Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant , which when mixed with a

 For purposes of this study, an overdose of pembroli zumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or gr eater (≥5 times the indicated 
dose).  No specific information is available on the  treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the eve nt of overdose, the participant 
should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided  if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results  from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the advers e event(s) is reported as a serious 
adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteri a are met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol d efinition of overdose is taken without any associat ed clinical symptoms or 
abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is report ed as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI ), using the terminology 
“accidental or intentional overdose without adverse  effect.” 
 All reports of overdose with and without an adverse  event must be reported within 24 hours to the Spon sor and within 2 working days 
hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Prod uct Safety; FAX [PHONE_1209]) 
Pregnancy, Lactation, and Pediatric Use Fertility and teratology studies with SurVaxM have not been conducted. Safety for women of childbearin g capacity cannot be inferred 
from the existing data. Patients who are pregnant o r are breast feeding are excluded from all SurVaxM clinical trials. Female patients 
must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or  must agree to use effective contraception during t he period of treatment. All female 
patients with reproductive potential must have a ne gative pregnancy test prior to treatment with SurVa xM. Male patients must be 
surgically sterile or must agree to use effective c ontraception during the period of treatment. The sa fety of SurVaxM in pediatric patients 
has not been evaluated and, therefore, SurVaxM shou ld not be administered to patients <[ADDRESS_227338] monthly and documen t the participant’s status until the 
pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The ou tcome of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_006] wi thin 2 working days if the

and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to  [COMPANY_006].  If a male participant impregnates his fema le partner, the study personnel at 
the site must be informed immediately and the pregn ancy must be reported to [COMPANY_006] and followed as desc ribed in Section 7.2.2. 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted in human  milk, and because of the 
potential for serious adverse reactions in the nurs ing infant, participants who are breast-feeding are  not eligible for enrollment. 
Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor  and to [COMPANY_006]  
 Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breas t feeding are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any preg nancy or lactation in a participant (spontaneously reported to them) that occurs 
during the study. Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeedi ng that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation  
must be reported by [CONTACT_191217], or a re the result of a protocol-specified 
intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeedi ng that occur from the time of treatment through 12 0 days following cessation of 
Sponsor’s product, or [ADDRESS_227339] be followed to the completion/ter mination of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine 
death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If th e pregnancy continues to term, the 
outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the  Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide

Peptide Binding Analysis SurVaxM epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] ( A, blue) are capable of displacing HPV at low concen trations similar to that observed with other known MHC class 
I ligands gp100-209-217, and Flu-58-66. In contrast  to the mimic peptides, the wild type peptides (red ) could only displace the HPV 
peptide at almost 1,000-fold higher concentration. In addition, the core peptide of the mimic (SVN56-6 4/M57) had 74-fold higher 
binding to HLA-A*0201 than that of the wild type ( B). Therefore, SVN53-67/M57 would be expected to lea d to improved presentation 
of the MHC I binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_191174] s ystem. This leads to a longer association time betw een the mimic epi[INVESTIGATOR_191175] I molecules. In turn, this should increase binding to lower affinity T cell receptors, which h ave not been deleted during 
development, can induce the proliferation of cross- reactive T cell clones that recognize wild type sur vivin epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].

Pre-clinical Human CTL studies of SurVaxM 
 Fresh PBMC from glioma patients were used to produc e dendritic cells (DC) in vitro so that the ability  of survivin peptides to 
stimulate CTL responses could be assessed against a utologous human tumor cells ex vivo. It was demonst rated that the responses 
obtained are clearly linked to HLA status since an HLA mismatch of PBMC and tumor target cells led to an abrogation of cell-
mediated cytotoxicity ( -A). HLA-A*0201, and HLA-A*0301 patients were able to  be stimulated to lyse an allogeneic-matched 
and autologous glioma cells ( B, C, D ). In addition, this CTL activity was also found ag ainst autologous (HLA-A*2901/A*3002) 
primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) cells (Figure 4-E) and  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells ( F). As compared to the 
wild type peptide, SVN53-67/M57 elicits a 3- to 5-f old increase in CTL mediated killing against autolo gous human tumor cells. 
SVN53-67/M57 can elicit a cell-mediated immune resp onse that is significantly greater than that induce d by [CONTACT_191219]. Thus, SVN53-67/M57 may have broad applicab ility against cancers that express survivin.

significant T cell reactivity could be detected in HLA-A*0201 patient samples. Tetramer reactivity is used to measure T cell-
derived immune responses. Antigen presenting cells were stimulated in cell culture with SurVaxM peptid es to produce pentamer-

Considering the route of administration (i.e., subc utaneous injection), it is very likely that SurVaxM  will remain locally at the injection 
site for a long period and not be systemically avai lable in any significant amount. Much of the peptid e will be taken up by [CONTACT_191220] (APC) locally and then processed f or presentation to the immune system. In addition, some fraction will be degraded 
locally by [CONTACT_191221] p eptides. Therefore, as with many 
other peptide vaccines tested to date, SurVaxM shou ld not reach vital organs to directly affect them. Nonetheless every effort has been 
made to address the safety of SurVaxM through pre-c linical animal toxicity studies. 
According to the study entitled “Subcutaneous Repea ted Dose Toxicity Study of 012410-2 in C57BL/6 Mice  with a Two-Week

 Efficacy Pre-clinical Data SurVaxM in Syngeneic, Immunocompetent, Murine, Intr acerebral Glioma Model  
Beginning four days after tumor implantation, mice were immunized with either SVN53-67/M57 peptide-loa ded dendritic cells or, by 
[CONTACT_191222] 100 µg SVN53-67/M5 7-KLH peptide [in Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA )] plus 100 ng 
sargramostim. Vaccinations were repeated (boosted) every 7 days up to a total of 3 immunizations, and long-term survivors were 
confirmed to be tumor-free by [CONTACT_9268]). SurVaxM produce d enhanced survival in mice with GL261 cerebral gli omas with some survivors 
alive 1 year after implantation without detectable tumor. No significant difference was observed betwe en survivin peptide-loaded DC 
or the peptide-KLH conjugate (SurVaxM), provided th at sargramostim was used as a supporting adjuvant.

SurVaxM with Temozolomide in Glioma-bearing C57BL/6  Mice  
Mice with intracranial GL261 murine gliomas were tr eated with temozolomide 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days fol lowing tumor implantation. 
SurVaxM was administered as 100 ug peptide in Monta nide with 100 ng sargramostim on day 12.  Median su rvival for mice receiving 
combination of temozolomide and SurVaxM was 46 days , compared to 32 days for mice receiving SurVaxM al one. Significant 
differences were observed in terms of median surviv al but not overall survival. This study demonstrate d that: 1) the combination of 
temozolomide and SurVaxM while not synergistic, was  not detrimental to immunization response and had m inimal toxicity and, 2) 
treatment with SurVaxM at a late stage ([ADDRESS_227347] ration) was still effective 
(compared to initiation of vaccinations [ADDRESS_227348] -implantation in earlier studies, with much smaller  tumor mass). 
Clinical Data The literature provides several immunotherapy trial s that incorporate wild type survivin peptides as t arget antigens and show the 
induction of specific T-cell activity in a limited number of patients with advanced solid tumors 
(32-35). A phase II trial (36) in 61 HLA-
A1/-A2/-B35-positive, metastatic melanoma patients,  using survivin-targeted peptide vaccination demons trated prolonged OS in 13/41 
patients who exhibited survivin-specific T-cell rea ctivity (SSTR) (median 19.6 vs 8.6 months; p=0.0077 ). It also revealed that the 
induction of SSTR was associated with gender and di sease stage, rather than age, HLA type, performance  status or vaccination regimen.  
It was observed that the majority of treatment-rela ted side effects were mild to moderate (CTC grade 1 -2), including fever, chills on the 
day of vaccination and inflammatory reactions at th e injection sites. The occurrence of these post-vac cination inflammatory reactions 
was strongly associated with the presence of SSTR a nd a trend toward favorable survival. 
SVN53-67/M57-KLH has been studied in a phase I clin ical trial sponsored and conducted by [CONTACT_191223]. In that trial, nine patients with recurrent , survivin-positive malignant gliomas who had faile d standard therapy, received SVN53-
67/M57-KLH [(500 mcg) in Montanide ISA 51 with sarg ramostim (100 mcg)] subcutaneously at two-week inte rvals, for four doses, 
until tumor progression. In addition, patients who survived six months or more without tumor progressi on, serious adverse events, or 
regimen limiting toxicity received maintenance phas e dosing every three months. Toxicity attributable to SVN53-67/M57-KLH was 
mostly limited to mild injection site reactions. SV N53-67/M57-KLH-Montanide-sargramostim was well tole rated and the majority of 
AE were grade one. Six of nine patients experienced  injection site reactions, all grade one, including  localized areas of erythema related 
to vaccination. Three patients reported fatigue (gr ades 1 and 2), two patients experienced myalgias (g rade 2). Lymphopenia was seen in 
3 patients (all grade 1) and leukopenia (grades 1 a nd 2) occurred in three patients. The only grade 3 AE, a seizure, was not related to the 
vaccine. One SAE (renal failure) occurred in the ma intenance phase in one patient but was unrelated to  the study drug. There is an

ongoing phase II trial of SVN53-67/M57-KLH-Montanid e-sargramostim and temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma that has 
confirmed the safety of the combination of vaccine with temozolomide. Interim data (as of 2/2/2018) ob tained from this phase II study 
has only reported two instances of grade 3 AE/SAE f rom separate patients at least possibly related to SVN53-67/M57-KLH from 63 
total patients; one patient reported maculo-papular  rash (grade 3 SAE) and one other patient experienc ed confusional state (grade 3 
SAE). No higher grade AE or SAE has been observed. Based upon this data SVN53-67/M57-KLH continues to be safe in glioblastoma 
patients. 
 
1.4  Rationale for use in recurrent glioblastoma  Approximately 22,850 people are diagnosed with prim ary cancer of the nervous system every year leading  to 15,320 deaths (1). 
Glioblastoma is by [CONTACT_191224]. The 5-year survival rate for pati ents with glioblastoma is 3.3% 
substantiating the great need for improved therapy (1). Following first recurrence, progression free s urvival with second-line therapy at 
six months (PFS6) is about 15%. Immunotherapy is on e promising option for patients with glioblastoma a nd a number of forms of active 
specific vaccination have been devised and are bein g investigated this cancer. These include both cell ular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191177] (Rintega) (2). The latter provides active specific vaccination to EGFR vIII, which is expressed by [CONTACT_191225] 30% of glioblastomas (3).  Survivin is a common cancer-associated protein that  is immunologically targetable (4). It is expressed  by [CONTACT_2669] 90% of human 
glioblastomas and by [CONTACT_191226]-CNS cancers as well (5). SVN53-67/M57-KLH (SurVaxM) is long surviv in peptide mimic that 
has enhanced binding to HLA-A*02 molecules (4, 6). SurVaxM has been tested at a fixed dose of [ADDRESS_227349] therapy. In 
that study, SurVaxM was given in emulsion with Mont anide ISA 51 together with sargramostim (GM-CSF) to  a total of 9 patients. The 
vaccine was well-tolerated. Mild (grade I) injectio n site reactions were common, but no serious advers e events due to the vaccine were 
observed. All evaluable patients developed survivin -specific CD8+ T cell responses and antibody titers  to the survivin peptide and to 
the conjugated carrier protein KLH. Evidence of spe cific cytokine-mediated helper support was also obs erved. Median overall survival 
was 68 weeks from trial entry (7). This phase I stu dy was followed by a multi-center phase II clinical  trial of SurVaxM in combination 
with standard therapy (Stupp protocol) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma being conducted a t five institutions. An interim 
analysis of data from the first 55 patients was con ducted. Patients ranged in age from 20-82 years (me dian = 60), male:female = 38:25 
with survivin tumor expression of 1-40% (median = 1 2%) by [CONTACT_9064]. PFS-6 was 96.3% (n=55)  measured from diagnosis 
and 62.8% (n=43) from first immunization. OS-12 was  90.9% (n=33) from diagnosis and 70.8% (n=24) from first immunization. As in 
the phase I study, the regimen was generally well t olerated and immunization-related adverse events we re mild with no serious adverse

events directly attributable to SurVaxM. The vaccin e was highly immunogenic and produced survivin-spec ific antibody (IgG) titers and 
CD8+ T-cells detectable by [CONTACT_191227].  Glioblastoma is known to be an immunosuppressive ca ncer and the microenvironment of these tumors is no t highly permissive for CD8-
mediated tumor cell killing (8). In addition, these  tumors secrete substances that suppress systemic a nti-tumoral immunity. Following 
surgical resection of bulk disease immune responses  improve substantially.  Therefore, immunotherapy i s more likely to be effective in 
such patients following reduction of bulk disease b y surgical resection. In one study of over 1,200 gl ioma patients, PD-1 expression on 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was detected in 48% of gliomas and was higher in glioblastoma than in l ower grade gliomas (54% vs. 
30%, p = 0.005)(9). In addition, PD-L1 expression o n tumor cells was seen in 27% and was more common i n tumors with unmethylated 
MGMT promoters (36% vs. 18%, p = 0.01), which is th e group of glioblastoma patients in greatest need o f improved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (9). It is 
likely that PD-[ADDRESS_227350] failed previous anti-PD1 blockade to be  treated with the combination of 
anti-PD1 and SurVaxM. These patients will be studie d in a separate exploratory cohort.

conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH). SVN5 3-67/M57-KLH contains a peptide mimic that is immun ogenic in humans 
and in C57BL/[ADDRESS_227370] udy is based on extensive experimental observation concerning the ability of 
SurVaxM to elicit potent and specific immune responses that are capable of i nhibiting the growth of cerebral gliomas in mice an d killing human glioma cells ex 
vivo via cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity.  The investigational product should be stored in a s ecure area according to local regulations. It is th e responsibility of the investigator to 
ensure that investigational product is only dispens ed to study subjects. The investigational product m ust be dispensed only from official 
study sites by [CONTACT_191228].  
 Vaccine Induction Phase 
Patients will receive the first of four induction d oses of SurVaxM in emulsion with Montanide and Sarg ramostim and given every other 
week on induction cycle [ADDRESS_227371] ion. Patients will receive 
approximately 500 mcg SurVaxM in 50/50 volume emuls ion with Montanide ISA 51 (1 cc total) and a second  separate injection of 
100 mcg sargramostim in close proximity (1-3 cm) to  the first injection. 
Vaccine Maintenance Phase 
SurVaxM should be administered every 12 weeks (± 2 w eeks) after the induction phase until intolerance o r tumor progression.  
Administration of SurVaxM SurVaxM must be administered at the clinical trial site by [CONTACT_65384]. 
SurVaxM injections must be performed using an appro priate needle for subcutaneous administration. A [ADDRESS_227372] ion will be recorded. In 
addition, 100 mcg sargramostim will be administered  subcutaneously as a second injection given in clos e proximity (1-3 cm) to the 
SurVaxM injection. The injection site should be adm inistered on the opposite side of the body from the  previous injection. 
Injections over the deltoid muscle are preferred, a nd the site of administration should alternate betw een left and right arms for each 
successive treatment. Alternative sites, including the anterior thigh, may be used if necessary. SurVa xM injections should not be given 
to areas of skin with dermatologic conditions (such  as persistent injection site reactions, infection,  edema, or scarring) that will not allow 
easy access for study drug administration or evalua tion of localized adverse events. If such condition s or other circumstances 
Pembrolizumab MISP Protocol Template  
Version 9: 1-Nov-[ADDRESS_227373] remain in clinic for observation a minimum of one h our following each vaccination 
to evaluate and treat any potential immediate hyper sensitivity reactions. 
Measurement of Local Reaction: Measurement of any l ocal reaction that may occur once the patient leave s the clinic will be performed 
by [CONTACT_144911]. At the time of injecti on, study staff should mark the outline of the inje ction site on the skin. Patients/caregiver 
will then be instructed by [CONTACT_191229] (using the diameter of a U.S. 
quarter – approximately 1 inch – as a reference sta ndard), between 24-48 hours of administration of Su rVaxM. Patients (or caregivers) 
will be asked to record the approximate dimensions of the reaction (if any) and the date it was measur ed. The study coordinator will 
contact [CONTACT_102] (or caregiver) within [ADDRESS_227374] the pat ient’s local reaction measurement. 
Pembrolizumab Administration 
Pembrolizumab may be administered 3 days before or after the scheduled day of each cycle due to admini strative reasons (i.e., scheduling 
reasons). Pembrolizumab will be administered at a d ose of [ADDRESS_227375] 
been completed and documented as reviewed and asses sed as safe and acceptable by [CONTACT_191230]/medically-licensed and 
qualified designee. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minu tes as possible. However, given the 
variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permit ted (i.e., infusion time is 30 
minutes -5 min / +10 min). 
Note: Dosing interruptions are permitted in the cas e of medical/surgical events or logistical reasons (i.e. elective surgery, unrelated 
medical events, subject vacation, and holidays) not  related to study therapy. Subjects should be place d back on study therapy within 3 
weeks of the scheduled interruption. The reason for  interruption should be documented. In the event of  dosing interruptions and schedule 
changes, every effort should be made to revert to t he original infusion schedule. 
 Administer infusion solution intravenously over 30 minutes (-5 to +10 minute window) through an intrav enous line containing a 
sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2-mic ron to 5-micron in-line or add-on filter. Do not co-administer other drugs

 Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited  in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during t he ongoing study. If there is a clinical 
indication for any medication or vaccination specif ically prohibited during the study, discontinuation  from study therapy or vaccination 
may be required. The final decision on any supporti ve therapy or vaccination rests with the investigat or and/or the participant's primary 
physician. However, the decision to continue the pa rticipant on study treatment requires the mutual ag reement of the investigator, the 
Sponsor and the participant.  6.3 Dose Modification and toxicity management for i mmune-related AEs associated with pembrolizumab 
 AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may repr esent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune-related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the 
last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect  more than on body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of trea tment is critical to reduce complications. Based 
on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were re versible and could be managed with 
interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of c orticosteroids and/or other supportive care. 
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. 
Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as 
part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of ir AEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 3.

6.4.  Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017]. Suggested supportive care me asures for the management of AEs with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined along w ith the dose modification guidelines in 
Section 6.3 [Table 3]. Where appropriate, these gui delines include the use of oral or IV treatment 
with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti-in flammatory agents if symptoms do not improve 
with administration of corticosteroids. Note that s everal courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid d ose is decreased. For each is order, attempts 
should be made to rule out other causes such as met astatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, 
which might require additional supportive care. The  treatment guidelines are intended to be applied 
when the Investigator determines the events to be r elated to pembrolizumab, and/or SurVaxM. 
. 
Note: If after the evaluation of the event, it is d etermined not to be related to pembrolizumab, 
the Investigator does not need to follow the treatm ent guidance. Refer to [Table 3] in Section 
6.[ADDRESS_227392] udy treatment by [CONTACT_191233], the tr ial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or 
other safety reasons. Specific details regarding pr ocedures to be performed at study treatment 
discontinuation are provided in Section 8.0. – Othe r Procedures. 
 
A participant must be discontinued from study treat ment but continue to be monitored in the 
study for any of the following reasons: 
 
• The participant or participant’s legally acceptab le representative requests to 
   discontinue study treatment. 
 
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression  
 
• Any progression or recurrence of any malignancy, or any occurrence of another 
  malignancy that requires active treatment 
 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 6.3 
 
• The participant has a medical condition or person al circumstance which, in the    opi[INVESTIGATOR_191181]/or sponsor, places the particip ant at unnecessary risk    from continued    
   administration of study treatment.

6.5.1 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the c riteria specified below: 
 
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccur ate or incomplete 
 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requir ements 
 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction i n this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to participants 
 
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development o f the study drug 
 
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to partici pant treatment can be made. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_227393] treatment follow up (F/U) visits will be done at [ADDRESS_227394] treatment.  To capture all 
possibly delayed immune-related adverse events (irA Es), the safety follow-up period will be at 
least [ADDRESS_227395]. All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follo w-Up Visit should be recorded. Participants with 
an AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_227396]. SAEs that occur within 90 days of

6.6.2 Follow-up Visits 
Participants who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than disease progression will 
move into the Follow-Up Phase and should be assesse d every 8 weeks (± 7 days) by 
[CONTACT_110531]. Every  effort should be made to collect information 
regarding disease status until the start of new ant i-cancer therapy, disease progression, death, end 
of the study or if the participant begins retreatme nt with pembrolizumab as detailed in Section 
6.3.1. Information regarding post-study anti-cancer  treatment will be collected if new treatment is 
initiated.

7.0 DOSE DELAYS / DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may repr esent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune-related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the 
last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect  more than on body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of trea tment is critical to reduce complications. Based 
on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were re versible and could be managed with 
interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of c orticosteroids and/or other supportive care. 
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. 
Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as 
part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of ir AEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management

unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnor mal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered rela ted to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clin ically significant adverse change in frequency

and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that i s temporally associated with the use of the [COMPANY_006]’s  
product, is also an adverse event. 
 
Changes resulting from normal growth and developmen t that do not vary significantly in frequency 
or severity from expected levels are not to be cons idered adverse events.  Examples of this may 
include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_191182] a physiologically appropr iate time. 
 
[COMPANY_006] product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent 
or protocol-specified procedure, whether investigat ional (including placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_80085]. 
 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the u se of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials, or as 
prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whe ther accidental or intentional), from abuse and 
from withdrawal. 
 
All AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety events th at occur after the consent form is signed but 
before treatment allocation must be reported by [CONTACT_191234]-in or other run-in treatment, if the ev ent cause the participant to be excluded from 
the study, or is the result of a protocol-specified  intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, or a procedure.  
 
● All AEs from the time of treatment allocation thr ough [ADDRESS_227399] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
 
● All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time o f treatment allocation through [ADDRESS_227400] be reported by [CONTACT_1275].

time period specified above must be reported immedi ately by [CONTACT_191235]-related. 
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE  or SAE or other reportable safety events in 
former study participants. However, if the investig ator learns of any SAE, including a death, at 
any time after a participant has been discharged fr om the study, and he/she considers the event to 
be reasonably related to the study treatment or stu dy participation, the investigator must 
promptly notify [COMPANY_006].

8.2 Definitions 
For purposes of this study, an overdose of pembroli zumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or greater (75 times the indicated dose). No spe cific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the even t of overdose, the participant should be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate  supportive treatment should be provided if 
clinically indicated. 
 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results  from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse e vent, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol d efinition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory  results, the overdose is reported as a 
nonserious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse  event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to Merc k Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide 
      Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1209]) 
 
8.3 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurr ing at any dose or during any use of

• Is life threatening; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/i ncapacity; 
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hosp italization; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Is another important medical event 
 
• Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events m eeting either of the below    criteria,     
  although not serious per ICH definition, are repo rtable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same   timeframe      
  as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. There fore, these events are    considered serious    
  by [CONTACT_131892]. 
 
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the s tudy); 
• Is associated with an overdose. 
 
For the time period beginning when the consent form  is signed until treatment 
allocation, any serious adverse event, or follow up  to a serious adverse event, 
including death due to any cause that occurs to any  participant must be reported within 24 
hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to M erck Global Safety if it causes the

12.1.5 Methods for Blood 1: Characterization of cir culating immune cells and 
cytokine/chemokine profile: 
 
Characterization of circulating immune cells: Frequencies of MDSCs, Tregs, CD8 + T cells, 
CD4 +T and additional circulating immune cells will be d etermined by [CONTACT_191241].  PBMCs will be isolated from whole blood using 
the standard ficoll separation assay.  Expression o f immunomodulatory factors (PD-1, PD-1L, 
Lag3, Tim3, OX40, 41BB) on circulating immune cells  will be also performed by [CONTACT_8315]. PBMCs will also be used for performing g ermline normal exome sequencing to 
identify somatic mutations in the tumor.

12.1.6 Methods for Blood 2: Blood Draws for Humoral  and Cellular Immune Response 
Sample Collection 
Immunological analyses will be conducted on blood s amples obtained prior to the patient’s 
scheduled vaccination dosing (i.e., pre-dosing or p re-immune sample) and at study follow-up 
visits. 
Samples will be  drawn on the day of, but prior to:  
 The first priming vaccine (V1), 
 At disease assessment every 9 weeks (± 4 weeks), an d 
 At disease progression or end-of-treatment.  
On each occasion, approximately 10 mL of blood will  be obtained from a peripheral venipuncture 
or an appropriate existing venous access device and  collected in one (1) green-top (heparinized) 
tube and one (1), 3.5 mL gold top tube. Blood tubes  will be kept at room temperature until pi[INVESTIGATOR_191191].

12.1.7 Processing and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_191192]:  
 
Dilute blood 1:1 with RPMI in a sterile 50ml conica l tube. Add 15ml ficoll to SepMate-50 tube. 
Holding SepMate tube at an angle, gently layer the ficoll with the diluted blood sample using a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462]. Gradually decrease angle as blood layer fi lls tube. Use up to 30mls of diluted blood per 
SepMate tube. NOTE: The pi[INVESTIGATOR_191193], and the blood is allowed to gently steam on to the ficoll layer without making turbulence in 
the ficoll layer.  
Spin for 15 minutes at 900g and 18 oC to 20 oC. Make sure the  centrifuge brakes are turned off for 
ficoll spin 
Quickly decant (pour) supernatant from SepMate into  a new sterile 50ml conical tube containing 
15ml RPMI for washing. Spin for 15 minutes at 400g 
Resuspend the pellets in 1-2ml of 1x Red Blood Cell  Lysis Buffer in water 
Incubate at 37 oC for up to 5 minutes 
Add PBS to increase the volume to 10ml 
Centrifuge at 400 g for 5 minutes 
Remove supernatant and resuspend in 10ml RPMI, coun t the cells.  
Make Freezing Media (90%FBS, plus 10%DMSO, i.e. 3.6 ml FBS + 400ul DMSO) 
Spin PBMCs at [ADDRESS_227419] 24 hours, but no 
longer than 1 week. Transfer cells to liquid nitrog en freezer and store until use. 
Processing of Serum: Serum will be separated from whole blood in a gold top tube and frozen at 
-80 C.  
PBMC and serum tubes will be labeled with the Subje ct ID # (unique to Net\work patients), 
initials, the participant’s study number, clinical study number, protocol time point, dose number, 
and protocol day. 
PBMC and serum samples from CCF (or network sites) will be shipped frozen on dry ice via

12.1.10  Immunological Analysis of Serum and PBMC 
Immunological assays will be performed at Roswell P ark. Pre-immune serum for baseline anti-
survivin and anti-KLH antibody titers and T cell mu ltimer assays will be performed in the Neuro-
Oncology lab. As noted above one 10 mL green top tu be and one 3.5 mL gold top tube will be 
processed for these assays. Serum from one 3.5 ml g old top tube will be directed to antibody 
assessments; PBMC collected from green top tube (ap proximately equal to that collected) will be 
designated for multimer studies.  
Results will be collected at multiple time points t hroughout the study as groups of patient samples 
become available for complete analysis. Data will b e reported in spreadsheet (Excel) format. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_227420] recurrence (bevacizumab-naïve ). This will include a 10-patient toxicity/safety 
run-in. Patients in the initial run-in will be incl uded in the assessment of response. Patients in the  
run-in will be followed using CTCAEv 5.0 criteria a nd if the combination regimen is excessively 
toxic defined as dose limiting toxicity seen in mor e than 33% of the patients, the study will be 
stopped. The probabilities of observing 3, 4, and 5  DLTs out of 10 patients with true toxicity rate 
of 33% is 23%, 26%, and 13%. If 4 or less DLTs obse rved in the 10 patients, the study proceed 
with more patients. If 5 or more DLTs observed, acc rual will be suspended and toxicity profile we 
be fully evaluated.

If toxicity threshold to stop will not be reached, an additional 31 patients will be enrolled for tota l 
of 41 patients. PFS6 will be used as the primary en d point. PFS6 = 15%; and 0.05 if PFS6 = 30%. 
This calculation will have type one error of 5% and  type II error of 12%. If 12 or more patients are 
progression free at 6 months, the study would meet its primary endpoint. 
 
Toxicities will be graded according to the National  Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.  
 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined as any of the following events occurring during 
the first 2 treatments with pembrolizumab and SurVa xM and within a 4 week period after that 
(total of 7 weeks). A DLT is defined as a clinicall y significant adverse event or abnormal 
laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease p rogression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medications and meets any of the criteria below.   
 
Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease  or extraneous cause 
 
Hematological toxicities will be considered dose li miting if any of the following occur  
 
 ANC of < 500/mm3.  
 Platelets < 25,000/mm3.  
 Febrile neutropenia lasting > one week (single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865])   
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significan t bleeding 
 
Non-hematological toxicities will be considered dos e limiting if any of the following occur:  
  
 Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse events wi th the allowed exceptions for  
 Grade 3 nausea/vomiting or diarrhea < 72 hours with  adequate antiemetic and other 
supportive care  
 Grade 3 fatigue < 1 week 
 ≥ Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality that lasts <24 to  72 hours, is not clinically complicated, 
and resolves spontaneously or responds to conventio nal medical interventions  
 ≥ Grade 3 amylase or lipase that is not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations 
of pancreatitis 
 Alopecia;  
 Grade 3 hyperglycemia 
 Grade [ADDRESS_227421]’s first epi[INVESTIGATOR_191197]  (DVT) or pulmonary embolism will not 
require dose modification. 
There will an exploratory cohort of [ADDRESS_227422] failed prior PD1 blockade that will be 
treated with the combination of PEM + SurVaxM and r esults of this arm will be reported in a 
descriptive manner.

IMMUNOTHERAPY RESPONSE ASSESSMENT IN NEURO-ONCOLOGY  
(IRANO) CRITERIA 
 
Tumor response should be assessed every 8 weeks (+/ - 1 week) for patients treated with 
immunotherapy using modified RANO criteria65 as out lined below. Clinicians may repeat 
response assessment more frequently as clinically i ndicated. 
 
Anti-Tumor Effect Definitions 
 
Evaluable for toxicity. All patients who receive at  least one dose of immunotherapy treatment 
will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of the ir first treatment. 
 
Evaluable for objective response. Only those patien ts who have measurable disease present at 
baseline (recommend obtaining within 14 days of cyc le 1, day 1) scan and have received at least 
one dose of immunotherapy will be considered evalua ble for response. 
These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective diseas e progression or die prior to the end 
of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Measurable disease. For contrast-enhancing tumors, measurable disease is defined as the 
bidimensionally, contrast-enhancing, measurable les ions with clearly defined margins by [CONTACT_191244], with a minimal diameter of [ADDRESS_227427] choose the larges t two to be followed. The remaining lesions will 
be considered non-measureable for the purpose of ob jective response determination. Unless 
progression is observed, objective response can onl y be determined when all measurable and non-
measurable lesions are assessed.  
 
Non-measurable evaluable disease. Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins 
not clearly defined, and/or lesions with maximal di ameter < 1cm.

Response/Progression Categories 
 
Complete response (CR). All of the following criter ia must be met: 
a) Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurab le and non-measurable disease 
sustained for at least 4 weeks. In the absence of a  confirming scan 4 weeks later, this 
scan will be considered only stable disease. 
 
b) No new lesions.  
 
c) All measurable and non-measurable lesions must b e assessed using the same techniques 
as baseline. 
 
d) Patients must be on no steroids or on physiologi c replacement doses only. 
 
e) For enhancing tumors: Stable or improved non-enh ancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions 
 
f) Stable or improved clinically, for clinical sign s and symptoms present at baseline and 
recorded to be disease related disease 
 
Patients with residual non-measurable disease canno t have a complete response. The best 
response possible is stable disease. 
 
Partial response (PR). All of the following criteri a must be met: 
a) Greater than or equal to 50% decrease compared t o baseline in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions s ustained for at least 4 weeks. In the 
absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this sc an will be considered only stable 
disease. 
b) No progression of non-measurable disease. 
 
c) No new lesions. 
 
d) All measurable and non-measurable lesions must b e assessed using the same techniques 
as baseline. 
 
e) The steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluat ion should be no greater than the dose 
at time of baseline scan. 
 
f) For enhancing tumors: Stable or improved non-enh ancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same 
or lower dose of corticosteroids compared to baseli ne scan. 
 
g) Stable or improved, for clinical signs and sympt oms present at baseline and recorded 
to be disease related clinically. 
 
Patients with non-measurable disease cannot have a partial response. The best response 
possible is stable disease.

Progressive disease (PD). Any of the following crit erion must be met: 
a) > 25% increase in sum of the products of perpend icular diameters of measurable lesions 
(over best response [smallest tumor size] or baseli ne if no decrease) on stable or 
increasing doses of corticosteroids 
 
b) Any new measurable lesion that when added to the  change in initial tumor(s) exceeds 
a 25% increase in cross-sectional area. 
 
c) Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to  other causes apart from the tumor (e.g. 
seizures, medication side effects, complications of  therapy, cerebrovascular events, 
infection, etc.). The definition of clinical deteri oration is left to the discretion of the 
investigator but it is recommended that a decline i n the Karnofsky Performance Score 
(KPS) from [ADDRESS_227428] 7 days, be considered 
neurologic deterioration, unless attributable to co -morbid events or changes in 
corticosteroid dose. 
 
d) Failure to return for evaluation due to death or  deteriorating condition 
Classification of progressive disease may be deferr ed for up to three months for patients 
with initial radiographic findings consistent with progressive disease (criteria a and b 
above) as detailed below. However, if follow-up ima ging after three months confirms 
progression or if the patient experiences significa nt clinical decline at any time, the date 
of actual progression will be back-dated to the fir st date that the patient met criteria for 
progression and such patients should discontinue fu rther immunotherapy. 
 
Stable disease (SD). All of the following criteria must be met: 
a) Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. 
 
b) All measurable and non-measurable sites must be assessed using the same techniques 
as baseline. 
 
c) Stable clinically. 
 
Unknown response status. Progressive disease has no t been documented and one or more 
measurable or non-measurable lesions have not been assessed.

Appendix 4  
Preparation of Peptide Vaccine Emulsion 
1. Required Materials 
- 1 vial containing MONTANIDE ISA 51 VG sterile 
 
- 1 vial containing SVN53-67/M57-KLH sterile 
 
- [ADDRESS_227429] (latex/silicone-free) Luer lock  syringes (Air-Tite Products  
4020.00V0) 
- 1 double sided female I-connector (Smiths Medical  MX494 or equivalent) 
 
2.  Peptide Reconstitution (Aqueous phase) 
 
Each vial of SVN53-67/M57-KLH contains 1.[ADDRESS_227430] agent. Immediately prior to use for vaccine production, lyophilized SVN53- 
67/M57-KLH is reconstituted by [CONTACT_44579] 1.0 ml ste rile bacteriostatic saline into the vial. Next, 
the vial is allowed to stand at room temperature fo r 5 minutes (step 1), followed by [CONTACT_191245] 20 seconds (step 2). Steps 1 and 2 may be repea ted up to twice if necessary. The 
reconstituted peptide solution is to be used within  2 hours for emulsion preparation. 
 
3. Vaccine Preparation 
Steps required to prepare 1.6 mL of vaccine emulsio n in a 50/50 ratio (volume/volume) with 
Montanide ISA 51 VG: 
 
Step 1: Loading Products 
 
1.1. Using a sterile [ADDRESS_227431]® Luer lock syri nge equipped with a 20g sterile 
needle, withdraw 0.8 ml of saline-reconstituted SVN 53-67/M57-KLH from the vial. 
 
1.2. Discard the needle and remove the stopper from  a female two-sided I-connector and 
connect the syringe to one end of the I-connector. 
 
1.3. Remove all air from the system using light pre ssure on the syringe. 
 
1.4. Place connected syringe and I-connector in ste rile area. 
 
1.5. Using another sterile [ADDRESS_227432]® Luer loc k syringe equipped with a 20g 
needle, withdraw 0.[ADDRESS_227433] 
the syringe containing the Montanide to that end. M ake sure that both connections are secure 
and leak-free. 
 
1.8. An emulsion is created using a double-syringe technique via the interposed I-connector.

Step 2: Emulsification 
2.1. The emulsification process is accomplished in 2 stages, including: A pre-emulsification 
stage, performed at low speed; and an emulsificatio n stage, performed at high speed. 
 
2.2. Hold the syringe-connector-syringe system firm ly to maintain a secure connection. Each 
thumb will be used alternately to push the opposing  plungers apart. To avoid leakage, never 
push with both thumbs simultaneously. Push on the p lunger of one of the syringes in order to 
begin the mixing of both phases within a single syr inge. 
 
2.3. Begin emulsification by [CONTACT_191246] e volume from one syringe to the other slowly 
and repetitively. One cycle corresponds to passage of the entire contents of one syringe to the 
other syringe and back again. Perform the first 20 cycles at a slow rate (i.e. about 2 seconds to 
transfer the pre-mix from one side to the other or about 4 seconds for each complete cycle). 
This "pre-emulsion" stage will take about 80-[ADDRESS_227434] stage (20 cycles), the  speed of mixing is increased. The following 
[ADDRESS_227435] as pos sible. When the emulsion starts to form, 
resistance can be felt when applying pressure to th e syringe plunger. At this point, the mixture 
will take on a creamy appearance and will become vi scous. A timer set to 40 seconds can be 
used to avoid losing count. The total process (pre- emulsion and emulsion) will take 60 cycles. 
The total process should take about 2.5 minutes. 
 
Step 3: Testing of Emulsion 
 
3.1 Place one droplet of the peptide emulsion into a beaker of distilled water. The droplet 
should retain its shape on the surface of the water . If it does not, vaccine preparation should be 
repeated from the beginning. 
 
Step 4: Packaging 
 
4.1. Transfer 1.[ADDRESS_227436] it to a sterile 23g needle. 
 
4.3. Follow the procedure for patient vaccination u sing this syringe and needle.

Appendix 5: Contraceptive Guidance and Pregnancy Te sting 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche an d until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below)  
Women in the following categories are not considere d WOCBP: 
● Premenarchal 
● Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
○ Documented hysterectomy 
○ Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] 
○ Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personn el’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history in terview. 
● Postmenopausal female 
○ A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses fo r 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
▪ A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level i n the postmenopausal range may be 
used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not  using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range 
is required.  
○ Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the non-hormonal highly effective contraception met hods if they wish to continue their 
HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must disconti nue HRT to allow confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
 
Contraception Requirements 
Male Participants:  
Male participants with female partners of childbear ing potential are eligible to participate if they 
agree to one of the following:  
● Be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as t heir usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent 
on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to r emain abstinent 
● Use a male condom plus partner use of a contracep tive method with a failure rate of <1% per 
year as described in Table 9 when having penile-vag inal intercourse with a woman of 
childbearing potential who is not currently pregnan t. 
○ Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom dur ing each epi[INVESTIGATOR_191202].

Female Participants:  
Female participants of childbearing potential are e ligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception that has a  low user dependency consistently and 
correctly as described in Table 9.  
 
Table [ADDRESS_227437] Low User Depende ncy  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently  and correctly.  
● Progestogen- only contraceptive implant a, b  
● Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) b 
● Intrauterine device (IUD) 
● Bilateral tubal occlusion 
 
● Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contra ception method provided that the partner is the 
sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absen ce of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception  should be used.  
● Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period o f risk associated with the study treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evalua ted in relation to the duration of the study and th e 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
Notes: 
Use should be consistent with local regulations reg arding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies. 
 
a) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical  Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, 
acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to th ose which inhibit ovulation. 
b) If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentiall y decreased due to interaction with study 
treatment, condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment 
period and for at least [X days, corresponding to t ime needed to eliminate study treatment plus 30 
days for study treatments with genotoxic potential]   after the last dose of study treatment.

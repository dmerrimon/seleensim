Abstract Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a type of peripheral neuropathy that affects the small umyelinated fibers, including both somatic innervation of the skin and autonomic nerves. Although diabetes and prediabetes are the two most common causes, up to 50% of all SFN remain idiopathic. Currently there is no effective treatment that prevents it or reverses it through regeneration of nerve fibers.   Recent advances in understanding the molecular machinery that mediates Wallerian degeneration (i.e. degeneration of nerve fibers after physical transection) showed that key players in this pathway (e.g. NMNAT2, Sarm1) and NAD+ metabolites play a similar role in degeneration of axons in a distal-to-proximal manner seen in many peripheral neuropathies including SFN. Pre-clinical studies have shown that rapid depletion of NAD initiates a cascade of molecular events that leads to axon degeneration and that supplementation of a NAD precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR) can prevent this degeneration.  In this study we plan to evaluate the ability of NR to prevent degeneration of small somatic sensory axons innervating the epi[INVESTIGATOR_744655] a human experimental model of nerve degeneration and regeneration. This experimental human model has been used previously to evaluate the rate of nerve degeneration and regeneration in several peripheral neuropathies and in healthy subjects.   Since NR is available as a nutritional supplement, if successful, this research can lead to development of a therapy for a variety of peripheral neuropathies very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].    2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives) We propose to use an established model of capsaicin-induced axonal degeneration and regeneration to assess the potential of nicotinamide riboside (NR) to delay small unmyelinated nerve fiber degeneration as well as to promote regeneration. The study will test two hypotheses: (1) NR-treatment will reduce capsaicin-induced axonal degeneration in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_744656]. (2) NR-treatment will enhance axonal regeneration after capsaicin-induced epi[INVESTIGATOR_744657].

Background Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) manifests in a variety of different diseases and often results in symptoms of burning pain, shooting pain, allodynia, and hyperesthesia (Tavee and Zhou, 2009).  Although strength remains preserved in patients with SFN, the pain and paresthesia’s are often disabling.  Diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in combination with metabolic disease are the most common identified causes of SFN (Hovaguimian and Gibbons, 2011). In these cases, besides strict glucose control, no other treatment option has demonstrated the ability to slow or prevent axon loss in people with diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.  Pathologically, the peripheral nerve damage in patients with SFN affects predominantly or exclusively the small myelinated (Aδ) fibers or unmyelinated C fibers.  Many small fiber neuropathy patients test normally on conventional electrophysiological tests because intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_744658].   Thus, in many patients, the only objective evidence of neuropathy is by [CONTACT_744670][INVESTIGATOR_192102] (IENFD) in the collected skin tissue samples (Holland et al., 1998),    The capsaicin cream is an FDA approved medication available over the counter for treatment of various conditions including arthritis related joint pain and post herpetic neuralgia (Fernandes et al., 2016).  It is the active ingredient in hot chili peppers and has been shown to bind vanilloid receptors on C- and A-delta nerve fibers leading to calcium entry and subsequent axonal degeneration (Marsh et al., 1987; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_49954]., 1990).   The application of over-the-counter strength capsaicin cream (0.1%) for 48 hours leads to loss of intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_744659] (Simone et al., 1998; Nolano et al., 1999). Associated with the loss of intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_744660] a decrease in sensation in the area of the patch. Over weeks to months, the fibers slowly regenerate, repopulating the treated area (Polydefkis et al., 2004; Hahn et al., 2007).  This regenerative response is associated with improved sensory function as well.   Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a pyridine-nucleoside form of vitamin B3 that functions as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or NAD+.   Studies in mice have shown that boosting the levels of NAD+ can produce multiple health benefits, including reducing nerve damage (Trammell et al., 2016a; Hamity et al., 2017). In humans, the levels of NAD+ diminish with age and it has been suggested that loss of this metabolite may play a role in age-related health decline (Johnson and Imai, 2018).  NR is FDA approved as a dietary supplement and can be purchased over the counter.    4. Study Procedures a. Study design: This is a randomized double-blinded study to evaluate the effects of NR on experimental axon degeneration and regeneration. After the initial screening (visit 1) is completed, the patients will undergo a skin biopsy and be randomized to either the study drug or placebo and will be instructed to take it for a week prior to visit 2. Based on existing pharmacokinetic studies, this should be sufficient to raise the plasma NAD levels at the time of experimental denervation of the skin. At visit 2, patients will undergo two baseline skin biopsies and application of the capsaicin patch for 48 hours and will be instructed to continue the study drug. At visit 3 (48 hours after visit 2), capsaicin patch will be removed, and a repeat skin biopsy will be done to evaluate the degree of epi[INVESTIGATOR_744661]. Patients will be instructed to continue the study drug for another 3 months and will undergo repeat skin biopsies at 2 months (visit 4) and 3

Blood samples will also be drawn at each visit to measure NAD levels to confirm compliance and to correlate with degree of epi[INVESTIGATOR_744662]. Figure [ADDRESS_1018635] current therapy stopped. The patients will continue with their current routine care. They will not be asked to stop any medication or care.  e. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group. Since human nerves degenerate and regenerate at different rates, in order to find out if NR has any therapeutic value, we do need to include a placebo control group.  f. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria. No participant will be removed from the study. Even if the treatment does not lead to faster nerve regeneration, previous research has shown that after topi[INVESTIGATOR_41956], epi[INVESTIGATOR_744663] 6 months. We will examine whether NR can speed this regeneration.   Figure 1: Study Timeline

Drugs/ Substances/ Devices a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used. As outlined in background section NR is commercially available as a nutritional supplement and has been evaluated in humans in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study (Trammell et al., 2016b). It is safe at the doses used in that study (100 mg, 300 mg and 1000 mg) over the course of [ADDRESS_1018636] dose of 1000 mg/day. There were no significant side effects or toxicity at that dose over 36 days of observation. Furthermore, a more recent clinical trial of NR in obese men looked at the effects of NR on insulin sensitivity over 12 weeks and utilized a dose of 1000 mg twice a day without any significant side effects or drop out from the study (Dollerup et al., 2018). In this study there were increases in multiple NAD metabolites in the serum and urine with this dose.  Given that both studies did not observe any side effects or toxicity doses above 1000 mg a day, and that the study by [CONTACT_744671], we plan to use 1000 mg orally (four 250mg capsules) twice a day for convenience

JHMIRB eFormA  01 Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1018637] studies, we know that following topi[INVESTIGATOR_744665], the epi[INVESTIGATOR_744666]. A previous study of 66 healthy control subjects, the baseline intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_744667] 22.7 + 10.1 fibers/mm (Polydefkis et al., 2006).  Following [ADDRESS_1018638]-capsaicin IENFD was 0.25 + 0.04 fibers/mm (nearly 99% reduction in nerve fiber density).  We expect a very similar study subject profile in the current study. If that is true, 20 subjects/arm will have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_1018639]-capsaicin epi[INVESTIGATOR_744668] 0.035 fibers/mm. If our subjects show more variability (standard deviation of 0.06 instead of 0.04) we would still have a power of 80% to detect a difference of 0.055 fibers/mm. Therefore, we are confident that a sample of 20 subjects/ group is sufficient to determine whether NR decreases axonal degeneration in our model.  Aim [ADDRESS_1018640] time. Across several studies, this rate of nerve fiber regrowth has been 0.18 + 0.08 fibers/mm/day (Polydefkis et al., 2004).  A sample of 20 subjects/group will have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_1018641] a 40% or greater change in nerve fiber regeneration. We will have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_1018642] a 30% improvement in regeneration.  d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. The study will be terminated early if the subjects experience any significant side effects. NR is produced as a supplement by a number of different manufacturers. There have been no side effects reported. Additionally, it was well tolerated in several published studies. Therefore we do not anticipate any toxicity. If a subject complains of side effects, the potential for any causation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6283]. Hoke and Polydefkis and reported to the IRB.   8. Risks

JHMIRB eFormA  01 Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_1018643] been successfully performed in numerous Johns Hopkins IRB-approved studies ( including as part of six industry-sponsored multicenter clinical trials with over 600 subjects total. Therefore, we do not anticipate any complications.  Neurological exam:  There are no risks associated with a neurological examination.   Capsaicin cream: Capsaicin is the active ingredient in hot peppers and may cause a local burning sensation to the area that it is applied.  The degree of burning is generally less than mild sunburn.  The affected area will become less sensitive to sensory stimuli due to local nerve fiber degeneration.  With time the area should return to normal or near normal with subsequent nerve regeneration and reinnervation of the skin. We have obtained IRB approval for similar studies in the past (RPN00-10-25-01, RPN 99-11-02-01, NA_00010088 (multicenter trial), WIRB Pr. No.:  20060008 (multicenter trial)) and have a FDA exemption letter for the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_41956]. The study participants may use over-the-counter, non-steroidal pain medications to manage any pain associated with the use of capsaicin cream.   Skin biopsy testing requires taking a 3mm-punch biopsy.  The affected areas are anesthetized with subcutaneous 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and the site will be sterilely dressed after the procedure.  No sutures are involved.  The patients will receive instructions how to care for each biopsy site after the procedure. The risk of infection is estimated at 1:500 and is likely less in healthy subjects.  Punch skin biopsy may result in a small scar that generally fades by [CONTACT_122467].    b. Steps taken to minimize the risks. The skin biopsies will be done under sterile conditions. Patients will be given clear instructions on how to care for the biopsy sites.   c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. If the patients experience any signs of infection at the site of biopsies, they will be asked to call the study coordinator and/or principal investigator. They will be seen in the clinic and appropriate medical care will be provided. Similarly, if the patients experience any side effects from the study drug, they will be asked to call the study coordinator and/or the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_744669].   d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality. In order to preserve participant confidentiality, all study participant records will be stored in a locked file cabinet located in the study coordinator’s office. All subjects will be given a study-specific unique identifying number and this will be used to label study documents. Data spreadsheets will use deidentified subject study numbers and will be password protected and stored on the study coordinator’s computer which is backed up regularly.  e. Financial risks to the participants. There is no cost to participate in the study.    9. Benefits

Background , Rationale  and Context   
 
EMERALD (Emergency Medicine Cardiovascular Risk Assessment for Lipid Disorders) is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_856091] (HLD) 
in the Emergency Department (ED) and will collect data essential to inform a future randomized 
controlled trial comparing ED HLD treatment  to usual care (future NHLBI submission). HLD is a 
key cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor that is causally associated with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of US mortality and morbidity . 1–[ADDRESS_1192153] 40% of ED patients with chest pain have poor ly managed or 
unrecognized HLD .[ADDRESS_1192154] of care in the Emergency Department. Therefore, the 
current ED care paradigm, which does not address HLD, represents a missed opportunity to 
prevent ASCVD events. Every 38.7 mg/dL reduction in low -density lipoprotein -cholesterol (LDL -
C) is associated with a 21% decrease in ASCVD events and  a 24% decrease in mortality.  5,6 
Thus, there is a clear opportunity to improve health for the millions of patients who present to 
the ED each year with undia gnosed and/or unmanaged HLD. 7,[ADDRESS_1192155] developed a novel ED -based HLD screening 
and treatment program: EMERALD (Emergency Medicine Cardiovascular Risk Assessment for 
Lipid Disorders). Thi s program adapts HLD recommendations from the 2013 AHA/ACC and 
2022 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines to the ED setting. The EMERALD 
intervention involves 1) ordering an ED lipid panel, 2) calculating 10 -year ASCVD risk using the 
Pooled Cohort Equations9, 3) prescribing a moderate - or high -intensity statin if applicable, and 
4) referring patients to outpatient care (primary care, preventive cardiology, or general 
cardiology , depending on risk level).  10–12 Our preliminary data demonstrate that >90% of ED 
patients with acute chest pain believe the ED is an appropriate place to evaluate for HLD and 
>80% believe it is a reasonable place to start medical therapy for HLD. However, the feasibility 
of screening for HLD and initiating treatment in the ED setting is unclear.  It is unknown whether 
patients prescribed HLD treatment will fill these prescriptions, take their medication, and 
complete schedule d follow -ups. In addition, it is not clear whether busy Emergency Physicians 
will adopt and follow the steps of a preventative HLD care program.  
 
Objective s  
 
What is needed now is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_856092] -C. We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 20 
patients designed to assess the feasibility of EMERALD and to explore changes in LDL -C by 
[CONTACT_856102]. The specific aims of this study are:  
 
Aim 1: T est the feasibility of EMERALD . We will determine the proportion of patients who 
receive a complete EMERALD assessment (ED lipid panel drawn, 10 -year ASCVD risk 
Protocol version:  
Template updated 9.24.14  3 calculated with the Pooled Cohort Equations, and prescribed a statin), fill their prescription 
within 7 -days of the ED encounter, and follow -up at 30 -days for a repeat lipid panel.  
 
Aim 2: Explore changes in LDL -C after initiating preventive care with statin therapy in the 
ED. The primary outcome will be change in LDL -C at 30 -days. The secondary out come will be 
change at 30 -days in non -high-density lipoprotein -cholesterol (non -HDL-C). 
 
Our experienced team is well -equipped to conduct this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This innovative proposal is a 
key step for determining if EMERALD is feasible and estimating its impact on LDL -C at [ADDRESS_1192156]  undiagnosed and/or unmanaged HLD. The 
concept could be expanded to other modifiable CVD risk factors, including diabetes, 
hypertension, obesity, and smoking.  
 
 
Methods : 
 
Overview and Design  
 
We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 20 patients designed to assess the feasibility of EMERALD 
and to explore changes in LDL -C by [CONTACT_856102].  
 
Subjects will be screened for Emerald  in the Emergency Department.  Research staff  and 
investigators  will screen for subjects in the Emergency D epartments with  the electric screening 
“track boards”. We will then screen patient health records and speak to their ED providers about 
EMERALD .  Labs will be ordered so that we can either rule in or out a patient for research.  
 
If they meet inclusion and no exclusion criteria, their treating Emergency Physician will be 
asked to initiate the EMERALD protocol, including: 1) ordering a lipid panel during the index 
ED encounter and 30 -days after ED discharge, 2) completion of the Pooled Cohort 
Equations, and 3) starting med ical therapy (moderate - or high -intensity statin, if appropriate)  
in the ED.  
 
The r esearch will take place in the Emergency D epartment at Wake Forest Baptist Medical 
Center. Follow -ups w ill occur in the CTSI CRU sp ace, Emergency Medicine CRU, or, if deemed 
appropriate, at an alternate site (e.g., subject's residence, local healthcare professional's site) 
for the 30 day follow -ups.

Intervention  and Procedure   
 
This program adapts HLD recommendations from the 2013 AHA/ACC and [ADDRESS_1192157] 
pain who are 40 -75 years old with an LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on an ED lipid panel or have known 
diabetes or ASCVD . For patients enrolled, their treating Emergency Physician will be asked 
to initiate the EMERALD protocol, including: 1) ordering a lipid panel during the index ED 
encounter and 30 -days  (+/- 5 business days ) after ED discharge, 2) completion of the 
Pooled Cohort Equations  by [CONTACT_102]’s ED provider  at the index visit , 3) starting medical 
therapy (moderate - or high -intensity statin / rosuvastin ) in the ED, if applicable , and  4) having 
subjects complete a drug diary documenting drug usage . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_856095] -C 
concentration, which are needed to inform a future randomized trial (future NHLB I 
submission). Ignition funds will be used to pay for lipid measures, support statistical 
analysis, and provide patient compensation. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_856096] a future randomized controlled trial of EMERALD (future NHLBI 
submission).  
 
 
The EMERALD procedure involves  
1) Ordering an ED lipid panel  
2) The subject’s ED provider c alculating the 10-year ASCVD risk using the Pooled 
Cohort Equations9 at the index visit , 
3) Based on the trial diagram, p rescribing a moderate - or high -intensity statin  (either  
rosuvastatin 10mg daily or  rosuv astatin 40 mg daily ) if applicable,  
Protocol version:  
Template updated 9.24.14  5 4) Have subjects complete a drug diary during the 3 0 days before their follow -up, and  
5) Bring subjects back 30-days  (+/- 5 business days ) after ED discharge  to retest their 
Lipid Panel  
 
Outcome  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_856097] -C and non -HDL-C. We anticipate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_856098] (ED lipid panel drawn, 10 -year ASCVD 
risk asse ssment performed, and statin therapy initiated) and will result in a trend towards 
reduced LDL -C among participants . 
 
 
Analytical Plan  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_856097] -C and non -HDL-C. We anticipate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_856098] (ED lipid panel drawn, 10 -year ASCVD 
risk assessment performed, and statin therapy initiated) and will result in a trend towards 
reduced LD L-C among participants. These data will support a future NHLBI submission (likely 
K23 award for [CONTACT_856105] with [CONTACT_856107] as mentor), which will use a randomized 
controlled trial design to examine the efficacy and patient adherence to EMERALD on a larger 
scale. If the pi[INVESTIGATOR_856099], then the investigative team 
will reconsider the EMERALD program design before pursuing NIH funding. In either case, the 
data from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_856100] s and used to produce the first publication 
regarding ED -initiated medical therapy for HLD.

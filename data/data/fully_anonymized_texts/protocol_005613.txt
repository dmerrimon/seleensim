1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
Front-line treatment for ADHD includes the use of stimulant medications, which is 
effective in reducing the core symptoms of the disorder but are associated with 
well-documented side effects. In addition, there is recent evidence that 
pharmacological treatment may not show optimal benefits in some cognitive domains. (Biederman, J, et  al 2015). Computerized cognitive training programs 
have shown some promise to improve working memory and attention in ADHD 
populations. (Klinberg, T
.)[Further research is needed to validate the 
effectiveness of currently available computerized cognitive i nterventions as well 
as for consumer-grade gamified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_407688].  
 
This protocol will evaluate the effects of a novel, highly -immersive, videogame- 
based interventions for ADHD Project: EVO that was derived from a comparable 
cognitive training program shown to have robust effects on working memory, 
attention,  and related constructs in older adults.(Angora,  J.A., et al) EVO Multitask 
incorporates adaptive, simultaneous cognitive tasks into a consumer-grade action 
video gaming-like platform with high-quality graphics and reward loops, and is 
deployed on mobile devices (i.e., tablets). We hypothesized that EVO Multitask 
digital therapy would be well -tolerated and feasible to administer to pediatric 
participants with ADHD, and would improve functioning in relevant cognitive 
domains. As a control, this protocol will also evaluate the effects of a highly - 
immersive educational videogame, “EVO Words” in a matched, time -on-task 
manner. 
 
Novel, cost-effective, and easy to implement/disseminate non -pharmacological 
interventions for ADHD could be helpful for many participants given limitations of 
other approved interventions.  
 
1.2   Clinical Experience with Study Agent(s) 
Akili has evaluated the EVO Multitask digital  therapy in various clinical populations 
as described below.  
 
Most relevant to the current protocol, a multi-site, open-label, proof -of- 
concept study was recently completed in children with ADHD. In this study, 
ADHD (N = 40, Mean Age = 10.3 years) and age-matched neuro-typi[INVESTIGATOR_185323] (N 
=40, Mean Age = 10.5 years) participants were recruited from 3 sites and screened 
for enrollment. A one month, at -home intervention followed,  which

Confidential  1.02/25- Jul-[ADDRESS_514302] -intervention assessment. Measures of cognitive 
function (TOVA, CANTAB) and behaviors (Parent -BRIEF) were collected at 
Screening and Post -Intervention. Tolerability, compliance, and acceptability were 
also assessed. No treatment related adverse events were reported. The ADHD 
group completed an average of 81% of the required at -home sessions, and 
reported a high level of enjoyment on average. The Attention Performance Index 
composite score from the TOVA improved significantly from pre-post intervention (p = 0.033, Cohen’s d = 0.35) in the ADHD group. There was no change in the neuro-typi[INVESTIGATOR_185324] (p = 0.30, Coh en’s d = 0.16). A post -hoc sub-population 
analysis of a large group of ADHD participants with greater cognitive and symptom 
severity at Baseline (TOVA API <= -1.8 & ADHD-RS >=30) showed a larger effect 
of the intervention (p = 0.003, Cohen’s d = 0.71). The  CANTAB Spatial Working 
Memory test showed statistically significant improvements on 9 of its 19 reported 
measures for the ADHD group while the neuro -typi[INVESTIGATOR_185325] 3 of the 
19 measures. For the Parent -BRIEF, the ADHD group showed improvements f or 
working memory, however this measure did not meet the alpha criterion for 
multiple comparisons. No change was found for the Parent -BRIEF in the neuro- 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_185326]. Results from this proof -of-concept study provide initial support 
for this novel, consumer-grade video game intervention as a potential treatment for attention and working memory symptoms in pediatric ADHD  populations.  
 
Additional studies using EVO Multitask in related populations include:  
 
A feasibility study was conducted at a small college for individuals with ADHD and other related learning difficulties. Forty-four students with a diagnosis of ADHD, ASD, LD (or a combination thereof), were asked to play EVO Multitask in their dorm rooms for 30 minutes/day for 1 week. The study showed that EVO Multitask was generally engaging and the one week protocol 
was feasible. 
General Results: 
• Over the week, participants were able to complete, on average,  25% 
progress through the game (matching the expected pace of 100% progress through 4 weeks). 
• The participants demonstrated an expected deficit in baseline game 
performance when playing in the multi -task environment as compared to 
single-task, confirming an interference processing  deficit.

Confidential  1.02/25- Jul-16  
  
• Over the week protocol, there was significant improvement in  subject 
reaction time, as measured in the EVO Multitask program. 
• No treatment related adverse events were reported. 
 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_407689], San Francisco (UCSF), 45 children ages 6 to 14 (23 with sensory 
processing disorders / 22 age-matched neuro-typi[INVESTIGATOR_185328]), were asked to play 
EVO Multitask at home for 30 minutes/day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. Both 
groups demonstrated that EVO was generally engaging and a 4 -week at-home 
protocol in these populations was  feasible. 
General Results: 
• Participants completed, on average, greate r than 70% of the game 
sessions. 
• Over the first ~1.5 weeks of at-home play, there was improvement (~70 – 
150%) in reaction time, as measured in the EVO  program. 
• No treatment related adverse events were reported. 
 
In a feasibility study at the Center for Autism Research Disorders (CARD- ABA Clinic) , 10 children with low-functioning autism ages 4 to 14, were 
evaluated for their ability to engage with the EVO Multitask digital therapy during an in-clinic visit. Optionally they could take the game home for 1 we ek of at-home 
intervention play. 
General Results: 
• Younger participants with more severe ASD were unable to engage  with 
EVO Multitask (the digital therapy mechanics and instruction were too 
difficult). 
• Two of the older participants with somewhat less impairment took EVO 
Multitask home. These participants completed less than 25% of the game 
over the week, implying that at-home gameplay may not be feasible for 
this population.  
• No treatment related adverse events were reported in any of  the 
participants. 
 
Additionally, Akili is currently conducting ongoing research in several additional 
clinical populations including geria tric depression, traumatic brain injury, 
Parkinson’s disease, cerebrovascular disease, and prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. To date no treatment related adverse events have been reported.

incontrovertible short -term benefits across core symptoms of ADHD and 
associated impairments. However, there are limitations to  current best practices

With respect to pharmacological interventions, they are accompanied by [CONTACT_185351], do not normalize functioning, and adherence rates over time are generally low. The latter  aspect is likely related to the fact that longer-term 
benefits  of medication for ADHD are modest. Longitudinal  studies have shown that 
acute improvements in ADHD symptoms and functioning are not maintained beyond 24-[ADDRESS_514304] been designed to provide an engaging, consumer -level experience that will

This study will fill this gap with a large (minimum of 300 participants) randomized parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either the EVO Multitask experimental intervention or the EVO Words educational 
control and instructed to play the digital therapi[INVESTIGATOR_185329] 25 minutes/day for 5 days/week over a 4 week treatment period. Change in Baseline on the Attention 
Performance Index from the TOVA 8 will serve as the primary outcome variable 
and will allow for a determination of whether EVO Multitask significantly improves 
attentional functioning in pediatric participants with ADHD. Secondary measures will include measures of ADHD symptoms, oth er measures of cognition and 
executive functioning, and measures of patient and parent/caregiver experience and satisfaction.

The therapeutic play regimen for the current study  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25 minutes/day; 5 
days/week; 4 weeks) was established based on previous work with the EVO 
Multitask digital therapy. Specifically, a proof -of-concept study demonstrated that 
this regimen resulted in significant improvements in API [INVESTIGATOR_185330] a sample of 
children with similar characteristics as proposed for this study. Results from the current study may also inform the development of additional dose -finding studies 
to determine whether  additional  (or less) game play might yield different results. It 
will also form the basis of additional studies to examine the durability of the intervention over time.

4. STUDY DESIGN 
 
4.1. OVERVIEW OF STUDY 
The study will be a blinded (investigators and outcome assessors) randomized, 
parallel group, controlled trial of EVO Multitasking game -based digital therapy 
versus EVO Words game-based digital therapy.  
The trial will consist of 3 primary phases: Screening, Washout/Baseline, and Treatment. During the Screening Phase (Day -28 to Day -7), participants will 
undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Screening may take place up to 28 days before the Baseline Visit (Day 0). F or those children currently on 
medication for ADHD the Washout period will begin 7 days prior to Baseline where 
treatment will be discontinued. On Day 0, the Baseline visit will occur wherein additional  eligibility  criteria will be established (ADHD-RS scores and API [INVESTIGATOR_103835]). 
The Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 27) will involve playing the digital therapy at home for each participant followed  by [CONTACT_185356]-Clinic assessment on Day [ADDRESS_514309] also 
be medically healthy, willing to discontinue any ongoing treatment, and free from other significant psychiatric comorbidities.  
Two different electronically administered dig ital therapi[INVESTIGATOR_185334]: 
Treatment #[ADDRESS_514310]: EVO Mobile Game -Based Digital Therapy 
Intervention (EVO Multitasking therapy), a proprietary system based on a 
prototype cognitive training videogame called Neuroracer. EVO Multitasking digital 
therapy was designed to incorporate the fundamental features of Neuroracer into a state-of-the -art mobile video game-like platform, which deploys modern 
videogame graphics, engaging reward loops, and real-time adaptive mechanics to 
dynamically personalize difficulty based on the user’s ability. EVO Multitasking 
therapy employs a perceptual discrimination attention/memory task as well as a 
continuous motor 'driving' task. Performance on these tasks are assessed in 
isolation and when performed together to calculate a performance index for each individual user. A personalized multi -task training regimen is automatically 
configured and delivered to the user, and is optimized adaptively to increase multi- 
task performance. As play ers proceed through the therapy periodic re -calibration 
occurs to maintain an optimal difficulty  level.

• Break: Participants should be allowed a 10 minute break following the 
TOVA / CANTAB tests. During the break they may have a snack but no 
caffeinated beverages are allowed  
 
• In-Clinic Assessment/Training for EVO Multitaski ng therapy OR EVO 
Words therapy (depending upon randomization). The subject will only 
practice  on the therapy  to which they were randomized. The subject  should 
play either EVO Multitask or Words for approximately 10 minutes. (Note: The parents should observe their child interact with the therapy as they will 
be asked to rate their expectations of possible benefit). Separate instructions will be provided to an unblinded clinical coordinator to log the 
subject into either the EVO or Words therapy. During the 10 minutes of in - 
clinic play, the unblinded coordinator should observe the participants play to ensure he or she can follow the rules (which are in Engl ish) of their 
assigned therapy. The unblinded coordinator should also make note of any 
motor conditions or uncorrected visual acuity that prevents proper game play. Participants that are unable to properly play their therapy will be withdrawn from the study. Note: For EVO Words the participant should be able to spell at least two words during the assessment. At the end of approximately [ADDRESS_514317] stop his/her play (at an obvious break point in the game) and turn 
the iPad off. At this point, the parent should complete the Baseline Expectation Survey 
 
• Materials to go home: An unblinded coordinator should provide the parents 
with of a copy of their ICF and child assent along with the instructions for 
their child’s therapy. The parents should be told that their child is expected 
to play their therapy for typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25 minutes/day, 5 days/week. NOTE: The 
parent and child should be told that no one except the child may play 
the therapy for any reason. The child should be provided with same iPad 
they previously played in the clinic along with a battery charger. In addition, 
both parent and participant should be instruction on intended and 
unintended use of the device. These are defined  as: 
 
§ Intended  use- Set up of the participant’s local WiFi  network for 
internet access to push play and compliance data to the Akili 
secure severs, and completion of at -home interventional play 
for the assigned 25 minutes per day, during 5 days of each 
calendar week. 
 
§ Unintended  use – Any and all other  features or applications of 
the device, including accessing the internet, downloading of additional applications, use of features such as music, calendar, or notes, and inputting any personal information other than participant’s home W iFi network as described 
above.

based on all available information. The results of the CGI -Severity scale 
should be recorded in the CRF 
 
• Randomization: The participants will be provided with an iPad which is 
engraved in the back with a serial number (“AL-###”). The iPads will be 
preloaded with either EVO Multitasking therapy or EVO Words therapy. A 
separate document will list the blinded treatment  assignment. 
 
• Break: Participants should be allowed a 10 minute break following the 
TOVA / CANTAB tests. During the break they may have a snack but no 
caffeinated beverages are allowed  
 
• In-Clinic Assessment/Training for EVO Multitasking therapy OR EVO 
Words therapy (depending upon randomization): The subject should play: 
either EVO Multitask or EVO Words for approximately 10 minutes. (Note: The parents should observe their child interact with  the therapy as they will 
be asked to rate their expectations of possible benefit). Separate instructions will be provided to an unblinded clinical coordinator to log the subject into either the EVO Multitask or EVO Words therapy. During the 10 
minutes of in-clinic play, the un-blinded coordinator should observe the participants play to ensure he or she can follow the rules (which are in English) of their assigned game. The un -blinded coordinator should also 
make note of any motor conditions or uncorrected visual acuity that prevents proper game play. Participants that are unable to properly play their therapy will be withdrawn from the study. Note: For EVO Words the participant should be able to spell at least two words during the assessment. 
At the end of approximately [ADDRESS_514320] stop his/her play (at an obvious break point in the game) and turn the iPad off. At this point,  the parent  should  complete  the Baseline 
Expectation Survey 
 
• Materials to go home: An un-blinded coordinator should provide the parents 
with of a copy of their ICF and child assent along with the instructions for 
their child’s therapy. The parents should be told that their child is expected 
to play their therapy for typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25 minutes/day, 5 days/week. NOTE: The 
parent and child should be told that no one except the child may play 
the game for any reason. The child should be provided with same iPad

4.5 Treatment Procedures – In-Home Game Play and Post-Treatment Visit 
Beginning on the first day after the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1 for untreated 
children at Screening; Visit 1a for those children requiring medication washout), participants will initiate at -home play with their randomized therapy (EVO 
Multitasking or EVO Words). The therapy will pi[INVESTIGATOR_407696] -clinic session. Participants and their parents will be instructed during 
Screening and Baseline that the expectations for  play will be typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25 
minutes/day, 5 days/week.  
 
For each play epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], participants will logon to their assigned iPad with a unique ID and initiate therapeutic play. Log on passwords and game instructions will be provided separately. Details about pe rformance and duration of play will be 
recorded and uploaded to central servers (when the iPad is connected to WiFi)  for 
data capture. Compliance with therapy play requirements will be monitored automatically and sites will receive daily email notifications. For participants not meeting the requirements, email reminders and instructions will be provided. 
Additionally, EVO Multitasking and EVO Words both contain built -in features that 
remind the participant to play. Participants who fail to meet play requirements will 
be contact[CONTACT_185362]-blinded site clinical coordinator to troubleshoot problems and problem-solve to increase compliance (Scripts for these communications will 
be described in a separate document). During the demographic data collection, 
the parent should specify the preferred method by [CONTACT_407714] (e.g. phone, text, or email). Addit ionally parents will receive a weekly 
and automatically generated progress email report directly from the Sponsor (Akili) 
by [CONTACT_185364]. However, parents may elect to  opt-out 
at the time of informed consent.

On day 21 the study site should remind the parents by [CONTACT_648], preferably (email 
and/or text are also acceptable), that their child is entering the last week of the 
study (A script for this communication will be described in a separate document).  
 
The post-treatment visit (Visit 2 will be scheduled to occur 4 weeks after the 
Baseline Visit. If the parent and child are unable to return to the clinic on Day 28, 
Day 28 + 3 days is acceptable (the subjec t should be encouraged to continue to 
play their therapy during this exception period). Children who have been ill or taken 
medication within [ADDRESS_514321] impacted functioning 
within 48 hours. At this visit, participants will be re-assessed for attentional functioning, ADHD symptoms, and impairment. Additional information regarding 
satisfaction and experience with the therapy will be collected from both participants 
and their  parents/caregivers.  
 
NOTE: The parent and subject should return to the clinic at approximately the 
same time of day (i.e. morning or afternoon) as was done for the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1 or 1a for untreated or treated children, 
respectively). Assessments should also be administered in the same order per the 
Table of Procedures in Section 4.3. Also, all attempts should be made to ensure 
that the same parent/caregiver accompany the subject and complete the outcome 
measures. Also, all attempts should be made to ensure t hat the same study staff 
administers the subjective clinical outcome measures (ADHD -RS, CGI, and IRS). 
 
Specific procedures to be completed during the Post -Treatment Visit include: 
 
• C-SSRS (Since last visit): The results of the C-SSRS should be recorded 
in the  CRF 
 
• Clinician completed ADHD-RS: Results of the ADHD-RS should be

4.[ADDRESS_514324] device and which is the comparator. The clinicians and 
staff completing assessments will be blinded to which device each participant is assigned. An un-blinded staff member at each site will be designated in order to provide initial instructions for use at the Screening/Baseline Visit, monitor compliance, and follow up with parents as required. Parents and participants will be instructed not to share instructions about  the details  of the intervention to which 
they were assigned to the study staff during their subsequent End of Treatment visit (Visit 2).). Additional details around the procedures to be used to minimize bias and blind participants/parents and site staff are as  follows. 
 
Since the EVO Multitasking therapy and the EVO Words therapy are fundamentally 
different, true blinding is not possible for this study. The following  study procedures 
will be implemented to maximize the chances that 1) participants and their parents 
are not aware of which treatment condition is the test intervention and which is the

comparator; and 2) that site staff involved in completing outcome measures are 
blinded to treatment assignment.  
 
4.6.1  Procedures to minimize bias in parents and  participants. 
 
All communication between site staff and participants/parents should 
emphasize  that this is a study to evaluate the effects of [ADDRESS_514325], they should be informed that the study is designed to evaluate how they compare to one another  on 
ADHD functioning. During Screening/Baseline, participants/parents will be reminded not to discuss the details or content of their assigned treatment with anyone at the site other  than the un-blinded coordinator who will review 
the instructions for the randomized therapy with each participant. Participants/parent will also be discouraged from discussing the details/content  of their assigned therapy with other  children/families outside 
of the  study. 
 
4.6.2 Procedures to blind/minimize bias in site staff and  investigators. 
 
Following  Screening and prior to randomization,  investigators and site staff 
will remind participants/parents not to discuss the content/details of their assigned treatment with anyone at the site except the un-blinded 
coordinator. Upon returning to the clinical site for their Baseline 1a visit (for 
participants who require washout) and for their follow -up (Visit 2) visit, 
participants and their families will be reminded not to discuss the content/details of their assigned treatment with other site staff. Following randomization at the end of Visit 1 (or Visit 1a for participants requiring washout), participants/parents will only have direct contact [CONTACT_407715]. Participants/parents will be reminded not to discuss the 
content/details of their assigned treatment in the event of any phone calls or unscheduled visits that might occur prior to the Visit 2. Inve stigators and 
other blinded site staff will not have access to any source documents or CRFs that may compromise the blind.  
 
 
4.6.3 Procedures in the event of possible or probable  unblinding.  
 
If at any point after randomization an Investigator or other site staff 
responsible for completing any of the outcome measures becomes possibly 
or probably un-blinded, the following procedures should be  implemented:

• A description of the un-blinding event should be generated and sent 
to the DCRI  Coordinating PI (Kollins), Medical Monitor (Krystal) and 
Project Leader. 
 
• If there are still study assessments that need to be completed, an 
alternative and blinded rater should be used, if available at the site 
(e.g., a Sub-I) 
 
• If a blinded Sub-I or other trained and qualified blinded rater is not 
available, the measures should  be completed by [CONTACT_185366]. 
 
Note: In the event of unblinding as described above or if study staff 
explicitly unblinds the parent or participant to the study hypothesis, the unblinding event will be noted in the CRF.  
 
4.8 Randomization Procedures 
 
Participants who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign the informed 
consent/assent will be enrolled. Randomization will occur during the baseline visit 
only after ADHD diagnosis is confirmed via the MINI -Kid. The treatment given to 
individual participants will be determined by a randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_185367] (DCRI) 
statistics group using a validated computer software (SAS) that incorporates a 
standard procedure for generating r andom numbers. A copy of the randomization 
schedule scheme will be held by [CONTACT_185368]. The randomization scheme will be monitored monthly through the enrollment period 
for accuracy. This schedule will be loaded into the clinical databas e 
randomization module. Participants randomized into the study will be assigned 
the treatment corresponding to the next available number in the randomization schedule. Any participants that show non -compliance as described in Section 
8.5.1 will be  replaced. 
 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an iPad preloaded with EVO Multitasking therapy or an iPad preloaded with EVO Words therapy. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_185369]. Group #1 - 
washed out of stimulant (at time of informed consent) and group #2 - wasn’t on 
stimulant (at time of informed consent). Although no official gender stratification  is 
indicated, study sites will use their best efforts to gender -match and enroll a 
minimum of 30% girls.

5 STUDY DEVICE 
The study devices are NOT intended to be used for any purpose other than that 
outlined in this  protocol. 
 
Description of Study Device (EVO Multitasking therapy): EVO Multitasking therapy 
will be loaded by [CONTACT_456] (Akili) onto iPad Mini II tablets. The iPads are configured to minimize the participants’ ability to utilize non -study related 
applications. Features such as browsing the internet, downloading apps, deleting apps, and messaging are restricted. However, some functions such as Music 
(which may provide for downloading  via iTunes), Notes, Calendar,  and Reminders 
may potentially be accessed by [CONTACT_4317]. Unblinded site staff will instruct participants and parents on inten ded and unintended use, as outlined in this 
protocol. The iPads along with chargers will be provided by [CONTACT_407716]. In a separate document, a list of logon credential (Subject IDs and 
Passwords) will be provided. All data entered by [CONTACT_185373].  
 
Description of Study Device (EVO Words therapy): EVO Words therapy will be loaded by [CONTACT_456] (Akili) onto iPad Mini II tablets. The iPads are configured to minimize the participants’ ability to utilize non-study related applications. Features such as browsing internet, downloading apps, deleting apps, and messaging are restricted. However, some functions such as Music (which may provide for downloading via iTunes), Notes, Calenda r, and Reminders may 
potentially be accessed by [CONTACT_4317]. Unblinded site staff will instruct participants and parents on intended and unintended use, as outlined in this protocol. The iPads along with chargers will be provided by [CONTACT_407716]. In a separate document, a list of logon credential (Subject IDs and Passwords) will be provided. All data entered by [CONTACT_407717]. 
 
5.1 Study Device Usage  
Participants and their parents/c aregivers will be instructed to play their assigned 
therapy for a duration of typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 25 minutes/day for 5 days/week during each of the 4 weeks of the treatment phase of the study. For EVO Multitask 25 minutes/day 
is accomplished by [CONTACT_144828] 5 “sessions” of 4 to 5 minutes each. For EVO Words 25 minutes/day is accomplished via a displayed minute timer. Participants should initiate  play on the first day after  the Baseline Visit. Specifics about  which days and 
times during those days can be used for play will be free to vary among the participants based on their schedules. Time of play will be captured. Therapeutic play should continue up until the day prior to the End of Treatment visit (Visit  2.). 
Prior to initiating play, the subject should block out 25 minutes of uninterrupted 
time in a quite location where he or she can focus on playing their therapy. It’s very important that only the study subject plays the therapy. At no other time should anyone else be allowed to play the therapy.

Confidential  1.02/25- Jul-16  
  
Also, it’s important to make sure the iPad is connected to the participants home 
WiFi. If home WiFi is not available the study staff and parents need to establish a plan where the iPad will be connected to remote WiFi on a periodic basis during subject play (Note: The remote WiFi location should not require webpage authentication). The iPad will cache all data locally but without WiFi access the study sites will not receive accurate compliance reports  
To initiate  play, the subject taps on the game therapy icon displayed on the screen 
and follows the in-program instructions. Also, separate hard -copy instructions will 
be sent home with the parent.  The instructions  are specific to EVO Multitasking  or 
EVO Words therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], so the un-blinded clinical coor dinator will need to provide 
these. 
For any calendar day the therapy will automatically lock after approximately [ADDRESS_514326] completes 5 
“sessions” of 4 to 5 minutes each. For EVO Words, the therapy stops after 25 minutes. 
 
5.2 Potential Benefits/Risks of Study Device  
Based on preliminary data obtained in several studies, including a Proof -of- 
Concept trial in children with ADHD, the potential  benefits  of the EVO Multitasking 
game-based therapy for this population are to increase attentional functioning. Given the central role of attention in the pathophysiology of ADHD, this benefit is substantial. 
To date,  there have been no adverse events reported across several early studies 
with the device. The risk/benefit ratio for use is  favorable. 
Use of the EVO Words therapy has not been evaluated systematically. However, 
no adverse events are expected with the amount of play required in the present study. Moreover, given the nature of the EVO Words therapy, expected benefit  for 
the primary outcome measure and secondary measures is expected to be minimal. 
The risks to a participant participating in this study are very small. The study involves completing some computerized tests, game -based digital therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
answering some questions. It is possible that the participan t could become 
frustrated by [CONTACT_185374]. The participant could become fatigued by [CONTACT_407718]. If the participant becomes frustrated or fatigued,  they may stop at any time. There is a risk that the participant may access 
unintended  features (e.g. Music, Contacts, Reminders, Notes, or Calendar) during 
the course of their participation in the at-home portion of this study. In this instance, 
the participant may enter personal information onto the device. To circumvent associated risk, all data entered by [CONTACT_407719]. There are no other risks to taking part in this study of which we are aware.

5.3 Procedures for Monitoring Compliance and Replacing Participants 
Both EVO Multitask and EVO Words automatically capture gameplay compliance and upload these data directly to a central server when connected to WiFi. The server will automatically push daily c ompliance emails to the clinical sites (the 
format  of which is described in a separate document).  Based on these  emails,  un- 
blinded study staff can then reach out to the parents or participants (via the preferred contact [CONTACT_185377]) to trouble shoot 
technical problems and/or encourage more play. The rules for compliance outreach follow:  
 
1) Participants that fail to play any EVO Multitask or EVO Words  sessions 
over two or more days will be contact[CONTACT_407720] l WiFi 
connection problems (These participants will be highlighted in yellow  in 
the daily compliance email 
 
2) Participants fail to play at least 5 sessions of EVO Multitask or 25 minutes 
of EVO Words over 3 or more days will be contact[CONTACT_407721] (These participants will be highlighted in yellow in the daily  compliance 
email) 
 
3) Participants that fail to play any EVO Multitask or EVO Words sessions over 
7 days will be replaced (These participants will be highlighted  in red in the daily 
compliance report). These participants should NOT be told they are being replaced and should be encouraged to keep playing (as with other participants) and reminded to return to the clinic for their exit visit at the end of 
the study. 
 
4) Participants that fail to play at least 12 sessions of EVO Multitask or 60 
minutes of EVO Words over 14 days will be replaced (These participants will be highlighted in red in the daily compliance  report). These  participants  should 
NOT be told they are being replaced and should be encouraged to keep playing (as with other  participants) and reminded to return to the clinic for their 
exit visit at the end of the study. 
 
Additionally, parents will receive a weekly and automatically generated progress email report directly from the Sponsor (Akili), unless they have opted-out at the time of informed consent.  
 
Note: In the event a subject does not return to the clinic for their final exit visit or does not complete their assessments during the exit visit, this subject will be replaced.

7.2 Assessment  
 
7.2.1 Time Frame  
 
An ADE observed from the time of randomization through the final 
study visit (day 28) will be collected in clinical database eCOS  
 
7.2.2  Causality Rating 
 
The causal relationship of an adverse event to either study game will 
be rated as follows:  
 
Possible: An event that might be due to the use of the study device. 
An alternative explanation - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s) - is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; 
therefore the causal relationship cannot be  excluded. 
 
Probable: An event that might be due to the use of the study device. 
An alternative explanation is less likely - e.g., concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is  suggestive. 
 
Definitely: An event that is due to the use of the study device. The 
event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867] 
- e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
7.2.3  Severity of Adverse Device Effects 
The severity of an ADE will be rated as follows:  
 
• Mild: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated. 
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual  activity 
and may warrant intervention. 
 
• Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or 
significantly affects clinical status and warrants  intervention.

8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
This section will provide an overview of the statistical, descriptive, and qualitative 
analyses for this study. Specific details of the analyses will be described in a 
separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
 
The main objective of this study is as follows : 
 
• To evaluate the effects of EVO Multitask game-based digital therapy 
versus EVO Words game-based digital therapy on attentional  functioning

8.4 Safety Analysis  
Treatment related adverse events for both the EVO Multitask and EVO Words 
interventions will be presented. Any adverse events occurring during any phase 
of the study judged by [CONTACT_185385]’ Primary Investigator (PI) to be related to either 
intervention  will be recorded and presented  in a table  listing.  The Safety population 
(see section 8.6.2  for analysis population  details) will be used for this analysis that 
will include randomized participants that began the at -home training phase for 
either intervention. The severity of each event will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_407700]. If there are frequently occurring treatment related adverse events, a frequency table will be included, to rank events from most frequent to most rare. Subjects will be included in the actual treatment group 
received.

appropriate methods will be used as described in the SAP. Below are general 
formulations of the null and alternative statistical hypotheses,  
 
• H0: μ EVOMULTI  = μ EVOWORDS (1) 
• H1: μ EVOMULTI  ≠ μ EVOWORDS (2) 
 
where H 0 is the null hypothesis, H 1 is the alternative hypothesis, μ EVOMULTI is the 
mean change score for the EVO Multitask group, and μ EVOWORDS is the mean of 
the change score for the EVO Words group. The Primary Objective (P1) is a 
special case of this hypothesis test that will use weighted scores to control for Type-I error increases due to a sample size re-estimation and potential  sample 
size increase at the interim analysis. The calculation of weighed scores will 
use the Chu-Hung-Wang method (Chang, 2014; Chu, Hung, & Wang,  1999). 
 
Multiplicity will be controlled across the Major Objectives of this study (P1 and 
S1). See the SAP for details on multiplicity adjustments 
 
8.6.2 Analysis Populations 
 
Three populations are defined for this study: A per -protocol (PP), intention-to- 
treat (ITT), and safety population. The ITT and PP populations will be used for 
all efficacy analyses. The Safety population  will be used for the safety analysis. 
The success of the primary and secondary objectives will be based on an assessment of the results from the ITT population. Additional analysis of the 
PP population is supportive. The primary efficacy endpoint must achieve 
significance in the ITT to preserved type I error for the secondary endpoints. 
Details about inclusion into each population are presented  below:  
 
• Per-Protocol (Treatment Complaint): This population is defined as  any 
participant that began the at -home phase, completed both the pre and 
post assessment, and met a minimum compliance level of 50%. 
Additionally the following participants are excluded from  this 
population:  
Participants where the subjective clinical assessments (ADHD - 
RS, CGI, and IRS) were not made by [CONTACT_407723] 
 
• Intention -to-Treat (ITT): This population is defined as any randomized 
participant that received a device for at home training. In the  case

corrections to group assignment will be made.  
 
• Safety: This population is defined as any randomized participant that 
received a device for at home training. The primary safety analyses 
will include participants regardless of if they completed the post - 
treatment assessment and will be analyzed in the group whose 
treatment they actually received.

statistical difference between EVO Multitask and EVO Words. The population 
for this analysis will follow the same guidelines used for inclusion into the ITT 
population ( See section 8.6.2). 
 
The specific results of the interim analysis will remain blinded and will not be used to declare success of the primary objective at the interim; Un -blinded 
staff at the DCRI will conduct this analysis for the purpose of finalizing the  
sample size only. To maintain blinding for all other study personnel and affiliates, the results of this analysis will only indicate the sample size necessary to sustain the power of the study to detect an effect size of 0.4. Enrollment in the study will continue until the at least a minimum of [ADDRESS_514341] size of 0.40 at a power > 
90% on a between participants T -test with an alpha criterion of  0.05.

9.1 Endpoint Determination 
API [INVESTIGATOR_185345] 8 will be derived directly from the computers used 
to administer the task and these scores will be entered into the database for 
analysis of primary outcome 
 
9.2 Safety Monitoring 
Safety/tolerability will be assessed primarily at the Post -Treatment Visit 
(Visit 3), as well as during the 4-week game play component as necessary. 
 
9.3  Data Management to Maintain Blinding  
As noted above (Section 4.7), instructions will be given to participants, their 
parents and study staff to minimize the possibility that information that may potentially unblind treatment assign ment (e.g. , parent or participant description of 
their assigned game content) is limited.

10 DATA MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 
10.1 Required  Data 
The full study dataset will be collected for participants who enter the treatment 
phase of the study. Limited data (i.e., demographics, adverse events, selection criteria, and reason for discontinuation) will be collected for participants who discontinue before the treatment phase.  
 
All required data for this study will be entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_514342] and Clinical Data 
The collection site will provide the following  
 
This study will use Web-based e-CRFs developed through a va lidated, electronic 
reporting-electronic-signatures–compliant platform (21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 11). Before initiation of the trial, each site will be contact[CONTACT_407724], hardware specifications, and Internet connectivity, to  
evaluate the capacity of the site to use this type of data collection system. The investigator's site staff who will be entering data will receive training on the system, 
after which each person will be issued a unique user identification (ID) and password. 
 
For security reasons, and in compliance with regulatory guidelines,  it is imperative 
that only the persons who own the user IDs and passwords access the system using their own unique access codes. Access codes are nontransferable. Site personnel who have not undergone training may not use the system and will not be issued user ID and password until appropriate training is  completed. 
 
During monitoring visits, the site will make their computer and/or high -speed 
Internet access available to the clinical research associate. At the conclusion of the study, each enrolling site will be  provided with a compact disc containing PDF 
files of both the individual subject's data and the audit trail (changes made to the database). This will be maintained at the site according to the requirements for records retention.

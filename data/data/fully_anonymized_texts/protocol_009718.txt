1.1 SYNOPSIS  
 
 
Title:  Improving Physical Activity and Gait Symmetry after Total Knee 
Arthroplasty  
Grant Number:  R21-AR074149  
Study Description:  The overall objective of this study is to gather preliminary evidence 
on the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of the Physical Activity 
and Symmetry ( PAS) intervention.  Specific hypotheses are as 
follows:  
 
H1:   The PAS group will have greater improvement in objectively 
assessed physical activity  (PA) at the 3 -month and 6 -month 
assessments, compared to the attention control (ATT) group. The 
main co -primary metric of interest is minutes of moderate to 
vigorous physical activity; other secondary metrics will include step 
count, minutes of any PA, and sedentary minutes.    
 
H2: The post -total knee arthroplasty  (TKA) exercise group will have 
greater improvement in peak load symmetry during walking at the 
3-month and 6 -month assessments, compared to the ATT group.  
 
Objectives*: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Specific Aim 1:   Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS 
program with respect to the change in objectively assessed physical 
activity, measured via accelerometers.  
Specific Aim 2:  Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS 
program with respect to change in peak load symmetry during 
walking, measured by a novel 3 -sensor insole device.  
Specific Aim 3: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PAS 
program following TKA.

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   Endpoints*: Primary Endpoints:  
One co -primary primary end - point / outcome is objectively 
assessed PA, measured via accelerometer.  The primary metric of 
interest is minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity 
(MVPA).  This will be assessed at both 3 -month and 6 -month follow -
up time points.   
 
The other co -primary primary end - point / outcome is peak load 
symmetry during gait.   This will be assessed at both 3 -month and 
6-month follow -up time points.   
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
In addition to minutes of MVPA, secondary metrics of physical 
activity will include step count, minutes of any PA, and sedentary 
minutes . In addition to peak load symmetry during gait, peak load 
symmetry will be assessed during physical performance tests 
including the [ADDRESS_1175447], and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. 
 
Feasibility metrics include recruitment, retention, intervention 
delivery, and outcome assessment. Perceptions of acceptability will 
be obtained from patients and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845751] -ended 
questions.  
 
Exploratory outcomes include self -reported PA, physical 
performance tests, balance, knee symptoms, and kinesiophobia.  
 
  
Study Population:  
 N = [ADDRESS_1175448]-TKA physical therapy (PT) at a 
University of North Carolina (UNC) Healthcare System  or at 
physical therapy clinics outside of UNC. We will enroll both males 
and females, 18 years of age and older from all racial and ethnic 
backgrounds.   
 
Phase* or Stage:  Based on the Obesity -Related Behavioral Intervention Trials 
(ORBIT) framework, this study is a Phase II Preliminary Testing 
trial. 
  
Description of 
Sites/Facilities Enrolling 
Participants:  We will only be enrolling patients receiving post -TKA PT at a UNC 
Healthcare System clinic or at physical therapy clinics outside of 
UNC.

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation:  The PAS program significantly augments usual post -TKA PT, 
specifically addressing critical gaps of physical inactivity and joint 
loading asymmetry.  The PAS program will be initiated during the 
final usual care PT visits, allowing integration and capi[INVESTIGATOR_845752] -provider relationship.  PAS content will be 
included within the last two routine PT visits  (Session 1 and 2, see 
Table 1, Section 6.1 Study Intervention Administration). Then, PAS 
participants will receive a follow -up call after 4 weeks (to assist with 
activity progression and problem -solving) and an additional visit 
after 8 weeks  (conducted in -person if possible or remotely via an 
IRB approved video platform or by [CONTACT_648] ).  
Study Duration*: 18 months   
Participant Duration:  6 months

Improving Physical Activity and Gait Symmetry after Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 11.0 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_1175449] common surgical procedure involving a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845753]. In 2012, TKAs accounted for >700,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and rates increased 66% from 
2003 -2012 1. Demand for TKA is expected to rise to 3.48 million procedures by 2030 2. About 40% of patients 
with unilateral TKA will progress to a TKA on the contralateral side within [ADDRESS_1175450] identified two key deficits in individuals’ 
activity -related trajectories following TKA. First, despi[INVESTIGATOR_845754], 
overall PA levels remain very low 5,6. Although some studies suggest that patients perceive they are more 
active after surgery than before, accelerometer -based studies demonstrate that PA levels do not increase 
meaningfully following TKA, remaining well below Department of Health and Human Ser vices (DHHS) 
guidelines7 as well as PA levels of healthy individuals 5,8-14. For example, participants in one study spent 8.1% 
of the day in movement -related activity prior to TKA, and this increased to only 9.1% [ADDRESS_1175451] following 
surgery despi[INVESTIGATOR_845755]  20; this indicates the 
importance of a re -training process, in which patients learn to correct maladaptive movement patterns that 
perpetuate joint loading asymmetries.   
Gaps in the Post -TKA Rehabilitation Process. Although outpatient PT is a standard practice following TKA, 
there is very little guidance regarding the most appropriate post -TKA rehabilitation regimen 17,21, and, as a 
result, there is substantial variability in post -TKA PT 22-24.  Importantly, neither deficit described above – overall 
PA and joint loading asymmetry – is adequately addressed in current post -TKA rehabilitation paradigms  22,23. 
Specifically, studies show lack of attention to cardiovascular training (e.g. general aerobic activity), guidance in 
exercise progression, and balance interventions 22,23. This highlights the need to optimize the post -TKA 
rehabilitation process so that these key outcomes are adequately addressed.     
Goal and Importance of this Exploratory Trial. To address these critical gaps, we will conduct an exploratory 
trial of a novel PAS intervention that focuses on the persistent deficits of physical inactivity and joint loading 
asymmetry following TKA. Randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_845756] h ypotheses related to PAS 
efficacy (Aims 1 and 2) and feasibility and acceptability (Aim 3). This exploratory study is required prior to a 
larger trial because:  1) Preliminary data on the PAS intervention are needed; although we hypothesize that it 
will result in meaningful improvements in PA and symmetry, if this is not confirmed then further investment in a 
large trial would not be warranted.  2) The PAS intervention will be integrated in real -world PT settin gs, and 
preliminary work is needed to establish logistical procedures.  
  
 2.1.2. PREMISE  
 
The PAS intervention is based on previous studies of effective strategies for improving PA and joint loading 
symmetry in various patient populations. With regard to improving PA, the PAS intervention will utilize goal 
setting, brief motivational interviewi ng (MI) and connection of patients with community programs and other PA

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 2.2.1  KNO WN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Emotional distress: it is unlikely that the types of questions participants will be asked in this study will result  
in emotional distress, but we understand th at participants may be uncomfortable with answering questions  
about some aspect of their health or other things about them. To minimize this risk, we will let participants  
know they may choose not to answer any study questions and can still be involved in the study.  
 
Breach of confidentiality: we will be collecting some elements of personal health information (PHI) necessary 
for the study. To minimize breaches of confidentiality, all data will be stored on a secure UNC server or a UNC 
IRB approved platform for sharing PHI (with Virginia Tech), and paper  
information will be stored in locked filing cabinets in the office of a study team member .  Only approved study 
personnel will have access to those data.  
 
Risks of Exercise: Injury associated with mild -to-moderate physical activity is rare or infrequent. Because 
participants will all be post TKA, mild -to-moderate PA may be associated with short -term increases in pain or 
discomfort; we estimate short -term likelihood to be "common." However, longer -term increases in pain or 
discomfort after this type of activity is "infrequent" when PA is done appropriately. To minimize all of these 
risks, we will ensure that participants are given instructions for safe and app ropriate physical activity levels and 
techniques for individuals post TKA. Participants will be given information on how to manage activity -related 
pain or discomfort. They will also be instructed that if pain is still elevated two hours after PA, they should 
reduce the intensity level during the next activity session.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1175452] -TKA PT.  
 
 2.2.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
This is a minimal risk study with risks that are comparable to those that would be encountered during typi[INVESTIGATOR_845757].  Functional tests also mirror activities conducted 
during normal daily routines (e.g., walking, chair stands).  Al though muscle or joint soreness may occur 
following assessments or intervention sessions, all of the activities being conducted are necessary for the 
scientific rigor of the study.  In particular, the function tests being conducted are those recommended by  [CONTACT_845789]  (OARSI) .  Section 8.2 on Safety As sessments describes the 
study team’s plans to minimize risks associated with intervention sessions and outcome assessment.  Given 
the high and increasing rate of TKAs, the persistent deficits of physical inactivity and joint loading asymmetry, 
and the lack  of a standard, evidence -based approach to address these deficits in rehabilitation settings, we 
believe the value of the information to be gained outweighs the risks of participation in the study.

physical activity, 
measured via 
accelerometers.  
H1:   The PAS group will 
have  greater improvement 
in objectively assessed 
physical activity at the 3-
month and [ADDRESS_1175454] is MVPA.  
 One co -primary  primary end - 
point / outcome  is objectively 
assessed PA, measured via 
accelerometer.   This will be 
assessed at both 3 -month 
and 6 -month follow -up time 
points.  The rationale for 
these time points is 
described in the Overall 
Design section, and the 
rationale for sample size and 
analysis including co -primary 
outcomes is described in the 
Statistical Considerations 
Section.   This is a co -primary outcome because it 
addresses one of the key deficits being 
addressed in the PAS intervention:  physical 
inactivity.  MVPA was particularly chosen as 
the primary metric because it corresponds to 
DHHS  PA recommendations.     
Obtain preliminary data 
on the efficacy of the 
PAS program with

group will have greater 
improvement in peak load

at the 3-month  and [ADDRESS_1175455] w ill be the peak 
load - limb symmetry index 
during level walking.  The other co -primary primary 
end- point / outcome is peak 
load symmetry during 
walking.   This will be 
assessed at both 3 -month 
and 6 -month follow -up time 
points.  The rationale for 
these time points is 
described in the Overall 
Design section, and the 
rationale for sample size and 
analysis including co -primary 
outcomes is described in the 
Statistical Considerations 
Section.   This is a co -primary outcome because it 
addresses one of the key deficits being 
addressed in the PAS intervention:  joint load 
asymmetry during gait.   
Secondary  
Obtain preliminary data 
on the efficacy of the 
PAS program with 
respect to the change in 
secondary metrics of 
objectively assessed PA, In addition to minutes of 
MVPA, seconda ry metrics 
will include step count, 
minutes of any PA, and 
sedentary minutes  These secondary metrics will be assessed 
because they measure aspects of PA that are 
complementary to minutes of MVPA and also 
have clinical relevance.

Tertiary / Exploratory  
Obtain preliminary data 
on the efficacy of the

4.1  OVERALL DESIGN    
 
The overall objective of this study is to gather preliminary evidence on the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability 
of the PAS intervention.  Specific aims are:  
Specific Aim 1:   Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS program with respect to the change 
in objectively assessed physical activity, measured via accelerometers.  
H1:   The PAS group will have greater improvement in objectively assessed PA at the [ADDRESS_1175457] is minutes of MVPA ; 
other secondary metrics will include step count, minutes of any PA, and sedentary minutes.    
Specific Aim 2:   Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS program with respect to change in 
peak load symmetry during walking, measured by a novel 3-sensor insole device.   
H2: The post -TKA exercise group will have greater improvement in peak load symmetry during walking at the 
3-month  and [ADDRESS_1175458] will be the peak load - limb symmetry index during level walking; secondary outcomes will be peak load 
- limb symmetry index values during additional physical performance tasks.       
Specific Aim 3 : Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PAS program following TKA.  
3a. Measure feasibility metrics related to recruitment, retention, intervention delivery, and outcome 
assessment.  
3b. Assess perceptions of acceptability of the intervention from patients and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845758].  
 
This will be an exploratory , single site  randomized controlled trial with 60 patients  equally allocated  to the PAS 
intervention or a n ATT  control group ( see Schema section above ).  Based on the ORBIT framework (which has 
application beyond the topic area of obesity), this study is a Phase II Preliminary Testing trial. Randomization 
will be stratified according to gender and presence of self -reported pain (≥3 on a 10 point scale) in any lower 
extremity joint (hip, knee or ankle) in addition to the surgical knee, to ensure that the groups are balanced in 
these respects.  We chose  patient -level randomization because it is a straight -forward design that avoids 
potential biases and challenges of cluster randomization, such as imbalances in participant characteristics 
across study arms and attrition of study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]  41,42.  With this design, each study therapis t can 
treat patients in both study arms.  Although the PAS program will involve discrete components that are distinct 
from usual post -TKA PT (which will be delivered to the ATT control group), we acknowledge the risk of 
contamination of intervention delivery . To mitigate  this risk, we will employ an intensive  fidelity monitoring 
process,  described below  and in the Intervention Documents . If we find in this exploratory study that 
contamination  is a concern, clinic -level randomization  will be considered for  a larger trial.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_845759]-TKA PT  is about [ADDRESS_1175459] to begin the PAS intervention before 
PT is complete. Follow -up assessments will be conducted 3 months  after the beginning intervention visits  
(shortly following  to the end of the PAS intervention)  and after 6 months (sustainability end  point).  Regarding 
the 3 -month follow -up time point, we selected this interval because it will: 1) allow for several weeks for 
participants to act on content delivered in the 8 -week intervention visit and 2) allow sufficient time for 
scheduling first follow -up ass essments after all intervention visits have been complete.  Longer term outcomes 
will be included in a larger trial.

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   4.2   SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
The ATT control group was selected to account for potential effects of intervention -related contacts (e.g., 
“attention”) that are not specific to the PAS program components (e.g., the specific rehabilitation and exercise 
program being delivered in the PAS intervention). Additional comments regarding ratio nale for the study design 
are described in Section 4.1.

their progress with components of the PAS intervention.  Because this intervention includes only [ADDRESS_1175461] not defined a separate “minimum -acceptable” participation in the intervention.  Ideal participati on 
includes participation in all visits.  As part of this exploratory trial, we will be monitoring the feasibility and rates 
of visit completion, in preparation for a larger trial. In this study, primary analyses will include all randomized 
participants, r egardless of amount of intervention completion.  However, we may conduct additional exploratory 
analyses that account for different patterns of intervention completion.

assessment. As noted above, there is no minimum number of intervention visits required to meet at definition 
of “completion,” but patterns of intervention completion will be assessed.

at physical therapy clinics outside of UNC.  We will include individuals with OA in other lower extremity joints to 
maximize generalizability and help inform the larger trial.   
 
5.2  EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
Exclusion criteria are:  significant cognitive impairment, neurological disorders affecting gait, systemic 
rheumatic disease; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a cardiovascular condition the past six months; psychosis; substance 
abuse disorder; lower extremity surgery in the past year; planning total joint replacement in next 6 months ; any 
other health conditions determined to be contraindications to a home exercise program.  
 
5.3  LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
N/A 
 
5.4  SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not subsequently 
assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for 
participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria  (e.g., development 
of an exclusionary health condition) will not be rescreened.  This is because of the brief period of time in which 
participants are eligible to participate in the study (e.g., time between initial screening and beginning of the 
interven tion, which starts at the end of routine post -TKA PT).  It is unlikely that any exclusionary health 
conditions, resulting in screen failure, will resolve during that period of time.  
 
5.5.  STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION   
For UNC Healthcare clinics, w e will identify potential participants though regular medical record searches of 
patients initiating outpatient post -TKA PT. About [ADDRESS_1175464] existing partnerships with 
and processes for working with other local PT clinics  37. Potentially eligible patients will be mailed a recruitment 
letter (including an opt -out telephone number) from the study team, followed by a telephone call about [ADDRESS_1175465].  A UNC provider (physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845760]) may also discuss the study with a patient and will notify a study team member, if the 
patient agrees to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].   For non UNC  Healthcare physical therapy clinics, staff will provide verbal 
information and / or recruitment flyers to participants regarding the study.  With patients’ verbal permission, a 
clinic team member may provide our UNC study team with contact [CONTACT_3031] (telephone numb er, address) for 
the patient, so that we may contact [CONTACT_395936].  Patients may also directly contact [CONTACT_845790], using the phone number provided on the flyer.  Interest and eligibility of these patients will also be 
assessed v ia telephone.  
Eligible patients will be asked to meet with a study team member to complete a baseline visit including 
informed consent, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) authorization and 
baseline assessments.  We may review the informed consent and HIPAA over the phone prior to the baseline 
visit. At the end of t he baseline  visit, participants will be given an accelerometer to wear for one week and 
return via mail.  Following receipt of the accelerometer, participants will be called by a n un-blinded study team 
member with their randomization assignment, and the treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845761].

Protocol #[ADDRESS_1175466] -TKA PT focuses on reducing pain and swelling and increasing range of motion 
(ROM) and strength. The PAS program significantly augment s usual post -TKA PT , specifically addressing 
critical gaps of physical inactivity and joint loading asymmetry . The PAS program will  be initiated during the 
final usual care PT visit s, allowing integration and capi[INVESTIGATOR_845762] -provider relationship . This 
is strategic timing because patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_845763] (strength, ROM,

PAS content to be included within the last two routine PT visits and will orchestrate this timing  with study 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  The course of PT may end slightly sooner or later than expected, and this exploratory 
study will allow us to fine tune processes for beginning delivery of PAS.  PAS p articipants will then receive a 
follow -up call after 4 weeks (to assist with activity progression and problem -solving) and an additional visit 
(conducted in -person if possible or remotely via an IRB approved video platform or by [CONTACT_845792] ) after 8 
weeks  (to visually monitor exercise performance and re -assess proportional weight -bearing ability) . Each of the

Specific content will be as follows:  
Session 1 (In-Person  if possible , or via 
video platform o r phone if needed ): 
The PT will:  (1) Emphasize the 
importance of PA in TKA recovery 
using key points. (2) Work with 
participants to establish a SMART 
(Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time -bound) goal regarding overall PA. (3) Incorporate MI  
principles to elicit motivations and / or ambivalence toward PA 69-71. (4) Provide a list of community -based and 
other r esources to support overall PA . These materials will be emailed to the participant if the visit is conducted 
remotely.    
Session 3 ( 4-Week  Phone Session ): The PT will: (1) Assess progress with overall PA using standard 
questions, referring to the web -based PA log. (2) Help participants to develop strategies to address any 
barriers they experienced in their PA. (3) Apply MI principles to elicit motivations  and / or ambivalence toward 
PA. (4) Work with participants to establish a new SMART PA goal for the next four weeks, with appropriate 
progression. (5) Discuss PA resources and facilitate connection of participants to these resources.   Table 1. Overview of PAS Intervention Session Content

discuss strategies for dealing with setbacks in PA .  Second, SMART goal setting  will be more long term in 
nature, focusing on the next six months.   
PAS Content: Balance Exercises to Improve Joint  Loading Symmetry .  
Although usual post -TKA PT aims to improve overall function, the PAS intervention differs substantially in its 
targeted approach to help patients detect side -to-side joint loading asymmetries and re -learn how to equalize 
loads across limbs . The content for this component of PAS will be as follows:  
Sess ion 2 (Second Session In-Person if possible, remotely via an IRB approved video platform or by [CONTACT_845794] ): If session is conducted in person, p articipants will undergo a process enabling them to detect when 
50% weight bearing is achieved on each leg. The foo t of the post-surgical  limb will be placed on an analog 
bathroom scale and the contralateral foot on a small step of equivalent height. The participant will then shift 
weight between legs so that it feels as if 50% of weight is on each foot. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845765]  50% weight bearing stance through 
verbal and tactile cues. The participant will then perform a series of [ADDRESS_1175469]-surgical limb 
and attempt to return to 50% weight bearing for a 10 second hold in that position. Participants who cannot 
successfully assume equal weight bearing within 5% for 8 of 10 trials will be given  a scale and a step of equal 
height to continue practice a t home  by [CONTACT_746]  10 repetitions of the weight shifting  activity daily .  
Next, t he PT will prescribe  balance 
exercises – one static and two dynam ic 
(see Intervention Documents) - which 
supplement the general strengthening 
exercises assigned as part of usual post -
TKA PT.  The initial balance exercise s 
prescribed will be the highest level at which 
the participant can perform at a minimal 
standard  (defined  in Table 2).  If the visit is 
conducted remotely, the PT will be 
instructed to begin with the lowest level of 
balance exercises and to increase the level 
once they meet the progression criterion 
shown in Table 2.  Participants will be 
given or emailed handouts and access  to a 
website that display s proper exercise form . 
Participants will be instructed to perform  
exercises  once daily. Static balance 
exercise s will be performed bilaterally in an alternating leg manner for three repetitions, 30-seconds each , with 
use of hand support as needed to maintain balance.  Dynamic balance exercises  will be performed bilaterally 
for 10 repetitions per set for three sets, with use of hand support as needed .  
Session  3 (4-Week Telephone Session ): The PT and participant will discuss  recent performance of balance 
exercises (e.g, frequency, progression, problems with specific exercises) using  standard questions ( see 
Intervention Documents ). This will ensure exercise performance is of appropriate intensity and frequency to 
achieve improvement. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845766] , based on criteria in Table 2 . 
Session 4 (8-Week Session In -Person if possible  or remotely via an IRB approved video platform or by [CONTACT_845793] ): The PT and participant will discuss performance of balance exercises using  standard questions 
(see Intervention Documents ). Participants will demonstrate  current exercises  if the session is conducted in 
person or via video platform , and t he therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845767] . Progression of exercises  will be 
promoted as described above. If session is delivered in -person, t he therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845768]’

care, without the additional PAS com ponents descri bed for Sessions 1 and 2 in Table 1. To account for non -
specific effects (e.g. therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] “attention”) of the two additional visits in the PAS intervention (4 -week phone 
call and 8 -week visit), the ATT control group will receive visits at the same intervals but differing in content .  
Specificall y, the 4 -week phone call will include: information on typi[INVESTIGATOR_845769], 
assessment of participants’ daily activities, and reminders about symptoms that should trigger contact[CONTACT_30697] a 
medica l professional.  The 8 -week visit (conducted in -person if possible or remotely via an IRB approved video 
platform or by [CONTACT_648]) will be primarily evaluative, including assessment of ROM , strength,  and function  when 
possible.  If the visit is delivered via video, performance tests will be conducted, when feasible.  P articipants wi ll 
be given or emailed  a report summarizing these assessments . Participants will also be instructed to continue 
the home exercise program prescribed by [CONTACT_845795]. This inf ormation may be delivered whether the 
visit is conducted in -person, via video or by [CONTACT_648]. Neither of these contacts will include PA counseling  or

6.3  MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
 
The randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_242511].  
The database will be configured so that blinded study personnel (e.g., those conducting follow -up 
assessments) will not have access to randomization  information. The participants will not be notified of 
randomization assignment until all baseline assessments are complete.  In addition an individual participant’s 
randomization assignment will not be known to any study personnel until baseline assessmen ts are complete.  
Randomization will be stratified according to gender and presence of self -reported pain (≥3 on a 10 point 
scale) in any lower extremity joint (hip, knee or ankle) in addition to the surgical knee, to ensure that the groups 
are balanced in these respects.   
 
6.4  STUDY INTERVENTION ADHERENCE   
 
The study database will be used to track participants’ completion of all assessment visits, as well as all 
intervention visits.  Intervention visits will be logged in the UNC electronic medical record ( EMR ), and the study 
coordinator or other unblinded study team member will monitor these records for study participants to 
determine intervention adherence (and document the information in the study database).  The study team will 
also maintain close communicat ion with study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] .  If participan ts miss intervention visits, an 
unblinded study team member may assist the study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845772], as 
needed.

When a participant discontinues from  the PAS intervention but not from the study, remaining study procedures 
will be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].   If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but 
not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if 
any change in participant management is needed; the treating study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845773]. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE). The 
data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the reason(s) for discontinuing 
the participant from the intervention, and methods for determining the need to discon tinue . 
 
7.2  PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY   
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up  study 
data would not be in the best interest of the participant or might require an additional treatment that 
would confound the interpretation of the study  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that 
precludes further study participation  
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded in the study database.   
Participants who discontinue or are withdrawn will be replaced up to the point of randomization assignment 
being given to the participant.  Once participants are given their randomization assignment, they will be 
counted toward the total study sample size and not replaced.

8   STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1  ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Measures will be collected at baseline, 3 months  and 6 months by a trained research assistant blinded to 
randomization assignment. Participants will be paid  $50 for completing baseline questionnaire and $15 for 
wearing  and returning an accelerometer. Then, up to $40 at 3 month and 6 month  time point : $25 for 
completing questionnaires and functional measures and $[ADDRESS_1175477] a briefer set of measures focused on the primary 
functional assessments.  We will explain to the participant during the consent process that the measures may

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   be more limited  in order to minimize in -person visit time . Also, we may schedule a time to call the participant 
after the in -person visits (at baseline and 3 month and 6 month follow -up) to complete the questionnaires over 
the phone.   
  
Efficacy (Aims 1 and 2)  
Co-Primary Efficacy Outcome : Objectively Assessed Physical Activity (accelerometer) . Our specific primary 
outcome of interest is MVPA per week, since this corresponds to DHHS recommendations and is a known 
predictor of outcomes in patients with OA 7. We will also examine step counts , minutes of any PA  and 
sedentary minutes  as secondary outcomes  72,73. Participant s will wear the waist -worn Actigraph GT3X+ 
(Pensacola, FL) for 7 days 74. Following previously established thresholds, outcomes will only be computed for 
participants who wear the accelerometer for 4+ days with 10+ hours of wear. Accelerometers will  be given to 
participants during in -person visits at each time point  and mailed back to the study team , using our procedures 
from prior studies that have resulted in very high adherence rates (89 -93%). If participants are not able to 
complete follow -up assessments in person but complete questionnaires by [CONTACT_756], we may mail an 
accelerometer for wear and return via mail. Accelerometer data will be processed using standard procedures 
75-78.   
Co-Primary Efficacy Outcome: Peak Joint Load S ymmetry  During Walking . We will use a novel, 3-sensor in -
shoe load measurement device ( loadsol ) to measure joint load symmetry. The loadsol® builds on the reliable 
pedar -X® in-shoe measurement system 79 but importantly collects data on a  handheld device without any 
external cabling, facilitating measurement during a variety of dynamic tasks. The loadsol® requires  minimal 
training, making i t ideal for clinical settings. Participants will complete a [ADDRESS_1175478] (three trials  
averaged ) 80, while load beneath each foot is recorded. W alking speed will also be recorded  and will be used 
as a covariate since this may impact the loading  metrics . Loading symmetry  (peak ground reaction force)  will 
be assessed using the limb symmetry index ( LSI (|Surgical/Non -Surgical|*100) , which has been associated 
with adverse outcomes such as re -injury of the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL); values lower than 100% 
indicate less loading of the surgical limb 81-84. LSI was selected based on its current use in the clinical setting  
and the ease of calculation.  
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes  
Self-reported Physical Activity :  Modified version of the CHAMPS (Community Health Activities Model Program 
for Seniors) Physical Activity Measure  85.   This measure complements the accelerometer -based data by 
[CONTACT_845796]. This 
modified version of the CHAMPS includes items tailored for this participant group.  F or each item, participants 
first indicate whether they have done the activity for [ADDRESS_1175479] week.  If they respond 
“yes,” they will be asked the number or days and minutes per week. This questionnaire will be supplemented 
with individual items to assess sitting behavior and sleep.   
 
Physical Performance Tests . We will administer tests  recommended by [CONTACT_845797] : 
30-second  stair stand test, 40m fast -paced walk, stair climb test, and TUG test  [ADDRESS_1175480], TUG, and 10m 
walk (described above), we will collect additional measures for the purpose of developi[INVESTIGATOR_845774] -based methods 
for assessing knee joint kinematics and spatiotemporal gait mechanics.   
 
Data capture via video cameras discontinued in December [ADDRESS_1175481] of the femoral ep icondyle, in the middle of the shank in -line with the lateral 
femoral epi[INVESTIGATOR_845775], and in the middle of the thigh in -line with the lateral femoral epi[INVESTIGATOR_845776]. Each camera will be equipped with an external light so urce (flash), which will cause the 
reflective markers to shine very brightly and be easily tracked throughout the video. The cameras will collect

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   wide view videos at 120 frames per second. The wide view video will result in a ‘Fish -Eye’ effect in the video 
data, which will be corrected and converted to a linear image using previously developed methods 23, [ADDRESS_1175482]. The XY position of each marker will be used to create knee angles. Before 
movement trials, a 1 seco nd static trial will be recorded from both  views, and the knee angle during quiet 
stance will be used to normalize knee angle during the movement trials (i.e. knee flexion and valgus will be 
considered zero during quiet stance).  
 
Balance. We are conducting a limited set of tests due to COVID precautions. We will administer two tests from 
the Berg Balance Scale: tandem stance and [ADDRESS_1175483]:   Stance With Eyes Closed, on Foam Surface 88.   
 
Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score  (KOOS) .  The KOOS is a widely used and validated patient -
reported outcome that includes five separately scored subscales  (42 items total) : pain, symptoms, activities of 
daily living, sports and recreation, and knee -related quality of life  90.  The KOOS pain subscale will also be 
assessed at each intervention visit, so that we can assess potential associations between pain and PA.   
 
Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia . Fear of movement is a key concern for patients following TKA, associated with 
poorer clinical outcomes 91,92.  This is a  17-item measure of multiple domains of fear of movement 93.   
Feasibility and Acceptability (Aim 3)  
 
Feasibility Metrics , The following are feasibility metrics, as well as “targets” that will indicate success, when 
appropriate:  
- Number of potentially eligible patients identified from the medical record during the recruitment period . There 
is no standard benchmark for “success” for this metric.  Rather, this information is important in planning for a 
future, larger trial.  When planning for that trial, a sample size / power analysis will be conducted.  Based on 
information gathered fro m this metric, we will be able to ascertain the feasibility of conducting a single site trial 
vs. moving to a multi -site trial (and understanding th e number / size of sites that would be needed).  
- Proportion of patients who are eligible and enroll , along with ineligibility and refusal reasons . Similarly, there 
is no standard benchmark for success for this metric, but it will be used to determine feasibility and site(s) for a 
future trial.  However, based on our prior studies, we expect an enrollment rate of at least 20%39,94.  An 
enrollment rate below this threshold will signal a need to closely evaluate study requirements for participants, 
as well as recruitment and enrollment methods. Information gathered on ineligibility and refusal reasons will 
guide this process.  
- Proportion of participants completing  each intervention contact [CONTACT_138563] -up assessment  (overall and by 
[CONTACT_30157]) . Because this is a brief intervention, completion of all [ADDRESS_1175484] two intervention visits (which 
take place during routine post -TKA PT), we will consider the approach to be successful if ≥80% of participants 
complete both visits; a proportion below this threshold will signal  a need to re -evaluate our approach of how 
these interventions are embedded into routine post -TKA PT.  With regard to the 4 -week and 8 -week follow -up 
intervention visits, we will also consider the approach to be successful if 80% of participants complete b oth 
visits; a proportion below this will signal a need to re -evaluate aspects including the timing of the visits and 
whether the final visit should remain in -person vs. via telephone.  Our participant questionnaires on 
intervention feedback will provide in sight into these issues.  
 
Acceptability.  We will ask study participants and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] a series of open -ended questions to assess 
intervention acceptability and obtain  suggestions for improving the intervention95,96.   
Patient Characteristics . We will collect information on  age, race / ethnicity, education, work and marital status, 
body mass index, comorbid illnesses 97, joints with arthritis symptoms, and duration of knee  symptoms .  
Symptoms and Events in the Non -Surgical Limb .  Although the 6 -month follow -up period is not sufficient to fully 
assess impacts on the non -surgical limb, we will measure changes in pain (10 -point visual analog scales 
Improving Physical Activity and Gait Symmetry after Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 11.0 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_1175485] 2 weeks), injuries, and 
progression in plans for TKA. This will be assessed for a longer period in the subsequent larger trial.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1175486] participants ’ safety, beyond adherence to 
usual procedures.  For the weight -shifting exercise to be conducted in 2 of the PAS visits, we will provide 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845777] -person training and a video (to refer to at later points) to show procedures, including 
prevention of falls if a participan t loses their balance during the test.  In addition, when participants are shown 
balance exercises, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845778] a place where they can easily 
grab on to a stable item if they begin to lose balance.  Any AE s that occur during PT visits or in the course of 
participants’ home exercise will be documented on the Adverse Events form , as described below.  
 
For the Physical Performance Tests, the testing administrator will be trained to monitor patient safety during 
testing. This will include following slightly behind and off to one side of the patient but not to pace or impede 
them, as well as allowing the patient to stop and rest if they become tired, if necessary.   
 
8.3  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS   
 8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol uses the definition of adverse event from DHHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP): 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the 
research (modified from the definit ion of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on 
Harmonization E -6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice).  
 
 8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol uses the definition of serious adverse event from DHHS OHRP:  any adverse event that results in 
death;  is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  results in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  results in a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity;  results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in this definition (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse ). 
 
 8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigators , if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_125234] .  The following guidelines will be 
used to describe severi ty:

Protocol #19 -0568   6 October  2022 
23 
Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the 
term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” .] 
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
All AEs  will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, assessed by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -
investigators based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures, there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study procedures caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study procedures 
and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evi dence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study procedures and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures caused the event, there 
is no temporal relationship between the study procedures and event onset, or an alternate etiology has 
been established.  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  
A clinician with appropriate expertise in post-TKA patients and recovery ( Olcott or Hill)  will be responsible for 
determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
procedures.  
 
 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of study team members 
during study visits.  All AEs, not otherwise precluded per the protocol, will be captured on the  Adverse Event 
Form.  Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study procedures (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at 
any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_31233].  
The Project Coordinator will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  
Participants are identified in the EMR as a study participant and for each AE/SAE occurrence, research team 
member s will receive  an alert through EMR. AEs or SAEs may also be reported to study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845779] 11.0 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_1175487]. Allen (or a co -investigator) is contact[CONTACT_242515], she / he will make a determination 
about the reporting requirements in accordance with UNC  IRB guidelines.   
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_845780]  (SO)  on a biannual basis, or as requested. 
Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a co -investigator will report any AEs that suggest new or increased risk to participants or 
others within [ADDRESS_1175488]. Allen (or a co -investigator) is contact[CONTACT_30111] a serious  adverse event, she / he will make a 
determination about the reporting requirements in accordance with UNC  IRB guidelines.  This will include 
notification of the UNC  IRB, as well as the SO, within 24 -hours if a study -related death and  within 48 hours if 
another SAE.

8.4. UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
 8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
Unanticipated Problems (U Ps) are not included in the 45 CFR part 46, but are defined by [CONTACT_845798], experience or outcome that meets all of the following requirements:  
 
(1) Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
 
Improving Physical Activity and Gait Symmetry after Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 11.0 
Protocol #19 -0568   6 October  2022 
25 
Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   (2) Related or possibly related to participation in the research. Possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592]); and  
 
(3) Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
OHRP recognizes that it may be difficult to determine whether a particular incident, experience, or outcome is 
unexpected and whether it is related or possibly related to participation in the research.  OHRP notes that an 
incident, experience, or outcome t hat meets the three criteria above generally will warrant consideration of 
substantive changes in the research protocol or informed consent process/document or other corrective 
actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of participants or o thers.   
 
The following corrective actions or substantive changes that could be considered in response to an 
unanticipated problem include:  
 
o Changes to the research protocol initiated by [CONTACT_242516];  
o modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified risks;  
o implementation of additional procedures for monitoring subjects; suspension of enrollment of new 
subjects;  
o suspension of research procedures in currently enrolled subjects;  
o modification of informed consent documents to include a description of newly recognized risks;  
o provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously enrolled subjects.  
 
Only a small subset of adverse events occurring in human subjects participating in research will meet these 
three criteria for an unanticipated problem. Furthermore, there are other types of incidents, experiences, and 
outcomes that occur during the conduc t of human subjects research that represent unanticipated problems but 
are not considered adverse events.  For example, some unanticipated problems involve social or economic 
harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events .  In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.   
 
 8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING  
All UPs will be reported to the NIAMS and the SO (through KAI) within [ADDRESS_1175490] their 
willingness to continue participation in the study.

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   9  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1  STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
Specific Aim 1:   Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS program with respect to the change 
in objectively assessed physical activity, measured via 
accelerometers.  
H1:   The PAS group will have greater improvement in objectively 
assessed physical activity at the [ADDRESS_1175491] is MVPA ; other secondary metrics will include step count, minutes of any PA, and sedentary minutes.    
Specific Aim 2:   Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the PAS program with respect to change in 
peak load symmetry during walking, measured by a novel 3-sensor insole device.   
H2: The post -TKA exercise group will have greater improvement in peak load symmetry during walking at the 
3-month  and [ADDRESS_1175492] will be the peak load - limb symmetry index during level walking; secondary outcomes will be peak load 
- limb symmetry index values during additional  physical performance tasks.       
 
9.[ADDRESS_1175493] sizes and corresponding statistical 
power for a comparison of intervention versus control group means, for the pr ojected total of n= 54 participants 
at the two -sided 0.05 significance level. We chose n= 54 because this is reasonable to complete within the time 
frame of this exploratory trial and will allow sufficient experience to inform a larger trial.  We are allowing for a 
10% attrition rate , so n= 60 participants will be enrolled . Data from this study are crucial for informing sample 
size estimates for a larger trial; however, preliminary calculations indicate that for a standardized effect size of 
0.35-0.[ADDRESS_1175494] deviation units, a sample size of 100-130 per  group may be required.  This sample size is 
reasonable to enroll within the time frame of this exploratory trial, and it will allow sufficient experience with 
intervention delivery to inform the larger trial.   Our analytic strategy (described below) will also accommodate 
dropout , missed visits, and loss-to-follow -up.  Information regarding the actual observed extent of dropout, 
missed visits, and loss -to-follow -up in this study will also be useful for the subsequent large -scale trial.

Improving Physical Activity and Gait Symmetry after Total Knee Arthroplasty  Version 11.0 
Protocol #[ADDRESS_1175496] some imbalance between the groups by [CONTACT_17793], owing to the limited sample size.  Variables 
exhibiting imbalance may be considered as covariates in the statistical models described below.  
 
The co -primary outcome of MVPA will be analyzed across the follow -up time points through a general linear 
mixed model (GLMM).  Specifically, the MVPA values at 8 weeks and at 6 months for a given patient will form 
their response vector for this model.  Fix ed effects for the primary model will include an indicator for PAS 
group, an indicator for the 6 -month follow -up time point, their interaction (group by [CONTACT_5586]), and b aseline MVPA 
value; a supporting model will also include any  covariates that exhibit random  imbalance between groups  at 
baseline . Random effects for patients will account for the within -patient correlation induced by [CONTACT_845799]. Formal statistical testing of the group by [CONTACT_845800] -up time poi nt. A term representing the interaction of PAS -by-baseline value 
will be included and tested to explore whether participants’ starting point might impact how much they improve; 
it will be removed if non -significant att ention.   Statistical contrasts will be constructed in order to estimate the 
effect of PAS versus attention  control, separately at 8 weeks and at 6 months; these estimates will inform the 
sample size estimation of the subsequent trial.  Estimated correlations among follow -up time points will also be 
useful in this regard.   
The approach outlined above will be repeated for the co -primary outcome of  peak  joint loading symmetry 
during gait , through fitting a separate GLMM.  The main difference will be to include walking speed as an 
additional covariate, as justified in the research strategy.  Secondary outcomes will also be analyzed using the 
same approach, each with its own GLMM.  
   
An exploratory analysis will include KOOS pain scores as a (time -dependent) main effect, as well as their 
interaction with PAS, to evaluate whether this variable has an impact on intervention effects. This exploratory 
analysis will be repeated, but using p articipant -specific changes in KOOS pain scores , to examine how our 
primary outcomes (MVPA and peak load symmetry during walking) are associated with those changes.   
  
If any of the co -primary or secondary outcomes exhibit distributions that deviate markedly from normality, 
alternatives will be considered.  First, transformations, such as the natural logarithm, will be applied in an 
attempt to normalize the distribution.   If this is not successful in remedying the non -normality, alternatives such 
as categorizing the variable and applying appropriate categorical data analysis, such as logistic mixed models 
(with a similar specification as described above for the GLMMs) or logistic models utilizing ge neralized 
estimating equations  methodology can be fitted.  
 
A two -sided 0.05 significance level will be applied to each co -primary outcome, as well as each secondary 
outcome; no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be applied.  This is consistent with the trial’s objective as 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_845781] -scale trial to follow.  
 
An additional advantage to using the GLMM approach is its ability to accommodate missing data (including 
dropouts, missed visits, and lost -to-follow -up) under a missing at random  paradigm.  All available follow -up 
data will be utilized in an intent -to-treat manner.  If a participant  is missing one of the follow -up time points, that 
participant  is not completely excluded from the analysis. A supportive analysis will be conducted using multiple 
imputation to produce multiple datasets that have complete data f or all n= 60 participants, where missing 
values (due to dropouts, missed visits, and lost -to-follow -up) have been imputed.  The statistical models will be 
fitted to each of the complete datasets; results of each model will be synthesized in a manner that accounts for 
both between and within imputation variation to produce final estimates to address the research questi ons. 
 
Feasibility metrics will be computed as proportions, along with 95% confidence intervals to describe the level of 
uncertainty of the estimates.  Lower confidence bounds of these proportions will be useful in considering worst -
case scenarios when planning t he subsequent large -scale trial. Acceptability data are primarily open -ended 
questions, and responses will be summarized to inform appropriate modifications to the PAS intervention. For 
the brief questionnaires on acceptability, appropriateness, and feasib ility 95,96, we will calculate mean and 
median scores and distributions across each domain.

10  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to starting the study 
intervention.  The following consent materia ls are submitted with this protocol: Adult Consent Form.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Once a potential participant meets the medical record and telephone screening criteria for eligibility, and is 
interested in participating, a study team member will email or mail the potential participant a copy of the 
informed consent form and HIPAA for them to review.  The study team member will set up a time to call the 
potential participant no more than [ADDRESS_1175497] the COVID -19 wellness 
screening.  During the phone call, t he study team member will review  the IRB approved consent form with the 
potential participant and provide an opportunity for him/her to ask any questions that they may have about the 
research study.   
 
We will use a UNC IRB approved consent form with included language that satisfies the HIPAA requirements 
and outlines the protection of health information utilized in the study.  No other study activities will occur until 
the consent process is completed.   
 
We anticipate this process to take approximately [ADDRESS_1175498] additional questions or concerns regarding the study.  During this phase of the consent 
process, it will be stressed that the participa nt is not obligated to participate in the study, that participation is 
completely voluntary, and that he/she may withdrawal from the study at any time without penalty.  Also, 
potential risks from participating in the study will be outlined in the consent f orm, as are the measures taken to 
protect against study specific risks.  Once the information in the consent from is fully reviewed and understood

Protocol v11.0 - 20221006   Measures Taken to Ensure Confidentiality of Data Shared per the NIH Data Sharing Policies  
It is NIH policy that the results and accomplishments of the activities that it funds should be made available to 
the public (see  https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm ). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_242490], confidentiality, and security for data 
dissemination and reuse (e.g., all data will be thoroughly de -identified and will not be traceable to a specific 
study participant). Plans for archiving and long -term preservation of the data will be implemented, as 
appropriate.  
 
Certificate of Confidentiality  
To further protect the privacy of study participants, the Secretary, Health and Human Services (HHS), has 
issued a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) to all researchers engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical or 
other human subjects research funded w holly or in part by [CONTACT_48160].   Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_242491] (see https://humansubjects.nih.gov/coc/index ). As set forth in  45 CFR Part

10.1.7 CLINICAL MONITORING  
 
Since this is a single site study there will not be site visits  conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigators .  
However, we will employ an intensive fidelity monitoring process for the study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845784] a co -investigator (Hill) and will conduct mock 
sessions of all PAS and ATT control intervention sessions prior to study initiation.  Since 
contamination between interventions is a challenge of this study design, we will aim to conduct 
monitoring of 75 % of PT sessions to evaluate fidelity and the feasibility of using this approach for a 
larger trial.   KAI may conduct a site visit on behalf of the NIAMS, however, KAI will not have the 
responsibility of the overall clinical monitoring for this study.  
 
 10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 
Informed consent --- During the consenting process, the study team member will review the completed consent 
document to ensure the participant has signed and dated the consent form accurately prior to completing any 
other study activities.    
 
Source documents and the electronic data --- Data from the Physical Performance Tests will be initially 
captured on source documents and will ultimately be entered into the study database; all other data from study 
measures will be entered directly into the study database.  To ensure accuracy site s taff will compare a 
representative sample of source data against the database.  
 
Intervention Fidelity — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are described in Section 
6.2  
 
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will implement 
corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern.  
 
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9115], 
source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456]/funding agency, 
and inspection by [CONTACT_242524] y authorities.

 [IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Study data will be stored on a secure UNC server in a folder accessible only to IRB -approved study team 
members. We will use REDCap to store all patient information and dispositions, responses to screening and 
outcome assessments. REDCap is a secure web ap plication supported at UNC that can be used to build and 
manage case report forms, surveys, and other data capture mechanisms.  Additionally, a data set will be 
shared with [CONTACT_845805]  at Virginia Tech  for the purpose of this research.  This data set will inc lude information 
from the loadsol  measurements, for which [CONTACT_760054] has specialized programs for analysis, along with a 
participant ID so that the processed loadsol  data can be linked back with other participant data at UNC. There 
will be no additional identifiable data elements included in the data set sent to Virginia Tech.   
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Research study records will be maintained for no less than [ADDRESS_1175504]’s medical 
record will be kept indefinitely. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor/funding 
agency, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor/funding agency to inform the investigator when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
 10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol,  
ICH GCP, or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the 
participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be 
developed by [CONTACT_242526].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_1175505] participant safety to the NIAMS and the SO (through KAI) within 48 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_845785] 7 business days of the time the PI [INVESTIGATOR_759994], 
if the protocol deviation harmed participant(s) or others or placed participant(s) or others at in creased risk of 
harm. Otherwise, protocol deviations/violations that occur but do not  affect participant safety will be submitted 
with the routine safety reports as noted. Protocol deviations will be sent to the reviewing IRB per their policies. 
The site investigator will be responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB require ments. Further 
details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.

1.1 Purpose:  
The objective of this research is to assess the effects of EHR -ba sed decision support 
tools on primary care clinician decisionmaking around pain treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_172293]. EHR- based clinical decision support tools are a common feature of QI 
The decision support tools are informed by [CONTACT_294076] “behavioral economics,” whereby [CONTACT_294077] “nudged,” though never forced, towards guideline -
concordant care.  
To test the effects of these decision support tools  f or improving the quality of care 
for pain treatment , we will implement a clinic -randomized QI study across the 
primary care clinics of Fairview Medical Group and University of Minnesota  
Physicians.  
The study has two parallel components. The decision support tools to be tested will differ somewhat depending on whether a given patient is opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve, or whether a 
given patient is a current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -user. Four  sets of analyses will be conducted 
separately: one for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve group  using EHR data,  one for the current 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -user group  using EHR data, one at the PCP -level using web survey data, and 
one at the PCP -level using MN Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data. 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
Three  of the key dimensions to addressing the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_293986] a) how to 
minimize the number of patients who are starting opi[INVESTIGATOR_293987], b) ensuring that opi[INVESTIGATOR_293988], and c) how to effectively and safely reduce prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_293989].  
Prior research establishes that behavioral economics -informed interventions that 
are embedded within the EHR can successfully improve clinicians’ decisionmaking. For example, an influential paper by [CONTACT_294078] (1), showed that EHR -
based “nudges,” similar to what we propose to test , successfully reduced rates of 
inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.  A few studies use quasi -experimental methods 
to examine how changes in the EHR infrastructure affect opi[INVESTIGATOR_293990], with mixed results.  
As the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293991], there is an urgent need to develop effective methods for improving pain treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_293992]. Behavioral economics -informed interventions may be especially useful in the context of pain 
treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414]. Specifically, decisions about opi[INVESTIGATOR_293993] -
opi[INVESTIGATOR_142243], monitoring opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], initial prescribing, and decisions around tapering and/or discontinuing opi[INVESTIGATOR_293994]. Therefore, interventions which nudge towards treatment guidelines, without compelling any clinical action, may be especially promising.  
 
 Page 7 of 37   We are proposing to implement a primary care clinic -randomized study of two sets 
of behavioral economics -informed interventions embedded in the EHR, to improve 
pain treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_293990].  
2.2 Preliminary Data:  
We recruited five clinicians to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the interventions, and one additional PCP 
from the PRINCE study team ([CONTACT_294106]) also pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested the interventions. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_293995] a mix of three PCPs and three pain clinicians. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing too k 
place from 11/27/18 to 12/25/18. We received extensive feedback in the semi -
structured exit interviews about how to improve the usability of the interventions, 
which informed the modifications we subsequently made to the interventions  
2.3 Existing Literature: There is a recent and growing literature that studies how EHR -
based “nudges” can affect clinician behavior  around opi[INVESTIGATOR_293996] . For example, two recent studies  found that reducing the default number 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_293997]  (2, 3) . However, other research on nudges to improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_293998] a patient was being co -
prescribed an opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527] a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_293999] (4). Overall, there are many open questions about the types of 
EHR- based alerts and reminders can effectively improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_294000].  
Another important component of safe and appropriate opi[INVESTIGATOR_294001]. A number of studies examine the effects of laws that mandate providers to check their state’s PDMP on prescribing patterns and on opi[INVESTIGATOR_294002] (5). Other research notes that many providers do not check the PDMP when prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], or do so relatively infrequently (6 -8). Reasons for 
the underuse of PDMPs by [CONTACT_294079] -consuming  to access (7, 8) . One approach to “nudge” providers to use the 
PDMP more frequently and effectively is to simply make it much easier to use, by [CONTACT_294080] a patient’s EHR. Very limited evidence to date exists on the effects of PDMP integration into the EHR (9). We are not aware of any 
randomized trials of PDMP integration into the EHR.  
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome:  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Naïve Population : Whether or not an opi[INVESTIGATOR_294003] a primary care 
visit, without  currently receiving a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_294004] (including a 
new order for a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_294005]).  
Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -User Population : A variable with three mutually -exclusive 
categories:  
 
 Page 8 of 37   Category 1 (appropriate taper) :  Whether a primary care appointment with someone 
currently receiving a “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_294006] 20%, relative to the current prescription, and there is documented evidence that the reduction was consistent with CDC guidelines.  “High risk,” is 
defined as a patient is currently receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_294007] >50 MME and/or currently receiving both an opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527] a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Category 2 (“inappropriate” taper): W
 hether a primary care appointment with 
someone currently receiving a “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_294008], or, decreased MME by [CONTACT_294081] (>20% 
relative reduction in MME).  
Category 3 (no taper): W hether a primary care appointment with someone currently 
receiving a “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_294009].  
3.2 S econdary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -N aïve Population:  
1) Whether a CDC -recommended non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_294010] a primary care 
visit (e.g., referral to physical therapy, prescription of an NSAID, referral to pain clinic)  
2) The length of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155]  
3) The MME of opi[INVESTIGATOR_294011]:  
1) Whether there was a partial reduction in the MME or prescription length of refill 
orders, versus a total opi[INVESTIGATOR_46218]  
2) Whether there was an increase in the MME/day for current opi[INVESTIGATOR_294012] 50 MME/day  
 
All PCPs, including visits with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve and current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -using patients:  
1) The frequency with which PCPs check the PMP.  
2) PCP satisfaction with decision support  
 
Exploratory outcome:  
For primary care appointments with someone currently receiving a “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], who did not get tapered, we will assess how frequently there is a 
documented clinical rationale for the decision to not taper, that is consistent with the CDC’s guidelines.  This outcome is not linked to the experimental study arms.  
4.0 Study Intervention(s)/Interaction(s)  
4.1 Description:  
The s ubjects  of the study are primary care clinicians working in Fairview and in 
University of Minnesota  Physicians.  The interventions  to be tested in this study are 
 
 Page 9 of 37   sets of EHR clinical decision support tools (some of which are  referred to as, “Best 
Practice Alerts ”). These tools are very similar to many other EHR tools and alerts that 
clinicians encounter and use in their practice, and which are frequently adopted by 
[CONTACT_294082].  
There are two sets of interventions  to  be tested. Both of these intervention sets use 
behavioral economics principles around “choice architecture.” One set includes a 
pair of EHR alerts – one that triggers for patients who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve (i.e., have not 
had an active opi[INVESTIGATOR_294013]), and one that triggers for 
patients who are current opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. The other intervention is essentially the same 
for patients who are opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve or current opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155].  
These interventions will be delivered to all o f the PCPs working in Fairview and UMP 
primary care clinics that are assigned to one of the intervention arms of the study (randomization arms are described in Section 5).  
Detailed description of the Intervention S et A (ch
 oice architecture): 
 
For the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve group , the interventions will “fire” when a PCP initiates an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_294014] a patient who has not had an opi[INVESTIGATOR_294015] s. The alert, shown in Exhibit 1 a, provides guidance 
language about opi[INVESTIGATOR_294016] “SmartSet” to order non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_294017]. PCPs can choose to ignore this, but 
opening the SmartSet is the default option. When the SmartSet is opened, PCPs can choose to click on a variety of treatment order options, including both non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_294018] -pharmacological options (e.g., referral to physical 
therapy or pain clinic). Clicking on a category expan ds the selections, and Exhibit 1 b 
shows the SmartSet with the non -pharmacologic options expanded. The non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_294019]’s chronic pain recommendations and the Fairview Opi[INVESTIGATOR_294020]’s recommendations.

 For the current -o
 pi[INVESTIGATOR_294021] , the interventions will “fire” when a refill order 
for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_294022] a new opi[INVESTIGATOR_294023] a patient currently receiving an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d. The alert, shown in Exhibit 2 , prompts PCPs to consider 
tapering the patient’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. The alert also displays the MME of the patient’s current opi[INVESTIGATOR_294024] a 10% reduction in MME relative to the current prescription would be. The alert contains options to either cancel the refill order, or to continue with the order.

Detailed description of the Intervention S e t B (PMP Integration): 
 
For all PCPs assigned to this intervention, they will have integrated access to the 
PMP embedded within the EHR. All clinicians can already access the PMP to look up a patient’s prior opi[INVESTIGATOR_294025]. However, this process involves signing in to the separate PMP website and can be complicated and time -consuming 
within typi[INVESTIGATOR_294026]. The integrated PMP tool makes it much easier and faster for a PCP to access the PMP information for a given patient. This is a proprietary tool called “PMP Gateway,” developed by [CONTACT_294083] , and is being paid for by [CONTACT_294084]. In this tool, t here is a link that is embedded directly wit hin the EHR, and does 
not require the PCP to re -enter credentials and password, and automatically shows the 
relevant information for the patient whose EHR is already open. We show screenshots for the integrated PMP tool below in Exhibits 4-5 .

Exhibit 5. View of the integrated PMP  
 
 
The integrated PMP tool also has a “reminder” function that we will use. This 
reminder is triggered if the PCP attempts to sign a n opi[INVESTIGATOR_294027] [ADDRESS_358099] fo ur types of data . 
1) Passively -collected data from the Fairview and UMP EHR systems. These data 
involve no interactions with the participants, and is information that is already 
collected by [CONTACT_294085].  
2) Retrospective chart reviews of primary care visits with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155].  
These chart reviews will involve no direct interaction with the study participants.  
3) Passively -collected data from the Minnesota PMP. These data involve no 
interactions with the participants, and is information that is already collected automatically by [CONTACT_294086].  
4) W
eb survey data from participants. We will use the University of Minnesota ’s 
REDCap system to collect information from consenting primary care providers  
via web surveys. This will include basic demographic and background information, information about views on pain treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414], information about how providers interact with EHR systems, and information about satisfaction with clinical decision support  for pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512]. 
Web surveys will be fielded at the start and again at the end of the 12 month study period.  All PCPs in the participating primary care clinics will be exposed to 
the study interventions their clinic is assigned to, regardless of whether PCPs 
complete the web survey or not.  
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design:  

 
 Page 14 of 37   The s tudy is a clinic -randomized trial of EHR clinical decision support tools for pain 
treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414].  We propose clinic -level randomization  in order to 
minimize the potential for spi[INVESTIGATOR_294028] “contamination” of the intervention across 
the study arms.  
The randomization plan is described in the figure below. There are two dimensions to the
 randomization. One dimension is treatment arm  within a factorial study 
design : some clinics will be randomized to receive “care as usual,”  (Arm 1),  some 
clinics will be randomized to receive Intervention set A (Arm 2) , some clinics will be 
randomized to receive Intervention B  (Arm 3) , and some clinics will receive both 
Interventions A and B  (Arm 4) . The other dimension to randomization occurs among 
the clinics that are assigned to Intervention set A or B, and involves those clinics being randomized to three different conditions. 1) The clinic receives the intervention set for the entire 12 month study  period  (Subarm A) , 2) the clinic 
receives the intervention set for only the first 6 months of the study period, and then reverts to “care as usual,”  for Intervention set A and PMP integration without  
the reminder function for Intervention B  (Subarm B) , or 3) The clinic receives the 
intervention set for the first 6 months, but in the second 6 months, I ntervention s et 
A will only fire in a random half of clinical encounters  and the reminder function will 
only fire in a random half of clinical encounters for Intervention B  (Subarm C) . 
Exhibit 7 . Randomization plan  
 

 
 Page 15 of 37   5.2 Study Procedures:  
● All PCPs who are in clinics that are assigned to Intervention set A or B will 
receive communications from the Medical Directors of their respective clinics  
about the implementation of the new EHR alerts  and/or PMP integration, in 
the same  way that new best- practice alerts  and EHR features  are normally  
implemented in Fairview and UMP.  
● All PCPs who are in clinics that are assigned to Intervention set A or B will receive either Intervention set A or B over the course of the study period.  As 
described above, both Intervention Sets A and B are extremely similar to the types of best -practice alerts  and/or new EHR capabilities  that clinicians are 
currently exposed to in their usual clinical practice.  
● The study team will receive bi- weekly reports from Fairview IT which will 
include data by [CONTACT_294087], and how often PCPs are using versus dismissing the alerts.  
● All PCPs in the Fairview and UMP primary care clinics will be recruited to complete brief web surveys at the start and end of the [ADDRESS_358100] information on PCPs’ 
background characteristics , knowledge and attitudes about pain treatment, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], and practice guidelines, and satisfaction with clinical decision 
support for pain treatment and opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414]. The web surveys will be 
implemented using the University of Minnesota ’s REDCap system.  
● Data from the shared EHR of Fairview and UMP will be used for analysis. These data are already collected as part of clinical care, and the research team will access these data via the University of Minnesota ’s Informatics Consulting 
Service. The data that the Informatics Consulting Service already has on hand will be augmented with additional EHR data on the activation of the study’s EHR alerts and the engagement with these alerts , along with data from the 
legacy HealthEast (which is now part of Fairview) Epic system which are not currently received by [CONTACT_294088]. Fairview IT will share those data with the Informatics Consulting Service, who will merge it with the other EHR data that the Informatics Consulting Service already has. All of these data will be stored and accessed only on the ICS’s secure data shelter.  
● We will conduct retrospective chart reviews  of the visit records for all visits 
where someone currently receiving a “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_294029] 20% relative to the current prescription. The study team has already created the chart review tool that will 
be used. These chart reviews  will ascertain whether there is any 
documentation of the clinical rationale for tapering that is consistent with the 
 
 Page 16 of 37   CDC’s guidelines. Each month during the [ADDRESS_358101] Number and 
visit date and store them in a database in the AHC -IE’s server. At the 
conclusion of the 12 month study period, all of these files will be destroyed.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_294030] -Investigator who will 
lead the chart reviews. For each visit that is reviewed, the study team will enter the information that is collected into a secure REDCap database. These 
data will then be shared with the ICS staff, who will link it to the EHR data in the ICS’ secure data shelter.  
● Data on the number of times per month each PCP checks the PMP, or has an assigned delegate check the PMP on their behalf, will be taken directly from the Minnesota PMP. The PMP data are held by [CONTACT_294089]. The study team will email the PCPs in the study asking for electronic authorization to access their data on how frequently they and their delegates check the Minnesota PMP between August 20 19 and September 2021.  
For the PCPs who provide this electronic authorization, Fairview IT will provide the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) prescriber identifier number to the PI. The list of DEA numbers will be transferred and stored via the PI’s secure “BOX” account. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_294031], also using BOX for file transfer. The Board of Pharmacy will pull the data on monthly number of times the PMP was checked between August 2019 
and September 2021, and then transfer back to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_294032]. The study 
team will analyze the PMP data on the PI’s HIPAA -compliant secure server. The 
study team will link information on characteristics of the PCPs (i.e., provider type, clinic where they practice, treatment arm assignment, and baseline information from the web survey) with the PMP data, and  then remove all 
identifiers from the analytic dataset. The file linking study identifiers to the PMP data will be stored separately in the PI’s BOX.  
● I
n addition, for primary care appointments with someone currently receiving a 
“high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], who did not get tapered, we will assess how frequently 
there is a documented clinical rationale for the decision to not taper, that is consistent with the CDC’s guidelines. We will do retrospective chart  reviews  of 
a random 10% sample of primary care appointments with someone currently receiving a “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], who did not get tapered (up to 2,000 visits). This will shed light on the appropriateness of decisions to not taper opi[INVESTIGATOR_294033].  For each visit that is reviewed, the study team will enter the 
information that is collected into a REDCap database.

.3 Follow -Up:  
 
 Page 17 of 37   At the end of the 12 -month study period, participants will be invited to participate in 
a follow -up web survey  that is similar in structure and length to the baseline survey .  
The research team will also examine longer- term opi[INVESTIGATOR_294034], up to 24 months after the completion of the study period.  
5.4 Individually Identifiable Health Information:  
This research will require exact dates of service for the EHR data from the AHC -IE. 
In addition, we will require Medical Record Numbers for the subset of the data 
collection that will involve chart reviews. Names and license numbers of the PCPs 
will be collected.  
5.5 Modifications to Procedures in Response to Data Monitoring Committee 
recommendations:  
The external Data Monitoring Committee reviewed the results of the interim 
outcomes analysis  (see Section 17.1 for details). Their letter to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_294035]. We will follow their recommendations and implement two changes to the study procedures.  
Change #1: Open up the PMP Integration arm to the entire study population at the 6-month mark.  
Change #2: We will not implement the secondary randomization of the intervention arm clinics into three subgroups. Instead, the clinics assigned to the “choice architecture” intervention set in Arms 3 and 4 will stay the same for months 6 -12 of 
the study p eriod.

determination and /or approvals are obtained.  
7.0 Sharing of Results with Participants  
7.1 Aggregate -level study results will be shared with clinical leadership from Fairview 
and UMP before any results are published in peer -reviewed journals.  No identifying 
information will be shared.  
8.0 Study Duration  
8.1 We anticipate that:  
● The duration of each participant’s participation in the study will be 12 months.  
● The process of enrolling participants to complete the web surveys will be three  
weeks  for the baseline survey and three weeks for the follow- up survey . 
● Once the 12 -month study period has ended, the data analysis will take an 
additional 9 -12 months.  
● EHR data alone will be examined up to 24 months after the completion of the 
study period.

11.0 Number of Participants  
11.1 Number of Participants to be Consented:  
We expect to  enroll approximately [ADDRESS_358104] that 20,000  chart s will be reviewed in the retrospective chart reviews of 
primary care visits with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155].  
12.0 Recruitment Methods  
12.1 Recruitment Process:  
All PCPs in Fairview and UMP primary care clinics will be included in the study. Those 
who are in the three intervention arms will receive information about the interventions that are going to be delivered in their clinics.  
Active recruitment of participants will only be relevant for the web survey 
components of the study. We will recruit all active PCPs who are working in the Fairview and UMP primary care clinics.  
We will include two notices about the upcoming web surveys in Fairview’s weekly “Neighborhood News” newsletter. The Medical Director of each primary care clinic will email their respective PCPs 1-[ADDRESS_358105] not yet responded to the survey. We will send an introductory email, 
followed by [CONTACT_294092] -up emails in the three weeks after the introductory 
email.  
12.2 Source of Participants:  
We will obtain the list of all PCPs working in the Fairview and UMP primary care 
clinics from both Fairview and UMP clinical leadership.  
12.3 Identification of Potential Participants:  
● The PI [INVESTIGATOR_294040], along with email addresses. This information was shared by 
[CONTACT_294093].  
● Each primary care clinic’s Medical Director will first alert all of their respective PCPs about the PRINCE study and the web surveys. The study team will then contact [CONTACT_294094].  
● For the analysis of EHR data, along with the subset of visits that are identified for medical chart reviews, we will be restricted by [CONTACT_58043] -IE to only obtain 
data from patient records where there is Minnesota Research Authorization status.  
 
12.4 Recruitment Materials: The following recruitment materials will be used in this 
study:  
- communications from the Medical Directors  
- email communications from the study team to recruit PCPs for the brief web surveys  
- written communications from the study team to Fairview and UMP clinical leadership  
- notices about the upcoming web surveys  to be published in Fairview’s “Neighborhood 
News” newsletter.  
- Email communication from the Medical Directors to PCPs about the authorization for 
accessing PMP data.  
- Email communications from the study team to the PCPs to ask for authorization for accessing PMP data.  
Recruitment materials are attached.  
12.5 Payment:  
● Each PCP that completes the web survey will be compensated $250. PCPs will be eligible to receive this payment for both the baseline and 12 -month follow -
up surveys, up to a maximum of $500.  
● The research team will mail checks directly to the participating PCPs 2 -4 weeks 
after the completion of the survey.  
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
 
 Page 23 of 37   13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances: There are no anticipated circumstances under which 
participants will be withdrawn from the research without their consent.  PCPs will not have 
the ability to withdraw from the study intervention arm their clinic is assigned to. 
However, the nature of the interventions is that they are EHR -based nudges that can 
easily be ignored by [CONTACT_21122], with no negative consequences to either the PCP or to the study.  
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures: Participants will be free to withdraw from completing the 
web surveys at any time, although their EHR data would still be used for analysis.  
13.3 Termination Procedures: N/A  
14.0 Risks to Participants  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
The only potential foreseeable risks are  a) a data security breach, which we consider a minimal risk due to our data security 
plan . The records of this study will be kept private. In any sort of report we might 
publish, we will not include any information that will make it possible to identify a subject. Research records will be stored securely and only researchers will have access to the records.  
b) discomfort answering web survey questions, which we consider a minimal risk because the web survey is designed to avoid questions that might make respondents uncomfortable and because respondents can choose to not respond to any survey question, and  
c) that the interventions themselves may be a minor nuisance in their day -to-day 
clinical practice . We think that latter risk is minimal because the EHR interventions 
can be ignored with no negative implications for the PCPs or for the study data and 
because these interventions are very similar to EHR alerts that are routinely used and introduced in cli nical practice.  
14.2 Reproduction Risks:  
Not Applicable.  
14.3 Risks to Others:  Not Applicable  
15.0 Incomplete Disclosure or Deception  
15.1 Incomplete Disclosure or Deception:  
● This research will not involve incomplete disclosure or deception.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
16.1 Potential Benefits: We do not foresee any immediate direct benefits to participants.  
Potential benefits include helpi[INVESTIGATOR_294041]- based tools to improve pain treatment in primary care which may improve the 
 
 Page 24 of 37   experience using the EHR for PCPs and may improve outcomes for patients with pain 
symptoms, as well.  
17.0 Statistical Considerations  
17.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
The first  formal statistical interim analysis is planned on the primary endpoint. This interim 
analysis is  planned to take place when  the study is  at least [ADDRESS_358106] main report/publication  of the study  will be prepared when PCP s have completed the 12 -
month follow -up survey and data for the primary endpoint has been received  and cleaned. 
Longer -term endpoints will be analyzed when all data has been received and cleaned.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will ensure the integrity  throughout the 
study by [CONTACT_294095]. The DMC  will be comprised of a 
statistician, an expert in behavioral economics interventions in a clinical setting, and a physician with expertise in trials around opi[INVESTIGATOR_294042]. The DMC will review interim and final analysis, data quality and completeness, external factors such as  scientific advances which 
may impact the study and make recommendation s. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_294043] .    
Interim Outcome Analysis Plan  
The DMC is responsible for assessment of the efficacy of the interventions during the course of the study i.e. interim analyses of efficacy endpoints. The study protocol version 1.2 pre -specifies 
the following interim analyses: The DMC will be asked to recommend graduation to the second stage of randomization when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference. As a guideline, the Lan -DeMets spending function analog of the Pocock boundaries will be used to 
monitor the primary endpoint comparison for the primary aims. The statistical analysis plan is given in the protocol. In brief, we will fit mixed effects logistic regression models of the primary outcome (described below) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve patients using data from the 12 months of the pre -
intervention period, and through December 31, 2020 (approximately [ADDRESS_358107]-intervention data). These models will include fixed effects for whether or not the encounter was at a clinic in the intervention a given intervention arm or received both interventions, indicators for study month to account for secular trends, and an indicator for whether an observation takes place in an intervention arm clinic and in the post -intervention period. These models will include 
random effects for clinic and PCP ( nested in clinic) to account for within -clinic and within -PCP 
correlation.  
 
 
 Page [ADDRESS_358108] of the intervention on key secondary outcomes will also be provided. Should the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_294044]’s effect, we would recommend the DMC to move into phase 2 of the study in which clinics in the experimental arms for that intervention would be re -randomized to 
continue with intervention for all opi[INVESTIGATOR_294045] 50% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155]. The decision to move to phase 2 will be  made separate for each intervention component (choice 
architecture nudge and PDMP integration/reminders).  
 We emphasize that data will only be available for the primary outcome in a timely manner for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve subpopulation and, therefore, decisions on whether or not to move into stage two of randomization will be made based on that subpopulation only.  
 The p
rimary outcome for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve subpopulation is: Whether or not an opi[INVESTIGATOR_294046] a primary care encounter, without  currently receiving a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_294047] (including a new order for a non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_294005]).  
 Key s
econdary outcomes  to be presented to the DMC are:  
• The frequency with which each PCP checks the Minnesota Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (derived from the Minnesota PDMP).  
• For the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve subpopulation, whether a CDC -recommended non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_294048] a primary care visit (e.g., referral to physical therapy, prescription of an NSAID, referral to pain clinic)  
• For the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve subpopulation, the length of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155]  
• For the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve subpopulation, the MME of opi[INVESTIGATOR_294049], there is a possibility  tha
 t data on two secondary outcomes for the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
using subpopulation will be presented to the DMC:  
• Whether there was a partial reduction in the MME or prescription length of refill orders, versus a total opi[INVESTIGATOR_294050] 26 of 37   • Whether there was an increase in the MME/day for current opi[INVESTIGATOR_294012] 50 
MME/day  
 
If at the single interim efficacy analysis, the PDMP integration/reminder intervention show 
substantial efficacy, we would recommend that the PDMP integration be made available to all clinics . A decision on what constitutes substantial efficacy will be made in consultation with the 
DMC.     Futility Analysis  
There will be no formal futility analyses presented to the DMC. Given that these intervention have small potential adverse effects, the DMC will NOT be asked to recommend early termination for futility.  
 
 
17.2 P
ower Analysis: The proposed design has sufficient power to detect clinically 
meaningful changes in opi[INVESTIGATOR_294051] (10). All power calculations assume a two -sided 
test at the 0.05 significance level. Power for the Primary Aim (comparison of intervention arms to the control during months 1 -6) is shown in Exhibits 2a -b 
assuming a total of 48  clinical are randomized (equal allocation between Arms 1 -4) 
with a conservative estimate of 10 providers per clinic (~12 providers per clinic in the FHS/UMP system). The range of the number of visits eligible and the percentage of visits with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_294052] (for both the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -using populations) were based on preliminary data from the EHR from a 
subset of clinics that will be randomized. Meeker et al. (1) assumed an intra -clinic 
correlation of 0.05 but that encounters within the same provider were not further correlated. We assumed the correlation for visits within the same clinic (but with different providers) was 0.025 and the within -provider correlation  would be 0.075 as 
well as considering a more conservative scenario (correlation given on the logistic scale (11)). We assumed a 5 % and 17% prescription rate in the control arm for the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- using populations, respectively, based on preliminary 
analysis of opi[INVESTIGATOR_294053], and based on published research (12) . We considered a d ifference in the percentage of eligible 
encounters with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_294054] 3.5% and 5% to be of clinical interest in the two populations. Exhibits [ADDRESS_358109] 6 months of the intervention.

The analysis sample for the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_294063], excluding patients with a cancer diagnosis in the 12 months 
prior to the visit. We will include both in- person visits along with virtual (telephone or video) 
visits  for all analyses . 
Primary Outcome Analysis   
To test our primary hypotheses, we will fit mixed effects logistic regression models using data from the [ADDRESS_358113]- intervention period prior to any 
second -stage randomization (the model for the current “high risk” opi[INVESTIGATOR_294064] 3 -category outcome). All models will include fixed 
effects for whether the encounter was at an intervention arm clinic, an indicator for whether the measurement was after the interventions began, and their interaction. The interaction is the primary measure of the intervention effect. These models include random effects for clinic and PCP (nested in clinic) to account for within- clinic and within -provider correlation. Because of the 
cluster -randomiz ed design with a moderate number of clinics, residual imbalances in patient and 
PCP-characteristics among the randomized groups may exist. The primary analysis model will 
adjust for characteristics at all levels of the hierarchy including clinic -level (ind icators for the four 
systems), PCP -level (clinician type [MD/DO, NP, or PA], sex, and length of tenure in medicine), 
and patient -level (age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and in -person or virtual visit). 
Separate models will be fit to assess the P DMP integration and choice architecture intervention 
and for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve and current, high -risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. In each model, the intervention 
group pools across two arms of the factorial design (e.g., the choice architecture intervention pools across arms 2 and 4) and the control condition pools across the remaining two groups (e.g., arms 1 and 3 to continue the example). A Bonferroni correction will adjust inference for multiple 
comparison across two different populations (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve and current, hi gh-risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]) but 
we will not adjust for multiple tests across the two different interventions.  
 As an exploratory analysis, we will assess whether PCP characteristics (clinician type and tenure in medicine) and patient characteristics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity) moderate the interventions’ effect. Tests for treatment effect heterogeneity will be implemented by [CONTACT_294096] 29 of 37   outcome (adjusting for the same factors described above). The effect of the intervention within 
subgroups formed from the potential moderators will be estimated by [CONTACT_294097].   Subgroup analyses will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons; they are supportive to the primary outcome analysis. Subgroup analyses will be interpreted with caution due to limited power and uncontrolled type I error.  
 
If the study proceeds to the second stage of randomization, we will fit mixed effects logistic 
regression models using data from [ADDRESS_358114] -intervention. All models will include 
fixed effects for intervention arm (control, continued intervention, 50% intervention, or intervention turned- off), indicators for whether the measurement was after the initial 
interventions began or after the second stage randomization, and their interaction. The interaction is the primary measure of the intervention e ffect. The models will include the same 
random effects and covariate adjustment as above.   Secondary Outcomes Analysis: PDMP and Web Survey data For other EHR -derived secondary outcomes, we will use the same general modeling framework as 
for the primary outcome but will fit mixed effects logistic or linear models depending on whether the outcome was categorical or continuous.  
 To assess intervention effects on the frequency of checking the PDMP we will fit mixed effects 
Poisson regression models using data from the [ADDRESS_358115] for clinician type, length of tenure in medicine, and health system indicators, and include random effects for clinic and PCP (nested in clinic) to account for within -clinic and within -provider 
correlation. As an exploratory analysis, we will assess whether PCP characteristics (clinician type and length of tenure) moderate the effect of the interventions using a similar process a s the 
primary outcome.  
 A similar approach will be used for the web survey data, except we will fit mixed effect linear regression models using data from the pre - and post -intervention surveys. All models will include 
fixed effects for whether the PCP was at an intervention arm c linic, an indicator for whether the 
survey was the 12 -month follow -up, and their interaction.

20.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
20.1 Data Integrity Monitoring.  
● The study team will conduct monthly reviews of data reports from Fairview IT, in order to assess whether the PRINCE alerts are firing as intended, and to assess the degree of PCP engagement with the alerts (e.g., how often using versus dismissing alerts).  
● The study team will receive monthly EHR data extracts from the AHC -IE, and 
the study partners at MMB will receive weekly PDMP data extracts. This will allow us to do an interim outcome check using data collected through December 31, 2020.  
 
20.2 Data Safety Monitoring.  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605].  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events.

Contract Language:  N/A 
 
 
22.0 Consent Process  
22.1 Consent Process (when consent will be obtained): N/A 
 
22.2 Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (when consent will not be obtained, 
required information will not be disclosed, or the research involves deception):  
● F or participation in the overall study by [CONTACT_21111]  (exposed to the study 
interventions ), we are requesting a waiver of consent.  Per the Common Rule 
(§46.116), informed consent can be waived when, “1) The research involves no 
more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; [and] (3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.”  We 
believe that we meet all three conditions, as we elaborate below.  
● Common Rule Criterion 1 (R
 esearch involves no more than minimal risk ). The 
proposed research is implementing a clinical quality improvement intervention. Clinical QI interventions that remind clinicians of practice guidelines and encourage clinical decisions that are concordant with well-established practice guidelines are common, and already carry minimal risk . In 
order to increase the value of the knowledge from the QI intervention, we will be randomly assigning clinics to receive different types of QI interventions.  In 
addition, the specific nature of the proposed interventions further ensures 
that there is no more than minimal risk. By [CONTACT_108], the QI interventions to be tested do not compel any activity or decision by [CONTACT_15098]. Rather, they are designed to merely “nudge,” clinicians towards evidence -based care that is 
supported by [CONTACT_294102].  
● Common Rule Criterion 2 (W
 aiving consent will not adversely affect the rights 
and welfare of the subjects ). This study is merely applying randomization to a 
QI intervention that would already be deemed acceptable for clinical operations, without requiring consent from clinicians.  Because this is a QI 
intervention that would normally be implemented without clinician consent, implementing the intervention to a random subset of clinicians will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.  
● Common Rule Criterion 3
  (The research could not practicably be carried out 
without the waiver or alteration ). As this study is a rigorous evaluation of a QI 
intervention, it is imperative to have information from all clinicians  working  in 
 
 Page [ADDRESS_358122] motivated clinicians , which would undermine the value of the study , 
making the research not practicable . 
22.3 Waiver of Written/Signed Documentation of Consent (when written/signed consent will not be obtained):  
● Fo
r the web survey component of the study only , we will obtain informed 
consent from PCPs but waive the signed documentation of consent. Because this study component is web -only, the consent process will be online -only. The 
first webpage of the web surveys will be the “information sheet” about the study, and at the end of the form participants will type their name [CONTACT_294104] “consent” to participation and move on to the actual web survey.  
● P
articipants will have the opportunity to carefully review the information sheet

1.0 Protocol  Summary  and/or  Schema  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 05- 122 A(17)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_596081] the efficacy  and the cumulative  toxicity of intrathecal  (administered  
through Ommaya reservoir) 131I-3F8 in children  and adult  patients with GD2 -expressing central  
nervous  system/leptomeningeal neoplasms.   Survival  is extremely poor  in these patients,  with 
median survival  of only a  few months. In a prior phase  I trial, 2 of  13  patients had negative  
remain  alive  and in complete remissi on after 4 years.  Patients in this protocol  will receive 
intrathecal  131I-3F8  weekly  for a total of four treatment  cycles.  About  130 p atients will be 
accrued  on this study. The  primary  endpoint  is overall  survival  at six months.  
 
2.1 Objectives and Scientific  Aims  
 
• To determine whether, in patients  with GD2 -expressing central  nervous  
system/leptomeningeal neoplasms, the activity  of intrathecal  131I-3F8  is sufficiently  
promising to  warrant  further study. Promising  activity  is defined as  a 6 month  overall  
survival  rate of 25% or more.  
 
• To determine the  response  rate to 131I-3F8 in this population. 
• To determine the  cumulative  toxicities of serial  injections  of intrathecal 131I-3F8. 
 
• To describe the effects  of HAMA (human -anti- mouse  antibody) on cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_155456] 
(CSF)  and serum  pharmacokinetics following  multiple  injections of 131I-3F8 
 
3.[ADDRESS_596082];    median  survival  time for most  
malignancies  is 4-14 months2,4,5.  Stereotactic r adiosurgery for small,  single  metastases  
(<4cm diameter), surgery for solitary metastases and radiotherapy are used for palliation. 
New techniques including  preoperative  functional imaging, image-guided neurosurgery,  
intraoperative  ultrasound and cortical  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_464936],  and lowered  the associated  surgical  morbidity and mortality6,7. 
However, novel  therapeutic agents  that may prevent  or delay  the progression of disease  
are needed  to improve overall  outcome.

3.4 Results  of Phase  I Intraventricular 131 -I-3F8 
 
3.4.1 Dosimetry  
 
We studied  the radiation  dose to the CSF  following i ntraventricular injection  of 131I-3F8 
in patients  diagnosed with GD2-positive LM disease, compared  radiation dose estimates  
by [CONTACT_464958] (regions of interest)  analyses,  and monitored acute and chronic 
toxicities following drug administration  in a phase I  study. Fifteen  patients (ages  1-61) 
received  a tracer  dose (37-74 MBq, 1 -2 mCi) and a second therapeutic injection  (370-740 
MBq, 10- 20 mCi).   Dosimetry was evaluated by [CONTACT_28760]-body ga mma  camera scanning  
(4, 24, 48 hours), s erial CSF and  blood sampling. Pre - and post - treatment clinical, 
radiographic and cytologic status  were evaluated.  Total  absorbed dose  to the CSF was  
1.12 – 13.0 Gy,  3.2 – 41.5 Gy  to the ventricles  and 1.0 – 13.7 Gy  to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_464937]. 
Clearance  half- life was 12.5 hr (3.5 - 44 hr).  Average ratio of the therapy/tracer  
administration (Gy/MBq), was 0.88 (±0.58)  and 1.08  (±0.66)  by [CONTACT_464959],  respectively.

Although not the primary  objective  of this study, of 13 evaluable patients,  clinical  improvement  
(n=2, patient #1, patient #6), radiographic  improvement  (n=2, patient  #1, patient  #13), and

further therapy with negative  CSF cytology by [CONTACT_464961] a 14 month period; resolution  of 3 areas  of enhancement  on MR 
imaging  was also noted. Patient  #14 had an isolated  CNS  relapse of neuroblastoma.  He was 
treated  with surgery, chemotherapy, cranio-spi[INVESTIGATOR_464940], intraventricular  131-I-3F8

Although all patients  had CSF flow throughout  the subarachnoid space,  variability  in CSF flow 
dynamics  were  noted  on baseline Indium  –DTPA  studies. Such variability  may be attributed to 
prior  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  the presence  of bulk and microscopic  disease,  or the presence of an indwelling  
shunt  all affecting  CSF flow and reabsorption.  This may in part account  for the interpatient  
variability  in CSF dosimetry  and clearance is this diverse  patient  population. Although no 
patient in this study had measurable serum  human- anti- mouse  antibody (HAMA)  titers  at the 
time of treatment, this would  contribute to faster  clearance in the systemic  circulation and 
decreased  dose to the blood. Previous  experiments  have  shown that, because  of the blood-brain 
barrier,  systemic  production of  HAMA is associated with low titers  in the CSF,  namely a  14-[ADDRESS_596089] clinical  utility  in the treatment  of some  patients 
with GD2-positive LM cancers.  
 
There are few other  therapeutic options  to offer this patient population. This study fills  an unmet  
need at this institution for  both pediatric  and adult  patients and capi[INVESTIGATOR_464941]-

radiographic  remission  (3 mo+, 8 mo+,  10 mo+, 12 mo+,  12 mo+,  12 mo+,  18 mo+,  22 mo+).  [ADDRESS_596090] been  seen in 
the 5 patients  who remain  in remission off therapy  for >1 year since 131I-3F8 injections. Accrual  
is ongoing. These results  support  the need to continue  this study in a larger  cohort  of patients,  
with the goal of decreasing the time between  injections and further  decreasing the toxicity profile

4.1 Overview of Study/Design Intervention 
 
4.2 Design  
This is a phase II single -arm open-  label  study that will define  responses  to therapy  with 
weekly  intrathecal 131I-3F8 in patients  with central  nervous  system/leptomeningeal GD2 - 
expressing disease.  Dosimetry  at plaques  of disease and surrounding normal  tissues will be 
determine d by a pre-treatment 131I-3F8 (2 mCi) scintigraphy. Pharmacokinetics of the dosimetry

dose of intrathecal  131I-3F8 will be determined  by [CONTACT_464963]  (cpm)  of 
serial CSF and serum  samples.  
Patients  will then receive  intrathecal 131I-3F8 treatment  cycle  (10 mCi/cycle) approximately 
weekly  for a total of 4 cycles.   A total dose of 40 mCi 131I-3F8 will be administered.  Since  the 
phase  I study demonstrated a CSF dose  of 15-60 cGy/mCi  to the CSF,  maximum  total anticipated 
CSF dose of  4 x 10 mCi of 131I-3F8 injections  would be  600-2400 cGy;  dose to  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_464942] 131I.  At an estimated  tumor to CSF  
dose ratio of 5:1, tumor dose could  be as high as  [ADDRESS_596091] had previous  
craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332],  the CSF radiation dose delivered by 131I-3F8 therapy  injections  will not 
exceed   2400 cGy based  on the CSF dosimetry  estimates  from  pre-treatment 131I-3F8 / 
scintigraphy scans.  This may require  the elimination  and/or  dose r eduction of the 3rd or 4th  
injection for patients  who have had previous craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_464943]. There will be no dose  
modifications  for patients  who have not had craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_464943]. Response  to therapy  will be 
assessed  by n eurologic examination, radiographic  imaging  and CSF cytology analysis. Other  aims  
will be met by m onitoring patients clinically and  biochemically  for toxicity  and by [CONTACT_464964].  
 
It is quite  possible that 131I-3F8 may  lead to disease stabilization  without  complete  or 
partial  responses  in this population with  advanced  disease.  We therefore propose  overall  survival  
at six months  as the primary  endpoint  of this study. Leptomeningeal  disease  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_464944].  
Though some  prior studies  have reported  survival  at six months  of around 15%  these included 
patients  receiving  chemotherapy. Patients  receiving  131I-3F8 at MSKCC  have completed  all 
chemotherapy  and are not anticipated to have  further  oncologic treatment after progressing on 
this protocol. If 131I-3F8 has zero effect,  we would  therefore expect  no more  than 5% of patients  
to survive  for six months.  We will therefore  use 5% overall  survival  at six months  as the null 
hypothesis  with 25% overall  survival  at six months  as the alternative  hypothesis.

4.2.3 Dosimetry  
Pharmacokinetics  and dosimetry of the dosimetry dose of intrathecal  131I-3F8 will be  determined  
by [CONTACT_464963]  (cpm)  of serial CSF and serum  samples and serial  
scintigraphy images  obtained at approximately 4, 24 and 48 hours  after injection.  Dosimetry  
estimates  will be calculated  by M edical Physics  physicists in the Dept  of Nuclear  Medicine.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_596105] dose with  131I-3F8:  
SSKI:  7 drops  daily  (to begin  [ADDRESS_596106] 
injection)  
 
Liothyronine (Liothyronine): 25 mcg/day if  weight  less than 25 kg, 50 mcg/day if  weight  greater  
or equal  to 25 kg (to  begin [ADDRESS_596107] 
injection)  
 
To start  1-2 da ys prior  to each injection:  
 
Dexamethasone (for those  patients not already  on a higher  dose of dexamethasone):  0.5 mg po 
bid if weight  less than 15 kg, 1 mg po bid  if weight  greater  than or equal  to 15 kg (to begin  about  
24 hours  pre- injection  and to be tapered  over  ~1 week)  
 
To be started  about  1 to 2 hours  before each injection: 
 
Hydroxyzine (Vistaril): 1 mg/kg IV, then Q [ADDRESS_596108]- injection (maximum  50 mg). 
 
Acetaminophen (Tylenol):  10 mg/kg po before  injection and then Q4 hours  x [ADDRESS_596109]- 
injection (maximum  325 mg) 
 
Lorazepam  (Ativan):  0.05 mg/kg IV x 1 (maximum 1mg)  
 
Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): 0.015 mg/kg/dose  x 1, then PRN  (maximu m 1mg)  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_596110] an 
intraventricular reservoir (i.e. Omma ya reservoir).  The Omma ya catheter  site will be prepped  
and draped. A  volume  of CSF equal  to the volume  of drug to  be injected  will be removed, the  
drug will be injected  slowly so  as not to exceed  a rate of 1ml/min.  Sterile  HSA will be flushed  
into the reservoir  followed by [CONTACT_464973].  After 131I-3F8 dosimetry injections, 
patients  will have approximately  0.5 cc CSF and 1-2 cc blood obtained for radioactivity  levels  at 
approximately, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4-6 hr, 18-24 hr,  44-48 hr,  66-72 hr and ~5-[ADDRESS_596111] injection.

9.3.1 * Dose  adjustments  for age <3 years  based  on CSF  volume: 
< 1year:  50% dose reduction 
1-3 years:  33% dose reduction 
>3 years:  Full dose, 10 mCi 131I-3F8 per injection  
+averaging  approximately 5 mCi of radioiodine/mg 3F8 
* Dose  adjustments  for patients  with prior craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_464943]:  
The total maximu m target  CSF dose by 131I-3F8 injections  will be 2400 Gy for patients  with 
prior  craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_464947] 131I-3F8/  scintigraphy  dosimetry   estimates.  This may 
require  a decrease or elimination  of the 3rd or 4th injection  to prevent  the risk of radiation toxicity 
for these patients.  
 
 
9.3.2 Dosimetry  will be assessed  by 
 
*CSF and blood ( 2 ml/sample) obtained for radioactivity levels at approxima tely, and 1, 2, 4, 18, 
and 44 hours  after 131I-3F8 dosimetry injection.  (CSF  samples  obtained here are for research  
purposes).  At the time  of 131I-3F8 scintigraphy analysis,  routine dosimetry estimations will be 
derived  from  the serial  scintigraphy  studies  at approximately 4, 24, and  [ADDRESS_596112]  
counting of CSF and blood samples  in a well scintillation  counter, and  combined  with MRI  
anatomical  imaging  to estimate  the absorbed  dose  to brain, CSF space,  blood and  visible tumor  
nodules.  
 
9.4 Tumor  genetic studies 
 
9.4.1 Tumor DNA and matched  normal  DNA will be used for genomic  DNA  sequencing, 
copy number  analysis  and methylation profiling;  tumor  RNA will be used for 
transcriptome and microRNA  profiling. The samples will not have any associated  patient- 
specific  identifying information,  but will be linked  to clinical  information  such  as patient  
age, gender,  tumor  stage,  tumor  recurrence status,  and tumor  site.  The identity of 
individual  patients  will be kept in a secure database registered  with the Office of Clinical  
Research,  under  the supervision of [CONTACT_464987] according  to HIPAA  regulations.  This 
testing will be done  in [CONTACT_86507]‟s  Lab (Z740).  These  tests will be done  only on the 
tumor  left over after testing  for 3F8 binding.  
 
9.4.2 Immunohistochemical profile:  Frozen  tumors  will collected to  be tested  for tissue  
antigens  and gangliosides  [including but not limited  to GM2,  GD2,  GD3].   These tests 
will only be done  on patients  whose  tumors are not known to  bind  to 3F8, and  therefore 
are consented  to the assessment arm of the protocol.

10.5 Concomitant  Therapy:  
Patients  may receive systemic  chemotherapy starting  [ADDRESS_596117] 3 weeks  before  they can resume injection 3 or 4. This will allow  
assessment  of response  while  avoiding widespread  progression  of systemic disease.  
 
 
11.0 Toxicities/Side  Effects  
 
11.1 Toxicities will be assessed via the NCI toxicity criteria (CTC 3.0). All toxicities will be 
recorded  in CRDB until [ADDRESS_596118] dose of 131-I-3F8. 
11.2 Toxicities associated with 131I-3F8 include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, pa in 
allergic reaction, and/or  drug  extravasation. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_464948], 
hyperglycemia or lymphopenia  related  to dexamethasone and self- limited  fever,  vomiting,  or 
headache will  not be considered serious adverse events  (SAE)  and will not be reported  to the 
IRB or FDA  though they will be captured  in the institutional database. However, life-threatening  
infections  or other  life-threatening  side effects  will be considered SAE's  and will be promptly 
reported  to the Institutional Review  Board  of MSKCC  and to the FDA.  
11.3 Neurologic changes  during the  study period which  meet  the criteria  for grade   4 
neurotoxicity will be assessed  by [CONTACT_464974],  possibly or probably 
caused  by [CONTACT_218725].  In the absence of clear  evidence of tumor progression, it may be 
assumed  that new signs  and symptoms  are treatment related.  
11.4 Any deaths  will be reviewed  during the study by [CONTACT_464975].  
 
12.0 C riteria for Therapeutic Response/Outcome Assessment 
 
12.1 Adequacy of trial: All patients  who fulfill  the eligibility r equirements, receive two treatment 
injections  of 131I-3F8 and undergo extent  of disease evaluation will have an adequate  trial.

protocol.  
12.5 Response  Definitions  
12.5.1 Comp lete Respo  nse (CR)  
Cytologic  and radiographic CR will be evaluated  separately,  since patients  with 
cytologic c learing and clinical  response  may continue  to have  residual  
abnormalities  on MRI  scans.  Patients with a CR must  also have stable or improved 
neurologic  exam.

IRB Number: 05- 122 A(17)  
Approval date: 20 -Mar-2018  
Page  16 of 23  
  
 
o Cyto lo gic CR 
Complete  clearing of  all malignant  cells from  lumbar  and ventricular  CSF 
based  on cytospin  preparation  in leukemia/lymphoma  patients  and 
cytology in  solid  tumor  patients. A  cytologic CR must  be documented by 
[CONTACT_464976] 4 weeks  
apart  (with  no interval  positive c ytologies). 
 
 
o Rad io grap hic C R 
In patients with evidence of  disease on MRI  scan,  complete clearing of 
MRI scan evidence of disease on [ADDRESS_596120] 4 weeks  
apart  will be required.  
 
12.5.2 Stab le Disea se (S D) 
Exists  when  a patient  fails to fulfill  the criteria  for either  complete or partial 
response  or progressive  disease.  
 
12.5.3 Progressive Disease (PD)  
An increase of at least 50%  in the absolute  number  of malignant  cells in the CSF 
OR, in -solid  tumor  patients,  an increase of greater  than 25% in the size of 
measurable lesions on MR scan OR the recurrence of malignant  cells in the CSF 
or new lesions on MR  after a patient  has attained  a complete remission OR 
evidence of clinical  neurologic progression. New  sites of or increasing  evidence of 
leptomeningeal  enhancement  that is not "measurable"  will also be  considered  
evidence of disease progression. 
 
  
 
13.0     C riteria For Removal From Study 
 
13.1 If at any time the patient develops  grade 4 toxicity  (other  than controllable  fever,  vomiting, 
headache)  attributed  to the study drugs, he/she  will be removed from  study and receive no further 
injections.  
 
13.2 If at any time the patient  is found to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the 
section  on Criteria  for Patient/Subject Eligibility  (i.e., a change in diagnosis), the patient will be 
removed  from  the study.  
 
13.3 If at time disease progression is  observed, the patient  will be removed  from  the study.  
 
13.4 If the patient experiences adverse events,  including unacceptable  toxicity  or exacerbation  of 
underlying  disease associated with drug administration and necessitating  discontinuation of 
treatment,  he/she  will come  off the study. Patents  who are removed  from  the study due to 
adverse events  will be treated  and followed according  to established  medical practice.  All 
pertinent  information  concerning  the outcome  of such treatment will be entered  in the Case  
Report  Form  or the Serious  Event  Report,  as applicable.

13.5 Withdrawal of consent:  The patient‟s desire to withdraw  from  the study may occur  at any 
time.  
 
13.6 Noncompliance:  If at any time  the patient  is non-compliant with therapy,  radiation  safety  
guidelines  or requests  withdrawal  from  the study, he/she  will be removed.  
 
13.7 Pregnancy:  The patient  will be removed from  study if  they are found to  be pregnant.  
 
14.0 Biostatistics  
This is a phase  II study to assess  the clinical  efficacy  of weekly  intrathecal  131I-3F8 for a new  
cohort  of 17 patients with GD2 -expressing central  nervous  system  and leptomeningeal  
neoplasms. A “response” is defined  as a patient  being alive  six months  after their first treatment.  
We will test hypothesis  that the proportion of responses  is 25%  or more  against  a null hypothesis  
that proportion  of responses  is 5% or less, with  a power  of 80%  and an alpha  of 5%. Using  a 
Simon  two-stage optimal design, nine patients will initially  be accrued. If at least one responds, 
then a further  [ADDRESS_596121] stage (0 / 9 responses)  is 0.63 if the true response  rate is 0.05. This 
probability decreases  to 0.08 if the true response  rate is 0.25, The probability  of declaring the 
agent  active (3 or more  responses  / 17) is 0.05 and  0.8 if the true response  rate is 0.05 or  0.25, 
respectively.  It is expected  that 4-6 patients/yr will be enrolled  and that this study can be 
completed  within [ADDRESS_596122]  null hypothesis  if: Reject  alternative  hypothesis  if: 
First stage  - 0 / 9 responses 
Second  stage  ≥3 / 17 responses  ≤2 / 17 responses  
 
The number  of CRs,  PRs, SDs  and PDs  will be reported.  Toxicities  will be reported  by [CONTACT_464977].  
 
Three additional  subgroups  will be added  for patients with:  Medulloblastoma  in CR (36 
evaluable patients), Medulloblastoma  with stable,  but minimal disease  (36 evaluable patients), 
and Retinoblastoma or Melanoma (18 evaluable patients).  For patients with neuroblastoma or 
other  cancers  in the CNS,  [ADDRESS_596123]  shown efficacy  on this phase  II study;  increasing  the

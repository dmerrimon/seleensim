Study Title: A Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Sa fety and Efficacy of AR-[ZIP_CODE],  a Co ld Ther moreceptor Modula tor, 
for the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease (COMET-2) 
Study Number: AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301 
Study Phase: 3 
Primary Objective(s): To evaluate the safety and effi cacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_117927] 0.003 % AR-[ZIP_CODE] compared to its vehicle dosed 
twice daily (BID) in subjects with dry eye disease (DED). 
Study Design: This will be a Phase 3, multicenter, vehicle-controlled, double -masked, randomized study conducted at 
approximately [ADDRESS_683986] 
of Screening (Day -14) and Base line (Day 1) visits as well as f ollow-up visits at Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, 
and Day 90 (Study Exit). In add ition, there will be a Day 60 di spensing visit. 
All subjects will be exposed to the Controlled Adverse Environm ent (CAE
®) at the Screening visit to assess 
eligibility. At the end of the S creening visit, all qualified s ubjects will be assigned to administer AR-[ZIP_CODE] 
vehicle BID to both eyes for approximately 14 days during the v ehicle run-in period. After the vehicle run-in 
period, subjects will be re-evaluated at the Baseline visit for  signs and symptoms of DED. Only subjects who 
requalify, based on inclusion/ exclusion criteria, will be enrol led in the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
within each site to receive 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE]  or AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle to be administered BI D as 1 drop in each 
eye for 90 days. Eff icacy will be assessed at the Baseline (Day  1) visit and Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 
90. At the end of the Day 90 v isit, subjects will exit the stud y. Safety assessments will be conducted at each 
study visit. 
Study Population: This study is anticipated to enroll approximately 460 subjects with DED so as approximately 414 subjects 
complete Day 90. The anticipated  dropout rate is 10%. To achiev e this goal, approximately [ADDRESS_683987] meet all of the fo llowing criteria to enter into the study: 
 Male or female, 30 years of age or older at the Screening visit

Statistical Methods: 
Sample Size Determination 
Two hundred two (202) intention-to-treat (ITT) population subje cts (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] over vehic le in the proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm 
in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14, assuming a true dif ference of proportions (AR-[ZIP_CODE] vs 
vehicle) of 80% vs 30% and a two-sided alpha = 0.05. 
Additionally, 202 ITT population subjects (study eyes) per trea tment group yields 99% power to conclude 
superiority of 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle in the mean change from Baseline in SAND E score on Day 28 
assuming a true difference (AR-[ZIP_CODE] minus vehicle) of -7.9, a common standard deviation of 17.72, and a 
two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Accounting for subject discontinuations, approximately 460 tota l subjects (230 per tr eatment arm) will be 
randomized assuming a dropout rate of 10%. 
 
Primary endpoint 
 Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schir mer score on Day 14  
 
Secondary endpoints 
 Change from Baseline in SANDE score on Day 28 
 Change from Baseline in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14

Statistical Analyses 
Analysis of primary efficacy will be based on difference of pro portions tests for dicho tomous endpoints and 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for change from Baseline endpoi nts. Available data only will be used if 
the discontinuation rate is < 5% in each arm; otherwise, an est imand based on multiple imputation will be 
used for the primary analysis.  
Analysis of secondary efficacy w ill be conducted as described f or the primary efficacy endpoints, using 
difference of proportions tests or ANCOVA with available data o nly if the discontinuation rate is < 5% in 
each arm and multiple imputation otherwise. The secondary effic acy endpoints will only be formally tested if 
the endpoint is significant at the α=0.05 level. Testing of the  secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted 
using a fixed-sequence hi erarchical strategy.

Clinical Stud y Protocol: AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, Amendment [ADDRESS_684001] of Transient Recepto r Potential Melastatin 8 
(TRPM8) that is being developed for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (DED). 
1.1 Background 
DED is a multifactorial diseas e of the ocular surface character ized by a loss of homeostasis 
of the tear film, and accompanie d by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface  inflammation and damage, and ne urosensory abnormalities 
play etiological roles ( Craig 2017). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_510320] 5% to 50% of the global population ≥ 50 years o ld, depending on the 
definition of DED that was used ( Baudouin 2014, Bron 2014, Rolando 2010, Smith 2007, 
Stapleton 2017,  Uchino 2013).  
DED is broadly attributed to eit her impaired tear film production or excessive tear film 
evaporation. Either of these ch anges to the tear film can compromise the healt h of the ocular 
surface with associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] l damage, which can adversely affect visua l function. 
This can be experienced as blurred vision and ocular surface di scomfort, often described as a 
feeling of dryness, burning, itchiness, or a sandy/gritty sensation. Treatment of DED is mainly sympt omatic and very few specific ph armacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_510321] (Jones 2017). Artificial tear preparations  are generally the first therapy 
considered. Artificial tears are based on lubricating or viscos ity-increasing agents and there is 
limited evidence suggesting that any one type of artificial tea r is markedly better than others 
(Doughty 2009). With respect to pharmaceuticals,  various strategies exist fo r targeting the 
underlying ocular inflammation asso ciated with DED with two pro ducts (Restasis
® [0.05% 
cyclosporine ophthalmic  emulsion] and Cequa™ [0.09% cyclosporine ophthalmic solution]) 
indicated for increased tear  production in patients with DED and a third, Xiidra® (5.0% 
lifitegrast ophthalmic solution), indicated for the treatment o f the signs and symptoms of 
DED. In addition, a novel choliner gic agonist, delivered nasall y (varenicline solution, nasal 
spray 0.03mg [Tyrvaya™]), is approved for the treatment of sign s and symptoms of DED. 
The short-term application of t opi[INVESTIGATOR_510322]. In recent years, increased a ttention has bee n placed on the neuronal regulation of tear 
production. The trigeminal nerve provides the pathway for paras ympathetic stimulation of 
the lacrimal functional unit a nd sensory stimulation of the cor nea and conjunctiva is essential 
for initiating basal tear production (Belmonte 2015; Belmonte 2017 ). Reduced corneal 
neuron density and / or dysfuncti on of the corneal sensory nerv es have been hypothesized to 
contribute to the pathogenesis of DED. The functional types of sensory nerve fibers of the 
cornea are distinguished by [CONTACT_510349], each of which confers a specific sensitivity to mecha nical, thermal, or chemical 
stimuli.

Confidential Page 17 of 86  
    Branches of the trigeminal nerve innervating the cornea and lids selectively express cold 
sensitive thermoreceptors, called TRPM8 receptors ( Belmonte 2017, Viana 2011 ). TRPM8 
receptors are associated with the  detection of ocular surface d ryness and are activated by 
[CONTACT_510350] o f tear production and blink 
rate (Belmonte 2017, Yang 2017, Yang 2018). In addition, agonists of TRPM8 promote a 
cooling sensation that may be bene ficial for reducing ocular di scomfort and pain. Taken 
together, TRMP8 agonists may have a dual role in the potential treatment of DED by [CONTACT_527147] ( Abelson 2013).

Avizorex Pharma S.L. (“Avizore x”), who began the development of  AR-[ADDRESS_684003] of

    1.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment 
AR-[ZIP_CODE] has been used as a flavor ing agent or adjuvant in the food industry and as a 
cooling ag
ent for chewing gum and candies for more than a decad e. AR-[ZIP_CODE] (FL-no. 
16.123) is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a flavoring agent or adjuvant 
(USFDA/FEMA GRAS No . 4681) in or on human food products wit h no safety concerns at 
specified use levels ( EU/EFSA 2014 ; WHO/JECFA No. 2079 ). 
In vitro , in vivo  and ex vivo  studies have also been pe rformed on AR-[ZIP_CODE] to demonstrate 
safety, tolerability and negligib le systemic exposure and to ch aracterize the effective dose 
and the regimen of ocular adm inistration of AR-[ZIP_CODE] ophthalmic  solution. In addition, 
Aerie has conducted two good labor atory practice (GLP) 3-month repeated-dose topi[INVESTIGATOR_527134]-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution

4.4 Screen Failures 
A screen failure occurs when a pa rticipant who consents to part icipate in the clinical study is 
not subsequently randomized. A minimal set of screen failure in formation is required to 
ensure transparent reporting of s creen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)  publishing requirements and to re spond to queries from 
regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography , screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and a ny SAEs. Individuals who do not meet  the criteria for participation in 
this study (screen failures) ma y be rescreened for eligibility up to one time if there is a 
reasonable possibility, in the I nvestigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], that the  patient might meet  the eligibility 
criteria. It is encouraged for t he investigator to discuss potential rescreening with the 
Sponsor. Rescreened participants  should be assigned a new parti cipant number for every 
screening/rescreening event.

The product formulation is adjus ted to a pH of approximately [ADDRESS_684019]. 
5.2 Selection and Timing of D ose for Each Patient 
Subjects who qualify at the Screening visit will be instructed on proper administration 
procedure to insti ll 1 drop of AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle BID to both eye s on Days -14 to -1 
(vehicle run-in period) as follo ws: 1 drop in eac h eye in the m orning (from approximately 
7:00h to 10:00h) and 1 drop in each eye in the evening (from ap proximately 19:00h to 
22:00h). A new vial should be used for each administration time  (both eyes dosed from one 
vial). Following the vehicle run-in period, those subjects who requali fy at the Baseline visit, will be 
randomized into two groups, in a 1:1 ratio within each site, as  follows: 
 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] (n = 230) 
 AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle (n = 230) 
Subjects will be re-instructe d on proper adminis tration procedures at the Baseline visit. 
Subjects will be instructed to adm inister their randomized stud y intervention BID to both 
eyes as follows: 1 drop in each eye in the morning (from approx imately 7:00h to 10:00h) and 
1 drop in each eye in the eveni ng (from approximately 19:00h to  22:00h). A new vial should 
be used for each administration time (both eyes dosed from one vial). At the Screening visit, 
the morning dose of AR-[ADDRESS_684020] under 
site staff supervision. At the Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 90 visits, the “evening” 
(or second) dose of randomized s tudy intervent ion will be admin istered by [CONTACT_7893], 
thus there will be no “evening” (or second) dose administered b y the subjects on these days. 
All office visits must be arrang ed at approximate ly the same ti me of day ± 1 hour.  
5.3 Method of Assigning Patients t o Study Intervention Groups 
All subjects will be centrall y assigned to randomized study intervention using interactive 
response technology (IRT). Before the study is initiated, the l og-in information and directions 
for the IRT will be provided to qualified personnel at each sit e.

Clinical Stud y Protocol: AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, I nc.
 
 
   
Confidential Page 30 of 86  
    All qualified subjects will be assigned to receive AR-[ZIP_CODE] veh icle BID to both eyes 
for approximately 14 days during the vehicle run-in period. Following the run-in period, 
all subjects who requalify at the Baseline visit (Day 1), will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, 
within each site, to receive 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] or AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle. The IRT will provide 
the site with the specific kit  number(s) for each randomized su bject at the time of 
randomization. Sites will dispense  the study intervention accor ding to the IRT instructions 
and the Schedule of Vis its and Assessments ( Appendix 1).

and Statisticians), and the subj ects. Only in case of medical e mergency or occurrence of 
adverse events that warrant  unmasking in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_90554], will the study 
intervention assignment(s) be unmasked and made available to th e Investigator and the 
Medical Monitor. In the absence of medical need, the randomizat ion code will not be 
available to the above personnel un til after the study is compl eted and the database is locked. 
If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s  study intervention assignment 
after an emergency situation, the  Investigator should contact t he Medical Monitor. Only after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor will a decision be made a s to whether or not the study 
intervention for the subject should be unmasked. The study inte rvention assignment will be 
revealed on a subject-by-subject  basis, thus leaving the maskin g on the remaining subjects 
intact. 5.[ADDRESS_684023] under 
supervision from site personnel. For the Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 90 visits,

    The subjects’ used and unused study intervention vials will be collected at eac h visit from the 
Baseline visit up to and including the Day 90 (Exit) visit to a ssess dosing compliance. Dosing 
compliance will be based off th e used and unused vial count. If  the subject is less than 80% 
or more than 125% compliant w ith dosing based on the expected n umber of used and unused 
vials, then the subject will be  deemed non-compliant and a prot ocol deviation must be 
recorded. Subjects will be instructed on instillation and stora ge of study intervention at the 
end of each visit (excluding the exit visit), as well as prov ided written instructions. 
These guidelines will be used by t he Investigator for determini ng the subject’s necessary 
compliance for the study and for  recording deviations from this  compliance.  
The study centers will keep an accurate accountability record t hat specifies the amount of 
study intervention dispensed to each subject, the amount of stu dy intervention returned to the 
site, and the dates of each. 
5.7 Packaging and Labeling 
Each packaged unit will be labele d with an investigational labe l with the information

6.6 Efficacy Assessments  
6.6.1 Symptom Questionnaire (V isual Analog Scale (VAS)) 
Subjects will be asked to rate each of the following DED sympto ms (both eyes together), 
over the last 24 hours, each on a separate VAS: ocular discomfort (ODS), eye dryness (EDS), 
. For each VAS, subjects will be a sked to place a vertical mark  on the horizontal 
line to indicate the level of each symptom, with 0 correspondin g to “no symptom” and 100 
corresponding to “maxima l symptom”. The asse ssment line length of each scale will be 
100 mm (Figure 2). Instructions f or measuring each subject’s response on each VAS can be 
found in the Manual of Procedures.

6.6.2 Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye Questionna
ire 
The SANDE questionnaire ( Schaumberg 2007 ) is comprised of 2 unique VASs to assess the 
frequency and severity of DED symptoms. Subjects will be asked to complete the SANDE to 
rate both the frequency and severity of DED symptoms for both e yes together. Each of the 
two questions will be accompanied by a VAS. The assessment line length of the scale will be 
100 mm and will be similar to the following depi[INVESTIGATOR_182513] (Figure 3 ). Higher scores indicate 
greater frequency or severity.  
Instructions for measuring each subject’s response on each VAS can be found in the Manual 
of Procedures. The SANDE score w ill be calculated by [CONTACT_527153] g the frequency score by 
[CONTACT_527154]. The final val ue must be rounded to the 
nearest whole number.  __________________________________________

Documentation of AEs/adverse r eactions will include AE descript ion, start date and stop 
date, severity, relationship, act ion(s) taken, seriousness, and  outcome. 
If a disease is known at the time  an AE is reported, this diagnosis should be recorded rather 
than listing of individual sympto ms. However, if a cluster of s ymptoms cannot be identified 
as a single diagnosis, each indivi dual event should be reported separately. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently known, it should be reported as follow-up informat ion.

6.9.2 Adverse Event Definitions 
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
 Adverse event (AE): any untowar d medical occurrence associated with the administration 
of the study intervention in human s, whether or not considered to be related to the study 
intervention.  
  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Stud y Protocol: AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, I nc.
 
 
   
Confidential Page 48 of 86  
     Adverse reaction (AR): any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
administration of the drug caused t he AE. For the purposes of I nvestigational New Drug 
(IND) safety reporting, “reasonabl e possibility” means there is  evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the a dministration of the drug and the AE. See Section 6.9.5 . 
 Life-threatening AE or life-thr eatening AR: an AE or AR is considered “life-threatening” 
if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occu rrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does no t include an AE or AR that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might  have caused death.  
 Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious adverse reaction (SAR): an AE or AR is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcome s: Death, a life-t hreatening or sight-t hreatening AE, subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disr uption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. I mportant medical events that may not result in death, 
be life-threatening, or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120279], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment , they may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes  listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical event s include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, bloo d dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not 
result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported 
as a serious adverse event whe n the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527146] e or for a preex isting condition ( with no increase in 
severity).  
 Unexpected AE or unexpected AR: an AE or AR is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the s pecificity or severity that has 
been observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not require d or available, is not 
consistent with the risk informa tion described in the general i nvestigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current applic ation, as amended. See section 6.9.6. 
6.9.[ADDRESS_684036] enrollment and the 
commencement of study medicati on, it should be recorded as an A E. Any change in the 
health status after commencemen t of study medic ation should be recorded as treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Confidential Page 49 of 86  
    Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse even t if the purpose of the 
surgery was diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
[IP_ADDRESS] AEs and Prior Medical History  
Any medical condition present pri or to informed consent which r emains unchanged or 
improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits. However, an AE should be 
recorded if the frequency, intens ity, or the character of a pre -existing condition worsens 
during the study period beyond what would be expected from the natural progression of that 
condition.  
Symptoms and signs that are cons istent with the n atural history of DED are not considered 
reportable adverse events. Such developments are recorded but a re not reportable adverse 
events. Worsening of symptoms and signs of DED should be record ed as an AE or SAE only 
if judged by [CONTACT_527156]/or frequency or 
changed in nature at any time during the study. When recording an unanticipated worsening 
of DED, it is important to conve y why the development was unexp ected.   
If there is a question as to whe ther a medical development shou ld be reported as an adverse 
event, the Investigator is r ecommended to contact [CONTACT_1034] f or guidance. 
6.9.[ADDRESS_684037]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
 1 = Mild: present and noticea ble, but not distressing, and no d isruption of normal daily 
activities 
 2 = Moderate: bothersome, discomfo rt sufficient to possibly red uce or affect normal daily 
activity 
 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform n ormal daily activity 
A change in increased severity for a reported AE will require a  stop date for the previous 
severity and a new start and st op date for the new severity. Fo r example, a change in severity 
may go from mild to moderate, or from moderate to severe. In ei ther case, the start and stop 
dates should be recorded. 
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations  (see Section 6.9.8 for further 
information on SAEs, SARs, and sus pected unexpected serious adv erse reactions 
[S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).

    6.9.5 Relationship 
A relationship between the AE a nd the study intervention or study procedure will be 
determined by [CONTACT_737], as applicable, for each AE usin g these explanations:  
 Not Related: The event is clea rly related to other factors such  as subject’s clinical 
condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease, or t herapy administered to the 
subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the pro duct, device, or 
procedure.  
 Unlikely Related: The event is most probably caused by [CONTACT_510364]’s 
underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay 
between administrati on and the onset of the A E is incompatible with a causal 
relationship. Therefore, there i s not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by 
[CONTACT_77425], device, or procedure.  
 Possibly Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication admin istration or study procedure and/or follo ws a known response 
pattern to the product, device or procedure but could have been  produced by [CONTACT_374983]’s clinical s tate, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy 
administered to t he subject.  
 Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication administration or study procedure and/or follows a k nown response pattern to 
the product, device or procedur e and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_510365]’s clinical state , therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy 
administered to the sub ject, and either occurs immediately following study medication 
administration or procedure, or i mproves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears 
on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.
  
6.9.6 Expectedness 
 AEs or ARs are considered “unexpected” if they are not  listed in the Reference Safety 
Information section of the Invest igator’s Brochure for AR-[ZIP_CODE] or are not listed at the 
specificity or severity that ha s been observed. “Unexpected,” a s used in this definition, 
also refers to AEs or ARs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring 
with this class of drugs or as a nticipated from the pharmacolog ical properties of 
AR-[ZIP_CODE] and are not  specifically mentioned as o ccurring with the study drug.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be u nexpected (by [CONTACT_375853]) if the Investig ator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes 
or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be 
unexpected (by [CONTACT_527157]) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only 
cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this defi nition, also refers to AEs or

    ARs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharm acological properties of the dr ug but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 An Investigator must immediat ely (i.e., withi n 24 hours from time of awareness) report 
any SAE or SAR (see Section 6.9.2 for definitions) t o the Sponsor or its clinical research 
organization (CRO) representativ e, whether or not considered dr ug-related, including 
those listed in the protocol or  Investigator’s Brochure. 
6.9.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (oth er than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and 
clinically significant at study e xit and that are changes from Screening values will be 
documented as AEs. 
6.9.8 Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Reactions or Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting SAEs or SARs  
An Investigator must immediat ely (i.e., within 24 hours) report  any SAE or SAR 
(see Section 6.9.2 for definitions ) to the Sponsor or its CRO r epresentative, whether or not 
considered study intervention-re lated, including those listed i n the protocol or Investigator’s 
Brochure. The Investigator must  use the SAE report form and include an assessment of 
whether there is a reasonable pos sibility that the drug caused the event. The Investigator must 
report any SAE or SAR that occu rs or is observed during the stu dy. In case of incomplete 
information, the Investigator m ust provide follow-up informatio n as soon as possible, again 
using the SAE report form. The email or fax to submit the SAE r eport is found in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].  SAE reports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1689]. Regulator y authorities, IRB, and 
Investigators at each of the s tudy sites will be informed as re quired.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Suspected Unexpected Ser ious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s)  
The Investigator must immedi ately (i.e., within 24 hours) repor t S[LOCATION_003]Rs. In the event of 
S[LOCATION_003]R, the site must notify the Medical Monitor (Section 10.2) for the study and submit an

The progress of the study will  be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_2394]-site, written, and telephone 
communications between personnel at  the Investigator’s site and  the Study Monitor. 
The Investigator will allow the Sponsor or designee and/or representatives of Health 
Regulatory Agencies to inspect all eCRFs, subject records (sour ce documents), signed 
consent forms, study medication r ecords (receipt, storage, prep aration, and disposition), 
and regulatory files related to t his study at mutually convenie nt times at regular intervals 
during the study and upon request aft er the study has been comp leted.

    The purpose of these visits is t o provide the Sponsor and/or He alth Regulatory Agency the 
opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study, document com pliance with the protocol and 
with regulatory requirements, v erify the accuracy and completen ess of subject eCRFs, 
resolve any apparent discrepancie s or inconsistencies in the st udy records, and account for all 
investigational supplies.  
9. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subje cts (n), mean, median, 
standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum. Qualitative varia bles will be summarized 
using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. For the purpose of summarizati on, medical history, concurrent m edications, and AEs will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug di ctionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined a s the last non-missing measure p rior to the initiation of 
randomized study treatment unless  otherwise defined in the SAP.  
Change from Baseline (CFB) will be calculated as post-Baseline result – Baseline; treatment 
comparisons will be calcu lated as AR-[ZIP_CODE] – vehicle. 
All primary and secondary analyses will be two-sided at a signi ficance level of 0.05. 
9.1.1 Unit of Analysis 
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes. For efficacy e ndpoints assessed at the eye 
level, the unit of analysis w ill be the “study eye” as defined in Section 9.1.2. For efficacy 
endpoints assessed OU, the unit of  analysis with be the subject . 
9.1.[ADDRESS_684048] one eye (the same eye) mee ting all the inclusion criteria 
(Section 4.2) and none of the exclusion criteria (Section 4.3) at both Screening and Baseline 
visits where applicable. Study s ubjects will be dosed in both e yes. If both eyes are eligible at 
the time of randomization, the study eye will be defined as the  eye with the lower pre-drop 
unanesthetized Schirmer score t o be performed at the Baseline v isit. If both eyes still qualify 
and have the same pre-drop unanest hetized Schirmer score, the r ight eye will be designated 
as the study eye 
  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution 
Clinical Stud y Protocol: AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, Amendment [ADDRESS_684049] as specified in 
Estimand 1 from the intent-to- treat (ITT) population, assuming the overall study 
discontinuation rate is <5% in each arm. If the study discontin uation rate is ≥ 5% in each arm 
then the primary analysis w ill be based on multiple imputation methodology as specified in 
Estimand 2, and the available data  analyses will become robustn ess analyses.  
Additional robustness analyses w ill include repeating the prima ry analysis on the ITT 
population imputing missing data a s failures for  the proportion  of subjects with ≥ 10 mm 
increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14 endpoint; u sing multiple imputation 
methodology under different assumptions of missingness (at random and not at random) each 
using 30 imputed values; the I TT population imputing missing data using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF); the ITT population usin g trimmed means;  and the per-protocol (PP) 
population with availab le data per subject. 
9.1.4 Hypotheses 
The primary endpoints will be tested as follows: 
H01: The difference between st udy eyes treated with AR-[ZIP_CODE] (0.00 3%) and study eyes 
treated with vehicle, in the pr oportion of subjects with ≥ 10 m m increase in unanesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 = 0. H
11: The difference between st udy eyes treated with AR-[ZIP_CODE] (0.00 3%) and study eyes 
treated with vehicle, in the pr oportion of subjects with ≥ 10 m m increase in unanesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 ≠ 0.

    9.2 Determination of Samp
le Size 
Two hundred two (202) ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 99% 
power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle i n the proportion of 
subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14, assuming a true 
difference of proportions (AR -[ZIP_CODE] vs vehicle) of 80% vs 30% a nd a two-sided alpha 
= 0.05.

    Additionally, 202 ITT population subj ects (study eyes) per trea tment group yields 99% 
power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle i n the mean change from 
Baseline in SANDE score on Day 28 assuming a true difference (A R-[ZIP_CODE] minus vehicle) 
of -7.9, a common SD of 17.72, and a two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Accounting for subject discont inuations, approximately 460 tota l subjects (230 per treatment 
arm) will be randomized assuming a dropout rate of 10%. 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis population will be considered. 9.3.1 Intent-to-Treat Population 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion includes all randomized su bjects. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed on the ITT population. Subjects in t he ITT will be analyzed as 
randomized. 9.3.2 Per Protocol Population 
The per protocol (PP) population i ncludes subjects in the ITT p opulation who do not have 
significant protocol deviations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study and 
who complete the tr ial through Day 90. Proto col deviations will  be assessed prio r to database 
lock and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only for 
efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analy zed as treated. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_684050] demographics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, and iris color will be presented using summary statistics (mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and media n) or frequency counts 
and percentages as appropriate.

    9.5 Efficacy Analyses 
9.5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
 Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm in crease in unanesthetized Schir mer score on Day 14 
9.5.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary comparison in thi s trial will be between AR-[ZIP_CODE] ( 0.003%) and vehicle in the 
ITT population with available data  per subject using Estimand 1  below if the overall study 
discontinuation rate is < 5%. If the discontinuation rate is ≥ 5%, this analysis will be a 
sensitivity analysis. 
Estimand 1: 
 Population: subjects in the I TT population with DED defined thr ough enrollment 
criteria  
 Endpoint:  
o Proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer 
score on Day 14 
 Intercurrent event:  
o Discontinuation of investigationa l products is ignored. [treatm ent policy 
strategy]  
o Non-optimal compliance is ignore d. [treatment policy strategy]  
o Withdrawal due to any reason. Mis sing data not imputed. [hypoth etical 
strategy] 
 Population-level summary:  
o Difference in the proportion of sub jects ≥ 10 mm increase in un anesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 between AR-[ZIP_CODE] (0.003%) and vehicle  
If the overall study discontinuation rate is ≥ 5% in each arm t hen the primary analysis will be 
based on multiple imputation methodology using Estimand 2 below . If the discontinuation 
rate is < 5% in each arm, this a nalysis will be a sensitivity a nalysis.

for maintaining the records may be  transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other 
Investigator) who will accept th e responsibility. Notice of thi s transfer, including written 
acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by [CONTACT_1034]. 
10.10 Protocol Deviations 
Per ICH E6 (Good Clinical Pract ice [GCP]) R2 Section 4.5.1 the Investigator/institution 
should conduct the tria l in compliance wit h the protocol agreed  with the Sponsor and, 
if required, by [CONTACT_527161] A uthority and which was given approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_510341].  Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not 
allowed because they can potential ly jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory 
acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the cr iteria as specified in the 
protocol is essential.  The site will contact [CONTACT_527162] n and/or exclusion criteria as 
needed prior to enrollment of the study subject. The Sponsor or  their representative will 
document clarificati on requests and respons es. If a subject doe s not meet any of the 
eligibility criteria, that subj ect may not be enrolled into the  study. 
If the Investigator feels that i n his/her clinical judgment, it  is necessary to promptly 
implement reasonable alternatives  to, or deviations from, the p rotocol in consid eration of the 
safety of study subjects, the S ponsor is to be notified of thes e alternatives  and deviations, 
and the reasons for such changes are to be documented in the study records. The Investigator 
is to also notify his/her IRB of any such changes. If a significant protocol devia tion is identified by [CONTACT_510376] e .g., 24 or 48 hours (as per 
IRB guidelines). The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation  and decide whether any of 
these non-compliances should be rep orted to the relevant regula tory authority as a serious 
breach of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant regulatory authorities’ re quirements, 
the protocol deviation is not req uired to be reported immediately but is still required to be 
notified to the IRB, the specifi c protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress 
report. The Sponsor will review, designa te, and/or approve all protocol  deviations prior to the 
database lock. 10.11 Access to Source Documentation 
Monitors, auditors, and other authorized representatives of the  Sponsor, the governing 
IRB(s), the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services (D HHS), and other 
domestic government agencies wi ll be granted direct access to t he study subject’s original 
medical and study records for verification of the data and/or c linical study procedures.

10.12 Data Generation and Analysis 
A system of computerized data va lidation checks will be impleme nted and applied to the 
database on an ongoing basis. Query  reports pertaining to data omissions and discrepancies 
will be forwarded to the clini cal Investigator and the Sponsor for resolution. The study 
database will be updated by [CONTACT_510377], in accordance with the 
resolved query reports. All chan ges to the study database will be documented. 
Data will be checked per CRO’s SOP s. The database will be locked, and a biostatistician will 
complete the analyses of the data in accordance with the SAP. 10.13 Retention of Data 
The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all  records relate d to the study in 
compliance with ICH GCP Guidelines E6 (R2) sections 4.9.4 and 4.9.5, and appliable local

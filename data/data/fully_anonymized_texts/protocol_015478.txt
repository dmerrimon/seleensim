 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This is an investigator -initiated, single -arm, open -label trial of letermovir treatment for patients 
with documented cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or CMV disease that is refractory or 
resistant to FDA -approved treatments and/or who have baseline organ dysfunctio n 
(myelosuppression or renal dysfunction) for which treatment with available antiviral agents 
would likely cause further dysfunction and increased risk of dialysis or death. We plan to enroll 
up to 32 immunocompromised patients including hematopoietic -cell (HCT) and solid -organ 
(SOT) transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735349] (see section 3).  
 
CMV infection is defined as the detection of CMV nucleic acids by [CONTACT_940] 
(PCR) or other molecular methods in blood or plasma in immunocomp romised patients at risk of 
CMV disease. CMV disease is defined as end -organ involvement with concurrent organ -specific 
clinical symptoms caused by [CONTACT_735384]. The 
criteria of Ljungman and colleagues (CID 2017)  will be used to classify CMV disease.  
 
Patients will receive letermovir treatment for up to 12 weeks with optional additional 12 weeks 
of treatment for secondary prophylaxis if clinically indicated.  
 
Clinical assessments and CMV viral load (VL) will be me asured at each study visit. Samples will 
also be collected for CMV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_735350].  
 
While on treatment, patients will be assessed weekly from Week 1 through Week 6, every other 
week from Week 8 through Week 12, and if necessary,  once per month at Weeks 16, 20, and 24.  
 
Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed for 12 weeks (with study visits at 1, 4, 
8, and 12 weeks after discontinuation).  
 
The study calendar (Section 10) provides detail of study visits and procedures.

dysfunction for which tr eatment with available CMV treatments are either ineffective or will 
likely worsen organ dysfunction.  
 
1.3 Secondary  Objectives  
 
• To describe kinetics of viral clearance and potential emergence of letermovir -resistant CMV 
virus in patients treated in this  setting. 
• Overall  survival

 • CMV progression -free survival: time from study enrollment to CMV progression or  death 
whichever occurs  first 
• Characterize pharmacokinetics of letermovir in adolescent  patients  
 
1.4 Exploratory  Objectives  
 
• To longitudinally describe CMV -specific CD4 and CD8 T -cell levels in patients with CMV 
infection or disease in this  trial 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease(s)  
 
CMV remains the most common viral infection in transplantation and in other patients who are 
immunocompro mised.[ADDRESS_1004755] effects of 
CMV include an increased risk of opportunistic infections and metabolic derangements.3 
 
CMV disease (consisting of CMV end -organ disease and CMV syndrome) is associated with 
increased morbidity, mortality, as well as poor outcomes following SOT and HCT.4,[ADDRESS_1004756] been effectiv e in reducing the burden of CMV 
disease, but infections continue to occur after prophylaxis is discontinued and available  antivirals 
to treat CMV frequently cause organ toxicity (myelosuppression with ganciclovir, renal toxicity 
with foscarnet and cidofovi r), and resistance to these antivirals develops with certain frequency 
in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], making imperative the need to develop and test new antivirals for 
treatment of CMV infection and CMV  disease.  
 
The FDA approved letermovir in November [ADDRESS_1004757] 
patients who are CMV seropositive (who have evidence of CMV infection prior to HCT),7 but 
there is minimal experience on its use to treat active infection.8,9 This trial is a proof -of-concept 
study to address the feasibil ity of using letermovir for treatment of active CMV infection.  
Letermovir use for treatment of active CMV infection and its use in SOT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735351] -label use.  
DF/HCC Protocol  #:18-348 
Protocol Version Date: March 31, 2021

 2.2 IND Agent  
 
Letermovir is an anti-CMV agent that recently received FDA approval for CMV prophylaxis in 
CMV seropositive, allogeneic hematopoietic -cell transplantation (HCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].7 Letermovir 
inhibits the viral terminase complex (UL51/UL56/UL89),10–[ADDRESS_1004758] -transplant period 
(within [ADDRESS_1004759] -transplant) through Week [ADDRESS_1004760] -transplant (Day +100) and were followed 
for an additional [ADDRESS_1004761] ions, is not as effective as 
ganciclovir or foscarnet, and is nephrotoxic.15 
 
Given letermovir’s outstanding safety profile, especially its lack of myelosuppression or 
nephrotoxicity, and the efficacy results of the phase 3 prophylaxis trial, many clinicia ns will be 
inclined to start using letermovir for treatment of active CMV infections and CMV disease even 
though the drug lacks approval for this indication. There are very limited data regarding 
letermovir’s activity during active CMV infection. Stoelben and colleagues reported a phase 2 
trial where 40mg or 80mg twice -daily of letermovir were effective in preemptively treating 
CMV viremia in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (67% were receiving concomitant cyclosporine).9 
Kaul and colleagues reported that a pati ent with multidrug -resistant CMV disease was 
successfully treated with letermovir 240mg/day after failing multiple previous treatments.[ADDRESS_1004762] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_735352] 70 
patients who had detectabl e CMV DNA at the time of randomization. Although not included in 
the main analysis of the trial, the 48 patients who received letermovir with detectable CMV at 
baseline were less likely than 22 patients on placebo to develop progressive infection requiring  
DF/HCC Protocol  #:18-348 
Protocol Version Date: March 31, [ADDRESS_1004763] letermovir’s ability to treat active CMV infection 
and CMV disease. We propose that treatment be studied initially in a proof -of-concept, open - 
label trial in patients who lack effective therapeutic options and in those with baseline organ 
dysfunction where currently available treatments would likely lead to poor clinical outcomes 
such irreversible kidney toxicity or severe myelosuppression. These patients would thus mos t 
likely benefit from letermovir treatment. The data generated will inform future development 
programs for CMV treatment with letermovir and will likely help patients in this situation.

Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.  
 
 
4. REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of any protocol -specific therapy or 
intervention. Any participant not registered to the protocol befor e protocol -specific therapy or 
intervention begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol -specific therapy and/or intervention. 
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal 
Investigator (PI). If the subject does not receive protocol therapy follow ing registration, the 
subject must be taken off -study in the CTMS (OnCore) with an appropriate date and reason 
entered. Protocol therapy will begin within [ADDRESS_1004769] 
procedures set forth by [CONTACT_375085] -Farber Cancer Institute’s Office of Data Quality will be followed.  
 
4.1 Registration Process for DF/HCC  Institutions

 5. TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
5.1 Treatment  Regimen  
 
Letermovir will be administered daily for up to 12 weeks, with the optional additional 12 weeks 
of treatment for secondary prophylaxis if clinically indicated. Treatment will be administered on 
an inpatient or outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in 
Section 7. No dose modifications will be permitted. No investigati onal or commercial agents or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282570]'s CMV infection or disease.  
 
Dosing for letermovir will be 480 mg PO/IV daily for patients not receiving concomitant 
cyclos porine. The dose is decreased to 240 mg PO/IV daily for patients receiving concomitant 
cyclosporine.18 
 
Given that the half -life of letermovir is ≤24 hours, a second dose on day 1 of treatment (~12 
hours apart) will be administered as a loading dose to pat ients who are ≥[ADDRESS_1004770] dose and that the exposure with 2 doses of 
letermovir 480 mg 12 hours apart is within the safety margin  for participants who are ≥ 40 kg. 
Given that this protocol is enrolling patients with active CMV infection (i.e. not being 
administered for prophylaxis which is the approved indication) and it is desirable to reach steady 
state exposure as soon as possibl e to avoid the emergence of viral resistance, it is reasonable to 
test a loading dose in the context of treatment of active infection in this study. For participants 
who are between 30 -39 kg, no loading dose is necessary given the exposures are predicted t o be 
higher already due to lighter weight.  
 
Letermovir will be provided PO or IV as needed.  
 
If dosed with the oral formulation while outpatient, the participant will be requested to maintain 
a medication diary of each dose of medication. (See Appendix C) The medication diary will be 
reviewed during each study visit.  
 
5.2 Agent  Administration  
 
As applicable, describe in detail the following parameters for each agent used as part of the

 5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care  Guidelines  
 
Patients who are receiving concomitant cyclosporine will receive 240 mg of letermovir per 
day owing to a drug –drug interaction that is mediated by [CONTACT_735388]1B1 and OATP1B3.  
 
Because letermovir is a weak -to-moderate inhib itor of cytochrome P -450 3A (CYP3A) and a 
weak -to-moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes (encoding cytochrome P -450, 
family 2, subfamily C, polypeptides 9 and 19, respectively), the case report form must capture 
the concurrent use of all other drug s, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The 
Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_505692]450 isoenzymes.  
 
Appendix D  presents guidelines for identifying m edications/substances that could potentially 
interact with letermovir.  
 
Given the lack of pediatric experience for the use of letermovir, the study will hold enrollment 
for additional pediatric patients (<18 years -old) after [ADDRESS_1004772] been enrolled to 
assess their letermovir pharmacokinetic profiles and assure letermovir exposures are adequate 
from an efficacy and safety perspective. Treatment dosing may be adjusted depending on results 
of these analysis. For example, if letermovir blood lev els are below the efficacy targets as 
determined in the adult phase III trial, the dose will be increased to achieve efficacy targets, and 
enrollment will resume with this new dose after obtaining permission form the IRB and FDA.  
 
With an estimated accrual  rate of 5 patients per month and a total duration of follow -up of 6 
months from enrollment, we expected to finish the study within 1 year from trial start.  
 
5.4 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol  Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance.  
 
Patient -level treatment response milestones:  
Patients will be required to achieve minimum virologic and clinical response milestones for 
treatment to continue.  
 
The CMV virological respon se milestones16 for patients without  CMV disease are defined as:  
1) Any decrease in CMV DNA from baseline (week 0), measured on week  3 
2) A ≥2 log decreased from baseline, or an undetectable CMV DNA, on week  6. 
 
The clinical response milestones for patients with CMV disease are defined as:  
1) Stabilization of clinical disease by [CONTACT_5875] 3 (i.e., no worsening signs or symptoms 
compared to week 1) as assessed by [CONTACT_735389] 
2) Improvement or resolution of clinical disease by [CONTACT_5875] 6 as judged by [CONTACT_1697] (i .e., 
improvement in signs and symptoms of affected organs [resolution of diarrhea, 
pneumonia, hepatitis, retinitis,  etc.])  
DF/HCC Protocol  #:18-348 
Protocol Version Date: March 31, 2021  
Page 15  
  
Patients who do not meet the response milestones should discontinue letermovir treatment. If 
there are no other treatments available to a particular patient (because of known multidrug 
antiviral resistance), patients with stable CMV disease or CMV viremia that has not reached the 
virologic milestones could continue treatment.  
 
In the absence of treatment interruptions due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 12 
weeks of treatment, followed by [CONTACT_33018] 12 weeks of secondary prophylaxis, or un til one of 
the following criteria applies:  
 
Patient -level safety events that require holding or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_735356]  
• Drug -induced liver injury (DILI) meeting Hy’s law criteria without alternative 
explanation. Patients with confirmed liver GVHD, for example,  will be allowed  to 
continue treatment, or if patients have abnormal LFTs due to CMV  hepatitis.  
 
• Any CTCAE grade 4 adverse event(s) with no alternative explanation whether 
attributable to drug or  not 
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the  oral

• Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol  therapy  
 
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in  the judgment of the treating  investigator  
 
Participants will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of these criteria apply. The 
reason for removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participant is removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
 
When a participant is removed from protocol therapy and/or is off study, the relevant Off - 
Treatment/Off -Study information will be updated in OnCore.  
 
Study -level stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_735357] -level stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_735358] 13.3. If the number of responses is not met 
after the first stage or safety is compromised, then the trial will be placed on hold and available 
data analyzed to decide whether to terminate the study early or consider a higher dose of 
letermovir for treatment.  
 
Given the lack of pediatric experience for the use of letermovir, the study will hold enrollment 
for additional pediatric patients (<18 years -old) after [ADDRESS_1004773] been enro lled to 
assess their letermovir pharmacokinetic profiles and assure letermovir exposures are adequate 
from an efficacy and safety perspective.

 5.5 Duration of Follow Up  
 
While on treatment, patients will be assessed weekly from Week 1 through Week 6, every other 
week from Week 8 through Week 12, and if necessary, once per month at Weeks 16, 20, and 24.  
 
 
Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed for 12 weeks (at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks 
after discontinuation).  
 
Clinical assessments and CMV VL will be measured at each visit. Participants removed from 
protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
5.6 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off  Study 
 
Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• Lost to  follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data  submission  
• Death  
 
For patients who discontinue from active study participation we will request the possibility of 
passive  follow up for survival and CMV events by [CONTACT_559699].  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF). In addition, the study team will ensure Of f 
Treatment/Off Study information is updated in OnCore in accordance with DF/HCC policy 
REGIST -101.

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
9.1 Biomarker Studies:  N/A 
 
9.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies:  
 
An additional whole blood sample will be collected for monthly measurements of CMV -specific 
CD4 and CD8 T -cell levels using the Viracor CMV T Cell Immunity Panel 
(https://www.vira cor-eurofins.com/test -menu/[ZIP_CODE] -cmv-t-cell-immunity -panel/). This panel 
measures the relative strength of T cell responses to CMV sp ecific antigens. It evaluates and 
reports the activity of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses independently. Effective T cell immunity  
against CMV is a factor in controlling CMV viral latency and a prospective characterization of T 
cell responses has not been per formed in this patient population.

 9.3 Special  Studies:  
 
9.3.1 CMV Resistance  variants  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Outcome Measure: The presence of CMV isolates that are resistant to  letermovir  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of Assessment: Deep sequencing will be done on plasma DNA samples 
collected at the time of study assessments. Per usual practice, BWH lab keeps 
additional aliquots of samples collected for CMV testing, which is done at  clinic 
visits as part of standard of care. Patients who have recurrent viremia while on 
letermovir trea tment will have these aliquots tested for resistance variants. No 
additional specimens will be  collected.  
Resistance to letermovir will be assessed by [CONTACT_735390] 51, UL56 and UL89. Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_735391] -generation DNA sequencing at DDL Diagnostic  Laboratory  
B.V. (Rijswijk, The Netherlands). These samples will be submitted through  [COMPANY_006].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing of Assessment: At the end of the  study  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of Data Recording: Electroni cally captured  data 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Timing of Data Recording: After genetic assays are  complete  
 
 
10. STUDY  CALENDAR  
 
Patients will receive letermovir treatment for up to 12 weeks with the option of an additional 12 
weeks of treatment for secondary prophylaxis if clinically i ndicated.  
 
While on treatment, patients will be assessed weekly from Week 1 through Week 6, every other 
week from Week 8 through Week 12, and if necessary, once per month on Week 16, 20, and 24.  
 
Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed for 12 weeks (at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks 
after discontinuation).  
 
Clinical assessments and CMV VL will be measured at each visit. (See section 10.1 for details). 
Genotypic evaluations will be done retrospectively based from samples collected.  
 
Pre-study evaluations are to be conducted within [ADDRESS_1004788] be performed prior to administration of any study agent. Study assessments 
will be performed weekly of the protocol -specified date, unless otherwise noted. Weekly 
windows will be Monday through Friday independent of the day of the week letermovir is started 
on Week 1.

10.1 CMV Viral Load  Assessment  
 
Plasma CMV testing for study purposes will be obtained at each study visit. Testing will be done 
at Viracor Eurofins who will serve as the central laboratory for the trial. Quantita tive testing of 
CMV in plasma will be done using the COBAS Amplicor/COBAS Taqman CMV test 
(https:/ /www.vir acor-eurofins.com/test -menu/5500 -cytomeg alovirus -cmv-quantitative -pcr/).  
Specific timepoints can be found in the study calendar in section 10.0. 
 
CMV virus load testing for clinical care will be at the discretion of the treating clinicians.  Local 
laboratory CMV results will be captured in the st udy database. Please see Appendix F for assay 
details.  
DF/HCC Protocol  #:18-348 
Protocol Version Date: March 31, [ADDRESS_1004790]  
 
Each patient will be required to achieve a minimum virological  and clinical response milestones 
for their treatment on study to continue.  
 
The virological response milestones are defined as:  
1) Any decrease in CMV DNA from baseline (Week 0), measured on week 3  and 
2) A ≥2 log decrease in CMV DNA from baseline, or an undete ctable CMV DNA, 
measured on week  6. 
 
For patients with clinical CMV disease, the clinical response milestones are defined  as: 
1) Stabilization of clinical disease by [CONTACT_5875] 3 (i.e. no worsening signs or  symptoms 
compared to week 1) as assessed by [CONTACT_735393] 
2) Improvement or resolution of clinical disease by [CONTACT_5875] 6 (i.e., improvement in signs and 
symptoms of affected organs [resolution of diarrhea, pneumonia, hepatitis, retinitis,  etc.])  
3) Patients with clinical CMV disease should also meet virological  response milestones 
outlined above to support the continuation of letermovir therapy. Patients who enter  the 
study based solely on documented CMV disease by [CONTACT_735394] (less t han 137  IU/mL).  
4) Patients who are enrolled with CMV retinitis will be considered failures if they require 
additional intravitreal therapy after study week 3. Intravitreal therapy before this time 
will be at the discretion of the treating  ophthalmologist.  
 
 
A complete virological response is defined as two consecutive CMV DNA levels <137 IU/mL in 
the central laboratory.  
 
CMV recurrence is defined as plasma CMV DNA ≥137 IU/mL in ≥2 consecutive samples in the 
central laboratory in a patient who had previously achieved plasma CMV DNA <137 IU/mL.  
 
Patients will be considered to have experienced virological failure if CMV virus load is 
unchanged or higher from baseline when measured on week 3. if the decline in CMV DNA is <[ADDRESS_1004791].

13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1004793] letermovir’s ability to tre at active CMV 
infection and CMV disease in patients who lack effective therapeutic options and in those with 
baseline organ dysfunction where currently available treatments would likely lead to poor 
clinical outcomes such as irreversible kidney toxicity or  severe myelosuppression. These  patients 
would thus most likely benefit from letermovir treatment. The data generated will inform future 
development programs for CMV treatment with letermovir and will likely help patients in  this

 situation.  
 
13.2 Endpoints  
 
13.2.1  Primary  Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is complete virological response assessed on week 6 of treatment for 
patients with CMV infection or clinical response with concurrent virological response assessed 
by [CONTACT_5875] 6 for patients with CMV disease. ( See Section 11 for definitions).  
 
13.2.2  Secondary  Endpoints  
 
• Proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful treatment response to  letermovir 
treatment, defined as a virological  response and a concomitant clinical response in 
patients with CMV disease by [CONTACT_10585] 6 of  treatment.  
• Proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful treatment response to  letermovir 
treatment, defined as a virological response and a concomitant clinical response in 
patients with CMV disease by [CONTACT_10585] 3 of  treatment.  
• Proportion of patients with complete virological and clinical response at study week  12 
independent of duration of letermovir  treatment.  
• Proportion of patients with complete virological and clinical response at study week  24 
independent of duration of letermovir  treatment.  
• Frequency and time to recurrent CMV viremia in patients who have virological  response 
to letermovir  treatment  
• Overall  survival  
• CMV progression -free survival  
• Kinetics of viral clearance and potential emergence of letermovir -resistant CMV virus in 
patients treated in this  setting.  
 
13.3 Sample Size/Power Calculation  
 
We plan to enroll 32 evaluable patients. Based on a recent phase 2 trial of maribavir in the 
comparable patient population,16 the proposed treatment will be regarded as efficacious in 
treating refractory and resistant CMV if the success rate is 60% or higher and inefficacious if the 
success rate is 35% or l ower. Here, response refers to complete virological response for CMV 
infection and clinical response with concurrent virological response for CMV disease (primary 
endpoint). With the sample size 32, there will be 91% power to detect a 25% difference in 
response rate.  
 
The study is a two -stage design with an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_735370]. In the first stage, 12 evaluable patients will be accrued. Of these 12, 
if 4 or fewer patients respond, then the stu dy will be terminated early for lack of efficacy. If, 
however, 5 or more patients respond, then additional 20 patients will be accrued. After the 
second stage, if 15 or more patients in a total of 32 respond, the proposed treatment will be 
considered effic acious. Conversely, if 14 or fewer patients respond, the proposed treatment will  
DF/HCC Protocol  #:18-348 
Protocol Version Date: March 31, 2021  
Page 32  
 be regarded as inefficacious and the treatment will not be considered further. If 15 out of 32 
patients respond, the 95% confidence interval for the response rat e is (30%, 68%). This 
confidence interval is calculated based on the Atkinson and Brown method (Biometric, 1985).  
 
With this design, the probability of concluding the proposed treatment is efficacious is 0.91 if the 
true but unknown response rate is 60% an d 0.095 if the true rate is 35%. The probability of early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] 0.58 if the rate is 35% and 0.057 if the rate is 60%. This decision rule is calculated 
using an exact binomial distribution. Patients will be considered unevaluable for the primary 
endpo int if they are removed from the study due to death that is unrelated to the proposed 
treatment, withdrawal of consent or lost to follow up prior to the response assessment. These 
patients will be replaced. Table [ADDRESS_1004794] ics of this design.

Overall prob. of accepting the treatment  0.095  0.231  0.427  0.636  0.806  0.913  
 
 
13.4 Monitoring Treatment Related  Toxicity  
 
Continuous monitoring on treatment related toxicity will be conducted for all patients who 
receive any amount of the study drug. Data safety and monitoring will be performed per Dana - 
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DF/HC C DSMC) 
guidelines. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for consultation with the DF/HCC DSMC 
for additional review, and are not regarded as formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_735371].  
 
The treatment related toxic ities would include the following events that occurring on therapy.  
 
• Drug -induced liver injury (DILI) meeting Hy’s law criteria without  alternative 
explanation.  
• Any CTCAE grade 4 adverse event(s) potentially related to letermovir, with no 
alternative  expla nation.  
 
In the previous studies of letermovir16, letermovir was well tolerated. Based on this information, 
we project the treatment related toxicity rate <=15%. In this study, we will monitor DILI and 
grade [ADDRESS_1004795] 10 patients, if 2 
or more patients experience DILI and/or if 3 or more patients experience grade 4 or higher 
treatment related adverse events, then the accrual will be halted and the DF/HCC DSMC will be 
consulted. With this design, the probability of halting accrual is 0.15 if the true but unknown 
rate of DILI (p1) is 5% and the true but unknown rate of grade 4 or higher treatment related 
adverse events (p2) is 10%; the probability of halting accrual is 0.63 if these rates ar e 15% and 
20%, respectively. Table 2 shows probabilities of halting accrual under various levels of p1  and

to the next 10  patients.  
 
13.5 Accrual  
 
Based on the current practice, the projected accrual rate will be 3 -4 patients per month. 
Conservatively extrapolating this projection, we anticipate that the accrual will complete 
approximately in one year.

Letermovir is a substrate of organic anion -transporting polypeptide 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3) 
transporters. Co -administration of letermovir with drugs that are inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 
transporters may result in increases in letermovir plasma conc entrations (Table).  
 
Potential for letermovir to affect other drugs  
Co-administration of letermovir with midazolam results in increased midazolam plasma 
concentrations,  indicating  that letermovir  is a moderate  inhibitor  of CYP3A.  Co-administration  of 
letermovir with drugs that are CYP3A substrates may result in clinically relevant increases in the 
plasma concentrations of co -administered CYP3A substrates (Table).  
 
Letermovir  is an inhibitor  of OATP1B1/3  transporters.  Co-administration  of letermovir  with drugs 
that are substrates  of OATP1B1/3  transporters  may result  in a clinically  relevant  increase  in plasma 
concentrations of co -administered OATP1B1/3 substrates  (Table).  
 
The magnitude of CYP3A -and OATP1B1/3 -mediated drug interactions on co-administered 
drugs may be different when letermovir is co -administered with cyclosporine. See the

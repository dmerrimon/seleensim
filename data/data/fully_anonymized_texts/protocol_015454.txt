Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
The study has encountered unexpected barriers and limitations in the recruitment of participants.
In view of the challenges,  the non-inferiority assessment will be limited to the groups receiving
the standard dose only (Groups 1 and 2) . The non-inferiority assessment of the high-dose (Groups
3 and 4)  will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint due to a decrease in the sample size and a
descriptive analysis will be performed instead.
As the study considered a timeframe of [ADDRESS_1259224] the changes
described above.

2-sided alpha for the non-inferiority (NI) analysis
was modified to 5%,  the CIs were adjusted to 95%,
and the sample size was modified accordingly.It is unlikely that enough
participants receiving the high-dose
influenza vaccine will be recruited
to power the assessment for the
primary analysis.
The NI assessment will be limited
to the standard-dose groups.

An exploratory objective was added to assess the 
correlation between the binding antibody (ELISA)  
titers and neutralizing antibody (VNA)  titers to
SARS-CoV-2,  in a subset of participants at
selected timepoints.
Two exploratory objectives were added: 
1. To assess humoral responses to Ad26.COV2.S
and influenza vaccine based on the previous history
of COVID-19 vaccination at entry.
2. To explore the humoral responses to
Ad26.COV2.S and influenza vaccine based on the

9.2 Sample Size 
Determination The cap on 60% of participants ≤64 years of age 
was replaced with language that allows for greater 
flexibility in the enrollment of patients ≤64 years 
of age,  and sample sizes were adjusted accordingly. Difficulty in recruitment of
participants 65 years of age and
older due to new COVID-19
booster recommendations and
influenza vaccine campaigns will
compromise the feasibility and will
not allow study endpoints to be

Exclusion criterion #7 was deleted. 
Exclusion criterion #12 was modified to indicate 
that planning to receive a licensed/registered 
SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1259228] study vaccination is not exclusionary. 
Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1259229] result should be obtained prior

1.1. Synopsis
A Randomized,  Double-blind,  Phase 3 Study to Evaluate Safety,  Reactogenicity,  and Immunogenicity of
Co-administration of Ad26.COV2.S and Influenza Vaccines in Healthy Adults 18 Years of Age and Older.
Ad26.COV2.S (also known as VAC31518,  JNJ-78436735)  is a monovalent vaccine composed of a
recombinant,  replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26)  vector,  constructed to encode the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]
(S) protein derived from a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Wuhan,  2019,  whole-genome sequence
NC 045512,  referred to as the original strain) ,  stabilized in its prefusion conformation.
The study aims to assess the safety, reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine
co-administered with a quadrivalent standard-dose or high-dose seasonal influenza vaccine compared to
administration of each vaccine separatelyto explore whether Ad26.COV2.S and the influenza vaccines can
be administered concomitantly.
The primary objective (for the NI assessment)  will be evaluated in approximately [ADDRESS_1259246]-dose influenza vaccine. In a cohort of participants
aged 65 and above,  the co-administration of the Ad26.COV2.S and the seasonal quadrivalent high-dose
influenza vaccine will be assesseddescriptively. In another cohort of COVID-19 vaccine-naïve individuals,
immune responses will be evaluated descriptively.

Hy
potheses
The primary hypotheses of this study are:
The concomitant administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent influenza
vaccine ( standard-dose )  is non-inferior than the administration of the seasonal quadrivalent influenza
vaccine ( standard-dose )  alone as measured by [CONTACT_898474] 4 influenza vaccine strains at 28
days after the administration of a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine,
AND
The concomitant administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent influenza
vaccine ( standard-dose )  is non-inferior than the administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine alone as
measured by S-ELISA antibody titers at 28 days after the administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.
For the high-dose groups,  no formal hypothesis testing is planned.
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_413402].
OVERALL DESIGN
This is a randomized,  double-blind,  parallel,  multicenter,  interventional study in healthy (including stable
comorbidities)  adults ≥18 years of age. In this study,  the safety,  reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity of
Ad26.COV2.S co-administered with an influenza vaccine will be evaluated.
Approximately 1, 100 participants will be randomized in parallel in this study. Participants aged ≥65 will be
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 groups. Participants aged ≤64 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
1 of 2 groups (Group 1 or Group 2) . Efforts will be made to ensure good representation in terms of race,
gender,and ethnicity.

Ad26.COV2.S will be supplied at a concentration of 1×1011 vp/mL in single-use vials,  with an extractable
volume of 0.5 mL,  and dosed at 5×1010 vp. Placebo (0.9% NaCl)  will be supplied in single-use vials.
The seasonal influenza vaccines to be used in this study are Afluria Quadrivalent ( standard-dose )  and
Fluzone HD Quadrivalent ( high-dose )  or equivalent formulated for the 2021-2022 influenza season:
 Afluria Quadrivalent ( standard-dose )  is a suspension for intramuscular (IM) injection supplied in a
0.5mL single-dose prefilled syringe. Each dose of Afluria Quadrivalent contains 60 µg of
hemagglutinin (HA) : 15 µg of each of 4 influenza strains (2 influenza A strains and 2 influenza B
strains) . For details,  refer to the Afluria Quadrivalent package insert.
 Fluzone HD Quadrivalent ( high-dose )  is a suspension for IM injection supplied in a 0.7mL single-dose
prefilled syringe. Each dose of Fluzone HD Quadrivalent contains 240 µg of HA: 60 µg of each of 4
influenza strains (2 influenza A strains and 2 influenza B strains) . For details,  refer to the Fluzone HD
Quadrivalent package insert.
Study vaccines will be administered by [CONTACT_327976]. On Day 1,  each participant
will receive 2 IM injections. Each injection should be administered in opposite arms. It is recommended to
use the right arm for the seasonal influenza vaccine on Day 1 and the left arm for the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine
or placebo on Days 1 and 29.
On Day 29,  each participant will receive 1 IM injection,  preferably into the deltoid muscle of the
non-dominant upper arm.
If an injection cannot be given in the deltoids due to a medical or other contraindication (for example,
tattooed upper arms rendering it difficult to assess site reactogenicity) ,  use alternative locations such as the
hip,  thigh,  or buttocks (to be avoided in overweight participants) . When selecting an alternative location,
the participant’s ability to assess injection site events should be considered.
In all circumstances,  IM injections in other locations than the upper arm are not considered protocol
deviations.
IMMUNOGENICITY EVALUATIONS
Venous blood samples will be collected for assessment of humoral immune responses. Sample volumes

Ad26.COV2.S (also known as VAC31518,  JNJ-78436735) is a monovalent vaccine composed of
a recombinant,  replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26)  vector,  constructed to
encode the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein derived from a severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507]-2
(SARS-CoV-2)  clinical isolate (Wuhan,  2019,  whole-genome sequence NC_045512,  referred to as

Adenoviral-vectored Vaccines
Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors are attractive candidates for expression
of foreign genes for a number of reasons. The adenoviral genome is well characterized and
comparatively easy to manipulate. Adenoviruses exhibit broad tropi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], infecting a variety of
dividing and non-dividing cells. The adenoviral vaccine (AdVac®) vector platform,  developed by
[CONTACT_524898].V. (nowJanssenVaccines & PreventionB.V.)allows forhigh-yieldproduction
of replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors,  eg,  Ad26,  with desired inserts. The adenovirus E1
regionis deletedto renderthe vectorreplication-incompetentandcreate space fortransgenes,with
viral replication taking place in cells that complement for the E1 deletion in the virus genome.
Ad26 has been selected as a potential vaccine vector because there is substantial nonclinical and
clinical experience with Ad26-based vaccines that demonstrate their capacity to elicit strong
humoral and cellular immune responses and their acceptable safety profile, irrespective of the
antigen transgene (see also Section 2.3.1) .

Ad26.COV2.S Candidate Vaccine
The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been developed in response to the global outbreak of COVID-19
caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2. In response to the public health emergency caused by [CONTACT_898476]-CoV-2 pandemic,  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA)  from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  on 27February 2021 for emergency use in
the [LOCATION_002] (FDA2021 ) ,  and Conditional Marketing Authorization approval by [CONTACT_898477] (EMA)  on 11 March 2021 for emergency use within the European Union (EU) .
On 12 March 2021,  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was recommended for emergency use under the
World Health Organization (WHO)  Emergency Use Listing Procedure.
COVID-19 Disease Burden
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that has spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_898454] 2019. The WHO declared that the outbreak
constituted a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and declared
the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020 ( WHO 2020 ; WHO 2020a ) . As of [ADDRESS_1259272] been reported since the start of the outbreak
(Johns Hopkins CSSE 2021 ) . Within the EU/European Economic Area (EEA)  countries,  as of
11 July 2021,  a total of 33, 270, 049 cases of COVID-19 and 740, 809 COVID-19-related deaths
were reported ( ECDC 2021 ) .
Influenza Disease Burden
Influenza is a worldwide public health problem,  responsible for significant morbidity and
mortality,  as well as a significant resource burden on countries. In a typi[INVESTIGATOR_114044],  about 3 to
5 million cases of severe influenza illness and about 290, 000 to 650, 000 deaths are estimated to
occur worldwide ( WHO 2018 ) . In the US,  more than 200, 000 patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153620] a result

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_230225] 15 seasons was estimated to be 309 per 100, 000 in individuals 65 years
and older ( Zhou 2012) . Notably,  the incidence of pneumonia and influenza hospi[INVESTIGATOR_898455],  with a dramatic increase seen above the age of [ADDRESS_1259273] rates of influenza-associated primary
respi[INVESTIGATOR_898456],  ie,  1, 194.9 per 100, 000 persons. ( Bartozsko 2019 )
Comorbidities including chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease were found to be
important predictors of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. There was a 3-fold increase in the risk of death among
elderly people compared with non-elderly people. Elderly participants also had a higher risk of
admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. ( Mertz 2013 )
Ad26.COV2.S Co-administration With Influenza Vaccines
There is currently no available data for the co-administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine with
other vaccines. However,  during the COVID-[ADDRESS_1259274] vulnerable populations at risk for severe illness,  the
healthcare system,  and other critical infrastructure.
According to the Centers of disease control and prevention (CDC) ,  efforts to reduce the spread of
COVID-19,  such as stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders,  have led to decreased use of routine
preventive medical services,  including immunization services. Ensuring that people continue or
start getting routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for protecting people
and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks,  including influenza
(CDC 2020 ) . This recommendation is particularly relevant for individuals who are more
susceptible to respi[INVESTIGATOR_898457].
It is recognized that older adults and patients with comorbidities are at greater risk of COVID-19
infection and that they are also more likely to develop severe illness after infection (Perrotta 2020 ;
CDC 2020 ) . Annual influenza vaccination is highly encouraged especially during the ongoing
COVID-[ADDRESS_1259275] COVID-19,  vaccination
may reduce the burden of influenza disease on the health care system,  including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],
severe outcomes, and deaths ( Huang 2021) . There is an urgent unmet medical need for
co-administration of prophylactic vaccines for these [ADDRESS_1259276] respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748].
It was recently reported,  that vaccine efficacy appeared to be preserved when co-administrating
the COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 with an influenza vaccine in participants 18 to <65 years
of age,and no early safety concerns were observed ( Toback 2021 ) .
2.1. Study Rationale
The study aims to assess the safety, reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S
vaccine co-administered with a quadrivalent standard-dose or high-dose seasonal influenza
vaccine compared to administration of each vaccine separately to explore whether Ad26.COV2.S

It is unknown whether the reactogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S can be influenced by[CONTACT_3252]-administration
with another vaccine. In certain cases,  it has been observed that vaccine co-administration can
increase systemic reactogenicity ( Sadoff2020 ) . However,  extensive experience with
non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are
similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone
(CDC 2021c ) . Vaccine’s co-administration is generally a safe and effective practice in which the
benefits outweigh the risks ( Brosio 2018 ) .
The seasonal influenza vaccines that will be used in this study are a quadrivalent high-dose
influenza vaccine approved for use in persons ≥[ADDRESS_1259278]-dose
influenza vaccine approved for use in persons ≥18years of age. These vaccines are indicated for
active immunization for prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B
viruses contained in the vaccine. For more details,  refer to Section 6.1.
2.2. Background
Nonclinical Pharmacology
Nonclinical pharmacology of Ad26.COV2.S was evaluated in murine,  rabbit,  Syrian hamster,
and non-human primate (NHP)  animal models for immunogenicity,  including assessment of
immunological parameters relevant to the theoretical risk of vaccine-associated enhanced
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (VAERD) . In addition,  vaccine efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S including lung
histopathology assessment was evaluated in Syrian hamsters and NHPs. Details are provided in
the IB ( IB Ad26.COV2.S 2021 ) .
Nonclinical Safety
Biodistribution
Ad26 viral vectors (Ad26-based HIV vaccine Ad26.ENVA.01 and Ad26-based RSV vaccine
Ad26.RSV.preF)  showed a similar pattern of biodistribution and clearance,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_898458] (IM)  route at full human dose
levels in the rabbit. Therefore,  the biodistribution results are considered sufficient to inform on the
biodistribution profile of Ad26.COV2.S,  for which the same (replication-incompetent)  Ad26
vector backbone is used. The target organs or tissues identified in the Ad26.COV2.S toxicology
study (ie,  injection site,  [draining] lymph nodes, and spleen)  are consistent with the tissues that
tested mostly positive for Ad26 DNA in the biodistribution studies for the Ad26 platform. Details
are provided in the IB ( IB Ad26.COV2.S 2021 ) .

In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance study in
rabbits,  Ad26.COV2.S was well tolerated when administered on 3 occasions over 4 weeks (ie,
every 2 weeks)  at 1×1011 virus particles (vp) /dose. The observed changes were related to a
normal,  anticipated (local and systemic)  immunologic response to vaccination. Overall,  the
findings were considered non-adverse and were partially or completely reversible after a 3-week
treatment-free period. Details are provided in the IB ( IB Ad26.COV2.S 2021) .
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology
There was no harmful effect of Ad26.COV2.S concerning female reproductive toxicity and
fertility as assessed in a combined embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development toxicity study
in the rabbit. No adverse effects were observed on reproductive performance,  fertility,  ovarian and
uterine examinations,  or parturition. In addition,  there was no adverse effect of vaccination on fetal
body weights,  external,  visceral and skeletal evaluations,  or on postnatal development of the
offspring. The parental females as well as their fetuses and offspring exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S
protein-specific antibody titers,  indicating that maternal antibodies were transferred to the fetuses
during gestation. Details are provided in the IB ( IB Ad26.COV2.S 2021) .
Clinical Studies
At the time of protocol writing,  Phase 1/2a (COV1001,  COV1002)  and Phase 2a (COV2001)
clinical studies to assess the safety,  reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S,  as well
as Phase 3 (COV3001,  COV3009,  COV3003)  clinical studies to assess the efficacy of
Ad26.COV2.S in the prevention of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19
in adults are ongoing and data from interim analyses from these studies,  except COV3009,  are
available.
Ef f icacy
A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×[ADDRESS_1259279] COVID-19 in adults ≥18 years of

Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp is currently under evaluation in the ongoing Phase 3 study COV3009.
Supportive safety information (adverse events [AEs],  clinical laboratory abnormalities,  vital signs,
and physical examination findings)  is available from the interim analysis of the Phase 1 and 2
studies COV1001,  COV1002,  and COV2001. In COV2001,  Ad26.COV2.S is being evaluated at
a range of doses and intervals (1.25×1010vp,  2.5×1010vp,  5×1010vp,  and 1×1011vp)  in adolescents
12 to 17 years of age,  adults 18 to 55 years of age,and 65 years of age.
Ad26.COV2.S has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile when administered as a
single-dose or as a 2-dose regimen in adults 18 years of age,  including adults 60 years of age.
No significant safety issues were identified. In general,  a lower reactogenicity profile was observed
in older adults compared to younger adults.
Overall,  up to 22 January 2021,  no safety concerns were identified after vaccination with
Ad26.COV2.S as a single-dose or 2-dose vaccine regimen at dose levels up to 1×1011 vp. There
was a trend towards a decrease in the frequency of solicited local and systemic adverse events
(AEs)(reactogenicity)  with a decreasing dose level of Ad26.COV2.S (from 1×1011 vp to 2.5×1010
vp) . Reactogenicity was demonstrated to be transient and most solicited AEs,  including pyrexia,
generally resolved in [ADDRESS_1259282] been reported in the supportive Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies
COV1001,  COV1002,and COV2001. In the COV3001 study,  at the time of the primary analysis,
0.4% participants in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 0.6% participants in the placebo group reported
1 or more serious adverse events (SAEs) . Ten (<0.1%)  participants reported SAEs that were
considered to be related to the study vaccine: 7 SAEs were reported in 7 participants in the
Ad26.COV2.S group: Grade 4: Guillain-Barré syndrome and pericarditis (one of each) ;  Grade 3:
radiculitis brachial,  post-vaccination syndrome,  and Type IV hypersensitivity (one of each) ;
Grade 2: facial paralysis (Bell’s Palsy - 2 cases reported) ;  3 SAEs were reported in 2 participants
in the placebo group: Grade 4: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (one participant) ;  Grade 3: Epstein-
Barr virus infection and atrial flutter (both were reported in the same participant) . No participants
in either vaccine group (Ad26.COV2.S or placebo)  were withdrawn from the study due to AEs.
Across studies COV1001,  COV1002,  and COV2001,  2 participants reported SAEs which were
considered to be related to the study vaccine (both occurred in study COV1001) . Early
discontinuations of vaccination or the study due to (S) AEs were infrequent in all groups.
Since then,  6 cases of severe allergic reactions were reported in study COV3012 (Sisonke

cases of severe allergic reactions reported from this study identified a plausible causal relationship
between the administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and the occurrence of severe allergic
reactions including anaphylaxis.
Cases of thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia have very rarely been observed in individuals
who received Ad26.COV2.S. At the time of primary analysis of study COV3001 (Data lock point
22 January 2021) ,  one case of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia
had been reported which triggered a temporary pause in vaccinations across Ad26.COV2.S clinical
studies. One additional case of DVT with thrombocytopenia was since reported in study

context of the routine vaccination programs,  one of which had a fatal outcome. At that time,  more
than 7.9 million people had received Ad26.COV2.S in the US.
Immunogenicity
Across studies COV1001,  COV1002, and COV2001,  a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S was shown
to elicit SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in both the 18 to 55 years age group and in adults
[ADDRESS_1259284] majority of the 18 to 55 years age group and in adults 65 years of age.

Clinical Safety Experience With Ad26-based Vaccines
Safety of Ad26-vectored vaccines has been evaluated in adults in clinical studies by [CONTACT_456].
Replication-incompetent Ad26 is being used as a vector in the development of vaccines against
diseases such as malaria,  RSV,  HIV,  Zika virus,  filovirus,  and human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) ,  and
has been used in the now licensed Ebola virus vaccine (Zabdeno/Ad26.ZEBOV)  and for
emergency use authorized COVID-19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S) .
As of [ADDRESS_1259286] been administered to
more than 8 million participants. The majority of these participants are enrolled in an ongoing
immunization campaign in the US (COVID-19 Vaccine Program Campaign)  (more than
7.9 million)  and an ongoing Ebola vaccine study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
an ongoing immunization campaign in Rwanda (UMURINZI Ebola Vaccine Program campaign)
(more than 156, 000) .
Overall,  the Ad26-based vaccines were well tolerated irrespective of the antigen transgene,
without significant safety issues. Recently,  rare disorders including blood clots in combination

Sta
tus: Approved,Date: 15 February 2022Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) ,which confirmed a positive benefit-risk profile for
the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine ( MacNeil 2021 ) ,  the US CDC and the FDA,  have recommended
vaccinations with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for all adults aged 18 years and older. Healthcare
professionals should be mindful of signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or
thrombocytopenia.
Participants should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms
such as shortness of breath,  chest pain,  leg swelling,  persistent abdominal pain,  severe or persistent
headaches,  blurred vision,  and skin bruising and/or petechiae beyond the site of vaccination. The
medical treatment of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia is different from standard blood clot
treatments. Study site personnel and/or treating physicians should follow available guidelines for
the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (eg,  from the American Society of Hematology
2021, British Society of Haematology 2021 ,  and the CDC 2021 ) . The use of heparin may be
harmful and alternative treatments may be needed. Consultation with a hematologist is strongly
recommended. Management of the participant should not be delayed by [CONTACT_537195]-making of
the Janssen Adjudication Committee. Due to the possibility of the occurrence of TTS after
vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S,  additional reporting, and data collection procedures have been
included in the study for thrombotic events,  thrombocytopenia,  and TTS (see Section 8.3.6) ,  which
may facilitate diagnosis and clinical management of the event.
Heparin-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia
TTS has been found to resemble heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) ,
which is mediated by [CONTACT_524904] 4 (PF4)  that
induce Fc receptor-mediated activation of platelets and hypercoagulation ( Arepally 2021 ) . Current
evidence suggests that these 2 conditions may be linked ( Streiff 2021 ) . The exact mechanisms
remain to be investigated,but anti-PF4 antibodies are suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis
of TTS associated with vaccination.

General Risk s Related to Vaccination
In general,  intramuscular (IM) injection may cause local itching,  warmth,  pain,  tenderness,
erythema/redness,  induration,  swelling,  arm discomfort,  or bruising of the skin. Participants may
exhibit general signs and symptoms associated with IM injection of a vaccine and/or placebo,
including fever,  chills,  rash,  myalgia,  nausea/vomiting,  headache,  dizziness,  arthralgia,  general
itching,  and fatigue. These side effects will be monitored,  but are generally short-term and do not
require treatment. Instructions regarding the use of antipyretic medication can be found in
Section 6.8.
Syncope can occur in association with the administration of injectable vaccines. Syncope can be
accompanied by [CONTACT_130361]. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury. If syncope develops,
participants should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Fear of injection might lead to fainting

Ad26.COV2.S in the proposed indication,  ie,  active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused
by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2 in adults ≥18 years of age (see Section 2.2) . The overall benefit and risk balance
for individual participants is ongoing.
Vaccination with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine may provide protection against the
influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine during the influenza
season.
2.3.3 Benefit-Risk Assessment of Study Participation
Based on the available data and proposed safety measures,  the overall benefit-risk assessment for
this clinical study is considered acceptable for the following reasons:
 A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protects against moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 as early

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
This is arandomized,  double-blind,  parallel,multicenter,interventionalstudyin healthy(including
stable comorbidities) adults ≥18 years of age. In this study,  the safety,  reactogenicity,  and
immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S co-administered with an influenza vaccine will be evaluated.
Approximately 1, 100 participants will be randomized in parallel in this study. Participants aged
≥65 will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 groups. Participants aged ≤64 will be randomized
in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 groups (Group 1 or Group 2) . Efforts will be made to ensure good
representation in terms of race,  gender,and ethnicity.
Participants will receive Ad26.COV2.S and a seasonal quadrivalent ( standard-dose or high-dose )
influenza vaccine either concomitantly on Day 1 and placebo on Day 29 (co-administration
groups 1 and 3)  or a seasonal quadrivalent ( standard-dose or high-dose )  influenza vaccine and
placebo on Day 1 and Ad26.COV2.S on Day 29 (control groups 2 and 4)  (see Table 2 ) .

distribution of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1259302] received a complete primary vaccination with an authorized/licensed
COVID-19a vaccine (completed ≥[ADDRESS_1259303] study vaccination)  or be COVID-19
vaccine-naïve. Type of primary vaccination will be documented and accounted for according to
interactive web response system (IWRS)  procedures.
A diagram of the study design is provided in Section 1.2.
Study Duration
The study duration from screening until the last follow-up visit will be approximately 7-8months.
The study comprises screening on Day -28 to 1,  vaccination visits on Days 1 and 29 with a 28-day
follow-up period after each vaccination. AEs leading to withdrawal,  MAAEs,  SAEs, and AESIs
will be collected throughout the study.
If a participant is unable to complete the study(post-vaccination1) ,  but has not withdrawn consent,
an early exit visit will be conducted,  or the participant can continue with other study procedures.
The end of the study is defined as the last participant’s last visit.
Unscheduled study visits may be performed based on investigator’s clinical judgment and may
include further evaluations,  as needed.
Study Procedures
For each group,  safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_327973] (at injection site)  and
systemic AEs,  unsolicited AEs,  MAAEs,  AESIs,  and SAEs. Other safety assessments include vital
signs measurements (heart rate,  supi[INVESTIGATOR_49835],  respi[INVESTIGATOR_697],  and
body temperature)  and physical examinations at the time points indicated in the Schedule of
Activities .
After each vaccination,  participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least
15 minutes for presence of any acute reactions and solicited events. Any solicited local or systemic
AEs,  unsolicited AEs,  MAAEs,  AESIs,  SAEs,  concomitant medications,  and vital signs will be
documented by [CONTACT_3449]-site personnel following this observation period. In addition,  participants
a Th

The reporting periods of AEs,  MAAEs,  AESIs,  and SAEs,  and special reporting situations are
detailed in Section 8.3. Reporting periods for concomitant therapy are outlined in Section 6.8. At
each visit,the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-[ADDRESS_1259305]. See Section 8.3.1on the reporting periods of this event.
Blood samples will be collected for assessment of humoral immune responses at the time points
indicated in the Schedule of Activities .
Over the entire study,  the total blood volume to be collected from each participant will be
approximately 90 mL.
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
For the rationale for performing this study,  refer to Section 2.1.
Dose Level Selection
The rationale behind the selection of the dose level is described in Section 4.3.
Blinding, Control, Study Phase/Periods, Vaccination Groups
Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of participants to vaccination
groups,  to increase the likelihood that known and unknown participant attributes (eg,demographic
and baseline characteristics)  are evenly balanced across vaccination groups,  and to enhance the
validity of statistical comparisons across vaccination groups. Blinded study vaccine will be used
to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation ofclinical endpoints.
4.2.1. Study-Specific Ethical Design Considerations
Potential participants will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and,  during
the study,  participants will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue
participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may
be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which
they would otherwise be entitled. Only participants who are fully able to understand the risks,
benefits,  and potential AEs of the study,  and provide their consent voluntarily will be enrolled.
The study will be performed in adult participants who will receive vaccination against
SARS-CoV-2 and influenza and compensation for their time and any inconveniences. See
Section 2.3for details on potential and known benefits and risks,  and for the safety measures taken
to minimize risk to participants.
The total blood volume to be collected is acceptable according to the US Department of Health
and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections,  and FDA guidelines ( FDA 1998 ;
US DHHS 1998 ) ,  and the European Commission guidelines ( EC 1998 ) .

The 5×1010 vp dose level used in this study is consistent with the dose level authorized for
emergency use in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  on 27 February 2021 and conditional marketing in the
EU on 11 March 2021 (see Section 2) .
4.4. End of Study Definition
End of Study Definition
The end of the study is considered as the last visit for the last participant in the study. The final
data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee)  after completion of the final
participant visit at that study site,  in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
Study Completion Definition
A participant will be considered to have completed the study if the participant has completed
assessments at 6-month follow-up visit post-vaccination 2.
Participants who prematurely discontinue the study vaccine for any reason before the second
vaccination will not be considered to have completed the study. The reasons for such cases should
be documented and available to the sponsor.
5. STUDY POPULATION
Screening for eligible participants could be performed within 28days before the administration of
the study vaccine. Refer to Section 5.4, Screen Failures for conditions under which the repeat of
any screening procedures are allowed.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling participants in this study are described below. If
there is a question about these criteria,  the investigator must consult with the appropriate sponsor
representative and resolve any issues before enrolling a participant in the study. Waivers are not
allowed.
For a discussion of the statistical considerations of participant selection,  refer to Section 9.2.
NOTE: Investigators should ensure that all study enrollment criteria have been met at screening.
If a participant’s clinical status changes (including any available laboratory results or receipt of
additional medical records)  after screening but before the first dose of study vaccination and they
no longer meet all eligibility criteria,  the participant should be excluded from participation in the
study (Refer to Section 5.4for conditions for retesting) .
The required source documentation to support meeting the enrollment criteria is noted in

6.1. Study Vaccines Administered
Ad26.COV2.S will be supplied at a concentration of 1×1011 vp/mL in single-use vials,  with an
extractable volume of 0.5 mL,  and dosed at 5×1010 vp. Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride [NaCl])
will be supplied in single-use vials.
The seasonal influenza vaccines to be used in this study are Afluria Quadrivalent ( standard-dose )
and Fluzone HD Quadrivalent ( high-dose ) or equivalent formulated for the 2021-2022
influenza- season:
 Afluria Quadrivalent ( standard-dose )  is a suspension for IM injection supplied in a 0.5-mL
single-dose prefilled syringe. Each dose of Afluria Quadrivalent contains 60 µg of
hemagglutinin (HA) : 15 µg of each of 4 influenza strains (2 influenza A strains and 2 influenza
B strains) . For details,  refer to the Afluria Quadrivalent package insert.
 Fluzone HD Quadrivalent ( high-dose )  is a suspension for IM injection supplied in a 0.7-mL
single-dose prefilled syringe. Each dose of Fluzone HD Quadrivalent contains 240 µg of HA:
60 µg of each of 4 influenza strains (2 influenza A strains and 2 influenza B strains) . For
details,  refer to the Fluzone HD Quadrivalent package insert.
Participants will be vaccinated at the study site according to the schedule shown in Table 2 . Study
vaccines will be administered by [CONTACT_327976]. On Day 1,  each participant
will receive 2 IM injections. Each injection should be administered in opposite arms. It is
recommended to use the right arm for the seasonal influenza vaccine on Day 1 and the left arm for
the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo on Days 1 and 29.
On Day 29,  each participant will receive 1 IM injection,  preferably the deltoid muscle of the
non-dominant upper arm is used.
If an injection cannot be given in the deltoids due to a medical or other contraindication (for
example,  tattooed upper arms rendering it difficult to assess site reactogenicity) ,  use alternative
locations such as the hip,  thigh, or buttocks (to be avoided in overweight participants) . When
selecting an alternative location,  the participant’s ability to assess injection site events should be
considered. In all circumstances,  IM injections in other locations than the upper arm are not
considered protocol deviations.
For further information on visit windows see the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.1. If a
participant cannot be vaccinated within the allowed window,  the decision regarding vaccination
will be assessed on a case-by-case basis upon discussion between sponsor and investigator. The
reason should be documented.
Study vaccine administration must be captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF) .
Ad26.COV2.S and placebo will be manufactured and provided under the responsibility of the
sponsor. Refer to the IB for a list of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( IB Ad26.COV2.S 2021 ) .

For this protocol,  the term “combination product” refers to the single integral drug-device
combination. The seasonal influenza vaccines administered in this study,  Afluria Quadrivalent
(standard-dose)  and Fluzone HD Quadrivalent (high-dose) ,are considered combination products.
All combination product deficiencies (including failure,  malfunction,  improper or inadequate
design,  manufacturer error,  use error,  and inadequate labeling)  shall be documented and reported
by [CONTACT_23528]. For studies using a combination product,  these
deficiencies will be reported as product quality complaints (PQC)  (see Section 10.4.6;  Appendix
4.6: Product Quality Complaint Handling )  and appropriately managed by [CONTACT_456].
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Preparation/Handling/Storage
All study vaccine must be stored in a secured location with no access for unauthorized personnel
and at controlled temperatures as indicated on the clinical labels. If study vaccine is exposed to
temperatures outside the specified temperature range,  all relevant data will be sent to the sponsor
to determine if the affected supplies can be used or will be replaced. The affected study vaccine
must be quarantined and not used until further instruction from the sponsor is received.
Refer to the SIPPM and the IPPI [INVESTIGATOR_327866],  handling,
and storage.
An unblinded study site pharmacist,  or another qualified individual,  who will have no other study
function following vaccination,  will prepare the appropriate vials and syringes,  labeled with the
participant’s identification number,  and provide the syringes for the study vaccine in a blinded
manner to the blinded vaccine administrator (a trained and qualified study nurse,  medical doctor,
or otherwise qualified health care professional [HCP])who will perform the injection.
Accountability
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study vaccines received at the site are
inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The study vaccines administered to the
participant must be documented on the vaccine accountability form. All study vaccines will be
stored and disposed of according to the sponsor's instructions. Study site personnel must not
combine the contents of the study vaccine containers.
Study vaccines must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label and
must be stored at the study site in a limited-access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate
environmental conditions. Unused study vaccines must be available for verification by [CONTACT_130376]'s study site monitor during on-site monitoring visits. The return to the sponsor of unused
study vaccines will be documented on the vaccine accountability form. When the study site is an
authorized destruction unit and study vaccine supplies are destroyed on-site,  this must also be
documented on the vaccine accountability form.

be disposed of immediately safely and therefore will not be retained for vaccine accountability
purposes.
Study vaccines should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified member
of the studysite personnel,  or by a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic pharmacist. Study vaccines will be supplied only
to participants participating in the study. Returned study vaccines must not be dispensed again,
even to the same participant. Study vaccines may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_160207]. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study vaccines from nor store them at,
any site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. Further guidance and information
for the final disposition of unused study vaccines are provided in the SIPPM.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Vaccine Allocation
Procedures f or Randomization and Stratif ication
Central randomization will be implemented in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned
to 1 of 2 vaccination groups (1:1 ratio;  for participants ≥18 to ≤64 years of age)  or 1 of
4 vaccination groups (1:1:1:1 ratio;  for participants ≥65 years of age) . This will be based on a
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by [CONTACT_478045].
The randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_898485] (≥18 to ≤64 years of age versus ≥65 years of age) and previous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
history (Vaxzevria [[COMPANY_008]],  Comirnaty [[COMPANY_007]-BioNTech],  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_327825] [Moderna],
Ad26.COV2-S [Janssen],  or COVID-19 vaccine naïve) . The type of primary vaccination will be
documented and accounted for according to IWRS procedures.
The IWRS will assign a unique intervention code,  which will dictate the intervention assignment
and matching study intervention kit for the participant. The requestor must use his or her own user
identification and personal identification number when contact[CONTACT_23790],  and will then give
the relevant participant details to uniquely identify the participant.
Blinding
Blinding will be guaranteed by [CONTACT_898486] a masked syringe bya blinded study vaccine
administrator. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the groups based on a computer-
generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by [CONTACT_861746].
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained
within the IWRS,  which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an
individual participant.

Sta
tus: Approved,Date: 15 February 2022Data that may potentially unblind the intervention assignment (ie, immunogenicity data,  study
vaccine accountability data,  study vaccine allocation,  or other specific laboratory data)  will be
handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential
for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions,  such as segregating the data in
question from view by [CONTACT_473],  clinical team,  or others as appropriate until the time of
database lock and unblinding.
Under normal circumstances,  the blind should not be broken until all participants have completed
the treatment phase of the study and the database lock is completed. The investigator may, in an
emergency, determine the identity of the intervention by [CONTACT_23793]. While the
responsibility to break the intervention code in emergency situations resides with the investigator,
it is recommended that the investigator contacts the sponsor or its designee if possible, to discuss
the particular situation,  before breaking the blind. Telephone contact [CONTACT_898487].
In the event the blind is broken,  the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date,  time,
and reason for the unblinding must be documented by [CONTACT_8784],  electronic data capture (eDC)
tool,and in the source document. The documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code
break must be retained with the participant's source documents in a secure manner.
Participants who have had their intervention assignment unblinded should continue to return for
scheduled evaluations.
Participants who withdraw will not be replaced.
6.4. Study Vaccination Compliance
Study vaccines will be administered IM by [CONTACT_898488].
The date and time of study vaccine administration and the location used will be recorded in the
eCRF.
6.5. Dose Modification
Dose modification is not applicable in this study.
6.6. Access to Licensed/Authorized Study Vaccine After the End of the Study
All participants in this study will receive Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent
influenza vaccine, irrespective of the study group to which they are randomized. Participants will
not be offered another active study vaccine after the end of the study.
Participants will be instructed that a study vaccine will not be made available to them after they
have completed/discontinued the study vaccine.

For this study,  any dose of Ad26.COV2.S or of a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine greater
than the protocol-specified dose will be considered an overdose. The sponsor does not recommend
specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose,  the investigator or treating physician should:
 Contact [CONTACT_898489].
 Closely monitor the participant for AEs/AESIs/SAEs/MAAEs (ie,  the participant will remain
at the study site for at least [ADDRESS_1259326]-dose will be made) .
 Document the quantity of the excess dose in the eCRF.
 Report as a special reporting situation (see Appendix 10.4.4) .

Prestudy specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_160134]/antipyretic medications and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids,  antihistamines,  and vaccinations taken up to [ADDRESS_1259327] be recorded at screening.
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_160134]/antipyretic medications and non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs,corticosteroids,  antihistamines,  and vaccinations must be recorded (including
dose and frequency)  from the first dose of study vaccine until [ADDRESS_1259328] vaccination.

Vaccination with licensed live attenuated vaccines within 28 days of a study vaccination (ie,  before
or after)  is prohibited. Other licensed (not live)  vaccines (eg,  tetanus,  hepatitis A,  hepatitis B,
rabies)  should be given at least 14 days before (or at least 14 days after)  administration of the study
vaccine to avoid potential confusion of adverse reactions and potential immune interference.
The use of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (licensed/authorized or investigational)  other than study
vaccination is disallowed less than [ADDRESS_1259330] study vaccination and during the
course of the study. In the event that a participant does receive another COVID-19 vaccine outside
of the study,  investigators are required to enter any COVID-19 vaccines (name/manufacturer of
the vaccine and date of administration)  in the Concomitant Therapy eCRF.
Vaccination with a seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2021-[ADDRESS_1259331]-exposure setting (eg,rabies or tetanus) ,  it could take priority over the
study vaccine and must be documented in the Concomitant Therapy eCRF.
Antipyretics are recommended post-vaccination for symptom relief as needed. Prophylactic
antipyretic use is not encouraged;  however,  in some instances,  it could be considered in special
circumstances and/or comorbidities per the investigator’s discretion.
Chronic or recurrent use of systemic corticosteroidsa at immunosuppressive dose (defined as >20
mg prednisone or equivalent daily for 2 consecutive weeks) and administration of antineoplastic
and immunomodulating agents or radiotherapy is prohibited during the treatment phase (ie,
through [ADDRESS_1259332] vaccination 2) . If any of these agents are indicated in a disease setting,
medical judgment should prevail.

8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Overview
The Schedule of Activities summarizes the frequency and timing of safety,  reactogenicity,
immunogenicity,  and all other measurements applicable to this study.
If multiple assessments are scheduled for the same timepoint,  it is recommended that procedures
be performed in the following sequence: vital signs and physical examination before blood draws.
If needed,  assessments may be performed on another day within the applicable visit window.
Actual dates and times of assessments must be recorded in the source document and the eCRF.
Participants will be provided a thermometer (to measure body temperature) ,  ruler (to measure local
injection site reactions) ,  and an electronic diary to record body temperature and solicited local (at
injection site)  and systemic symptoms. The diary includes instructions on how to capture the data
and grading scales to assess severity of the signs and symptoms post-vaccination (reactogenicity) .
The study staff is responsible for providing appropriate training to the participant to avoid missing
or incorrect data. The diary will be reviewed by [CONTACT_898492]’s assessment of reactogenicity will be completed on the 7-day post vaccination visit
as indicated in the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.1) . If there are ongoing symptoms,  the
diary can be reviewed during the nextvisit. If a participant misses a vaccination,  the diary covering
the period after the missed vaccination does not have to be completed.
The total blood volume to be collected from each participant throughout the study will be

participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a private/off-study test (whether through
PCR or serological testing) ,  the event should be reported as medical history,  AE or SAE if the
event meets the criteria for an SAE. The participant can continue in the study in accordance with
country and site level recommendations for COVID-19.
The study staff can recommend the participant informs their medical care provider. If there are no
local country recommendations for COVID-19,  the sponsor recommends the participant self-
quarantines and does not come for a clinic visit until a negative PCR test could be obtained.

No generally accepted immunological correlate of protection has been demonstrated for
SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1259340] COVID-19 is established in
terms of humoral immunity,  then a statistical comparison to that correlate or threshold will
substitute NI testing to immune responses to vaccine at release,  as outlined in the study statistical
analytical plan (SAP) .
Venous blood samples will be collected for assessment of humoral immune responses. Sample
volumes and time points are detailed in the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.
If the participant is unable to complete the study but they did not withdraw consent,
immunogenicity samples will be taken at the early exit visit,  but only if the early exit visit is at
least 10 days after the previous immunology blood draw. See the Schedule of Activities for further

recommended before blood sampling.
8.2.3. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Blood samples for clinical laboratory assessments (as detailed in Section 10.2, Appendix 2 )  will
be collected as described in the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.
In case ofa thrombotic event,  thrombocytopenia, or TTS occurring post-vaccination,  every effort
should be made to collect in a local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/laboratory the blood test results obtained to ensure
that the treating physician performs a rapid diagnosis and treatment.
This information should be reported through the TTS AESI form (see Section 10.8, Appendix 8 )
electronically per instructions in the eCRF completion guidelines. In addition,  every effort should
be made to collect blood samples from the participant for a platelet count (local laboratory or
substitute for local laboratory)  and other applicable testing (central laboratory;eg,  anti-PF4 see the
Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3.2and Section 10.2, Appendix 2 ) .
The investigator will review the laboratory test results performed locally and investigate potential
cases of thrombosis (per Appendix 9,  Section 10.9)  to assist the investigation of the AESI, and
document it in eDC.
See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details on laboratory tests to be reported for post-vaccination
thrombocytopenia.
8.2.4. Pregnancy Testing
A urine pregnancy test for participants of childbearing potential will be performed at screening

Serious Adverse Event Information
All Adverse Events
Adverse events and special reporting situations,  whether serious or non-serious,  that are related to
study procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will be reported from
the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until the end of the study/early withdrawal.
Clinically relevant medical events not meeting the above criteria and occurring between signing
of ICF and moment of first vaccination will be collected on the Medical History eCRF page as
pre-existing conditions.
Solicited AEs,  collected through a diary,  will be recorded for each vaccination from the time of
vaccination until [ADDRESS_1259345]-vaccination (or until resolution) .
All unsolicited AEs and special reporting situations,  whether serious or non-serious,  will be
reported for each vaccination from the time of vaccination until [ADDRESS_1259346]-vaccination.
Unsolicited adverse events with the onset date outside the timeframe defined above (>28 days after
each study vaccination) ,  which are ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination,  should be
recorded as such.
At each visit the participant will be asked if they have had a private/off-study COVID-[ADDRESS_1259347]. If a
participant receives a positive SARS-CoV-2 result from a private/off-study test during the study
period (whether through PCR or serological testing)  the event should be reported as an AE or as
an SAE if the event meets the criteria of an SAE. The participant can continue in the study in
accordance with local country and site level recommendations for COVID-19. Any positive
SARS-CoV-2 result should be recorded in the eCRF. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection should be
documented as medical history and does not preclude participation in the study.
All SAEs, AESIs, and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study/vaccination (regardless of
the causal relationship)  are to be reported from the moment of first vaccination until the end of the
study,  which may include contact [CONTACT_160181]-up. The sponsor will evaluate any safety
information that is spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_898494].

urgent care clinic,  or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. Routine medical
visits for chronic comorbidities (or study visits)  will not be considered medically-attended visits.
New onset of chronic diseases will be collected as part of the MAAEs. MAAEs are to be reported
for all participants throughout the study.
As long as the participant remains in the study,  all AEs will be followed until resolved,  until
clinically stable or the end of the study,  as applicable. The investigator’s assessment of ongoing
AEs at the time of each participant’s last visit should be documented in the participant’s medical
chart.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
TTS is considered to be an AESI. Suspected AESIs (thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia
[defined as platelet count below 150, 000/µL ( Brighton Collaboration 2021 ) ] post-vaccination)  will
be recorded from the moment of vaccination until the end of the study/early withdrawal. An AESI
Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to evaluate each suspected
AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS (see Section 8.3.6) .
All AESIs occurring during the study period must be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_559957] [ADDRESS_1259348] be completed and reviewed by a physician from the study
site,  and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow-up reports of an SAE
should be transmitted electronically or by [CONTACT_6972] (fax) . Telephone reporting should be the
exception and the reporter should be asked to complete the appropriate form(s)  first.
8.3.2. Method of Detecting Adverse Events, Medically-attended Adverse
Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest, and Serious Adverse
Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs,  MAAEs,  suspected AESIs,or SAEs.
Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire
about AE occurrence.

Sta
tus: Approved,Date: 15 February 2022Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited AEs are used to assess the reactogenicity of the study vaccine and are predefined local
(at injection site)  and systemic events for which the participant is specifically questioned and
which are noted by [CONTACT_160226].
After each vaccination,  participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least
[ADDRESS_1259349]-vaccination (or until resolution) . All participants will be provided with a diary and
instructions on how to complete the diary (see Overview in Section 8) .
Electronic diary information will be transferred from the e-diary source to the sponsor. After
review and verbal discussion of the initial electronic diary entries with the participant,  the
investigator will complete his/her own assessment in the relevant sections of the CRF (ie,
investigator’s assessment of reactogenicity) . Once a solicited symptom from a diary is verified and
considered to be of severity Grade 1 or above,  it will be recorded as a solicited adverse event per
FDA toxicity grading (See Appendix 6,  Section 10.6) .
Solicited Injection Site (Local) Adverse Events
Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of local reaction at the injection site
namely pain/tenderness,  erythema, swelling,  and systemic reactions, namely fatigue,  headache,
nausea,  and myalgia daily for 7days post-vaccination (or until resolution,  whatever happens first) .
The extent (largest diameter)  of any erythema and swelling should be measured (using the ruler
supplied)  and recorded daily. The case definitions for solicited injection site events can be found
in the references ( Gidudu 2012 ; Kohl 2007 ) .
Solicited Systemic Adverse Events
Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer for home
use. Participants should record the temperature in the diary starting in the evening of the day of
vaccination,  and then daily for the next 7days approximately at the same time each day. If more
than one measurement is made on any given day,  the highest temperature of that day should be
recorded.
Fever is defined as endogenous elevation of body temperature ≥38°C (100.4°F) . (See Appendix 6,
Section 10.6.)
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned in the
participant diary.
Medically-attended Adverse Events
MAAEs are AEs with medically-attended visits including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  emergency room,  urgent care
clinic,  or other visits to or from medical personnel for any reason. New onset of chronic diseases

and evaluations as medically indicated to elucidate the nature and causality of the AE,  MAAE,
AESI,  SAE,  or PQC as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or
investigations,  histopathological examinations,  or consultation with other health care
professionals.
Adverse events, including pregnancy,  will be followed by [CONTACT_70443] 10.4, Appendix 4 .
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities.
The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where
required)  all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) .
The investigator (or sponsor where required)  must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate IEC/IRB that
approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB. A S[LOCATION_003]R will
be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/IRB will
receive a blinded S[LOCATION_003]R summary,  unless otherwise specified.
8.3.5. Pregnancy
All initial reports ofpregnancy in participants or partners of male participants must be reported to
the sponsor by [CONTACT_41032] 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the
appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg,  spontaneous
abortion,  fetal death,  stillbirth,  congenital anomalies,  ectopic pregnancy)  are considered SAEs and
must be reported using an SAE reporting form.
Any participant who becomes pregnant during the study may continue study vaccination if the
investigator considers that the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks to the mother and
fetus and is allowed by [CONTACT_427].
Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the
infant will be required.

At baseline,  safety blood samples will be collected. Whole blood samples will be used for a
complete blood counts (CBC) ,  including platelet count (as part of a complete blood count) , in a
local laboratory or substitute for local laboratory,  depending on local feasibility towards
turnaround time of sample processing.
Serum and plasma samples will be collected and stored for potential future coagulation-related
testing in a central laboratory if the participant experiences an AESI (see Section 10.2,
Appendix 2 ) .
Specific requirements for the AESI are described below.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome
As described in Section 2.3.1,  TTS has been observed very rarely following vaccination with
Ad26.COV2.S and is considered to be an AESI in this study. TTS is a syndrome characterized by
a combination of both a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia ( American Society of
Hematology 2021 ;Brighton Collaboration 2021 ).
Because this syndrome is rare and not completely understood,  all cases of thrombosis and/or
thrombocytopenia will be considered a suspected case of TTS until further adjudication can be
performed. An AESI Adjudication Committee with appropriate expertise will be established to
evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it is a case of TTS. The investigator shall be
responsible for reporting any suspected AESI of TTS using the SAE form and the form detailed in
Section 10.8, Appendix 8 .
A suspected TTS case is defined as:
 Thrombotic events: any thrombotic or thromboembolic event as detailed in Section 10.9,
Appendix 9
 Thrombocytopenia,  defined as platelet count below 150, 000/µL ( Brighton Collaboration 2021 )
post-vaccination
Symptoms,  signs,  or conditions suggestive of a thrombotic event should be recorded and reported
as a suspected AESI even if the final or definitive diagnosis has not yet been determined,  and
alternative diagnoses have not yet been eliminated or shown to be less likely. Follow-up
information and final diagnoses,  if applicable,  should be submitted to the sponsor as soon as
feasible.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statistical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_35522]. A general
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined
below. Specific details will be provided in the SAP.
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses
The study is successful if the below objectives are demonstrated:
 NI of the humoral immune response as measured by [CONTACT_898495]26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal standard-dose influenza vaccine
versus the administration of a seasonal quadrivalent standard-dose influenza vaccine alone,
28 days after the administration of a seasonal influenza vaccine.
AND
 NI of the concomitant administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent
standard-dose influenza vaccine versus the administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine alone,
28 days after the administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine,  in terms of humoral immune
response (ELISA)
Therefore,  the following CIs will be calculated:
 The 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference in log-transformed HI antibody titers against each of
the 4 seasonal influenza vaccine strains at 28 days after the administration of the quadrivalent
seasonal influenza vaccine between the Control and the CoAd group,  and

administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine between the Control and the CoAd group
Only if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Control group/CoAd group)  of
the HI antibody titer for each of the 4 vaccine strains and for GMC for ELISA lies below 1.5,  NI
of co-administration versus separate administration will be concluded for both vaccines (seasonal
influenza vaccine and Ad26.COV2.S vaccine) . If 1 or more confidence limits for the GMT/GMC
ratio exceed 1.5,  NI cannot be concluded.
The primary analysis will be performed when all participants have completed the 28 days after the
second study vaccination visit or discontinued earlier. No interim analyses will be performed.
For the high-dose groups,  no formal hypothesis testing is planned.
No formal statistical testing of safety data is planned. Safety data will be analyzed descriptively
by [CONTACT_29299].
9.2. Sample Size Determination
Sample size calculations are performed under the following assumptions:
 no effect of co-administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine on
the immune response against influenza as measured by [CONTACT_287046]
4 influenza vaccine strains at 28 days after the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine
 the use of Afluria Quadrivalent for standard-dose (adults ≥18 to <64 years of age and older
adults ≥65 years of age)
 a standard deviation of 0.[ADDRESS_1259354] the 4 influenza vaccine strains at 28 days after the administration of seasonal influenza
vaccine (with or without Ad26.COV2.S)
 no effect of co-administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine on
the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by S-ELISA at 28 days after the
administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine
 a standard deviation of 0.50 at the log 10 scale for S-ELISA at 28 days after the administration
of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (with or without seasonal influenza vaccine)
 a NI margin of 1.5
 2-sided α of 5%

9.3. Populations for Analysis Sets
For purposes of analysis,  the following populations are defined:
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomized participants with at least 1 documented study vaccine
administration,  regardless of the occurrence of protocol deviations and vaccine type (seasonal
influenza,  Ad26.COV2.S,  or placebo) . Analyses of safety and participant information will be
performed on the FAS.
Per Protocol Influenza Immunogenicity (PPII) Set: All randomized participants who received
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in combination with a seasonal influenza vaccine for the co-administration
group and those who received a seasonal influenza vaccine alone for the control group,  for whom
immunogenicity data are available for at least one of the influenza strains in the vaccine.
Samples taken after a participant experiences a major protocol deviation expected to impact the
immunogenicity outcomes will be excluded from the PPII analysis.
Per Protocol SARS-CoV-2 Immunogenicity (PPSI) Set: All randomized participants who
received Ad26.COV2.S vaccine in combination with seasonal influenza vaccine for the
co-administration group and Ad26.COV2.S vaccine alone for the control group and for whom
SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity data are available. In addition,  samples obtained at later timepoints
from participants after molecularly confirmed (viral RNA test result)  natural SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1259357] in the immunogenicity analysis will be specified

The primary analysis set for analyses related to influenza immunogenicity is the PPII Set,  the
primary analysis set for analyses related to SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity is the PPSI Set. As a
sensitivity analysis,  key tables may also be based on the FAS.
Note: Participants who have a self-confirmed history of SARS-CoV-2 infection at screening or

9.4.2. Inferential Endpoints
The NI immunogenicity objectives will be assessed by [CONTACT_147572]:
 the 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference in log-transformed HI antibody titers against each of
the [ADDRESS_1259359]-dose .
 the 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference in log-transformed S-ELISA titers at [ADDRESS_1259360] each of the 4 influenza vaccine strains and for S-ELISA titers,  an
analysis of variance (ANOVA)  model will be fitted with the respective titers as dependent variable
and group (Control or CoAd) , age category (as stratified) ,  previous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (as
stratified) ,and baseline S-ELISA titers as independent variable. Based on these ANOVA models,
the CIs around the difference will be calculated and will be back transformed (by [CONTACT_151698])
to CIs around a GMC or GMT ratio (Control group/CoAd group) ,  respectively, and compared to
the NI margin of 1.5.
Only if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT or GMC ratio (Control group/CoAd
group) ,  respectively,of the HI antibody titer for each of the 4 vaccine strains and for S-ELISA lies
below 1.5,  NI of co-administration versus separate administration will be concluded for both
vaccines (seasonal influenza vaccine and Ad26.COV2.S vaccine) . If [ADDRESS_1259361] assessment pre-vaccination (ie, it
corresponds to Day 1 for CoAd groups or influenza vaccine alone,  or to Day 29 for Ad26.COV2.S
vaccine) . In a sensitivity analysis,  different variances between the groups will be allowed.
Therefore,  the CIs will be calculated via Welch’s ANOVA.
The assessment of the primary endpoints will be performed on individuals who have been
previously vaccinated with different types of COVID-19 vaccines. This factor brings a level of
variability of immune responses that is unknown.

Practice (GCP) ,  and applicable regulatory and country-specific requirements.
Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing,
conducting,  recording,  and reporting studies that involve the participation of human participants.
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights,  safety,  and well-being of
study participants are protected,  consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of
Helsinki,  and that the study data are credible.
Protocol Clarification Communications
If text within a final approved protocol requires clarification (eg,  current wording is unclear or
ambiguous)  that does not change any aspect of the current study conduct,  a protocol clarification
communication (PCC)  may be prepared. The PCC Document will be communicated to the
Investigational Site,  Site Monitors,  Local Trial Managers (LTMs) ,  Clinical Trial Managers
(CTMs) ,  and/or Contract Research Organizations (CROs)  who will ensure that the PCC
explanations are followed by [CONTACT_473].
The PCC Document may be shared by [CONTACT_70454]/IRBs per local regulations.
The PCC Documents must NOT be used in place of protocol amendments,  but the content of the
PCC Document must be included in any future protocol amendments.
Protocol Amendments
Neither the investigator nor the sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment by
[CONTACT_456]. All protocol amendments must be issued by [CONTACT_456],  and signed and dated by [CONTACT_31035]. Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IEC/IRB approval,  or
when the relevant competent authority has raised any grounds for non-acceptance,  except when
necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the participants,  in which case the amendment must
be promptly submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant competent authority. Documentation of
amendment approval by [CONTACT_23846]/IRB must be provided to the sponsor. When the
change(s)  involve only logistic or administrative aspects of the study,  the IEC/IRB (where

10.3.11. Monitoring
The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central,  remote,  and/or on-site
monitoring)to monitor this study.
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary. The monitor will
record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first
post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits,
the monitor may compare the data entered into the eCRF with the source documents
(eg,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/physician’s office medical records) . The nature and location of all source
documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the
eCRF are known to the sponsor and study site personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_247932]. If electronic records are maintained at the study site,  the method of
verification must be discussed with the study site personnel.
Direct access to source documents (medical records)  must be allowed for the purpose of verifying
that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will
be discussed with the study site personnel. The sponsor expects that,  during monitoring visits,  the
relevant study site personnel will be available,  the source documents will be accessible,  and a
suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will
meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study
conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits,  remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these
remote contacts,  study site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the

Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at
any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance
with regulatory guidelines and company policy. These audits will require access to all study
records,  including source documents,  for inspection. Participant privacy must,  however,  be
respected. The investigator and study site personnel are responsible for being present and available
for consultation during routinely scheduled study site audit visits conducted by [CONTACT_70468].
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_67840],  either as part
of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a
regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has
been contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection.
10.3.13. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines,  the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF
and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant,  as well as all study
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8,  Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical
Trial,  and all study documents as specified by [CONTACT_8146](s) . The
investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these
documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least [ADDRESS_1259370]. These documents will be retained for a longer period
if required by [CONTACT_70469]. It is the
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no
longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires,  relocates,  or for other reasons withdraws from the
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090],  custody must be transferred to a person who will accept
the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_70497]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents
before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any
documentation relating to this study,  the investigator/institution must permit access to such reports.

Sta
tus: Approved,Date: 15 February 2022Study/Site Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected
and a study site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time,  provided there is reasonable cause and
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_70470]:
 Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol,  the requirements of the IEC/IRB or
local health authorities,  the sponsor's procedures,  or GCP guidelines
 Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]
 Discontinuation of further study vaccine development

Special Interest, Product Quality Complaints, and Other Safety Reporting:
Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and
Reporting
10.4.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a
pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational)  product. An AE does not necessarily have
a causal relationship with the intervention. An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended
sign (including an abnormal finding) ,  symptom,  or disease temporally associated with the use of a
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational)  product,  whether or not related to that medicinal
(investigational or non-investigational)  product. (Definition per ICH)
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the
baseline condition,  or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures,  including laboratory test
abnormalities.
Any respi[INVESTIGATOR_327889]-CoV-[ADDRESS_1259371] infections
arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection will not be reported as (S) AEs in the Clinical Study Report
but will be tabulated separately. In general,  any (S) AEs caused by [CONTACT_328031]-CoV-2 infection will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables
and presented separately. In general,  (S) AEs caused by [CONTACT_413448]-CoV-2
infection will be removed at the analysis level from the (S) AE listings and tables and presented
separately.
Note: For time period of sponsor’s AE collection,  see All Adverse Events under Section 8.3.1.
Serious Adverse Event
An SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for
Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death
 Is life-threatening
(The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Sta
tus: Approved,Date: 15 February 2022 Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product
 Is Medically Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised indeciding whether expedited reporting
is also appropriate in other situations,  such as important medical events that may not be
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206149]. These should usually be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship
between the study vaccine and the event (eg,  death from anaphylaxis) ,  the event must be reported
as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study
endpoint (eg,  all-cause mortality) .
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product
reference safety information. For Ad26.COV2.S,  the expectedness of an AE will be determined
by [CONTACT_70471].
10.4.2. Attribution Definitions
Assessment of Causality
The causal relationship to study vaccine is determined by [CONTACT_093]. The following selection
should be used to assess all AEs.
Related
There is a reasonable causal relationship between study vaccine administration and the AE.
Not Related
There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study vaccine administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to support a causal relationship.
By [CONTACT_108],  all solicited adverse events at the injection site (local)  will be considered related to
the study vaccine administration.
10.4.3. Severity Criteria
All AEs and laboratory data will be coded for severity using a modified version of the FDA grading
table,  based on version of September 2007 ( US DHHS 2007 ) ,  included in Section 10.6,
Appendix 6 .

derived from the diameter [for erythema and swelling] and the temperature measurements [for
fever]) .
10.4.4. Special Reporting Situations
Safety events of interest on a sponsor study vaccine in an interventional study that may require
expedited reporting or safety evaluation include,  but are not limited to:
 Overdose of a sponsor study vaccine
 Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study vaccine
 Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study vaccine
 Medication error,  intercepted medication error,  or potential medication error involving a
[COMPANY_012] medicinal product (with or without patient exposure to the Johnson &
Johnson medicinal product,  eg,  product name [CONTACT_2976],  product label confusion,  intercepted
prescribing or dispensing errors)
 Exposure to a sponsor study vaccine from breastfeeding
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that
meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the CRF.
10.4.5. Procedures
All Adverse Events
All AEs,  regardless of seriousness,  severity,  or presumed relationship to study vaccine,  must be
recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever possible,
diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough,
runny nose,  sneezing,  sore throat,  and head congestion should be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_898464]31518 JNJ-78436735

document and reported according to sponsor instructions.
For all studies with an outpatient phase,  including open-label studies,  the participant must be
provided with a "wallet (study)  card" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration
of the study indicating the following:
 Study number
 Statement,  in the local language(s) ,  that the participant is participating in a clinical study
 Investigator's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24hour contact [CONTACT_23828]
 Local sponsor's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 24-hour contact [CONTACT_23828] (for medical personnel only)
 Site number
 Participant number
 Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind
Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054],  or that have not resolved upon the
participant's discontinuation from the study,  must be followed until any of the following occurs:
 The event resolves
 The event stabilizes
 The event returns to baseline,  if a baseline value/status is available
 The event can be attributed to agents other than the study vaccine or to factors unrelated to
study conduct
 It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (participant or health care
practitioner refusal to provide additional information,  lost to follow-up after demonstration of
due diligence with follow-up efforts)
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  that occurs during
participation in the study must be reported as an SAE,  except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43717](eg,  social reasons such as pending
placement in long-term care facility)
 Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the eCRF) .
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23743],  and where the
underlying condition for which the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23744],  will not be
considered SAEs. Any AE that results in a prolongation of the originally planned

Amendment INT -7(27April 2015)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the Europea n Union.
The overall reason for the amendment: The overall reason for the amendment is to extend the period for long -
term safety follow up to a maximum of 5 years from the final analysis clinical cut off .
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Amendment INT -6(20January 2014 )
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union . 
The overall reason for the amendment: The final analysis of the primary endpoint, progression -free survival 
(PFS) was performed after the predefined total of 150 PFS events were reported in the abiraterone plus exemestane 
group and in the exemestane al one group ; the clinical cutoff date for the final analysis (CCO -FA) was 20 September 
2013. The results did not show a clinically meaningful or statistically significant advantage of abiraterone acetate 
plus exemestane or abiraterone acetate alone over exem estane alone. There was also a slight increase in the 
incidence of adverse event sin subjects treated with abiraterone acetate orwith the combination of abiraterone 
acetate plus exemestane versus single -agent exemestane.  How ever, individual subjects may derive benefit from the 
treatment they are currently receiving with continued control of disease in the absence of significant toxicity . 
Therefore, it was decided to offer all subjects still on study treatment the opportunity to continue on their existing
study medication for up to 2 years from the CCO -FA(ie, up to 20 September 2015), at which point the situation will 
be reassessed for subjects still receiving study medication . Subjects who do not continue on study medication and
those in long-term follow up will be discontinued from the study. The decision to continue on study medication or 
withdraw from the study will be made by [CONTACT_24484] .
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Based on the results of the fina l analysis, t he primary endpoint of the study was not met.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Amendment INT -5(18March 2013)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directiv e 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.
The overall reason for the amendment: The overall reason for the amendm ent is to incorporate the 
recommendations of the Data Review Committee (DRC) follow ing their review of the efficacy and safety results 
from the protocol -specified interim  analysis of progression -free survival (PFS) (110 [50%] of progression or death 
events).
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: The criterion for futility was met for the abiraterone acetate group and the DRC recommended that 
subjects no longer be randomized to this group. The sponsor is stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564825]. The criteria for futility or efficacy were not met for the abirater one acetate plus 
exemestane group; the DRC recommended that this group continue per protocol. The sponsor will continue per 
protocol. Based on the findings in the 2groups noted above, the DRC stated the study team may consider that 
subjects who progress in the exemestane alone group be allow ed to crossover to the abiraterone acetate plus 
exemestane group. The sponsor considered this option but decided not to allow  crossover and for subjects who 
progress on exemestane to discontinue study treatment. The sponsor also decided that subjects in the abiraterone 
acetate group be inform ed of the sponsor decision to discontinue random ized assignment to the abiraterone acetate 
group and to allow  ongoing subjects to make their own decision about whether or not to continue further study 
treatment.
Synopsis Overview of Study 
Design; Sample Size 
Determination; Section 3.1 
Overvie w of Study Design; 
Section 11.1 Sample Size 
DeterminationAdded a description of the DRC recommendations in the overview of study 
design. Added Attachment 9 to explain the revisions to the protocol based on the 
DRC recommendations. 
Added a revised sample size and number of events for the final analysis of PFS 
based on 2 treatment groups.
Rationale: Added cautionary wording for w omen who are pregnant or may be pregnant to avoid handling of 
abiraterone acetate tablets w ithout protection. This w ording is being incorporated into all new  or am ended 
abiraterone acetate protocols. 
Section 14.[ADDRESS_741974] milk.
Rationale: Based on in vitro data, abiraterone acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4. A drug-drug interaction study of 
abiraterone acetate and ketoconazole showed no clinically meaningful influence on abiraterone pharmacokinetics 
(PK). A drug-drug interaction study of abiraterone aceta te and rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_564826] ∞. This information is being incorporated into all new or amended abiraterone acetate protocols.
Section 8.3 Special 
Concomitant TherapyAdded this wording to Section 8.3: In a clinical pharmacok inetic interaction study of 
healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 600 mg daily for 6 
days) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, the mean plasma AUC ∞
of abiraterone was decreased by 55%. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampi [INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital) during treatment with 
abiraterone acetate are to be avoided, or used w ith careful evaluation of clinical efficacy.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Removed cautionary wording regarding CYP3A4 inhibitors because drug interaction studies did not 
show any clinically meaning ful effect softhe strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, on the pharm acokinetics of 
either exemestane or abiraterone.
Section 4.3 
Prohibitions and 
RestrictionsRemoved reference to CYP3A4 i nhibitor sin text and in Table 1. 
Rationale: The storage conditions for prednisone and prednisolone were not correct and have been updated. 
Section 14.[ADDRESS_741975] temperature for storage of prednisone is 20 to 25ºC  (68 to 77 ºF) and for 
prednisolone is below  25ºC
Rationale: Updated Attachment 5 : Progressive Disease Notification Fax Sheet; Tom Griffin has replaced Margaret 
Yu as the project physician.
Attachment [ADDRESS_741976] information.
Rationale: Made minor editorial revisions for consistency with other protocols and incorporated minor changes 
from revised protocol template. 
Throughout the 
protocolMinor editorial changes and incorporation of new template language.
Amendment INT -4(19September 2012)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union .
The overall reason for the amendment: A prothrom bin time (PT) is not done by [CONTACT_564854], [LOCATION_009], 
the Netherlands, and Spain, but an international norm alized ratio (INR) is done instead. In addition, some subjects 
have abnormal but not clinically  significant PT, w hich strictly per the current wording, would violate the protocol. 
This amendm ent allows an INR to be done whenever PT is not available. It also allows subjects with out of range 
PTs that are of no clinical significance to be eligible for the study.
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: To allow  INR to be done in place of PT, and to allow for subjects with PTs/ INRs, or PTT out of 
norm al range but not clinically significant to be eligible for enrollment.
Time and Events 
ScheduleSpecified coagulation as PT or INR , and PTT; defined INR in footnote.
4.1 Inclusion Criteria

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015SYNOPSIS
Randomized, Open -Label Study of Abiraterone Acetate (JNJ -212082) Plus Prednisone With or Without 
Exemestane in Postmenopausal Women With ER+ Metastatic Breast Cancer Progressing After Letrozole or 
Anastrozole Therapy
Abiraterone [17-(3-pyridyl)androsta -5,16-dien-3β-ol] is an irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP)17 
(17-hydroxylase/ C17,20 -lyase), a dual-function enzyme that catalyzes 2critical reactions in the synthesis of 
testosterone. Abiraterone acetate (JNJ-212082) is the prodrug of the active drug abiraterone (JNJ-589485). Once 
absorbed after oral administration, abiraterone acetate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_564832], abiraterone.
OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS
This Phase 2 study  evaluates whether estrogen receptor (ER) signaling remains important to breast cancer grow th in 
the setting of arom atase inhibition failure in postmenopausal women with estrogen -receptor -positive (ER+) 
metastatic breast cancer. This study also evaluates if continued aromatase inhibition, through the use of exemestane, 
is required to maximally suppress estrogen biosynthesis when abiraterone acetate is used.
Primary Objective
The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane, each compared with exem estane alone, in postmenopausal 
women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer progressing after letrozole or anastrozole therapy.
Secondary Objectives
Secondary objectives are to assess abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 
combined with exemestane, each compared with exemestane alone, in postmenopausal wome n with ER+ metastatic 
breast cancer progressing after letrozole or anastrozole therapy, with respect to the following:
Overall survival 
Overall response rate 
Patient -reported outcomes (PROs), EORTC -C30, EQ -5D-5L, and BPI -SF pain intensity scale
Endocrine markers estradiol, testosterone, estrone, and other biomarkers 
Pharm acokinetics (PK) characterization of abiraterone and exemestane
Hypothesis
Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane, each
comp ared with exemestane alone, are safe and prolong progression -free survival (PFS) in postmenopausal women 
with ER+ metastatic breast cancer still sensitive to treatment w ith endocrine therapy.
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, open -label, paral lel-group, multicenter Phase 2 study of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 
(or prednisolone when prednisone is not available) and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with 
exemestane, each compared with exemestane alone, in postm enopausal women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer 
progressing after letrozole or anastrozole therapy. This study is divided into 3phases: Screening, Treatment, and 
Follow -Up. The Treatment phase comprises a series of 28-day cycles with continuous study treatment until disease 
progression, when an End-of-Treatment visit is completed before the Follow -Up phase begins. At selected study 
sites, PK and fresh tumor biopsies are assessed. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) will be assessed in samples from all 
subjects at baseline . Site s will be notified if a subject’s Day [ADDRESS_741999].
During Screening, potential study subjects are assessed for stud y eligibility after providing signed informed consent. 
Eligible subjects, stratified by [CONTACT_365357][INVESTIGATOR_564833] (0 or 1 versus 2) and by [CONTACT_564859] (adjuvant versus metastatic), are rando mly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
3treatment groups: abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with 
exemestane, or exemestane alone.
During Treatment, study visits are scheduled Day 1 of every 28-day cycle (2days) as well as Day 15 (2days) of 
Cycles1 through 3. Treatment will continue until the earliest of the following events: disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or death. At disease progression, subjects randomized to exemestane alone may be switched

19
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone at the discretion of the investigator; if not switched, these subjects must be 
discontinued from study drug. At disease progression, subjects randomized to either abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone or abiraterone acetat e plus prednisone combined with exemestane must be discontinued from study drug. 
Whenever study drug is discontinued, subjects should be evaluated within 30 days during the End -of-Treatm ent visit 
and entered into the Follow -Up phase regardless of reason for study drug discontinuation, and monitored every 
3months (7days) until death, loss to follow -up, consent withdrawal, or abiraterone acetate development in this 
indication is discontinued. The total duration of the study will be extended up to September 2018. Subjects with no 
disease progression for 12treatment cycles may continue study treatment at the discretion of the investigator, in 
which case, study visits will continue every 3 cycles to measure safety and efficacy parameters.
The clinical cutoff for the planned interim analysis (110 [50%] of progression or death events) occurred on 
14December 2012. At the time of the clinical cutoff, safety data w ere available for 231 subjects. The DRC reviewed 
the efficacy and safety outcomes of the interim analysis. They also reviewed biom arker data in relation to the PFS 
data. On 0 8 March 2013, the DRC recommended the study continue as follows:
abiraterone acetate + exemestane group: The interim analysis criteria were not met for either for futility nor 
efficac y. The DRC therefore recommends that this group continue as stipulated in the protocol. 
abiraterone acetate group: The interim analysis criterion for futility was met. The DRC therefore recommends 
that randomized assignment to this group be discontinued. 
exemestane group: Patients with progressive disease in this group are offered crossover to abiraterone acetate 
alone. Given the findings regarding the other 2 groups noted above, the study team may consider crossover to the 
combination of exemestane + abi raterone acetate. 
The biomarker studies should continue as planned.
Protocol Amendment INT-5 incorporates the recommendations of the DRC. The sponsor considered the crossover 
option but decided not to allow  crossover and for subjects who progress on exeme stane to discontinue study 
treatment. The sponsor also decided that subjects in the abiraterone acetate group be informed of the decision to 
discontinue randomized assignment to the abiraterone acetate group and to allow ongoing subjects to make their 
own decision about whether or not to continue further study treatment. The changes in random ization and crossover 
are outlined in Attachment 9of the protocol .
The clinical cutoff for the final analysis for the study (after the predefined total of 150 PFS even ts were reported in 
the abiraterone plus exemestane group and in the exemestane alone group) occurred on 20 September 2013. The 
results of the analysis did not show a significant benefit in PFS (the prim ary endpoint of the study) of adding 
abiraterone acet ate to exemestane , while a slight increase inthe incidence ofreported adverse events was observed 
inthe combination treatment group and in the abiraterone acetate group versus the exemestane alone group . 
How ever, individual subjects in the study may derive benefit from the treatment they are currently receiving with 
continued control of disease in the absence of significant toxicity . Therefore, the study has been amended to allow 
subjects to continue receiving their existing study medication and to reduce the number of required study -related 
procedures and amount of data collected (Attachment 10). The decision to continue to receive study medication or 
withdraw from the study will be based on updated study information and made together with thesubject and the 
investigator. Subjects who elect not to continue on study medication and those currently in long -term follow -up will 
be discontinued from the study. Under Amendment 7, individual subjects who may continue to derive benefit from 
the treatment they are currently receiving, will be offered the opportunity to continue on their existing study 
medication and followed -up for safety for an additional duration of up to 3 years (ie, up to 20 September 2018) from 
the date previously stated (20September 2015 ) in the Amendment INT-6. The situation may be reassessed 
periodically for subjects still receiving study medication .
SUBJECT POPUL ATION
Postmenopausal women at least 18years of age with ER+, Her2 -metastatic breast cancer (confirmed with 
prerandomization formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded [FFPE] tissue) will be enrolled in this study .Subjects with 
disease confined only to bone may be included. Their disease must have been sensitive to anastrozole or letrozole 
therapy prior to disease progression, defined as e ither stable disease or better for 6months in the metastatic setting 
or relapse free for 2years in the adjuvant setting. Subjects must have had no more than 2prior lines of therapy in 
the metastatic setting, of which no more than 1was chemotherapy; simultaneous combination treatment is

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015considered 1line of therapy. They must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
score of 1.
DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTRA TION
All study drugs are oral and should be taken once daily. Abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg/day  should be taken as four 
250-mg tablets and mu st be taken on an empty stomach. No food sho uld be consumed for at least [ADDRESS_742000] 1hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken. Prednisone 
5 mg/day should be taken daily with abiraterone acetate; if gastric intestinal upset occurs, prednisone may be taken 
with food and separately from abiraterone acetate. Exemestane 25mg/day should be taken as a single tablet, 
preferably after a meal.
EFFIC ACY EVA LUATION
Determination of PFS will use radiographic progression defined by[CONTACT_16622] 
(RECIST) on measurable lesions captured by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 
baseline and, using the same modality, repeated every  2cycles initially (Day 1 Cycle3, Day 1 Cycle 5, and Day 1 
Cycle7) and every 3cycles thereafter (eg, Day 1 Cycle 10, Day 1 Cycle 13) until, and including, the 
End-of-Treatm ent visit. Since disease progre ssion should be documented by [CONTACT_462], imaging with whichever 
modality was used at baseline should be completed as soon as possible if a new breast -cancer -related symptom 
appears that requires medical intervention. Determination of long-term benefit will use survival status and PRO 
scores throughout the study and during Follow -Up.
BIOM ARKER EVA LUATION
Tumor samples (FFPE) will be assessed for ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and Her2 at randomization. These 
tumors may also be analyzed for microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns, mutations or amplification of the ER, or 
for other biomarkers. Serum  samples are analyzed for estrogens or androgens. At selected study sites, fresh tumor 
biopsies will be taken. Blood samples for CTC analysis will be collected from al l subjects. Biom arker studies are 
designed to identify markers predictive of response (or resistance) to abiraterone.
PHARM ACOGENOMICS EVA LUATION
Where local regulations permit, if separate consent is granted, blood samples will be taken for pharmacogenomi cs 
research.
SAFETY EVA LUATION
Evaluations include periodic physical examination, vital sign measurement, and clinical laboratory tests. Cardiac 
function is assessed by [CONTACT_7163] -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) and 12-lead 
electrocardiog ram (ECG). Adverse events, including laboratory adverse events, are graded and summarized. Any 
clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the study will be followed by [CONTACT_564860] a clinically stable endpoi nt is reached.
PHARM ACOKINETICS EVA LUATION
At selected study sites, serial PK blood samples for determination of abiraterone and exemestane concentrations will 
be collected Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1. Predose samples will also be collected Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 4. From 
PK profiles obtained Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, the following param eters will be calculated: Cmax, tmax, AUC last, tlast, 
and AUC 24h. Additional PK param eters may be determined and exploratory analyses may be performed, as deemed 
appropriate.
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINA TION
The primary analysis consists of 2 pair-wise comparisons of the experimental treatment groups (abiraterone acetate 
plus prednisone and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane) with the reference treatment 
group (exemestane alone). For each of the pair- wise comparison s, the statistical tests of treatment effects on primary 
endpoint of PFS will be conducted independently at the 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_742001] ratio of any pair-wise comparison (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 
and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane, each compared with exemestane alone) is 0.65 
(median PFS 6.2 and 4.0months, respectively), the study has 80% power at a significance level of 0.10 (2-sided) to 
demonstrate a treatment difference with approximately 150 PFS events in each pair-wise comparison. Assuming an
enrollment rate of 20subjects per month for 15months, a total sample size of approxim ately 300 subjects
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
JNJ-212082 (abiraterone acetate)
Clinical Protocol 212082BCA2001 Amendment INT -7
21
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015(100 subjects per group) is planned. In the case that randomization to 1 treatment group is discontinued based on the 
DRC recommendation after the interim analysis, the study may stop random ization when approximately 
200subjects are enrolled to the remai ning 2 treatment groups. The final analysis would then be performed after the 
occurrence of 150 death or progression events within the remaining 2 treatment groups.
STATISTICA L METHODS
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis including all random ized subjects will be used to evaluate efficacy. The prim ary 
efficacy endpoint, PFS, is measured from time of random ization to first occurrence of either disease progression or 
death from any cause. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, overall response rate, PRO scores, and 
biomarkers, and PK. Distributions of time -to-event variables will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit 
method. Median times to event with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. The stratified log-rank test 
will be used as the primary analysis for treatment comparison. A Cox proportional -hazards model will provide 
estimates of hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The relative risk of overall response rate 
(treatment:control) will be reported along with the associa ted 95% confidence interval. Statistical inference will be 
evaluated using the Chi-square statistic. PRO scores and biom arker concentrations will be descriptively summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570]; statistical tests may be carried out as appropriate.
Plasma concentrations of abiraterone and exemestane and PK param eter estimations will be descriptively 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Association of biomarkers with clinical response or time -to-event endpoints will be 
assessed using the appropriate statistical meth ods (analysis of variance [ANOVA], categorical, or survival model), 
depending on endpoint.
Subjects who receive at least 1study drug dose will be analyzed for safety . Treatm ent-emergent adverse events will 
be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities (MedDRA) system and graded according to 
National Cancer Institute Comm on Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) , Version 4.0. Adverse 
events will be summarized by [CONTACT_325746] , and will be presented over all and by [CONTACT_6490]. Deaths and other serious adverse events will be provided in a listing. Other safety endpoints, including vital 
signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and ECG, will be summarized descriptively. 
Interim A nalysis and Data Review Committee
One interim analysis is scheduled when approximately 110 (50%) of the PFS events have occurred. Gamma -family 
spending functions determined the TypeI error rate of 10% (2-sided) and TypeII error rate of 20% for each 
pair-wise comparison. After re view of interim data, the Data Revie w Committee (DRC) will make recommendations 
regarding study continuation. In addition to the planned interim  analysis, the DRC will meet periodically to revie w 
the cumulative safety data collected. One DRC safety review  will occur after the tenth subject in each treatment 
group (~30 subjects) has received study drug for 28days (Cycle1); subject accrual will continue only if no safety 
concerns arise. When baseline and at least [ADDRESS_742002] 25subjects in each 
treatment group (75subjects total), the DRC will determine if additional ECGs are needed for these and subsequent 
subjects .

Status: Approved Date: 27April [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women with an estimated 1.38 million cases 
newly  diagnosed worldwide in 2008 (23% of all cancers) (Ferlay  2010); incidence and mortality 
rates per 100,000 person years were 109.4/21.0 (Belgium), 99.7/17.6 ([LOCATION_009]), 81.8/16.9 
(German y), 86.3/16.1 (Italy), 82.7/14.7 (Sweden), 96.8/19.6 (Netherlands), and 87.9/18.6 
([LOCATION_008]). Breast cancer is estimated to account for 28% of newly  diagnosed cancer s in 
women in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.)and 15% of deaths from cancer in U.S.women in 2010 
(American Cancer Society  2010a). In the U.S.(1999 to 2006), among patients with breast 
cancer, 60% were diagnosed with localized Stage 1 or 2 disease, 33% with Stage 2 or 3, and 5% 
with Stage 4 (National Cancer Institute 2010). About 70% of primary  breast cancers are estrogen 
receptor positive (ER+) (National Breast Cancer Coalition 2010), which correlates most often 
with postmenopausal status (Kamangar 2006). Surviv al rates decrease with stage of disease. The 
5-year survival rate for women with metastatic breast cancer is 15% (American Cancer Societ y 
2010b), which reflects a substantial unmet medical need for more effective therap y.
Several lines of evidence support investigation of abiraterone acetate (JNJ-212082) for treatment 
of women with ER+ breast cancer. Breast cancers ER+ and progesterone -receptor -positive (PR+) 
positively  correlate with circulating levels of adrenal steroids, including dehy droepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] 
(DHEA) and its sulphate (DHEA- S) (Eliassen 2006 ;Key 2002) and in vitro data indicate these 
ligands stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in a low-estrogen environment 
(Maggiolini 1999). Although adrenalectom y and hypophy sectom y were effectiv e for treatment 
of ER+ breast cancer, abiraterone acetate is the first compound specifically  designed to inhibit 
cytochrome P450 (CYP)17 with resultant inhibition of sex hormone biosynthesis. 
Hypothetically , depletion of androgens and estrogens by [CONTACT_564862] -dependent growth signaling. 
The role of androgens and androgen receptor (AR) function in ER+ breast cancer is not entirel y 
clear. Proliferation of certain breast tumor cell lines has been suppressed with antiandrogen -and 
androgen -like steroids (Hackenberg 1996). Expression of AR has been correlated with smaller 
tumors, less aggressive disease, and lack of lymph node involvement (Ogawa 2008). However, 
high serum levels of adrenal androgens (DHEA and androstenedione) also have been correlated 
with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women (Hankinson 1998 ;Kaaks 2005), 
which may  result from androgen signaling via either AR or ER (Maggiolini 1999).
Patients with ER+ disease have limited option s once disease progresses after treatment with 
available endocrine therapy . Although chemotherapy  may be used following progression during 
aromatase inhibitor therapy , toxicities are severe and overall survival is not extended 
substantially . In addition, patients with disease still driven by [CONTACT_564863]

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015with systemic chemotherapy . Since CYP17 is upstream from aromatase in the steroid synthesis 
pathway , theoretically , abiraterone acetate more completely  inhibits sex steroid synthesis. 
Abiraterone acetate may inhibit synthesis of adrenal sources of hormones (eg, androstenedione) 
whereas other available endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564838].
Twenty -five postmenopausal subjects with refractory  metastatic breast cancer, who had been 
treated with both tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors before study  entry, have been treated with 
abiraterone acetate in an ongoing Cancer Research Phase 1/2 study  sponsored by [CONTACT_564864] (CR9304 -21). This dose-escalation study  has 4 planned dose levels: 250, 500, 1000, 
and 2,000mg/day  with 6 evaluable subjects treated at each dose level; subjects are discontinued 
from study  drug and replaced before completion of a 28-day cycle when an event other than 
toxicity  occurs. The majority  of subjects recruited into the Phase 1 portion of the study  are ER+. 
At the time of the poster presentation (Basu 2010), abiraterone acetate at all dose levels resulted 
in suppression of serum testosterone by [CONTACT_2006] 15 Cycle1 of study  treatment. Serum estradiol also 
declined with treatment but concentrations greater than 15pmol/L were maintained by 
3subjects. Mechanism -based toxicities such as hypokalemia were the most frequent adverse 
events and were medically  manageable. Preliminary  antitumor efficacy  in breast cancer was 
observed: of the 6 subjects given 1,000 m g/day , 1 ER+ subject has achieved a partial response 
for more than 8months with corresponding reduction in breast cancer tumor marker CA15.3; 
another ER+ subject has had stable disease for more than [ADDRESS_742014]  (Aromasin 2008, 2009). It is approved in the U.S., 
Europe, and Canada for adjuvant treatment of ER+ early  breast cancer in postmenopausal 
women after [ADDRESS_742015] cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed 
following tamoxifen therapy . As with other estrogen -lowering agents, bone mineral density  may 
decrease with exemestane therap y. Patients taking exemestane experienced a significant increase 
in the overall fracture rate when compared with those taking tamoxifen (Lønning 2005). 
The present Phase [ADDRESS_742016] cancer growth in the setting of aromatase inhibition failure in postmenopausal women 
with ER+ metastatic breast cancer. This study  also evaluates if continued aromatase inhibition, 
through the use of exemestane, is required to maximally  suppress estrogen biosy nthesis when 
abiraterone acetate is used.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Abiraterone Acetate (JNJ-212082)
Abiraterone acetate is a prodrug of abiraterone [17-(3-pyridyl) androsta -5,16 -dien -3-ol], a novel 
selective irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP17, a dual-function enzy me that catalyzes 
2critical reactions in testosterone synthesis. 
A Phase 3, multinational, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  of oral abiraterone 
acetate and oral prednisone demonstrated that abiraterone acetate 1,000 m g/day  was an effective 
therap y for subjects (N=1,195) with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer whose disease 
had progressed following treatment with a docetaxel -containing treatment regimen 
(Study COU -AA-301). Compared with placebo -plus- prednisone treatment, abiraterone acetate 
plus prednisone reduced risk of death by 35% and significantly  improved time to prostate -
specific antigen (PSA) progression, radiographic progression- free survival (rPFS), and PSA 
response.
This was the first study to demonstrate conclusively  the importance of inhibition of CYP17 
targeting of AR-mediated signaling persisting or up-regulated after conventional 
androgen -deprivation therapy  and docetaxel chemotherap y. The results substantiate the 
hypothesis that abiraterone improves survival in patients with metastatic castration -resistant 
prostate cancer by [CONTACT_097]17 inhibition lowering testosterone concentrations below those achieved 
with androgen -deprivation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
In addition, treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone resulted in a highly  desirable 
safet y profile and benefit/risk ratio, consistent with findings of earlier Phase 1/[ADDRESS_742017] (LFT) 
abnormalities were managed with careful laboratory  monitor ing, treatment interruptions and

2.2. Hypothesis
Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with 
exemestane, each compared with exemestane alone, are safe and prolong PFS in postmenopausal 
women with ER+ metastatic b reast cancer still sensitive to treatment with endocrine therap y.
3. STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE
This is a randomized, open -label, parallel -group, multicenter Phase 2 study  of abiraterone acetate 
plus prednisone (or prednisolone when prednisone is not availabl e)and abiraterone acetate plus 
prednisone combined with exemestane, each compared with exemestane alone, in 
postmenopausal women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer progressing after letrozole or 
anastrozole therapy . From approximately  65 sites in North Ame rica, Europe, and Asia, 
approximately  300 subjects will be randomized to 3 treatment groups (100 subjects per group).
3.1. Overview  of Study  Design
This study  is divided into 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow -Up. Timing of study 
assessments and procedures is detailed in the Time and Events Schedule (following the 
Synopsis). The Treatment phase comprises a series of 28-day cycles with continuous study  
treatment until disease progression, when an End-of-Treatment visit is completed before the 
Follow -Up phase begins.
During Screening, potential study  subjects are assessed for study  eligibility  (Section 4) after 
providing signed informed consent. Eligible subjects will be stratified by 2 factors: number of 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564833] (0 or 1 versus 2);and whether letrozole or anastrozole 
was administered in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Subjects will be assigned randoml y in a 
1:1:1ratio as follows:

During the Treatment phase, study  visits and study  procedures are scheduled Day 1 of every  
28-day cycle (2days) as well as Day 15 (2days) of Cycles1 through 3.Study drug treatment 
will continue until the earliest of the following events: disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , 
or death. Subjects with no disease progression for 12treatment cycles may continue study 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator , in which case study  visits will continue every 
3cycles. 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST) will define disease progression on 
measurable lesions captured by [CONTACT_20420]  (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) (Attachment 1). At disease progression, subjects randomized to exemestane alone may be 
switched to abiraterone acetat e plus prednisone at the discretion of the investigator; if not 
switched, these subjects must be discontinued from study  drug. At disease progression, subjects 
randomized to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 
combined with exemestane must be discontinued from study  drug. In either case, subjects should 
be evaluated within 30days during the End- of-Treatment visit and entered into the Follow -Up 
phase. 
Subjects should enter the Follow -Up phase regardless of reason for study drug discontinuation 
and should be monitored every  3months (7days) until death, loss to follow -up, consent 
withdrawal, or abiraterone acetate development in this indication is discontinued. The total 
duration of the study  will be extended up toSeptember 2018 .
Samples to assess circulating tumor cells (CTC) will be collected from all subjects. At selected 
study  sites, fresh tumor biopsies and samples to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) will be obtained.
The study  will end on the date of the la st follow -up of the last subject participating in the study .
The clinical cutoff for the planned interim analysis (110 [50%] of progression or death events) 
occurred on 14 December 2012. At the time of the clinical cutoff, safet y data were available for

the interim analysis. They  also reviewed biomarker data in relation to the PFS data. On 
08March 2013, the DRC recommended the study  continue as follows:
abiraterone acetate + exemestane group: The interim analy sis criteria were not met for either 
for futility  nor efficacy. The DRC therefore recommends that this group continue as 
stipulated in the protocol. 
abiraterone acetate group: The interim analysis criterion for futility  was met. The DRC 
therefore recommends that randomized assignment to this group be discontinued. 
exemestane group: Patients with progressive disease in this group are offered crossover to 
abiraterone acetate alone. Given the findings regarding the other 2 groups noted above, the 
study  team may  consider crossover to the combination of exemestane + abiraterone acetate. 
The biomarker studies should continue as planned.
Protocol Amendment INT-[ADDRESS_742019]-Clinical Cutoff for the Final Analysis
Based upon the results ofthe final analysis, the protocol has been amended to allow subjects to 
continue on study  medication for up to 2 years from the CCO -FA (ie, up to 20 Septemb er 2015) , 
at which point the situation will be reassessed for subjects still receiving study  medication . 
Subjects who elect not to continue on study  medication and those currentl y in long-term 
follow -up will be discontinued from the study .Since Amendment INT-6, only serious adverse 
event information and drug accountability  data will be collected and reported as outlined in 
Attachment 10.Under Amendment INT-7, individual subjects who may continue to derive 
benefit from the treatment they are currently  receiving, will be offered the opportunity  to 
continue on their existing study  medication and followed-up for safet y for an additional duration 
of up to 3 years (ie, up to 20 September 2018) from the date previousl y stated 
(20September 2015) in the Amendment INT-6. The situation may be reassessed periodically  for 
subjects still receiving study  medication .
3.2. Study Design Rationale 
Study Drug Dose
The abiraterone acetate dose in this study  is 1,000 m g/day , consistent with the dose 
recommended for Phase [ADDRESS_742020] 
cancer (CR9304 -21). Abiraterone acetate was well tolerated at doses ranging from 250-mg to

Status: Approved Date: 27April [ZIP_CODE],000 m g/day . Considering PK, adrenal CYP17 inhibition, and efficacy  signal from treatment of 
men with prostate cancer and women with metastatic breast cancer (CR9304 -21), abiraterone 
acetate 1,[ADDRESS_742021] cancer, 25 mg/day .
Randomization, Comparator, Special Design Considerations
To improve the likelihood that subject attributes are balanced across groups and to enhance 
validity  of statistical comparisons across groups, randomization is used in this study . Since 
patients with fewer prior lines of anticancer therapy  are likely to be more sensitive to additional 
treatment, subjects are stratified by 2factors: number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564833] 
(0 or 1 versus 2) and whether letrozole or anastrozole was administered in the adjuvant or 
metastatic setting (Puente 2010); simultaneous combination treatment is considered 1 line of 
therap y. To help assess abiraterone acetate efficacy , the active comparator (exemestane) in this 
study  is the standard of care for postmenopausal women whose disease remains sensitive to 
endocrine therapy  following disease progression after treatment with anastrozole or letroz ole. To 
manage mineralocorticoid excess, abiraterone acetate is alway s taken with low-dose prednisone 
(prednisolone when prednisone is not available) . To mitigate difficulties managing hypokalemia 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_564839], the prednisone dose may  be 
increased to 10mg/day . To understand if continued aromatase inhibition maximally  suppresses 
estrogen biosy nthesis in the presence of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, 1 treatment group 
receives combination therapy  (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane). 
To capture time to disease progression, imaging will be done onDay [ADDRESS_742022] cycle,thereafter ; to facilitate accurate comparisons over time, the 
same modality  (CT or MRI ) should be used throughout the study ; to comply  with RECI ST, 
positron emission tomograph y (PET) scans are not allowed. To rule out drug-drug interaction 
due to common abiraterone acetate and exemestane metabolic pathways, potential effects on 
exposure after coadministration of abiraterone acetate and exemestane are assessed in a PK study  
with a subset of subjects. Because almost all plasma concentrations of abiraterone acetate were 
below the limit of quantification in previous clinical studies, only plasma concentrations of 
abiraterone will be measured in this study .
Patient -Reported Outcomes
As metastatic breast cancer progresses, patients often endure painful and debilitating metastases 
that may reduce quality  of life. Because health-related quality  of life is an important factor when 
evaluating treatment options (Bottomley  2007;Lemieux 2011), standardized PROs are used in 
this study  to assess quality  of life before, during, and after treatment. Instruments include 
3questionnaires extensively  validated and widel y used in breast cancer clinical trials: European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core 30 qualit y-of- life questionnaire

DNA and Biomarker Collection
Circulating levels of adrenal steroids, including DHEA and its sulphate, DHEA- S, positivel y 
correlate with ER+/PR+ breast cancers (Eliassen 2006 ;Key 2002) and in vitro data indicate 
these ligands stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in a low-estrogen environment 
(Maggiolini 1999). These ligands function as weak ER agonists, indicating that stero idogenic 
enzy mes upstream of aromatase may also contribute to disease progression (Chan 2002) by 
[CONTACT_564865]. Abiraterone is expected to attenuate 
this activity  by [CONTACT_564866]. To demonstrate attenuation on steroidogenic enzy me production 
following abiraterone acetate treatment, CYP17, CYP19, or 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
(HSD) expression levels will be evaluated and compared with baseline expression levels. To 
evaluate the impact of abiraterone on breast cancer subtypes, formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded 
(FFPE) tumor tissue will be evaluated for AR, ER, PR, human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
2 (Her2) , and other biomarkers . The AR will be fully  characterized to identify  any anomalies in 
individual subjects and to determine the extent of nuclear localization of the ligand -bound 
complex before and after study  drug initiation. Breast cancer subty pes may be further defined b y 
characterizing the molecular profile (eg, microRNA [miRNA ], mRNA, somatic anomalies) in 
FFPE tumor samples. Fresh tumor biopsies will be taken in a subset of subjects to characterize
AR, ER, PR, CYP17, CYP19, or other candidate markers related to abiraterone or to breast 
cancer. Circulating tumor cell samples will be taken from all subjects to characterize AR, ER, 
PR, CYP17, CYP19, or other candidate markers related to abiraterone or to breast cancer. ER 
mutation analy sis and RNA analyses may also be performed, as possible, on CTC and fresh 
biopsy  samples. The overall intent is to demonstrate that CTCs can act as surrogates for tumor 
biopsies in future studies and that selected biomark ers will be predictive of response to 
abiraterone in breast cancer subt ypes. Future studies will confirm these initial findings.
Genetic variation may be important in understanding individual differences in drug distribution 
and response as well as differe ntial disease susceptibility  and prognosis. Therefore, DNA will be 
collected, when separate informed consent is given by [CONTACT_232304], to identify  genetic 
factors that may  influence abiraterone efficacy  or be associated with metastatic breast cancer.

5. TREA TMENT ALLOCA TION AND RA NDOMIZA TION
This is an open -label study  using central randomization. Subjects are stratified by2 factors: 
number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564833] (0 or 1 versus 2) and whether letrozole or 
anastrozole was administered in the adjuvant or metastatic setting (Puente 2010). On Day 1 
Cycle1 subjects are randomly  assigned by [CONTACT_564869] 1 of 3 
treatment group s in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_742026] commence study  drug treatment within 2days. 
Subjects withdrawn or discontinued from the study  will not be replaced. 
After approval of Amendment INT-6 by [CONTACT_135534]  (HA) and Independent Ethics 
Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/I RB), subjects will be offered the choice of 
continuing on their randomized treatment or discontinuing from the study . Subjects who elect not 
to continue on study  medication and those currently  in long-term follow -up will be discontinued 
from the study .The procedures for Amendment INT-6 are outlined in Attachment 10.Under 
Amendment INT-7, individual subjects who may continue to derive benefit from the treatment 
they are currentl y receiving, will be offered the opportunity  to continue on their existing study  
medication and followed -up for safety  for an additional duration of up to 3 years (ie, up to 20 
September 2018) from the date previously  stated (20September 2015) in the Amendment INT -6. 
The s ituation may  be reassessed periodically  for subjects still receiving study medication .
6. DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTRA TION
All study  drugs are oral and should be taken once daily . Abiraterone acetate 1,000 m g/day  must 
be taken as four 250-mg tablets on an empty  stomach.No food should be consumed for at least 
2hours before the dose of abiraterone acetate is taken and for at least 1hour after the dose of 
abiraterone acetate is taken. Prednisone (prednisolone when prednisone is not available) 
5mg/day  should be taken daily  with abiraterone acetate; if gastric intestinal upset occurs, 
prednisone may be taken with food and separatel y from abiraterone acetate. Exemestane 
25mg/day  should be taken as a single tablet, preferabl y after a meal.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Study  drugs are dispensed foreach 28-day cycle and taken outside the clinic; sufficient study  
drug for 3cycles will be dispensed when study  treatment continues beyond 12treatment cycles. 
Subjects participating in the PK assessment (selected study  sites only) must be administered 
study drug at the stud y site on PK sampling day s.
No dose or dosage adjustment is foreseen but an investigator may make an adjustment for a 
medical emergency , in which case the sponsor must be notified immediately . A missed dose of 
study  drug, including pre dnisone, should be omitted and not made up.
6.1. Dose Reduction and Toxicity  Management
In clinical studies, both abiraterone acetate and exemestane were generally  well tolerated. The 
most common abiraterone -acetate -related adverse events included fatigue (cort isol reduced by 
[CONTACT_097]17 inhibition) and mineralocorticoid -related hypertension, fluid retention, and hypokalemia 
(compensatory  adrenocorticotropic hormone drive); in this study  prednisone is expected to 
mitigate these effects (cortisol supplementation and abrogation of the adrenocorticotropic 
hormone drive). The exemestane -related adverse event experienced by [CONTACT_2669] 10% of subjects 
was hot flashes (Aromasin 2008). 
Since many adverse events may be related to progressing breast cancer, investigators should 
consider approaches other than dose reduction to address adverse events. Up to 2 dose reductions 
of abiraterone acetate are allowed for adverse events that the investigator attributes to abiraterone 
acetate . At each dose reduction, the dose will be reduced by 1 tablet, eg, 4 tablets (1,000 mg) to 
3 tablets (750 mg), and 3 tablets (750 mg) to 2 tablets (500 mg). After an abiraterone acetate 
dose reduction, the abiraterone acetate dose should not be increased without documentation of 
adverse events resolution and a discussion with the Sponsor’s medical monitor. An abiraterone 
acetate dose of lower than 500 mg/day  is not allowed. Study  drug should not be resumed until 
resolution of the adverse events is documented.
Based on experience with exemestane at repeated doses up to 200mg/day, exemestane lower 
than 25mg/day  is not recommended (Aromasin 2008, 2009) and exemestane dose cannot be 
reduced in this study ; if interruption is required, exemestane should not be resumed until 
resolution of the adverse event is do cumented and the medical monitor approves.
During this study , prednisone is taken with abiraterone acetate. Following prolonged 
glucocorticoid therapy , patients may develop Cushing’s syndrome, characterized by [CONTACT_564870] , thin skin, easy bruising, bone loss, avascular necrosis of the hip, cataracts, and proximal 
myopath y. With long-term glucocorticoid therapy , a rapid withdrawal may result in symptoms 
that include fever, myalgia, fatigue, arthralgia, and malaise, which may occur even without 
evidence of frank adrenal insufficiency . Discontinuation of prednisone will be individualized 
depending on investigator judgment. Abrupt discontinuation of prednisone after chronic therapy  
may trigger s ymptoms and signs consistent with adrenal insufficiency .

8.3 Special Concomita nt Therapy
The following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564844]:
CYP2D6 substrates: Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzy me 
CYP2D6. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with CYP2D6 substrates that have a 
narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, exercise caution and 
consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate.
CYP3A4 inducers: In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study  of healthy  subjects pretreated 
with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 600 mg daily  for 6 days) followed by a single dose 
of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, the mean plasma AUC ∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55%. 
Strong inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phen ytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampi [INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabu tin, rifapentine, 
phenobarbital) during treatment with abiraterone acetate are to be avoided, or used with careful 
evaluation of clinical efficacy .
Anticoagulant therapy : Subjects taking warfarin may participate in this study  but it is 
recommended that PTbe monitored at least weekly  for the first month and, if the INR is stable, 
monthly  thereafter. Subcutaneous heparin is permitted.
For the most accurate and current information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with 
abiraterone acetate, refer to the latest version of the Investigator Brochure for abiraterone acetate.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Blood samples (5mL) are collected to measure coagulation, lipid profile, fasting glucose, 
hematology , chemistry  with electroly tes, and LFTs; total blood volume drawn for a subject through 
4 treatment cycles is estimated to be 120mL (Table 3). Blood samples (2mL, abiraterone acetate ; 
4mL, exemestane) for PK assessment are collected at selected study  sites for 20 subjects/treatment 
group; the approximate total blood volume ranges from 50to 150mL, depending on treatment 
group and treatment site. Sites that do not have a capabilit y of overnight stays will not collect PK 
samples at 12, 16, and 22 hours after study  drug dosing on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1. Blood  
samples (40mLwhere local regulations permit) for CTC evaluation are collected at all sites. 
Tumor samples are collected for ER subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_564828]. DNA sampling will 
be completed only wher e regulations permit for subjects who consent separatel y to participate in 
the pharmacogenomic component of the study . Repeated or unscheduled blood samples may be 
taken if required for safety  reasons.
Instructions for collection and shipment of pharmacoge nomics samples are provided in the Study  
Laboratory  Manual. In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement blood sample may be 
requested. Subjects participating in PK assessment will be provided a diary  to record meal and 
dosing times for the 2 daysbefore each PK sampling day .

9.1.2. Screening Phase
Each subject must satisfy all entry  criteria (Sections 4.1 and 4.2) and sign the consent form 
before any study  procedure is performed. Potential subjects must not have taken anastrozole, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
45
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015letrozole, fulvestrant, or any chemotherap y for at least 2weeks, and bevacizumab for at least 
3weeks, before randomization. Procedures and evaluations should be performed according to the 
Time and Events Schedule.
9.1.3. Treatment Phase
Subjects should receive study  drug until disease progression (Section 9.2.1), when subjects 
randomized to exemestane alone may be switched to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone at the 
discretion of the investigator; if not switched, these subjects must be discontinued from study 
drug. At disease progression, subjects randomized to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone 
or abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane must be discontinued from 
study  drug. Subjects with no disease progression for 12treatment cycles may continue study 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator, in which case study  visits will continue every 
3cycles for assessment of efficacy  (CT or MRI , ECOG) and safet y (physical examinations, vital 
signs, fasting glucose, hematology , chemistry  with electrol ytes, LFTs); PROs and lipid profiles 
will be continued every  cycle and every  [ADDRESS_742034] has met the criteria for discontinuation of
study  drug(s) . This should be scheduled within 30days after the final dose of study  drug to 
collect posttreatment safety  and efficacy  data as well as a biomarker sample, as specified in the 
Time and Events Schedule.
9.1.5. Follow -Up Phase
Subjects should enter the Follow -Up phase regardless of reason for study drug discontinuation 
and should be monitored every  3months (7days) until death, loss to follow -up, consent 
withdrawal, or abiraterone acetate development in this indication is discontinued. Nonstudy 
anti-breast -cance r therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (with start and stop dates) and survival status may be collected by 
[CONTACT_564874]. PROs also should be completed. The total study  duration will be 
extended up to September [ADDRESS_742035] (Attachment 1) on 
meas urable lesions captured by [CONTACT_564875], using the same modality , repeated 
every  2cycles initially  (Day 1 Cycle3, Day 1 Cycle5, and Day 1 Cycle7) and every  3cycles 
thereafter (eg, Day 1 Cycle10, Day 1 Cycle13) until, and including, the End-of-Treatment visit. 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

46
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015The baseline image should be taken within 4weeks before randomization as close as possible to 
Day [ADDRESS_742036] be made to ensure the same radiographic method (CT or MRI) 
is used before and throughout the study . 
Since disease progression should be documented by [CONTACT_462], imaging with whichever 
modality  was used at baseline should be completed as soon as possible if a new 
breast -cancer -related symptom appears that requires medical intervention, such as initiation of 
chemotherap y, palliative radiotherap y, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_564845] y (or dose increase). When clinical 
progression cannot be confirmed by [CONTACT_462], such as when the disease site is skin, bone 
marrow, or central nervous system, the corresponding clinical examination finding will be 
recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF. See the Time and Events Schedule for 
frequency  of ph ysical examinations.
Disease progression should not be based on assessments of new sclerotic bone lesions. When 
bone disease is the only basis for determination of progression or response , only lytic bone 
lesions should be used.
All disease progressions should be confirmed by [CONTACT_564876] y via a faxed confirmation 
form (Attachment 5).
9.2.2. Long -Term Benefit
Survival status will be determined throughout the study  and during Follow -Up. Survival status, 
including nonstudy  anticancer therapy , may be monitored by [CONTACT_564877] -Up.
The following PROs are self-administered, health -related quality -of-life questionnaires that 
assess subject -perceived disease burden, including pain, and should be conducted according to 
the Time and Events Schedule. 
EORTC -C30
The EORTC -C30 (Attachment 2) is a 30-item questionnaire validated for clinical research in 
oncology  (Aaronson 1993 ;Bottomley  2007;Fayers 2002) and is specificall y validated and 
responsive in breast cancer patients (McLachlan 1998 ;Osoba 1994). The EORTC -30 comprises 
scales in function, symptoms, a global health subscale, as well as single items to assess specific 
symptoms.
EQ-5D-5L
The EQ-5D- 5L (Attachment 3) is a 5-item instrument measuring mobility , self-care, usual 
activities, pain, discomfort, and anxiety /depression (EuroQol Group 1990) that generates a single 
utility  score commonl y used to calculate quality -adjusted life years, an outcome measure of cost 
effectiveness (Drummond 2005 ;Weinstein 1996).

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Pain Intensity Scale of BPI -SF
Of the BPI-SF instrument, only the 4-item pain intensity  scale (Attachment 4) is used in this 
study  (Cleeland 1994).
9.3. Safety  Evaluation
All study  subjects who received any dose of study  drug will be evaluable for safet y. Adverse 
events, including laboratory  adverse events, will be graded and summarized according to the 
NCI-CTCAE ( Attachment 6). Any  clinically  significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the 
study  will be followed by [CONTACT_43727] a clinically  stable endpoint is 
reach ed. The following evaluations of safet y will be performed at time points specified in the 
Time and Events Schedule.
Cardiac Function
The cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction should be evaluated by [CONTACT_27915] (ECHO if MUGA 
unavailable) before and after study treatment using the same assessment modality; subjects with 
prior anthracy cline 350mg/m2will have evaluations at baseline and every  3cycles thereafter 
(eg, Day 1 Cycle4, Day 1 Cycle7). ECGs should be done within 4weeks before randomization 
and Day 1 Cycle4 and every  3cycles thereafter (eg, Day 1 Cycle4, Day 1 Cycle7), and 
End-of- Treatment (see Section 11.9 for details); serum potassium <3.5 mM should be corrected 
before any ECG is recorded. At selected study  sites, when PK sampling is Day 1 Cycle1, an 
ECG should be recorded 2 hours after study  drug dose. ECGs (12-lead) should be recorded at a 
paper speed of 25 mm/sec until 4 regular consecutive complexes are available. 
Computer -generated interpretations of ECGs should be reviewed for data integ rity and 
reasonableness b y the investigator. 
Physical Examination
Physical examinations, including weight, should be conducted at every visit; height will be 
recorded at baseline only. Subject weight will be measured with the subject lightly  clothed and 
without shoes. Any clinically  significant change in physical findings noted during the study 
should be reported as an adverse event. Any clinically  significant abnormalities persisting at the 
end of the study  should be followed by [CONTACT_70438] a 
clinically  stable endpoint. 
Vital Signs 
Upright sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], and oral or aural body  temperature, 
should be recorded. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples for hematology  and chemist ry will be taken for evaluation of laboratory  safety 
parameters (Attachment 7). The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015review, and record any clinically  relevant changes during the study  in the adverse event section 
of the eCRF. Baseline values, including Screening coagulation and dipstick urinaly sis, should be 
measured within [ADDRESS_742037] dose of study  treatment.
9.4. Biomarker Evaluation
Circulating levels of adrenal steroids, including DHEA and its sulphate, DHEA- S, positivel y 
correlate with ER+/PR+ breast cancers (Eliassen 2006 ;Key 2002) and in vitro data indicate 
these ligands stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in a low-estrogen environment 
(Maggiolini 1999). These ligands function as weak ER agonists, indicating that stero idogenic 
enzy mes upstream of aromatase may also contribute to disease progression (Chan 2002) by 
[CONTACT_564865]. Abiraterone is expected to attenuate 
this activity  by [CONTACT_564878].
9.4.1. Formalin -Fixed Paraffin -Embedded Tumor Tissue
To determine study  eligibility , prior to randomization an FFPE tumor sample will be assessed for 
ER, PR, and Her2. In addition to these markers, samples may also be analy zed for expression 
levels of intratumoral nuclear AR, CYP17, CYP19, Ki-67, and 3-HSD by 
[CONTACT_564879] (FISH). Samples may also be 
analyzed for miRNA expression levels to define molecular subtypes of breast cancer or for 
mutations or amplification of the ERα gene, K303R or for other biomarkers (e.g. mRNA, 
somatic anomalies) . 
9.4.2. Endocrine Markers
For every  subject, blood samples (15mL) for assessment of endocrine biomarkers will be taken 
Day 1 of C ycles 1 through 3, and every  3cycles thereafter (eg, Day 1 Cycle 6, Day 1 Cy cle9) up 
to, and including Day 1 Cycle 12,and atthe End-of-Treatment visit. Estradiol, testosterone, and 
estrone levels will be evaluated for all subjects. Additional androgens or estrogens may also be 
evaluated. 
9.4.3. Circulating Tumor Cells 
Blood samples (40 mLwhere local regulations permit) will be taken Day 1 of Cy cles1 and 2 and 
during the End-of- Treatment visit for enumeration and characterization of CTCs and biomarkers 
such as AR, ER, PR, Her2, CYP17, CYP19, or other candidate markers. Other molecular 
analyses (eg, RNA or DNA based) may also be conducted. Sites will be notified when a subject’s

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Day [ADDRESS_742038].
9.4.4. Fresh Tumor Biopsies (Selected Study  Sites)
Consent to biopsy  metastasized or primary  tumor will be sought from subjects with superficial 
disease easily  and safely amenable to successive tumor biopsies at selected study  sites. Consent 
will be obtained for a biopsy  at baseline and at least 1 treatment phase time point. If consent is 
granted for 3 time points, biopsies will be taken at screening , Day 1 Cycle3, and Day 1 Cycle5; 
missing time points will not be considered protocol violatio ns. Biomarker studies may include 
global miRNA and gene -expression profiling, somatic mutational profiling,
immunohistochemistry  or FISH analyses of AR, ER, PR, Her2, CYP17, CYP19, Ki-67, and 
3β-HSD. Additional androgens and estrogens also may be evaluated.
9.5. Pharmacogenomics Evaluation
There are [ADDRESS_742039] cancer. Stored DNA samples will be 
double -coded and stored for a period of 5 years after the Clinical Study  Report is issued. 
Subjects may  participate in either part, neither part, or both parts, where l ocal regulations permit.
9.6. Pharmacokinetics Evaluation (Selected Study Sites)
Evaluations
The twent y (20) subjects/treatment group will participat ein PK assessments onDays1 and 15 of 
Cycle1 for collection of serial venous blood samples (2mL, abiraterone acetate; 4mL,

10. SUBJECT COMPLETION/W ITHDRA WAL
10.1. Completion
A subject will be considered as having completed the Treatment phase if she completes 
assessments until experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  or medical conditio n 
that precludes further study  treatment. A subject will be considered as having completed the 
study  if she completes Treatment and Follow -Up phases ( total study  duration will be extended up 
to September 2018 ).
Under Amendment INT-6, the long-term follow -up phase will be stopped, and subjects in long-
term follow up will be discontinued from the study  (see Attachment 10).
10.2. Discontinuation of Study Drug
Notification of study  drug discontinuation for disease progression should be made to the sponsor 
by [CONTACT_564880]. Once 
the sponsor has been notified of an acceptable reason for study  treatment discontinuation, the 
subject can be discontinued from study drug(s) and entered into the Follow -Up phase after the 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
51
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015End-of- Treatment visit. An exception to the discontinuation rule can be made if the treatment 
discontinuation is being made for safety  reasons. The End-of-Treatment visit should be 
scheduled within 30days after the final dose of study  drug. When a subject withdraws consent 
for study  treatment but is willing to continue in the study , posttreatment follow -up should report 
overall survival, subsequent non-study  anti-breast- cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (with start and stop dates), 
and PRO score.
At disease progression, subjects randomized to exemestane alone may  be switched to abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone at the discretion of the investigator after notify ingthe sponsor ; if not 
switched, these subjects must be discontinued from study  drug after notifying the sponsor . Those 
subjects who cross -over to abiraterone acetate from exemestane will complete study  visits 
starting again with Day 1 Cycle 1. However, the subjects that cross -over will not be required to 
provide additional samples for the sub-studies (i.e., PK, biopsy ), or have further samples 
collected for biomarker, endocrine, CTCs and pharmacogenomic evaluations. At disease 
progression, subjects randomized to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane must be discontinued from study  drug. 
In addition, an investigator may  discontinue study drug for any  of the following reasons:
Dosing noncompliance
Unacceptable toxicity
Medical condition not ser ved b y continuing stud y drug treatment 
Administration of prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_564847]
10.3. Withdrawal From the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the following reasons:
Loss to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent
Death
If a subjec t is lost to follow -up, every  reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_564881]. If a subject withdraws consent, the End-of- Treatment study  visit should be 
completed within [ADDRESS_742042]. Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced.

Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
52
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015A subject who withdraws from the study  will have the following options regarding 
pharmacogenomic research:
The DNA extracted from the subject's blood will be retai ned and used in accordance with the 
subject's original pharmacogenomic informed consent.
The subject may withdraw consent for pharmacogenomic research, in which case the DNA 
sample will be destro yed and no further testing will take place. To initiate the sample 
destruction process, the investigator must notify  the sponsor site contact [CONTACT_564882]. The sponsor site contact [INVESTIGATOR_1318], in turn, contact [CONTACT_62253]/pharmacogenomics 
representatives to execute sample destruction. If requested, the investigator will receive 
written confirmation from the sponsor that the sample has been destro yed.
Withdrawal From Pharmacogenomics Research Only
A subject may withdraw consent for pharmacogenomic research while remaining in the clinical 
study . In such a case, any DNA extracted from the subject’s blood will be destroy ed. The sample 
destruction process will proceed as described above. 
11. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analy sis will be done by  [CONTACT_564883]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze efficacy  and safet y data is outlined 
below. Specific details are provided in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan.
Unless otherwise specified, continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive stat istics, 
which will include subject number, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical endpoints will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. The baseline 
measurement will be the last value on or before the first dose of st udy medication. 
11.1. Sample Size Determination
The primary  analysis consists of 2 pair-wise comparisons of the experimental treatment groups 
(abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with 
exemestane) with the reference treatment group (exemestane alone). For each of the pair-wise 
comparisons, the statistical tests of treatment effects on primary  endpoint of PFS will be 
conducted independently at the 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_742043] ratio of any pair-wise comparison (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and 
abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane, each compared with exemestane 
alone) is 0.65 (median PFS 6.2 and 4.0months, respectivel y), the study  has 80% power at a 
significance level of 0.10 ( 2-sided) to demonstrate a treatment difference with approximately  150 
PFS events i n each pair-wise comparison. Assuming an enrollment rate of 20 subjects per month 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
53
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015for 15months, a total sample size of approximately 300 subjects (100 subjects per group) is 
planned. In the case that randomization to [ADDRESS_742044] disposition and efficacy  analyses will be performed on data from the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
population. All randomized subjects included in the ITT analysis will be classif ied according to 
assigned treatment group, regardless of actual treatment received. The primary  efficacy  analyses 
will be on the ITT population . 
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study  drug will be included in the analysis of safet y 
(Safet y Popu lation).
11.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic variables will include age, race, ethnicity , height, and weight. Baseline disease 
characteristics (documented in the source documents and eCRF) will include time since 
diagnosis, disease sites, prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (how many  and whether nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor 
was given in adjuvant or metastatic setting), duration of stable disease during prior aromatase 
inhibitor therapy , and hormone receptor status. 
11.4. Efficacy  Analyses
11.4.1. Primary  Efficacy  Endp oint
The primary  efficacy  endpoint, PFS, is measured from time of randomization to first occurrence 
of one of the following:
Disease progression as defined in Section 9.2.1
Death from an y cause
11.4.2. Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
Overall survival will be measure d from date of randomization to date of death from any 
cause. Survival time of living subjects will be censored on the last date a subject is known to 
be alive or lost to follow-up.
Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects fulfilling respective criteria for 
response over the total number of subjects in the ITT population. Overall response for 
measurable disease is defined as a subject having a best overall response of either complete 
response or partial response based on RECI ST (Attachment 1). 
PROs: EORTC -C30, EQ-5D- 5L, and BPI-SF pain intensity  scale scores (Attachment 2,

biomarkers)
PK characterization of abiraterone and exemestane
Other efficacy  endpoints include ECOG (Attachment 8), pharmacogenomics evaluations, CTC 
characterization, and bio marker evaluations in fresh tumor biopsies.
11.4.3. Analyses Methods
Distributions of time-to-event variables will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit 
method . Median times to event with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be estimated. The 
stratifi ed log-rank test will be used as the primary  analysis for treatment comparison. ACox 
proportional -hazards model will be used to provide estimates of hazard ratios with 95% 
confidence intervals.
The relative risk (treatment:control) will be reported along with the associated 95% confidence 
interval. Statistical inference will be evaluated using Chi-square statistic; the Fisher’s exact test 
may be used if the expected counts in some cells are small.
Scores from EORTC -C30, EQ-5D- 5L, and BPI-SF pain intensity  scale will be descriptively  
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Longitudinal analy sis with repeated measures may be used as 
appropriate.
11.5. Biomarker A nalyses  
Biomarker studies are designed to identify  markers predictive of response (or resistance) to 
abirateron e. The following biomarkers may be analy zed: 
protein levels quantified by [CONTACT_564884] (AR, ER, PR, Her2, CYP17, 
CYP19, Ki -67, and 3β -HSD)
serum endocrine biomarkers (estradiol, testosterone, and estrone)
CTCs
gene expression, miRNA or somatic mutation profiling
The associations of the above biomarkers with clinical response or time-to-event endpoints will 
be assessed using the appropriate statistical methods (analy sis of variance [ANOVA], 
categorical, or survival model), depending on the endpoint.
Analy ses will be performed within each treatment group and difference by [CONTACT_564885]. 
Correlation of baseline expression levels or changes in expression levels with response or 
time-to-event endpoints will identify  responsive (or resistant) subgroups. For expression- related 
analyses, evaluations will determ ine whether patterns of expression change with acquired 
resistance to treatment.

The PK population will include all subjects with sufficient and interpretable PK assessments to 
estimate the noncompartmental PK parameters. PK parameter estimations of abiraterone and 
exemestane will be summarized by [CONTACT_496175]. The plasma 
abiraterone and exemestane concentrations of at each time point will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_564886]. Individual and mean plasma concentration -time profiles 
of abiraterone and exemestane will be plotted by [CONTACT_1570]. All subjects and samples 
excluded from analysis will be clearl y documented in the study  report. Further exploratory  PK 
analyses may  be per formed, as deemed appropriate.
11.7. Safety  Analyses
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study  drug will be analyzed for safety . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) system and graded according to the NCI-CTCAE. Adverse events will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_6657], and will be presented overall and by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Deaths and other serious adverse events will be provided in a listing. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events resulting in study  drug discontinuation, dose modification, 
and dose interruption or delay  will also be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_11702]. Other safety 
endpoints, including vital signs, clinical laboratory  parameters, and ECG, will be summ arized 
descriptivel y. Shift tables for select laboratory  parameters will be presented. No formal statistical 
analyses are planned.
11.8. Interim A nalysis
One interim analysis is scheduled when a total of approximately  110 (50%) of the PFS events 
have occurred. The interim analy sis is expected to occur after approximately  75 PFS events in 
each of the 2 pair-wise comparisons: 1) abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus exemestane 
alone, 2)abiraterone acetate plus prednisone combined with exemestane versus exeme stane 
alone. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564848]-based futility  and efficacy  were calculated using East®
software. Gamma -famil y spending functions determined the TypeI error rate of 10% (2-sided) 
and TypeII error rate of 20% for each comparison. After the review of interim data, the Data 
Review Committee (DRC) will make recommendations regarding the continuation of the study .
11.9. Data Review  Committee
A DRC will be formed to monitor data on a regular basis to ensure the safet y of the subjects 
enrolled in this stu dy and to meet efficacy  objectives. The DRC will consist of at least [ADDRESS_742045] 1 statistician. Details regarding DRC responsibilities and 
interim analy sis procedures will be provided in a separate DRC charter.
In addition to the planned interim analy sis (Section 11.8), the DRC will meet periodicall y to 
review the cumulative safety  data collected. One safety  review by  [CONTACT_564887]

12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety  information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
[CONTACT_23824]. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a 
medicinal (inve stigational or noninvestigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) 
product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. 
Note: Definition is according to the International Conference on Ha rmonisation (I CH).
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adver se events starting with the signing of the informed consent form 
(refer to Section 12.3.1, All Adverse Events, for time of last adverse event recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event, based on ICHand EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance forMedicinal 
Products for Human Use , is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused de ath if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
57
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life threaten ing or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43714] 1 of the outcomes listed in the definition above. These 
should usually  be considered serious.
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safe ty Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity  is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safet y information. For an investigational product, the expectedness 
of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_83408]’s 
Brochure. For a non-sponsor investigational medicinal product (eg, a comparator product) with a 
marketing authorization, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_564888]. 
Adverse Event Associated with the Use of the Drug
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, 
probable, or very  likel y by [CONTACT_23826] 12.1.2. 
12.1.2. Attribution Defini tions
Not related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causa l relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, 
eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal rela tionship cannot be excluded.
Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg,confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease( s).
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
58
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Very likely
An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained 
by [CONTACT_4867], eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship 
in time is very  suggestive (eg, it is confirm ed by [CONTACT_35719]).
12.1.3. Severity Criteria 
The NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0will be used to grade the severit y of adverse events. Adverse 
events not listed in the NCI -CTCAE Version 4.0 will be graded as follows.
Grade 1: Mild adverse event; asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only ; intervention not indicated
Grade 2: Moderate adverse event; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily  living
Grade 3: Sever e or medically  significant but not immediately  life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily 
living
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated
Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event
12.2. Special Reporting Situations
Safety  events of interest on a sponsor medicinal product that may require expedited reporting 
and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of a sponsor medicinal product
Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor medicinal product
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a sponsor medicinal product
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the 
sponsor medicinal product, eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the eCRF.
12.3. Procedures
12.3.1. All Adverse Events
All adverse events, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and 
dated informed consent form is obtained until [ADDRESS_742046] be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor 
will evaluate any  safety  information that is spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_564889].

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Disease progression will not be reported as an adverse event, as this information will be used for 
assessment of efficacy endpoints. However, the signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae 
resulting from disease progression will be reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event 
definition (see Section 12.1.1, Adverse Event Definitions and Classification). All adverse events, 
regardless of seriousness, severit y, or presumed relationship to study  therapy , must be recorded 
using medical terminology  in the source document and the eCRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses 
should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology  (eg, cough, runny  nose, 
sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_23739]”). 
Investigators must record in the eCRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_564849] . All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in 
the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions.
The sponsor assumes responsibility  for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory  
authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator and the head of the investigational 
institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) .The 
investigator (or sponsor where required) must report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate Independent 
Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/I RB) that approved the protocol unless 
otherwise required and documented b y the IEC/IRB . 
Subjects (or their designees, if appropriate) must be provided with a “study card” indicating the 
name [CONTACT_439709], the study number , the investigator ’s name, a 24-hour 
emergency contact [CONTACT_6227] , and, if applicable, excluded concomi tant medications.
12.3.2. Serious A dverse Events
All serious adverse events occurring during clinical studies must be reported to the appropriate 
sponsor contact [CONTACT_564890] [ADDRESS_742047] be completed and signed by a member of the investigational 
staff, and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow -up reports of a 
serious adverse event should be made b y facsimile (fax) .
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054] , or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’ s participation in the study , must be followed until 
any of the following occurs:
The event resolves
The event stabilizes
The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value is available
The event can be attributed to agents other than the study  drug or to factors unrelated to study 
conduct

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015Every  effort should be made to ensure that all subjective measure ments (eg,pain scale 
information or other questionnaires) to be recorded in the eCRF are complete d by [CONTACT_97527]. The investigator must verify  that all data 
entries in the eCRF s are accurate and correct.
All eCRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by [CONTACT_564902] -site personnel. If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool. The 
investigator or an authorized member of the investigational staff must adjust the eCRF (if 
applicable) and complete the query . 
If corrections to aneCRF are needed after the initial entry  into the eCRF , this can be done in [ADDRESS_742051] s:
Site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to 
an auto query  (generated by  [CONTACT_66832])
Site manager can generate a query  for resolu tion by  [CONTACT_71378]
Clinical data manager can generate a query  for resolution by  [CONTACT_71378]
17.6. Data Quality  Assurance/Quality  Control
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of quali fied 
investigators and appropriate study  centers, review of protocol procedures with the investigator 
and associated personnel before the study , and periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456], and 
direct transmission of clinical laboratory  data from a centr al laboratory  into the sponsor’s data 
base. Written instructions will be provided for collection, preparation, and shipment of blood, 
plasma, and urine samples. 
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study  personnel before the 
start of the study .The sponsor will review eCRFs for accuracy  and completeness during on-site 
monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with 
the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of thedata into the clinical study
database they  will be verified for accuracy .
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take meas ures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing

Abiraterone acetate:  Clini cal Protocol 212082BCA2001 –Amendment INT -7
71
Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study  
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the inv estigator must permit access to such reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  center visit log that will be kept at the site. The first post-
initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the 
monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source 
documents). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all 
sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and 
investigational staff and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_350975]. If electronic 
records are maintained at the inves tigational site, the method of verification must be discussed 
with the investigational staff. 
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the data recorded in the eCRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings 
from this review of eCRFs and source documents will be discussed with the investigational staff. 
The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant investigational staff will be 
available, the source documentatio n will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last visit of the last subject participating in the study .
The final data from the investigational site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after 
completion of the final subject visit at that site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 201517.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study  at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Investigational sites will be closed upon 
study  completion. An investigational site is considered closed when all required documents and 
study  supplies have been collected and a site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of an investigational site by  [CONTACT_43218]:
Failure of the investiga tor to comply  with the protocol, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP 
guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by  [CONTACT_093]
Discontinuation of further drug development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor’s clinical quality  assurance department may visit the site at any 
time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance with 
regulatory  guidelines and compan y policy . These audits will require access to all study  records, 
including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the eCRFs. Subject privacy  
must, however, be respected. The investigator and staff are responsible for being present and 
available for consultation during routinel y scheduled site audit visits conducted by  [CONTACT_97531]. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if they have been 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.
17.11. Use of Information and Publication
All information, including but not limited to information regarding abiraterone acetate or the 
sponsor’s operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific 
data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by [CONTACT_66894], and any data, including pharmacogenomic research data, generated as 
a result of this study , areconsidered confidential and remain the sole property  of the sponsor. 
The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only 
to accomplish this study , and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent.

Status: Approved Date: 27April 2015The investigator understands that the information developed in the clinical study  will be used by 
[CONTACT_564903], and thus may 
be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory  agencies. To permit the 
information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide 
the sponsor with all data obtained in the study .
The results of the study  will be reported in a Clinical Study  Report generated by [CONTACT_443750] . Recruitment 
performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the 
study  will be used to determine a coordinating investigator . Study  subject identifiers will not be 
used in publication of pharmacogenomic results. Any work created in connection with 
performance of the study  and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection 
(except any publication by [CONTACT_40999]) shall be the propert y of the 
sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work. 
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors guidelines , the sponsor shall have the right to publish such data and information without 
approval from the investigator. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study ,a 
copy  of the manuscr ipt must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60days before 
submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, 
poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by [CONTACT_97533], the inves tigator 
will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow for filing of a patent 
application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrit y or regulatory  compliance, 
the sponsor will review these issues with the invest igator. The sponsor will not mandate 
modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For
multicenter study  designs and substudy  approaches, results may need to be published in a given 
sequence (eg,substudies) shoul d not generally  be published before the primary  endpoints of a 
study  have been published. Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrit y of a multicenter 
study by [CONTACT_443751], within 12months after conclusion, abandonment, 
or termination of the study  at all sites, or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study  
publication. Authorship of publications resulting from thisstudy  will be based on the guidelines 
on authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted 
to Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant 
contribution to the design of the st udy or analy sis and interpretation of the data, provided critical 
review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version.
Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results
The sponsor will register and/or disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as 
required b y law.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumo rs (RECIST)
Eligibility
RECIST criteria w ill be used on measurable soft tissue and visceral lesions.
–Measurable disease is the presence of at least one measurable lesion . If the measurable disease is restricted 
to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology. 
–Measurable lesions : Visceral or extranodal lesions need to be [ADDRESS_742058]; 
however, lymph nodes need to be [ADDRESS_742059] one dimension to be considered as target or evaluable 
lesions to assess changes in size.
–Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diam eter <20mm), 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdom inal masses that are not confirmed and follow ed by [CONTACT_28171]. 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 
14days before the beginning of the treatment; nodal and visceral/extranodal disease will be recorded separately.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable 
lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], incl uding a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Methods of Measurem ent
CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for 
response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 10mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_36894] a  5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm . 
Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by
[CONTACT_6776] . How ever, CT is preferable. 
Ultrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumor lesions. 
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between Partial Response and Com plete Response in rare 
cases (eg, after treat ment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions).

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
Baseline Documentation of TARGET and NON -TARGET Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5  lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the long est diameter) and their suitability 
for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). 
A sum of the longest diam eter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. 
The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to characterize the objective tumor.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absen ce of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up. 
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Com plete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum L D
Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started 
or the appearance of one or more new  lesions
Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
Com plete Response: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level

Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The Best Overall Response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for Progressive Disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). In general, the subject’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measur ement and confirmation criteria.

Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.” Every 
effort should be made to docum ent the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation 
of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated 
(fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.

Modified Schedule of Events for Subjects Continuing to Receive Study  Medicati onUnder Amendment 
INT-6 (after the Clinical Cut Off Date for Final Analysis)
The final analysis of Study  212082BCA2001 occurred as planned. The results did not show a 
significant benefit in PFS (the primary  endpoint of the study ) of adding abiraterone acetate to 
exemestane. Furthermore, there was a slight increase in reported adverse events for the 
abiraterone acetate group and the abiraterone acetate plus exemestane group compared with
exemestane alone. This was most notable for hypokal emia, hypertension, and infections and 
infestations. No drug -related deaths were observed.
However, individual subjects might derive benefit from their current treatment with continued 
control of disease in the absence of significant toxicity . Therefore, the study  has been amended 
to allow subjects to continue to receive their current study medication. As well, the number of 
required stud y-related procedures and amount of data to be collected have been reduced. 
For subjects continuing on study  medication, a final study  follow-up visit will occur within 
30days after the last dose of study  medication is administered. Subjects who elect not to 
continue on study  medication andthose currently in long-term follow -up will be discontinued 
from the study . At thattime final patient disposition for these subjects will be recorded in the 
eCRF.
The study  will be considered completed when the last subject completes the last study  visit.
The following outlines instructions for the follow -up of subjects who continue to receive study 
medication u nder Amendment I NT-6.
Study Evaluations to be Performed Under Amendment INT -6
Only serious adverse event information will be collected and drug accountability  performed
according to the Schedule of Events below . However, no further data will be collected in the 
eCRF. Assessments not specified in the Schedule of Events areat the discretion of the 
investigator .Investigators should monitor and assess the subjects according to routine practice. 
No further efficacy  data are being collected by  [CONTACT_97280].
Information regarding serious adverse events (as defined in Section 12.3.2 ) will be transmitted to 
the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be completed and signed by a 
member of the investigational staff, and transmitted to the sponsor within 24hours. The initial 
and follow -up reports of a serious adverse event should be made by [CONTACT_6972] (fax). No other 
safet y data will be collected by  [CONTACT_456]. An End -of-Treatment Visit or phone c all for a safety 
assessment should take place within [ADDRESS_742082] dose of study  medication is 
administered .

20September 2015) as long as the subject, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is receiving benefit 
and not experiencing unacceptable toxicity ; or until such time that the subject needs to start other 
anti-cancer treatment, withdraws consent, or at the investigator’s/subject’s decision. At the end 
of the 2- year period, the situation will be reassessed for subjects still receiving study  medication. 
During the treatm ent phase, subjects will continue to receive daily  treatment with abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone and/or exemestane as they were up to the time of this 
amendment and according to the dosing regimens outlined in Section 6Dosage and 
Administration. Subject’s visits will be registered in the interactive voice response system, and 
the dispensing of study  medication and drug accountability  will occur every  3 m onths. Subjects 
will be supplied with 3 months of study  drug at each visit. For consistency , the subjects will not 
restart their cycle number. Cy cle “X” will be the first cy cle under Amendment INT-6.

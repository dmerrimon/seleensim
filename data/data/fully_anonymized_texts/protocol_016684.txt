We hypothesize that the use of meal replacement therapy with financial incentives (vs. no financial incentives) will lead to greater percent reduction in BMI (primary endpoint) as well as reduce body fat, blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, and improve heart rate variability at 26 and 52 weeks.    Secondary Objectives: Identify weight loss thresholds associated with significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular health in adolescents with severe obesity.  We hypothesize that a minimum weight loss threshold exists, that when exceeded, will be associated with meaningful improvements in multiple cardiometabolic risk factors and parameters of vascular health. Number of Participants 130 Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria Diagnosis: Severe obesity Main Inclusion Criteria: • BMI ≥1.2 times the 95th percentile (based on sex and age) or BMI ≥35 kg/m2 • Age 13-17 years Study Intervention All participants will engage in 52 weeks of meal replacement therapy.  Participants will be randomly assigned to receive financial incentives for weight loss or no financial incentives.  Statistical Methodology The primary analysis will be conducted using the intent-to-treat population to compare the mean BMI percent change from randomization to 52 weeks (additional analyses will use the 26-week time-point as secondary) of follow-up between the financial incentives and no financial incentives groups, adjusted for BMI at randomization and insurance status (randomization stratification factor) for added precision.  Confidence intervals (CIs) and P-values will be based on robust variance estimation.  Statistical significance will be considered as p<0.05.

It will be critically important for pediatricians to have evidence-based weight loss targets for their patients with severe obesity since it will better inform the type and intensity of the treatments selected in clinical practice.  Although evidence-based benchmarks have been established for adults,[ADDRESS_508937] a 12-month randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effects of meal replacement therapy plus financial incentives on weight loss and cardiometabolic/vascular outcomes among 142 adolescents (ages 13-17 years old) with severe obesity and to identify thresholds of weight loss required to achieve clinically-meaningful cardiometabolic/vascular improvements in this patient population.  Importantly, we will be able to characterize the degree of normalization of risk factors and vascular outcomes according to amount of weight loss and compare post-intervention values to a database of youth with normal weight, overweight, and obesity in the same age-range tested in the same laboratory using identical methods.  1.1 Background and Rationale Severe obesity, defined as a BMI ≥20% above the 95th percentile or BMI ≥35 kg/m2, is the fastest growing pediatric obesity category, with a reported prevalence of nearly 6% in the United

Approximately 90% will have a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 in adulthood;[ADDRESS_508940]-risk and ideal treatment approach, conventional lifestyle modification therapy (diet-, exercise-, behavioral counseling), is relatively ineffective when used alone in terms of BMI reduction and cardiometabolic risk factor improvement in adolescents with severe obesity.10-13  Indeed, one relatively large study demonstrated that only 2% of adolescents with severe obesity achieved a clinically-meaningful reduction in BMI after [ADDRESS_508941] when conventional approaches are used, has been comprehensively reviewed in a recently-published scientific statement from the American Heart Association.2  Orlistat is the only weight loss medication approved by [CONTACT_403500].47  Weight loss surgery reduces BMI on the order of 30-40% in adolescents but is not widely available, is associated with greater risk than lifestyle modification therapy or pharmacotherapy, and is often reserved for only those with the most serious co-morbidities.48-[ADDRESS_508942] this difficult-to-treat chronic disease.  The financial incentive model has been used successfully in adult obesity trials to address suboptimal adherence to lifestyle modification therapy and improve weight loss outcomes.14-18  While probably inappropriate for young children, financial incentives may be an effective tool in teens to address ambivalence, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_403484], and improve compliance to obesity interventions, ultimately leading to meaningful behavior change and superior weight loss and risk factor improvement.  Indeed, adherence to behavioral targets is a strong predictor of long-term weight loss success among youth.51  Although yet to be investigated as a weight loss intervention among adolescents, strong rationale supporting this approach can be drawn from evidence demonstrating that financial incentives significantly improved many health-related

Although a relatively new treatment for pediatric severe obesity, meal replacements elicited promising short-term weight loss (BMI reduction of 6% at 4 months) in a recent study of adolescents with severe obesity25 and in a separate ongoing trial being conducted by [CONTACT_27156] (unpublished; data shown in “Preliminary Studies” section).  However, in the published trial, much of the initial weight lost was regained by [CONTACT_403502] 4 and 12 months, owing to diminished adherence to the meal replacement regimen over time.25  Our unique concept is to capi[INVESTIGATOR_403485] (to optimize adherence), which we believe will lead to clinically-meaningful and sustained weight loss, superior risk factor modification, and vascular health improvement in this difficult-to-treat patient population.      This study will afford a unique opportunity to address another key question related to the treatment of pediatric severe obesity: how much weight loss is necessary to elicit clinically-meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, co-morbidities, and vascular health among adolescents with severe obesity?  Acknowledging that most teens with severe obesity will opt for non-surgical interventions, it will be critically important for pediatricians to have evidence-based weight loss targets for their patients with severe obesity since it will better inform the type and intensity of the treatments used in clinical practice and may lead to the establishment of future guidelines.  Although evidence-based benchmarks have been established for adults,[ADDRESS_508944] a clinical trial to determine whether meal replacement therapy plus financial incentives leads to superior weight loss and better health outcomes among adolescents with severe obesity and we will identify the various thresholds of weight loss necessary to achieve specific cardiometabolic risk factor, co-morbidity, and vascular improvements in this unique patient population.  Moreover, we will also be able to describe the degree of normalization of cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular outcomes according to varying amounts of weight reduction and compare (in a cross-sectional fashion) post-intervention values to an existing database of youth with normal weight, overweight, and obesity tested in the same facilities/laboratory using the same protocol and methods.  Beyond body weight/BMI loss, we will also be able to identify thresholds of reduction in absolute and percent total body fat and absolute and percent visceral fat that are associated with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular health. 1.2 Clinical Data to Date Significance and Preliminary Work The significance of, and rationale for, the proposed research are that 1) adolescent severe obesity is a prevalent and serious disease that is extremely difficult to successfully treat; 2) conventional lifestyle modification treatment approaches are rarely effective among adolescents

Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_403503]; and 3) although never before evaluated in youth, the combination of meal replacements and financial incentives represents a novel, promising, and relatively low-risk (compared to medications or surgery) treatment approach.  The nature of severe obesity demands that appropriately-intensive interventions be initiated earlier in life, not later in adulthood when adiposity and co-morbidities have become entrenched.  Indeed, evidence suggests that early interventions targeting adiposity and chronic disease risk factors during childhood is more effective than when instituted in adulthood.8, [ADDRESS_508945] to deliver (clinically-meaningful and sustained weight loss and risk factor management as well as improved vascular health) in this population in need of safe, effective, and durable treatments.  Weight regain has been, and continues to be, a major hurdle in the field of obesity medicine.  The use of financial incentives holds strong promise as a tool to encourage long-term adherence to specific dietary and physical activity regimens.  Drawing from the adult literature, 12-month control-subtracted body weight reductions with financial incentives have ranged from 4-6%.17, 18, [ADDRESS_508946] to observe even greater weight loss efficacy in our trial owing to the concurrent use of meal replacement therapy.  Therefore, the magnitude of weight loss and risk factor/vascular improvement with our novel intervention has the potential to exceed all other lifestyle modification treatment approaches studied to date.    Our second study aim will address an equally significant and highly-relevant unanswered question regarding the treatment of pediatric patients with severe obesity.  We will describe for the first time, the thresholds of weight loss required to elicit clinically-meaningful improvements in specific cardiometabolic risk factors and measures of vascular health among youth with severe obesity.  Pediatricians need evidence regarding the amount of weight loss they should strive to achieve for their pediatric patients with severe obesity since it will inform the type and intensity of the treatment approach.  Although evidence-based benchmarks have been established for adults,[ADDRESS_508947], pre-determined meal regimen removes the “guess-work” from eating.  A recent study by [CONTACT_403504].25 demonstrated promising short-term weight loss efficacy (BMI reduction of approximately 6%) in adolescents with severe obesity using meal replacements for a period of 4 months.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_403486], adherence to the meal replacement regimen was suboptimal even over the short-term (baseline to month 4) and worsened from months 4 to 12 with a parallel trajectory of weight regain.25  Therefore, meal replacement therapy appears to be a promising weight loss intervention for adolescents with severe obesity;

CONFIDENTIAL This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_403505], efforts to improve short- and long-term adherence using strategies like financial incentives would likely enhance outcomes.  Figure 1. Weight Loss with Meal Replacement Therapy in Adolescents with Severe Obesity   We are currently conducting a clinical trial that includes a 4-week meal replacement induction period (prior to randomization to topi[INVESTIGATOR_237588]) and have observed promising BMI reduction in adolescents with severe obesity (N=19).  Mean BMI reduction was 3.2% in only four weeks (Figure 1).  These data are consistent with the findings of Berkowitz and colleagues25 and demonstrate the feasibility of meal replacement therapy in our hands.  Anecdotally, our participants have had a very positive experience with the meal replacement program and reported high levels of satisfaction with the degree of weight reduction in such a short period of time and with the convenience of the treatment regimen.      Effectiveness of Financial Incentives in Improving Weight Loss and Health Outcomes The use of financial incentives to improve health is gaining in popularity among users, employers, and health groups.[ADDRESS_508948] reported weight loss outcomes of between 4-6%.17, 18, [ADDRESS_508949] been shown to improve other health-related behaviors in adolescents.  Compared to a control condition with only 30% compliance with wearing a physical activity accelerometer, teens who received financial incentives had a compliance rate of nearly 55%, almost double that of the controls.19  In another trial, over 35% of adolescent smokers who received financial incentives were able to quit smoking vs. 0% with cognitive behavior therapy alone.[ADDRESS_508950] completed the 1-month meal replacement period (prior to randomization to drug or placebo) in our ongoing previously-mentioned clinical trial, we compared cardiometabolic risk factor outcomes between those achieving ≥4% (N=7) vs. <4% (N=12) BMI reduction (Figure 2).  Note: comparisons of thresholds of 1%, 2%, and 3% BMI reduction did not yield either statistically-significant or clinically-meaningful improvements in risk factors at these lower levels of weight loss.  Although a much larger sample size will be required to sufficiently identify important and relevant thresholds of BMI reduction, these preliminary data suggest that 4% BMI reduction elicits significant and clinically-meaningful improvements in multiple cardiometabolic risk factors among teens with severe obesity (>10% improvements in many of the risk factors).

Our database, which continues to grow, currently contains data from over [ADDRESS_508952]-weight loss cardiometabolic and vascular outcomes (non-invasively measured arterial stiffness and heart rate variability) of the adolescents with severe obesity in the proposed trial to those in the normal weight, overweight, and obese groups in the database in order to characterize the level of improvement.

We hypothesize that a minimum weight loss threshold exists, that when exceeded, will be associated with meaningful improvements in multiple cardiometabolic risk factors and parameters of vascular health. 3 Study Design 3.1 General Design This will be a 52-week randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effects of meal replacement therapy plus financial incentives on weight loss, cardiometabolic/vascular outcomes, and behavior change among 130 adolescents (ages 13-17 years old) with severe obesity and to identify the various thresholds of weight loss required to achieve cardiometabolic/vascular improvements in this patient population.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_403509] (public/Medicaid vs. private), which is a highly-quantifiable variable and is closely associated with family income and socioeconomic status.  Throughout the entire study, all participants (regardless of financial incentives status) will engage in meal replacement therapy designed to achieve sustained weight loss.  In an effort to maximize the rigor of the study design, we will utilize deception.  Upon recruitment, participants will be informed that they will be participating in a trial evaluating the effect of meal replacement therapy on weight loss – we will not mention the financial incentives component.  Following randomization, participants allocated to the financial incentives group will be informed of the true nature of the study and asked to sign an addendum assent form (parents will sign the parental consent) detailing the financial incentives protocol.  Participants allocated to the control group will remain blinded throughout the trial and will be informed of the true nature of the study once the project is fully completed.   3.2 Primary and Secondary Study Endpoints The primary analysis will be conducted using the intent-to-treat population to compare the mean BMI percent change from randomization to 52 weeks (additional analyses will use the 26-week time-point as secondary) of follow-up between the financial incentives and no financial incentives groups, adjusted for BMI at randomization and insurance status (randomization stratification factor) for added precision.  Confidence intervals (CIs) and P-values will be based on robust variance estimation.  Statistical significance will be considered as p<0.05.  Secondary endpoints of body fat, blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, heart rate variability, and adherence to the meal replacement regimen will be characterized at [ADDRESS_508954] Selection and Withdrawal 4.1 Inclusion Criteria • BMI ≥1.2 times the 95th percentile (based on sex and age) or BMI ≥35 kg/m2 • 13-17 years old 4.2 Exclusion Criteria • Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus • Previous (within 6 months) or current use of meal replacements • Previous (within 6 months) or current use of medication(s) prescribed primarily for weight loss (refer to appendix material for comprehensive list) • If currently using weight altering drug(s) for non-obesity indication(s) (refer to appendix material for comprehensive list), any change in drug(s) or dose within the previous 6 months • Previous bariatric surgery • If currently using anti-hypertensive medication(s), lipid medication(s), and/or medication(s) to treat insulin resistance (refer to appendix material for comprehensive list), any change in drug(s) or dose within the previous 6 months • If currently using CPAP/BIPAP (for sleep apnea), change in frequency of use or settings within the previous 6 months • History of treatment with growth hormone • Neurodevelopmental disorder severe enough to impair ability to comply with study protocol • Clinical diagnosis of bipolar illness, schizophrenia, and/or conduct disorder • Substance abuse • Females: currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant • Tobacco use • Bulimia nervosa • Endorsement of vomiting, laxative use, and/or diuretic use for weight control (EDE-Q) • Binge eating disorder • Neuromuscular disorder • Hypothalamic obesity • Obesity associated with genetic disorder (monogenetic obesity) • Hyperthyroidism or uncontrolled hypothyroidism • History of cholelithiasis

Additional recruitment strategies may include advertisements, study-specific recruitment letters sent to potentially-eligible patients in the respective health systems of the MN-POC (Fairview for the University of Minnesota), and word of mouth.  Appropriate designees will discuss study participation with interested participants and their parents at which time the initial consent and assent discussion will be conducted.  4.3 Early Withdrawal of Participants  4.3.1 When and How to Withdraw Participants Participants may withdraw from the trial at any time.  The study may also be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_458], medical officer, or IRB for any reason.  Participants who discontinue participation and withdraw consent/assent will not complete follow-up visits.  However, participants who are not fully compliant with the protocol and/or who choose to stop the intervention altogether but do not withdraw consent will remain in the study for follow-up in order to preserve the ability to perform an ITT analysis.  Upon completion of the trial or upon complete withdrawal from the trial, participants will be referred back to their primary care physician, if applicable.  4.3.[ADDRESS_508955] to follow-up if no response is obtained after three attempts.   5 Treatment  5.1 Treatment Regimen All participants will engage in meal replacement therapy throughout the entire 52-week treatment period.  Participants will be randomized (1:1) to either financial incentives or no financial incentives.  5.2 Method for Assigning Participants to Treatment Groups Each participant will be randomly assigned (1:1) to financial incentives or no financial incentives using permuted blocks of size 2, 4, or 6.  For eligible participants who are randomized, a randomization number will be assigned starting with R001 and numbered sequentially.    5.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy Concomitant medication(s) status will be collected at the baseline visit.  Changes in concomitant medication(s) will be assessed during follow-up visits.    6 Study Procedures Participants will be asked to withhold all medication(s), if applicable, for study visits.  Table 1 shows the procedures to be performed and data to be collected at each study visit (please refer to the detailed breakdown of visits following the table for comprehensive list of assessments/procedures).  Phone calls will be made monthly to assess adverse events, compliance, and deliver lifestyle/behavioral modification counseling.  All participants, regardless of assignment, will receive modest reimbursement for completing study visit assessments (separate from the financial incentive payments described later).

Total percent body fat, visceral fat (novel feature of the iDXA), and lean muscle mass will be determined by [CONTACT_11323] x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE Healthcare).  The scanning table accommodates body sizes of up to [ADDRESS_508958] between the acromial process and the bony olecranon.  Sitting blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the participant has been resting quietly without legs crossed for 10 minutes.  Measurements will be made three consecutive times (3-minute intervals).  The final two of three independent measurements will be averaged.  6.10.3 Blood Analyses Fasting (≥8 hours) blood (approximately 2 tablespoons) will be collected for the measurement of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total-, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides), glucose, and insulin (to be assayed in Fairview Diagnostics Laboratories, Fairview-University Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN - a Center for Disease Control and Prevention certified laboratory).  Fasting samples for C-reactive protein and oxidized LDL cholesterol will be processed and stored at -80 degrees C for a batched analysis in the University of Minnesota Cytokine Reference Laboratory (CLIA licensed).    6.10.4 Lifestyle/Behavioral Modification Counseling All participants, regardless of group assignment, will receive the same lifestyle/behavioral modification counseling monthly throughout the entire study: delivered at each in-person study visit and on the phone for months when there is no study visit.  The lifestyle/behavioral modification curriculum has been adapted from the NIDDK-sponsored TODAY study lifestyle modification program materials57 and utilized by [CONTACT_67933] a previous58 and ongoing trial.  Trained study coordinators will deliver the lifestyle/behavioral modification counseling, which will focus on small, successive changes in dietary (after meal replacement induction period) and physical activity behaviors through the use of evidence-based behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, reinforcement for goal achievement, stimulus control, social support, problem solving, and motivational techniques.  The educational materials will be given to subjects and parents at the first study visit and selected sections will be reviewed and discussed at each face-to-face and phone-based lifestyle modification counseling session.  We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of this lifestyle modification protocol in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial among adolescents with severe obesity.58  The intensity of the lifestyle modification is designed to be practical and feasible in the clinic setting.    6.10.5 Meal Replacement Therapy All participants, regardless of assignment to the financial incentives group or control group, will engage in meal replacement therapy throughout the entire 52-week trial.    Participants will be asked to strictly follow the prescribed eating regimen, which will include provision (home delivery) of pre-packaged meals from Healthy for Life (1,200 kcals per day).  Meals will be provided free of charge.  Guidance will be provided regarding the use of the meals at school, and participants will be encouraged to engage in family meal sessions despi[INVESTIGATOR_403489].  6.10.[ADDRESS_508959] process with clear goals for the participants, financial incentives will be tied to individual percent reduction in body weight (changes in 
  Page 16 
CONFIDENTIAL This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_403512]).  We believe the complexity of basing incentives on BMI reduction would create confusion and frustration for the participants owing to the interplay between changes in height and weight ultimately making it difficult to effectively communicate goals to the participants.  Moreover, change in height is obviously beyond the domain of control for participants and offering higher payouts to individuals who experience greater increases in height will be viewed as unfair.  Using the baseline body weight as the reference for all subsequent study visits (to avoid offering incentives for weight cycling – gain and subsequent loss), participants will receive $20 (in the form of a gift card) for every 0.5% reduction in body weight from baseline.  To make goals clear for participants, individual tables will be created displaying the amount of weight loss (in pounds) corresponding to each half percentage-point reduction in body weight.  Financial incentive payments, if earned, will be made to participants in the financial incentives group at all study visits.  Even if unsuccessful in earning a payment at a preceding visit, participants will remain eligible for the incentives at all subsequent visits (i.e., if weight is gained or remains stable, participants will be have the opportunity to get back on track; again, in relation to the baseline body weight).  No payment will be made for partial goal attainment (i.e., full 0.5% weight reduction increments must be achieved).  6.10.7 Assessment of Motivation, and Other Behavioral and Psychosocial Factors Questionnaires to be utilized at the same time points will measure quality of life (PedsQL Child and Parent questionnaire; Impact of Weight on Quality of Life: IWQOL-Kids), anxiety (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders: SCARED questionnaire) and depression (Depression Scale for Children: CES-DC questionnaire).  Weight reduction will be measured at all study visits.  6.10.8 Vascular Measurements Vascular testing will be performed in the morning in a quiet room of constant temperature (22º C – 23º C).  Participants will be fasting and will be instructed to refrain from caffeine and medications prior to the study.    Carotid-radial, carotid-femoral, and/or carotid-foot augmentation index and pulse wave velocity will be measured by [CONTACT_403513]â MM3 system (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia).  Augmentation index is a measure of the relative magnitude of the reflected (or retrograde) pulse wave early in the cardiac cycle.  Higher values represent increased arterial stiffening.  Pulse wave velocity will be calculated as distance divided by [CONTACT_403514].  Higher values of pulse wave velocity represent increased arterial stiffness.  Resting heart rate variability will be measured with the SphygmoCorâ MM3 system. 7 Statistical Plan 7.1 Participant Populations for Analysis The primary analysis will be on an intent-to-treat population where all randomized participants will be evaluated according to their treatment assignment (financial incentives vs. no financial incentives).  The analysis will be conducted with multiple imputation techniques, if necessary.  A secondary per protocol analysis will include participants who are without major protocol violations.  Safety assessments will include all participants who receive any treatment according to the treatment they receive.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_403515] 17

Major protocol violations include: cessation of study meals.   • Safety Population: All participants who receive any amount of treatment according to the treatment they receive. 7.[ADDRESS_508960] (BMI reduction, our primary endpoint) of 5% at 52 weeks.17, 18, 54  We estimate having a dropout rate of no more than 20% (our previous clinical trial experience with this population has been 10-15%).58, [ADDRESS_508961] deviation of approximately 8.8 and using a conservative correlation between baseline and follow-up scores of 0.6, we present in Table 2 the power associated with a clinically-meaningful control-subtracted BMI reduction of 5% based on an overall sample size of 130 (60 in each treatment arm) and a range of degrees of attrition (including rows reflecting scenarios of higher than expected levels).

Treatment compliance will also be evaluated. Safety analyses will use the Safety analysis population and will be primarily descriptive, reporting the number and percentage of adverse events.   7.3.1 Specific Aim #1 (Primary and Secondary Endpoints) The primary analysis will be conducted using the intent-to-treat population to compare the mean BMI percent change from randomization to 52 weeks (additional analyses will use the 26-week time-point as secondary) of follow-up between the financial incentives and no financial incentives groups, adjusted for BMI at randomization and insurance status (randomization stratification factor) for added precision.  Confidence intervals (CIs) and P-values will be based on robust variance estimation.  Statistical significance will be considered as p<0.05.  Supportive analyses using the per-protocol population will

Secondary endpoints of body fat (total, visceral, and subcutaneous), blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, heart rate variability, and adherence to the meal replacement regimen will be characterized at 26 and 52 weeks.  The evaluation will be in a similar fashion as the primary outcome wherein analyses will be adjusted for baseline values and the randomization stratification factor.  Longitudinal analyses will also be conducted, incorporating the variables that are measured at multiple time points (e.g., blood pressure, adherence). Supportive analyses using the PP population will also be conducted.  We also recognize there is always the possibility of subgroups with differential treatment effect.  We do not a priori have a particular subgroup of interest the study is designed to evaluate, though exploratory analyses would be able to investigate such.   7.3.2 Specific Aim #[ADDRESS_508963] the distribution of values from the existing control database (normal weight, overweight, and obese groups).    Other scales will also be explored, e.g., absolute BMI, percent of the 95th BMI percentile, BMI z-score, total body fat, percent body fat, total visceral fat, and percent visceral fat at follow-up, in addition to percent change in BMI from randomization.  Results of these analyses will be considered exploratory, interpreted as suggestive, requiring confirmation.  It is also possible thresholds may differ for different types of participants, e.g., based on sex.  Such interactions will be explored to the extent there are sufficient numbers of individuals within subgroups and sufficient variability over which to explore thresholds.  In addition, these results will be used to aid in the interpretation of the clinical meaningfulness of the treatment effect from aim #1.  For example, if a cutoff of 4% BMI reduction is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in at least some of the cardiometabolic risk factors, we will examine how many participants met this threshold in each group.  In an exploratory fashion, we will utilize the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to describe the sensitivity and specificity of various BMI reductions cut-points associated with remission of dichotomous co-morbidities at baseline such as dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], pre-hypertension/hypertension, pre-diabetes, etc. (in the subset of participants with these conditions at baseline).      7.3.3 Safety Analyses   The safety profile will be evaluated using the Safety analysis population and evaluated using data collected throughout follow-up.  Analyses will be primarily descriptive reporting the number and percentage of adverse events along with categorizations of seriousness, severity, frequency (within a subject), and perceived relatedness to the

Based upon attrition rates in our previous trials,58, 61 we anticipate that no more than 20% of the participants will be lost to follow-up.  Taking this into account, the planned enrollment of 130 is inflated to account for potential drop out.  As such, in the ‘worst case’ situation of observing missing data as high as 20%, we will still have >85% and >95% power to detect a 4% and 5%, respectively, control-subtracted percent change in BMI from randomization to 52 weeks (primary endpoint).  If the data are missing at random, conditioned on measured covariates, then supplementary analyses adjusting for these covariates will produce unbiased results.  For potential missing data mechanisms beyond measured covariates, we will examine the extent to which results may be affected.  Imputation techniques will be considered for missing data issues (e.g., multiple imputation).  Secondary endpoints will be handled similarly.  We do not expect to observe differential attrition by [CONTACT_403517].17, 18, [ADDRESS_508966] all potential risks.    8.1.1 Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (iDXA) Scan The iDXA is painless and involves exposure to a very low dose of radiation.  As part of this study, participants will undergo a total of three iDXA scans.      8.1.2 Blood Sampling  There is minimal risk of bruising and infection associated with the blood draw.   8.1.3 Questionnaires There are no risks associated with the questionnaires to be used in the study.  Participants may refuse to answer any questions or stop participating at any time. 8.2 Definitions              8.2.1 Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Inter-current illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:

CONFIDENTIAL This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] • results in study withdrawal • is associated with a serious adverse event • is associated with clinical signs or symptoms • leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests • is considered by [CONTACT_403518]: • Unrelated: Clearly not related to study • Unlikely: Unlikely to be related to study • Possible: May be related to study • Probable: Likely to be related to study • Definite: Clearly related to study  8.2.2 Serious Adverse Event Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the participant, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events.   8.2.[ADDRESS_508967] to follow-up, or the serious adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the final visit, if there is an ongoing serious adverse event, the participant and the parent/guardian will be instructed to report any subsequent event(s) that they, or their personal physician, believe might be reasonably related to participation in this study.  8.2.4 Preexisting Condition  A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting  condition will only be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the  character of the condition worsens during the study period.

Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844]. 8.[ADDRESS_508968] with the participant and their parent/guardian, adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event form.   All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document, although they should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.

Copi[INVESTIGATOR_17236]’s binder. 8.[ADDRESS_508969] of the DSMB, principal investigator, and/or lead-investigator for medical safety.  The main adverse effect that we expect to observe is excessive weight loss during the meal replacement period.  In the context of this trial, we will define excessive weight loss as 2 consecutive weeks during which ≥[ADDRESS_508970] per week for those with a BMI <40 kg/m2 and ≥[ADDRESS_508971] per week for those with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2.  Individuals endorsing vomiting, laxative use, and/or diuretic use for weight control at the baseline visit will be excluded.  We will also monitor for the incidence of disordered eating behaviors using the EDE-Q questionnaire, which will be administered at all in-person study visits.  Any participant endorsing vomiting, laxative use, and/or diuretic use for weight control (via the EDE-Q) at any time during the trial will be interviewed using the Eating Disorders Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5.  If disordered eating is present upon clinical interview, the participant will be removed from the trial and referred to an eating behavior specialist for clinical follow-up.  If no eating disorder is present, the participant may continue in the trial.  The DSMB will be given the authority to stop the trial if the occurrence of excessive weight loss and/or incidence of disordered eating are deemed to be at an unacceptably high level.  Participants will be instructed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.   8.6 Medical Monitoring Safety monitoring will include individual participant comprehensive assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as they occur.  Adverse events will be monitored closely and participants will be provided with information about the risks of the study intervention and provided with phone numbers to reach the principal investigator/study coordinator in case of emergencies.

The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_403494], which will be stored in a separate, secured location.  Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_156837], including source documents with patient identifiers, will be kept in locked file cabinets in a locked office until the completion and publication of the study, at which point any patient identifiers will be removed and data will be stored at a secure storage facility for 6 years.  Access to the locked file cabinet will be given to the study coordinators and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_13701].  Any study files that will be shared with the University of Minnesota will remove patient identifying information.   11.3 Recruitment and Informed Consent  Participants will be recruited from the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Pediatric Weight Management Clinic and MN-POC sites and through various health systems.  Appropriate designees will discuss study participation with interested participants and their parents at which time the initial consent and assent discussion will be conducted.  Assent and consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_403530], asking the participant and the parent(s)/guardian(s) to explain the purpose, risk and benefits, and other details of the study, and giving the participant and parent(s)/guardian(s) an opportunity to ask questions.  A copy of the assent and consent form will be given to the participants and parent(s)/guardian(s).

Blood Sampling (fasting and during meal test) There is minimal risk of bruising and infection associated with the blood draw.  Meal Replacements and Monitoring for Excessive Weight Loss and Disordered Eating Behaviors Adverse events will be comprehensively documented at all study visits and during each monthly phone call.  Participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_403531].  All participants will receive counseling regarding avoidance of unhealthy weight loss behaviors such as use of diuretics, diet pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], purging, or excessive exercise.  However, this message will be delivered conscientiously so as not to provide participants with ideas they may not already have.  We will serially assess multiple domains of unhealthy weight loss behaviors using the EDE-Q.  The EDE-Q identifies disordered eating behaviors and unhealthy attitudes about weight such as purging, unhealthy obsession with dieting and/or body weight, prolonged fasting/starvation, use of laxatives to control weight, and excessive exercise.  The EDE-Q has been validated and used extensively in the adolescent population and normative values and cut-points have been established for this age group.  Participants will be asked to weigh themselves regularly, and monthly phone calls will be performed.  We will use the in person visits to monitor for excessive weight loss defined as ≥5 pounds per week for those with a BMI <40 kg/m2 and ≥7 pounds per week for those with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2.  Participants reporting excessive weight loss will be given supplemental counseling regarding unhealthy weight loss behaviors and removed from the trial if excessive weight loss is noted for [ADDRESS_508977] Risk   Claudia Fox, M.D., M.P.H. (lead-study investigator for medical safety) will be responsible for the medical safety aspects of this trial.  [CONTACT_48376] is board-certified in Obesity Medicine by [CONTACT_403532]. Kelly.  Participants will be evaluated at each visit for potential adverse effects.  At each contact [CONTACT_403533]/guardian, adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event form.   All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will be recorded in the source document and will be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  Females will undergo pregnancy tests at each study visit requiring a DXA scan.  Absolute confidentiality will be maintained.  All data will be stored in locked offices and will not be released without consent of participants.  Blood samples sent to other laboratories will be

Novel approaches such as meal replacements plus financial incentives should be explored.  Data obtained from this study will determine whether combining these approaches is a promising weight loss strategy for adolescents with severe obesity.   11.8 Data and Regulatory Monitoring Plan Medical Monitoring Safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events.  Adverse events will be monitored closely and participants will be provided with information about the risks of the study intervention and provided with phone numbers to reach the principal investigator/study coordinator in case of emergencies. 12   Study Finances 12.1 Funding Source The study is funded by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).   12.[ADDRESS_508979] with this study (patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must refer to the Regents Policies on Individual Conflict of Interest Policy or Institutional Conflict of Interest Policy. These policies require University Faculty and staff to report external professional activities and business and significant financial interests related to his or her University activities by [CONTACT_17258] a REPA (Report of External Professional Activities) at least once per year. Faculty and staff should also file a REPA when substantial changes in business or financial interests occur, when an activity that presents a potential conflict of interest is anticipated, or when submitting an application for research support or technology transfer, submitting research protocols to the IRB, or receiving financial contributions.

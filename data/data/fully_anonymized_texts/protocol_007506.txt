3. Abstract:   
Background/Purpose:  Falls are a common and costly complication following stroke. While residual 
walking and balance deficits contribute substantially to long -term disability, of greater concern for 
this population is the incidence of falls. Between 40% and 70% of individuals  fall within their first 
year post -stroke. Individuals who fall have increased incidence of serious adverse outcomes, 
including fractures, depression, and mortality. A primary goal of stroke rehabilitation is to improve 
mobility in the presence of motor, balance, and visual -spatial  
deficits. The conundrum all stakeholders must face is that increased mobility may increase risk for falls, whereas limiting walking and general mobility will lead to a multitude of deficits 
associated with inactivity, including r ecurrent stroke. Because of these serious consequences, 
there is an urgent need in the rehabilitation of Veterans with stroke to both identify those who are at fall risk and develop intervention strategies that will reduce fall incidence while increasing 
mobility. Backward walking has recently emerged as both a potential predictor of fall incidence 
as well as an intervention modality to prevent future falls. However, it has not yet been 
assessed under the rigors of a controlled trial. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial  
with three specific aims to examine 1) the effectiveness of Backward Walking Training (BWTraining) early poststroke in decreasing falls, 2) the timing of BWTraining delivery to 
increase Backward Walking speed (BWSpeed), and 3) the relationship between BWSpeed and prospective fall incidence.  
Subjects : One -hundred twenty -eight individuals, [ADDRESS_119808] -stroke, will participate. 
Additional study criteria include: 1) ambulatory with gait speed < 0.8 m/s; 2) community -
dwelling; 3) Berg Balance Scale < 42; 4) absence of other neurological conditions; 5) discharged from physical therapy services; 6) stable cardiac status; 7) absence of lower extremity orthopedic impairments or pain that limits gait ability.  
Methods:  Fol
 lowing baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to BWTraining at 2 
months (Immediate group) or [ADDRESS_119809] -stroke (Delayed group). The intervention consists of 
18 sessions (3X/week for 6 weeks) of BWTraining: 20–30 minutes of step training using a Body Weight Sup port and Treadmill system (BWST) followed by [ADDRESS_119810] environment to overground. The Immediate group will be followed prospectively for 1- year and compared to the 
Delayed group to determine the effectiveness of BWTraining in decreasing falls (Specific Aim#1). BWSpeed post -intervention will be compared between groups to ass ess the timing 
effect of BWTraining (Specific Aim #2). The Delayed group will be followed prospectively for 1-
year prior to BWTraining, to determine if BWSpeed at 2- months is a predictor of fall incidence in 
the first year post -stroke (Specific Aim #3).

 Outcome Measures: Fall incidence 2- months to [ADDRESS_119811] walking gait speed, dynamic 
balance measured by [CONTACT_107798], fall self -efficacy measured by t he 
Activities -Balance Confidence Scale and gait kinematics.  
Data Analysis Plan: The total number of falls per patient month for the immediate and delayed 
intervention groups will be calculated, and using a nonparametric ratio estimate, point and 
interval estimates for the average hazard for each group will be determined. The ratio of the two 
individual group estimates, 95% confidence limits and P -values will be obtained. Forward 
stepwise ordinal logistic regression will be used to determine the independent  relationship 
between BWSpeed at 2- months post -stroke and 1 -year fall incidence of those in the Delayed 
intervention group.  
4.  Background:  
Falls are a Common and Serious Complication after Stroke.  
Stroke is the leading cause of chronic disability world- wide1  and in the [LOCATION_002] more 
than 795,[ADDRESS_119812] 
common manifestations of stroke.  Falls among community -dwelling individuals with stroke 
are widely reported in the literature, with incidence of falls reported to be 40% and 70%.3, [ADDRESS_119813] -stroke include both 
fractures7, 11 and soft tissue injuries3, 11 with overall injury incidence reported to be 15%-
50%.3, 7, 9, [ADDRESS_119814] common fractures reported; a 2.1% rate of hip 
fractures has been reported to occur in individuals with stroke after a fall.[ADDRESS_119815] of falls on individuals with stroke include fear of falling, 
reduced mobility, greater disability, depression, increased stress experienced by [CONTACT_18629], and social isolation.
3, 4, 6 Fear of falling often leads to activity restriction as 
reported by [CONTACT_107799].,11 who determined that 44% of individuals post -stroke 
restricted their activities due to fear of falling. Belgen reported that individuals with stroke who fell were 5.[ADDRESS_119816] -stroke.   
Protocol: 201500926          Page 4 of 20 
IRB version 03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 10/24/[ADDRESS_119817] -stroke that the addition of a  30 -minute BWTraining to each  conventional care 
session delivered 3x/week for three weeks resulted in a significant improved forward walking 
speed, stride length, and gait symmetry when compared to conventional training alone. 
However, with the lack of an active control group it is no t known if these benefits were simply 
due to the additional therapy. In high- functioning stroke survivors who were able to ambulate 
without an assistive device or orthotic, Weng and colleagues20 reported that walking speed as 
well as balance and lower extremity motor function was significantly more improved for those in a BWTraining compared to those who received dose- matched conventional therapy. Although 
total training time was matched, these results need to be int erpreted cautiously as the amount of 
gait training in the conventional therapy group was not standardized nor matched to the amount 
of backward gait training.   
The foundation for this current proposal resulted from our case-
series with individuals post -stroke21 and our recently conducted pi[INVESTIGATOR_107775] t raining in subsequent balance and gait ability22, [ADDRESS_119818] -stroke 
rehabilitation in order to implement pro-active measures both intrinsically (related to the individual) and extrinsically (associated with their environment). Clinical tests of walking 
speed and postural balance to predict fall risk after stroke have been reported previously.
24-
[ADDRESS_119819] at a speed less 
than 0.6 m/s identified 100% of fallers and those who walked backward at a speed less t han 
0.4 m/s had a 3.[ADDRESS_119820] walking velocity at a cut off of 1.0 m/s only identified 83% of fallers. If BWSpeed is a more reliable predictor of falls than forward wal king speed in the post -stroke

(sideways, backwards) and reported subsequent improvements in dynamic balance activities.  
While  we recognize that falls post -stroke are multifactorial7, the inability to combine  hip 
extension with knee flexion required for backward steppi[INVESTIGATOR_107777] a contributor to the 
prevalence of falls in thi s population. Repetitive practice of this movement combination in a 
controlled environment may facilitate its expression when necessary to prevent a fall. We 
hypothesize that BWTraining will improve balance and falls self -efficacy and decrease fall 
incidence in the first year post -stroke.  
Backwards walking effectively engages cerebral pathways damaged by [CONTACT_84639].  
In addition to the increased challenge to postural stability BWTraining affords, there are 
additional benefits to this rehabilitation strategy. Compared with forward, backward walking is 
more effective at inducing cerebral activation.33, [ADDRESS_119822] walking revealed an increased oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) response compared 
to forward, suggestive of increased cortical processing, in the Supplementary Motor Area 
(SMA), Primary Motor Cortex (PMC), and Superior Parietal Lobule.[ADDRESS_119823] walking due to the 
concentric contraction of knee flexors during early swing phase16, 44 which may be beneficial at

walking.  Although causes of falls are multifactorial, it is important to note that a primary phy sical 
contributing factor to a fall is the difficulty and/or inability to take a backward step to maintain 
balance.[ADDRESS_119825] step to maintain balance, 
remain upright and prevent a fall.  
5. Specific Aims:  
Aim #1: Test the hypothesis that [ADDRESS_119826] -stroke (versus usual care comparison group).  
Hypothesis #1a: BWTraining at 2- months post -stroke reduces the number of falls over the next 
year.  
Hypothesis #1b: BWTraining at 2- months post -stroke increases gait speed, improves balance 
and increases balance confidence over the next year.  
Aim #2: Test the hypothesis that BWTraining at 2 months (immediate) vs. 1 -year (delayed) 
post-stroke is more effective at improving BWSpeed.  
Hypothesis #2a: BWSpeed improvement from [ADDRESS_119827] -stroke.  
Hypothesis #2b: Improvements in forward gait speed, Functional Gait Assessment and 
Activities -Balance Confidence Scale from [ADDRESS_119828] -stroke.  
Aim #3: This exploratory aim will test the hypothesis that BWSpeed at 2- months post -stroke is a 
significant predictor of fall incidence over the next year 1 year period, after adjusting for other 
covariates.  
Hypothesis #3: BWSpeed at 2-months will be a significant predictor of fall incidence during the 
first year post -stroke, after adjusting for other covariates.  
6. Research Plan:  
This prospective, single -blind, RCT enrolling individuals at 2- months post -stroke is designed 
to addres s the study’s three Specific Aims (See Figure below).  Participants will be 
randomized to either Immediate (2- months post -stroke) or Delayed (1- year post -stroke) 
BWTraining. The primary endpoint for SA#1 and SA#[ADDRESS_119829] -
stroke.  The primary endpoint for SA#[ADDRESS_119830]-stroke. Secondary assessment time points (Assessments B and C) will allow us to 
examine potential mechanism s of recovery contributing to our primary results.  Individual 
treatment allocations will be in sealed envelopes. Envelopes will be opened only on 
enrollment of the next eligible participant . We will recruit [ADDRESS_119831] -stroke. This 
will permit up to a 10% attrition rate and still provide a sufficient participant  pool to address 
our Specific Aims.

in-person screen to determine if they meet the criteria listed below.  Potential participants will 
sign the screening Informed Consent Form and then the following screening assessments will 
be administered:  
 
1. Berg Balance Scale51: This tool consists of [ADDRESS_119840] : Participants, wearing a gait belt and guarded by a licensed 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], will traverse a total distance of 14 meters, two times at their self -
selected walking pace. The time to traverse the middle 10 meters will be recorded 
with a stop watch.  
3. Lower Extremity Fugl -Meyer Motor Assessment: The participant’s ability to move their 
paretic lower limb will be assessed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting and standing position.  
4. Range of Motion:  Range of Moti on of the hips, knees and ankles of both lower limbs will 
be assessed. This assessment will take place in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_107780] . 
5. Three-Meter Backward WalkTest . The test consists of a 1 meter warm -up distance, 
a timed 3 meter distance, followed by [CONTACT_33018] 1 meter to continue walking. 
Participants will walk this distance two times and the speed will be averaged.  
 
Participants who meet eligibility criteria following the screening assessment will be invited to 
sign Part 2 Consent, the Intervention Informed Consent Form. Intervention Informed Consent 
allows for baseline testing and study participation.  
 Following baseline assessment (Assessment A) participants will be randomized to either  the 
Immediate Group (initiate BWTraining within 1- week of Assessment A ) or the Delayed Group 
(initiate BWTraining at 1- year post -stroke).  
 
BWTraining Intervention.  The intervention consists of 18- 21 sessions, 3x/week for [ADDRESS_119841] of 20– [ADDRESS_119842] 
periods provided as warranted followed by 15 minutes of overground gait training. A 20– [ADDRESS_119843] with their paretic leg, their non- paretic leg (if needed) 
and at the hips for weight -shift.
 
Training targets:  The overall goal is to enable the participant, by [CONTACT_107806], to walk 
independently for a total of 20 minutes in four, 5 minute bouts at 0% BWS with good steppi[INVESTIGATOR_107781]. Progression of training will be accomplished by: (1) gradually decreasi ng BWS from 
40% to 0%, (2) initiating treadmill speed just below  participant’s overground backward walking 
speed, increasing as  able and as  tolerated, and (3) providing manual assistance initially when 
the participant is unable to independently step or control upright posture, and decreasing manual assistance to afford skill and control progression by [CONTACT_2299].

followed by [CONTACT_33018]  1 meter to continue walking. Participants will walk this distance 
two times  and the speed will be averaged. 
Functional Gait Assessment (FGA),[ADDRESS_119846] during which 
participants perform the following activities: walk at normal speeds, at fast and slow speeds, 
with vertical and horizontal head turns, with eyes closed, over obstacles, in tandem, backward 
and while ascending and descending stairs. Excellent test -retest53 and intra- and inter -rater 
reliability54 has been established patients post- stroke.    
Activities -Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC): This 16-item  self-report measure is 
used to assess perceived efficacy (self-reported confidence) in maintaining balance while 
performing a number of activities common in community -dwelling older adults .

standing up from a chair, walking three feet straight ahead, turning around and returning to the 
chair to sit down.  
Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES)59 is a 14- item questionnaire based on the Falls Efficacy 
Scale (FES),60 modified for people with chronic stroke. It includes the 10 ite ms from the FES 
plus 4 items considered complex for people with stroke and is designed to measure self -
perceived fear of falling during task performance. Significant differences in MFES scores between patients in a Falls and Balance Clinic and healthy older adults (p < 0.05) attests to the 
scales’ validity.
59 
Modified Rankin Scale (mRS): This 0 -5 scale is a functional outcome measure of stroke that 
reflects the overall level of disability. The clinician assessor scores the participant based on their impression and observation of the participant over the course of the evaluation process.  
Kinesiologic assessment of walking: To more explicitly describe changes in participants’ gait 
as a result of the intervention, secondary outcome measures will include:  
1) Assessment of kinematics using a passive motion- capture system :Hip, knee and ankle 
angle data from the LE’s will be acquired by [CONTACT_107807] a modified Helen Hayes marker set  with rigid clusters on the pelvis 
and each thigh, shank and foot segments  and recording the movement of these 
markers at 100 Hz using a 12 camera motion capture system (Vicon Motion Capture 
Systems, Oxford, [LOCATION_006]). Data will be processed using Visual 3D (C -Motion, Inc., 
Germantown, MD). Intersegmental joint moments (normalized to body mass) will be 
calculated using standard 3D inverse dynamics techniques.  
2) Assessme nt of kinetics and spatio- temporal movement characteristics :Three-
dimensional ground reaction forces will be acquired under each foot  as participants 
walk across force plates.  The force plates are flush with the floor and are not an obstacle 
or trippi[INVESTIGATOR_107783].  The participant will be asked to stand or walk in a specific location 
corresponding with the force plates embedded in the floor.  This will be done while they 
also are wearing the EMGs and reflective markers so that all data are captured 
simultaneously.  GRF data will be normalized to body weight. Sagittal plane hip, knee 
and ankle joint moment impulses and the vertical GRF will be calculated.  
3) S patial -Temporal gait variables  of stride time, stride length, step time, step length 
and step width will be captured during forward and backward walking across a 
GAITRite instrumented walkway (CIR Systems Inc, Havertown, PA). Additionally, the 
participant will be asked to walk over a 12’ instrumented walkway.  The walkway appears 
like a basic carpet with embedded switches to record foot falls and placement.  The edges 
of the carpet walkway will be taped down to minimize the possibility of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_107784].  Participants will be guarded by [CONTACT_107808][INVESTIGATOR_107785]/or an overhead harness may be used.  The instrumented walkway (carpet) will 
provide quantitative data regarding the spatial and temporal characteristics of standing 
and walking.  
 
4) Assessment of muscle activation using surface electromyography (EMG ) By [CONTACT_107809], EMG allow s 
us to develop a better understanding of how the nervous system’s control of movement is 
disrupted following stroke  and whether this control is affected by [CONTACT_25234]. Using 
standard surface preparation (cleaning the skin with water or alcohol pad, shaving of excess hair) and electrode placement, surface EMGs will be collected from lower 
extremity and trunk muscles using surface EMG electrodes. EMG sensors will be attached

 to the skin with double- sided hypoallergenic medical tape.  Before the data collection, 
functional tests will be performed while each EMG channel is examined to assure clear 
signals and to check for crosstalk.  
. 
Fall Incidence. In addition to the assessments described above that will be conducted at the 
5 specific time points, fall incidence will be monitored throughout the study for each 
participant  using the international standards for defining and reporting falls,61 including the 
following definition for a fall: “A person has a fall if they end up on the ground or floor when 
they did not expect to. Most often a fall starts while a person is on their feet, but a fall could also start from a chair or bed. If a person ends up on the ground, either on their knees, their 
belly, their side, their bottom, or their back, they have had a fall.”  This explanation will be 
provided to participants and caregivers and printed on monthly calendars issued at 
randomization.  Participants and/or caregivers will place an “X” on the corresponding date if 
a fall occurs, and submit  to their study site each month (even if no falls occurred). If a 
calendar is not received within one week of its expected return, study personnel w ill contact 
[CONTACT_4317] . Participants will be contact[CONTACT_107810] -up on reported falls using the Fall 
Characterization Questionnaire.  Information collected for each fall will include presence and 
nature of any  injury, location of the fall, and ability to get up independently after the fall. 
Three categories will be used to characterize falls outcome poststroke: multiple or injurious 
(M/I); single, noninjurious (S/NI); and nonfallers. Injurious falls will be defined as those 
resulting in serious injury: fracture, loss of consciousness, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  This 
information will be collected in-person for those currently receiving the study intervention 
and via phone for participants who have either completed or  have yet to begin BWTraining.  
 
Monitoring Delayed BWTraining. Participants randomized to  Delayed BWTraining (Usual 
Care) will be assessed at the same time points as the Immediate BWTraining Group, at 
Baseline (Assessment A), at [ADDRESS_119853] -enrollment (A ssessment B) and at 6- months 
post-stroke (Assessment C). In addition to these on-site assessments, this group (as well as 
the Immediate BWTraining Group) will be monitored throughout the first year post -stroke for 
1) Any usual and customary rehabilitation services and 2) Fall incidence.  
1. Usual and Customary Rehabilitation services: Throughout study participation, for ethical 
reasons, subjects will be permitted to engage in usual and customary clinical rehabilitation services. Any rehabilitation services received outside of the study intervention will be tracked and described in written logs. All subjects will be provided a health utilization log and will complete a daily checklist to report the type (PT, OT, Speech) and the length (0.5

training and strategize on how to progress the intervention. Videorecordings will also provide the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_107787]. Assessment sessions  will also 
be periodically recorded. This will provide assessment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_107788]. Videorecordings may also be used in scientific 
presentations. Participants will be informed when videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_107789]: For Specific Aim #1 (primary outcome for entire study is the average fall 
rate per year), we will calculate the total number of falls per patient year for the Immediate 
intervention and Delayed intervention (control) groups, and use the actuarial method 
described below to estimate the average hazard rate in each group, and the overall hazard 
ratio. We will compare the Immediate and Delayed groups’ fall rate at Assessment D, 1-year post-stroke. The analysis takes repeated falls within the same subject into account.  
Consider the number of falls, Y
ij for the j -th patient on treatment i (i=1,2) in the year, and T ij , 
the time at risk for the subject (usually 1 year, less for withdrawals before then). The estimated average fall hazard for treatment i is the ratio estimator H
i= ΣY ij / ΣT ij. Under 
nonparametric considerations, if the true average hazard over subjects and time for treatment i is ϴ
i , then by [CONTACT_107812], Log(H i)- log(ϴ i ) (Log=natural log) is 
asymptotically normal with mean zero and variance V i , i=1,2 defined by  
   
[CONTACT_107813]=[{ Var(Y ij)/(Mean Y ij)2} +{ Var(T ij)/(Mean T ij)2} -{2 Cov (Y ij , Tij )/(Mean Y ij )/(Mean T ij )}]/N i 
 with the means, variances, and covariance, the sample moments, and N
i is the sample size 
for treatment i.  The log of the estimated average hazard ratio Log(H 2/H1) is asymptotically 
normally distributed with mean Log(ϴ 2 /ϴ1)=Log(ϴ 2 )- Log(ϴ 1 ) and asymptotic variance 
(V1+V2). This enables us to obtain a two-sided P -value and after taking natural anti -logs, a 
point estimate and 95% confidence interval for the true average hazard ratio.  
 
Power analysis : The study is powered around Specific Aim 1,  comparison of fall incidence 
at 1-year post -stroke for those in the Immediate versus the Delayed BWTraining groups. 
Although the analysis is valid for any within patient distribution of the number of falls and 
time at risk, we must make additional assumptions to calculate power.  Dean and colleagues
62, in a study of post -stroke fall incidence reported an average of 1.5 falls per 
patient year, and hence we will plan for a 33% reduction from 1.8 falls per year to 1.2 falls per year, with 80% power at p =0.05.  Using a Poisson rate of 1.8 vs. 1.2 falls per year we 
would require 64 subjects randomized to each group to be followed for one year.  Although all data for withdrawals will be used up to the time of withdrawal, we shall recruit an additional 14 subjects (142 total) to assure we observe [ADDRESS_119855] (less variable) then the Poisson, which allows 
unlimited falls for a patient.  This suggests the real variance within a group will be lower 
than that suggested in the Poisson, making power a bit higher than stated here.  We cannot quantify this, however.  Power was derived via large sample approximations, and v erified 
via 10,000 simulations.

7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
The risks undertaken in the walking therapy programs of the study are no greater than those in 
everyday physical therapy clinics where persons who have had a stroke are challenged daily to 
exercise, train, practice and improve beyond their current abilities. Safety in therapy is 
mandatory. Research personnel will walk beside participants during all aspects of the exercise 
intervention and all aspects of the assessment that assess gait  and balance. Participants may 
experience some fatigue while being tested or during the therapy sessions. Should they become 
tired, they will be allowed to rest. Participants may experience temporary muscle soreness as 
they increase the use of  their trunk and limbs during the walking intervention. There is a risk of 
falling during walking activities, but guarding by [CONTACT_107814]. Stroke 
patients, including those in this study, are at risk for another stroke, coronar y heart disease 
related event and cardiac related death, regardless of intervention.  
8. Possible Benefits:  
Subjects participating in this study may see improvements in their walking speed, balance, 
and/or the amount of walking that they are able to do. They may become more confident in their 
balance and walking ability.    
9. Conflict of Interest:  
There are no conflicts of interest apparent for any of the investigators.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
PRIMARY  
1) To evaluate, in a Phase II single dose level trial, the therapeutic potential of adoptive 
immunotherapy with EBV -specific T -cells derived from HLA partially matched third -party donors in 
the treatment of EBV -induced lymphomas and EBV -associated malignancies including EBV+ 
Hodgkin’s and Non -Hodgkin’s disease, EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma, EBV+ hemophagocytic  
lymphohistiocytosis, and EBV+ leiomyosarcoma . 
2) To establish a centralized bank of cryoperserved, GMP  (Good Manurfacturing Practice) grade, 
EBV-specific T -cell lines from consenting donors of defined HLA type and HLA restriction which can 
serve as an imm ediately accessible source of HLA partially matched EBV -specific T -cells for 
adoptive therapy of EBV lymphomas, EBV lymphoproliferative disease and other EBV -associated 
malignancies.  
3) To estimate the overall survival, disease free survival, and probabili ty of EBV relapse over time of 
patients who receive EBV-specific T -cells derived from HLA partially matched third -party donors.  
 
SECONDARY  
1) To evaluate the in vivo expansion and duration of engraftment of successive doses of transferred 
EBV-reactive lymphocytes within treated patients and to correlate these findings with the diseased 
patient’s T -cell populations and general immune function.  
2)  To determine the inci dence, kinetics and durability of pathological and/or clinical responses of 
EBV-induced malignancies to treatment with infusions of EBV -specific T -cells derived from 
histocompatible or partially HLA -matched EBV -seropositive normal third -party donors.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Epstein -Barr virus is a member of the herpes virus family of DNA viruses.  In normal individuals, 
primary infection occurs in early adolescents and initially involves the parotid and salivary glands 
giving rise to either an asym ptomatic infection or infectious mononucleosis (1).  Following initial 
production of lytic virus, the virus infects and becomes latent in B -lymphocytes and remains so for 
the life of the individual.  Infection of the B -lymphocytes results in their transfor mation and 
immortalization. However, during latent infection, only a limited number of viral genes are expressed. 
These include the nuclear antigens EBNA1 -5 and the latent membrane proteins, LMP1 and LMP2 
(2, 3). In normal seropositive individuals, 30 -100/million circulating B -cells are transformed latently 
infected B -cells (4).  The immune response to EBV includes both the generation of antibodies and 
the production of antigen -specific T -cells.  However, control of latent infection depends upon the 
integri ty of T -cell mediated immunity (5). Data from our own ( 6, 7 ) and other studies indicate that 
the principal effectors controlling EBV are HLA -class I -restricted CD8+ T-cells specific for latent EBV 
antigens, particularly EBNA -3 ( 8, 9 ).  EBV -specific HLA  class II -restricted CD4+ T-cells stimulate 
the CD8+ T-cell populations but their role in controlling or eliminating EBV transformed cells is still 
controversial (10).   In a normal seropositive adult, 0.5 -5% of the circulating T -cells can be shown to 
be E BV-specific by [CONTACT_694065]8+T-cells binding EBV peptide/HLA tetramer complexes.(11) 
Similarly, the frequencies of EBV reactive interferon -gamma positive T -cells and cytotoxic T -cell 
precursors range from 1/102-103 and 1/103-104 respectively ( 12 ).  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Page 6 of 41 In immunocompromised, T -cell deficient human hosts, EBV may cause either lymphoproliferative 
disorders or outright lymphomas (13).  In addition, EBV latent infection has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of up to 30 % of patients with Hodgkin’s disease (14),  a high proportion of 
nasopharyngeal carcinomas developi[INVESTIGATOR_693992] (15) and leiomyosarcomas developi[INVESTIGATOR_693993], genetic immunodeficiencies or states of immunosuppression resulting 
from drugs used to prevent rejection or GVHD fo llowing organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants 
(16). 
EBV-LPD are particularly common among organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Among renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693994] 0.6  - 1% (17, 18). However, in more heavily immunosuppressed liver 
and heart allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the incidences are 5% and 10 -13% respectively (19, 20). The EBV -
LPD developi[INVESTIGATOR_693995] (21). Such polyclonal disorders 
may regress spontaneously if treatment with immunosuppressive drugs i s curtailed (21, 22). 
Alternatively, treatment with interferon -, acyclovir or B -cell specific monoclonal antibodies may 
induce durable remissions in a proportion of cases refractory to this approach (23, 24, 25). However, 
for patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_693996], none of these approaches has been 
consistently effective.  Furthermore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_693997], the long term survival has been 
estimated at 25 -60% (23).  
Recently, EBV -induced lymphomas have emerged as a significant complication of HLA non -identical 
related and matched related marrow allografts particularly when administered after selective 
depletion of T -cells (26, 27 ,32) or application of more intensive, T -cell targeted, cytoreductive 
regimens to ensure engraftment or prevent GvHD (28). Thes e EBV -LPD resemble the EBV+ 
lymphomas in AIDS patients and differ from the benign B -cell hyperplasias and polyclonal 
lymphoproliferative disorders observed in most renal and cardiac allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693998] -grade diffuse large cell B -cell lymphomas which are 
monoclonal (29). Their clinical course is fulminant. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that the 
median survival for patients afflicted with EBV lymphomas emerging early after hematopoietic stem 
cell transpla nts is only 31 days (30).  Like EBV+ lymphomas which emerge in the context of profound 
cell mediated immune deficits, these lymphomas express not only EBNA1 but also EBNA2, EBNA3, 
4, [ADDRESS_941386] origin (26, 31). 
Furthermore, they develop only in the interval between completion of pre transplant immunoblative 
therapy and the reconstitution of function al donor T -cell derived immunity, which is usually [ADDRESS_941387] transplant (32).  These malignancies thus reflect the rapid emergence of EBV 
transformed B -cell clones from the marrow graft itself if not controlled by [CONTACT_322891] -specific T -cells.  
Historically, treatment of systemic EBV lymphomas developi[INVESTIGATOR_693999], AIDS or organ grafts requiring chronic immunosuppression has entailed the use of 
combination chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_694000] -Hodgkin’s lymphoma, su ch as 
CHOP, PROMACE -CYTOBO M or m-BACOD. However, while initial complete remissions have been 
recorded in 20 -72% of such patients, these remissions have been invariably short -lived (33 -37).  
Furthermore, intensive chemotherapy has been complicated by a high mortality ascribable to 
opportunistic infections.  As a consequence, median duration of survival post diagnosis of EBV 
lymphomas has ranged from 3 -15 months. ( 33-37). For AIDS patients with EBV lymphomas of the 
central nervous system, which are consistently EBV+, median survival du ration is only 2 -3 months 
(38,39).   
More recently, the CD20 specific monoclonal antibody, Rituxan, has been employed to treat both 
EBV lymphoproliferative disorders and EBV lymphomas occurring in patients with genetic or 
acquired immunodeficiencies and in  organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Rituxan 
used alone has induced initial responses in up to 70% of organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_379364] 50 % of 
patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_694001] (40, 41).  Howeve r, 
responses overall have been sustained in no more than 50 % of patients (42).  In those who relapse 
or fail to respond to Rituximab, these lymphomas have been consistently lethal.   Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Page 7 of 41 The importance of T -cell immunity to the control of EBV infection had initially been suggested by [CONTACT_694066] 1970s (43).  However, it was not until 1994 that the therapeutic 
potential of T -cells in the treatment of EBV lymphomas was formally demonstrated,   when, our 
group reported a series of 5 p atients who developed monoclonal EBV lymphomas following T -cell 
depleted allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants who achieved durable remissions of 
pathologically documented monoclonal EBV lymphomas following infusions of small numbers of 
donor lymphocyt es (26).  In a subsequent study, we demonstrated that doses providing as few as 
1,000 EBV -specific CTLPs could induce durable and complete remissions of widespread disease 
(32). Groups in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe have subsequently confirmed these obser vations (44, 
45).  Furthermore, Rooney et al demonstrated that infusions of EBV -specific T -cells propagated in 
vitro prevent ed the development of EBV lymphomas in a large cadre of patients at risk who had 
received T -cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplants (46).  In addition, our own group, the 
group at Baylor and a group in Milan have each demonstrated the capacity of such EBV -specific T -
cells to induce complete regressions of EBV lymphomas without risk of subsequent development of 
graft versus ho st disease (47 -49). 
EBV specific T cells can also be effective in the treatment of other EBV associated malignancies. 
For example, r ecent clinical trials have demonstrated complete response rates in up to 20 % of 
patients with EBV+ Hodgkin’s disease who ha ve received infusions of ex vivo propagated EBV -
specific autologous T -cells (50).  Similarly, a significant proportion of patients with EBV+ 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma have also responded to infusions of either unselected allogeneic HLA -
matched T -cells or in  vitro propagated EBV -specific autologous T -cells (51, 69 ). 
Our current, ongoing  study (95 -024) is a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the toxicity and therapeutic 
potential of EBV -specific T -cells generated from a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HS CT) donor 
in the treatment of EBV+ lymphomas developi[INVESTIGATOR_694002].    This study 
initially concentrated on evaluation of EBV -specific T -cells generated from HLA disparate unrelated 
and related hematopoietic cell transplant donors. W e have focused on these donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694003] 
2 reasons: 1) These patients are at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_694004], 2) These patients are 
also at the highest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_694005]/or chronic graft vs. host disease if they 
receive u nselected donor lymphocytes since these populations include significant frequencies of 
alloreactive T -cells capable of generating cytotoxic responses against major  (HLA) as well as minor 
alloantigens. In Phase I o f Protocol [ADDRESS_941388] patients treated, 95 -024 underwent an IRB/FDA approved 
expansion to include EBV CTL infusions from partially HLA -matched seropositive third party donors.  
Since that time, ten patients, who have received HSCTs, have been treated with EBV CTLs from 3rd 
party donors. All infusions were well tolerated without toxicity or adverse event ascribable to the T 
cell infusions. Furthermore, no patient has developed acute or chronic GVHD. Six (6)  of these 
patients  (including one who was treated on a single patient use IND according to 95 -024) achieved 
durable complete remissions. The remaining [ADDRESS_941389] party donor (70).  
The HSCT cohort of 95 -024 (Group 1) remains open  as a phase  II study , accruing patients to an 
extension of its Phase I arm.  
In addition to HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Group 1), 95 -024 is also designed to assess the toxicity and anti -
tumor activity of HLA -haplotype matched EBV -specific T -cells in patients who develop EBV Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

treatment .  
The AIDS/organ allograft cohort of 95 -024 (Group 2) remains open, and is accruing patients to its 
Phase I arm.  
Our preliminary successes with third party donor -derived EBV specific T cells are consistent with the 
findings of Haque et al (52, 53) , who used pre-generated EBV - specific T -cells derived from normal 
partially HLA -matched seropositive third party donors for cellular immunotherapy of EBV+ 
lymphoproliferative disease in organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In a phase II, multicenter trial conducted in 
Europ e, HLA -partially matched EBV -specific T -cells were selected from a limited cryopreserved 
bank of EBV -specific predominantly CD8+ T -cell lines previously generated from normal EBV 
seropositive donors established by [CONTACT_694067] (54). The T -cells used for each patient were 
selected on the basis of partial HLA matchin g with the patient, EBV- specificity , and lack of reactivity 
against autologous or allogenic PHA -stimulated PHA blasts. A total of 33 transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694007].  While these EBV LPD were not characterized as to clonality, they did 
include 13 EBVLPD which were refractory to Rituxan and/ or chemotherapy.  There were 2 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694008] 31 organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
Treatment consisted of weekly infusions of 2 x 106 EBV-reactive T -cells/kg x 4. In each case, the 
infusions were well tolerated without acute toxicities. Furthermore, no patien t experienced either an 
allograft rejection response or, in the marrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], GVHD. At [ADDRESS_941391] infusion, 
64% had a significant response (12CR, 9 PR). At 6 months, these responses were sustained in all 
12 patients with CR and in 5/9 pati ents who achieved a PR, or 52% of the series. Only 5 patients 
were monitored for engraftment of the T -cells; they were detected for [ADDRESS_941392] application of EBV - specific T -cells for the adoptive immunotherapy of 
EBV-associated malignancies: the logistical difficulties in obtaining needed blood samples from 
donors and the prohibitively long time required to  generate and isolate suitably EBV -specific T -cells 
in the numbers necessary for effective treatment. Without the use of third party cell lines, protocols 
rely on EBV - transformed B cell lines generated from the blood of the T -cell donor for in vitro 
immun ization of the T - cells. Transformation of the B cells with the laboratory strain of EBV, B95.[ADDRESS_941393] EBV - transformed cells . This period of culture is also required to deplete the T cell lines  of 
alloreactive T -cells that could cause either GVHD in marrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694009]. Since the total time required to generate such T -cells (60 -65 days) exceeds 
the median survival of patients with such lymphomas (31 days) (30),  the EBV -specific T -cells need 
to be generated before the onset of lymphoma if they are to be consistently effective. For patients, 
other than a transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], who develop other EBV associated malignancies, generation of 
autologous EBV - reactive T -cells has been attempted, but often fails. Furthermore, EBV - specific T -
cells generated from these tumor bearing hosts often fail to react against the limited spectrum of 
EBV antigen s (LMP -1, LMP -2, EBN A-1) expressed by [CONTACT_694068].  
In the course of our st udy, we have, whenever possible, attempted to generate EBV -specific T -cells 
for patients at risk for this complication prior to or at the time of transplant. As a result, over [ADDRESS_941394] been generated, characterized and cryopreserv ed for an individual Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

achieved reconstitution of functional T -cell immunity so that they are no longer at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_694010]. As a result, we now have a significant number of HLA -typed, well characterized. 
HLA-restricted EBV -specific T -cell lines, generated under GMP conditions, which could be used for 
adoptive therapy of EBV lymphomas expressing shared HLA alleles, if the specific donors from 
whom they were generated provided second consent for their use in patients other than the specific 
individuals for whom they were transplant donors.  
Based on the studies of Haque et al (52, 53) and our own initial experience s with third party EBV -
specific T -cells, we propose 1) to test the clinical efficacy of such third party -derived EBV -specific T -
cells, when adoptively transferred for the treatment of EBV -associ ated malignancies, as measured 
by [CONTACT_694069]. 2) To continue growing a bank of cryopreserved HLA -typed 
EBV-specific T -cell lines generated under GMP conditions from the blood of consenting donors as a 
source of third party derived, H LA partially matched EBV -specific T -cells of desired HLA restriction 
for adoptive therapy.  
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.[ADDRESS_941395] party donors w hen adoptively tr ansferred into patients afflicted with an EBV 
lymphoma, an EBV+ lymphoproliferative disorder or another EBV -associated malignancy.  
Patients eligible for this trial will include:  
1) Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694011] (HSCT) transplants who develop a n EBV lymphoma or 
EBV lymphoproliferative disease post transplant or who have rising levels of EBV DNA in the 
circulation following prior treatment of the EBVLPD with chemotherapy and/or Rituxan  indicating that 
they are at high risk o f developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a recurre nt EBV lymphoma  for whom EBV -specific T -cells from 
their HCT donor are not available  
2) Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694012] a biopsy -proven EBV+ lymphoma or 
lymphoproliferative disorder or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694013]/or Rituxan who have persistent or recurrent elevations in levels of EBVDNA in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells exceeding 500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ ml and are therefore at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_694014]  
3) Any immunocompromised or genetically immunodeficient patient who develops a biopsy proven 
EBV lymphoma  or lymphoproliferative disease or  
4) Any patient afflicted with pathologically documented other EBV-associated malignancy (e.g. EBV+ 
Hodgkin’s and Non -Hodgkin’s disease, EBV+ nasopharyngeal  carcinoma, EBV+ hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis or EBV+ leiomyosarcoma).  
The T cells to be used for adoptive therapy will be derived from T cell lines generated under GMP 
conditions from normal consenting EBV seroposi tive donors of defined HLA type. Th ese T cell lines 
will be generated by [CONTACT_694070] B cells transformed Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-[ADDRESS_941396] 21 -28 days. After 
testing to insure EBV -specificity, absence of alloreactivity, absence of endotoxin and microbial 
sterility, these T cells will be cryopreserved and maintained in a designated EBV -specific T -cell bank 
for subsequent use. Selection of an EBV -specific T -cell line from this bank for the treatment of a 
patient consenting to enter this phase II trial will be based on: 1) the presence of HLA alleles on the 
T cell line that are also expressed by [CONTACT_102] ( and/or, in the case of HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the 
transpla nt donor  because EBV lymphomas in such patients are usually of donor origin ) 2) the 
availability of EBV -specific  T cells in numbers adequate for treatment of the patient at the doses 
required and 3) ascertainment, whenever possible that the EBV -specific T -cell line is restricted by [CONTACT_694071] ( and/or in the case of  allogeneic HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the 
transplant donor).  
4.2 Intervention  
For each course of therapy, the EBV -specific T -cells will be administered at a dose of 2x106 T-
cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694015] (+/ - 3 days) for three doses.  Each dose of T -cells will be 
infused intravenously over a period of [ADDRESS_941397] not achieved a CR 
may receive additional courses of 3 weekly T cell infusions, each followed by 3 week periods of 
observation.  
 
Because of  the potential of EBVLPD and EBV -associated malignancies to progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], patients 
who continue to show progression following the 3 week observation period  will be considered for 
alternative therapy (e.g. chemotherapy) or continued treatment with EBV -specific T -cells.  In some 
cases, patients with aggressive EBV in the absence of a grade [ADDRESS_941398] completion of T -cell 
therapy.   
 
If the planned dose of  EBV peptide sensitized T -cells (2x106 T-cells/kg) is not available , but the cells 
generated exhibit required levels of EBV specific cytotoxic activity and meet all other release criteria, 
patients may be treated at a dose level of 1x10^6 EBV specific T ce lls/kg.  A +/- 20% variability of 
total cell dose is allowed . 
In certain cases, in order to avoid discarding a large fraction of a vial  of the final product to achieve a 
specific dose level, which may affect viability, variability of each dose may exceed +/ -20%. In such 
cases, care will be given to ensure that the total combined volume of the 3 doses does not exceed 
the planned dose.  
 
If there are insufficient cells and no other viable options, patients may be infused with all available 
cells in two doses o r with three doses. If three doses are given each dose should be as close to 1 x 
106 T-cells/Kg as possible.  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC /DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
5.1 Donors of EBV -Specific T -cells 
 
The EBV -specific T -cell lines to be used for treatment in this protocol and to be maintained 
cryopreserved under GMP conditions in the Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility at MSKCC, will 
be derived from the 3  groups listed below:  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-2018 
 
 
 Page 11 of 41  
1) Normal, HLA -typed, EBV -seropositive donors of allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell or 
organ allografts, who previously consented and gave blood or leukocytes to establish EBV -
specific T -cells to be used to treat an EBV lymphoma were it to develop in the patient to 
whom they donated a hematopoietic cell graft or organ. Once that patient has recons tituted 
immune function and is no longer at risk of an EBV lymphoma, the donors will be informed 
of the purposes of this T -cell bank and will be asked for consent, in writing, to the addition of 
their EBV-specific T -cell line generated from their blood to the bank and to the use of these 
T-cells to treat an EBV lymphoma or EBV -associated malignancy in a patient other than the 
patient for whom they were originally intended. This group of previously esta blished EBV -
specific T -cell lines currently constitutes a bank of approximately 300 separate donor -
derived lines.  
2) Normal, HLA typed, EBV -seropositive related and unrelate d hematopoietic cell transplant 
donors who, from now on, are requested to consent to provide blood or blood white cells to 
make EBV -specific T -cells for treatment or prevention of an EBV -lymphoma in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694016] -specific T cell line generated can be 
transferred to the bank and used fo r another patient , at such time  as the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694017].   
3) Normal, HLA typed, EBV -seropositive volunteer blood donors whose T cells would add to 
the HLA diversity of the T cells available in the Immune Cell Th erapy Bank.  
Adequate health for donation is determined by [CONTACT_240825] (related donor) or NMDP (unrelated 
donor) guidelines.  Normal donors are evaluated for evidence of prior sensitization to EBV by [CONTACT_694072]. They are also typed for HLA -A,B, C and DR .  
Clinical studies are obtained within [ADDRESS_941399] be within a range  that would not preclude donating blood or 
undergoing leukapheresis.  Serologic testing for transm issible diseases will be performed as per 
each department’s guidelines or at the discretion of the treating attending.  
Because of the need to, at least, partially match the donor tissue type with the patient’s tumor, our 
goal is to have many 3rd party EB V CTL lines available. We estimate that a bank containing EBV -
immune T cells from about 300 -500 donors of different types would be able to supply partially 
matched T cells for over 90% of patients who have EBV disease.  
Volunteer blood donors in Group [ADDRESS_941400] already provided the two donations listed below upon initial consent to the  
T cell infusion protocol (IRB # 05 -065, 07 -055, 95 -024, or 12 -086) for the primary recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694018].  
i) An initial donation of 25 ml of heparinized blood -this blood is used to establish a B 
cell line transformed with the B95.8 laboratory strain of EBV, which is required for 
subsequent in vitro sensitization of the donor’s T -cells against EBV. The 
establishment and testing of an EBV transformed autologous B  cell line suitable for T -
cell stimulation requires 4 -5 weeks of in vitro culture.  
ii) A donation of a single standard [ADDRESS_941401] a leukapheresis from some of the 
donors , a unit of whole blood will be acceptable. However, the AICTF (Adoptive 
Immune Cell Therapy Facility manufacturing the clinical grade cell products under 
GMP conditions at MSKCC) may only be able to generate a limited number of T cells 
from a unit of bloo d. This blood is required for isolation of the T -cells to be sensitized 
with the donor’s EBV B cell line and propagated in vitro. In addition, it is required to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Page 12 of 41 provide autologous feeder cells essential to sustain T - cell growth without the risk of 
stimula ting the growth of alloreactive T -cells capable of inducing GVHD.  
In addition to providing written consent to these donations of blood for the purpose of generating 
EBV- specific T -cells for potential use in the treatment of an EBV lymphoma, volunteer dono rs in 
Group s 2 and 3 will be informed of the following potential applications of the blood cells donated:  
The use of a fraction of the cells isolated to generate:  
a) immune T -cells specific for another virus, called cytomegalovirus, that can cause lethal 
infections in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694019] T -cells could be used, under separate protocols to treat CMV infection ( IRB # 12 -086).  
Inclusion of the use of blood cells for the purpose of also generating T cells against CMV can 
obviate the need for an additional leukapheresis or unit of blood for this purpose. T-cells will be 
stored and maintained cryopreserved under GMP conditions in the Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy 
Facility at MSKCC, to be used for the treatment of patients in whom these cells may be therapeutic.  
  
5.2 Generation of EBV -Specific T -Cells From the Blood of Selected Donors  
For the gene ration of EBV -specific T -cells, 25 ml of heparinized blood is initially  drawn and used to 
prepare an EBV transformed B -cell line. To prepare these lines, Ficoll -Hypaque separated 
mononuclear cells are washed and exposed to filtered bacterial, fungal and mycoplasma -free 
supernatants of the EBV secreting B95 -8 marmos et cell line. The B95 -8 cell line used is negative for 
retroviruses and other animal viruses. After exposure, the cell lines are propagated in RPM1 -1640 
with glutamine and 10% pooled, screened fetal calf serum. After transformation of the B cells by 
[CONTACT_322891], t he EBV transformed cell line is expanded in the same medium together with acyclovir to 
prevent generation of infectious EBV. T heses cell lines can then be used as a stimulus for the 
generation of T -cells from the same donor. Prior to use as stimulators, th e EBV transformed cells 
are also irradiated to 9,[ADDRESS_941402] 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis or a unit of blood obtained from the donor is required . 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be separated from the leukapheresed cells by [CONTACT_694073] -Hypaque. An a liquot of these cells will be depleted of monocytes by 
[CONTACT_694074] (or by [CONTACT_694075]14 
microbeads if frozen/thawed sample is used , so as  to prevent clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_694020] n procedure). T -cells will then be enriched and purified by [CONTACT_694076] B -
cells with magnetic beads coupled with CD56 and CD19 clinical grade microbeads. Purified 
peripheral blood T -lymphocytes (1x106 cells/ml) will then be stimulated with 5x104 irradiated (9,000r) 
autologous EBV transformed B -cells. The T -cell: EBV+ BLCL ratio is therefore 20:1, a condition 
which favors development of EBV -reactive T -cells. These cells are propagated without added 
cytokine for  10 days, and there after, expanded b y growth in medium supplemented with clinical 
grade recombinant IL -2 (concentration 10 units/ml) and IL -15 (concentration 10ng/ml). Feedings with 
medium and  IL-2 are administered at 3 day intervals. IL15 is added weekly.  
The activity of the anti -EBV specif ic T-cells will be assayed at ~[ADDRESS_941403] autologous EBV B cell lines and appropriate specificity Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-2018 
 
 
 Page 13 of 41 will be selected for use as effectors for  adoptive immunotherapy. The criteria for selection of effector 
cell populations appropriate for adoptive immunotherapy will include:  
1) The EBV -specific T cell populations must be culture negative for bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma 
and must be tested and sho wn to contain ≤ 5 EU/ml cell dose of endotoxin.  
2) The EBV -specific T cell populations must exhibit high levels of specific lysis of EBV -
transformed autologous B cell lines (>25% specific lysis at effector target ratios of 25:1), but not 
against autologous  PHA blasts (<10%) in standard 51Cr release assays.  
3) The EBV -specific T cells must not exhibit significant cytotoxicity against the patient's PHA 
blasts or against HLA -mismatched EBV transformed B cell lines in standard 51Cr release assays.  
5.3  Cryopre servation and Storage  
Prior to use, these EBV - specific T -cells may be cryopreserved at a concentration of up to 30 x 106 
cells/ml in 10% DMSO, 16% human serum albumin and normal saline for intravenous infusion in 
cryovials labeled with the  unique identifier number and unique bar code of the donor,  name [CONTACT_694111][INVESTIGATOR_841], MSKCC MRN of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], component AICT#, component 
name, date the component was started, date the component was frozen and the number of ce lls 
frozen per container.   Cryovials will be stored in the vapor phase of a monitored liquid nitrogen  
freezer designated for this purpose in the AICT cell manufacture facility at MSKCC.

at MSKCC. Each T -cell line accrued to this Bank will be logged in a computerized registry recording 
the donor providing the T -cells, the donor’s eligibility, the donors written consent, the donor’s unique 
AICT number and the Q/A testing specifications described above under Generation of EBV - specif ic 
T-cells. Each sample will be labelled as described above under Cryopreservation and Storage.

of the investigator , patients with elevated but stable creatin ine will not be precluded from 
treatment on study.   
 There is no age restriction to eligibility for this protocol.  
It is expected that five types of patients afflicte d with EBV -associated lymphomas, 
lymphoproliferative diseases  or malignancies  will be referred and will consent to participate in this 
trial. These are : 
1) Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_694022] (HSCT) (ie: marrow, PBSC, or umbilical cord blood) . In 
these cases, the HSCT  donor, if EBV -seropositive, will be used as the donor of EBV -specific T -cells 
for adoptive immunotherapy  wherever possible , because the EBV -LPD are almost invariably derived 
from that marrow donor. These patients will be enrolled onto protocol # IRB [ADDRESS_941406] donor is EBV seronegative or not readily available (e.g. a cord blood transplant), the patient 
will be a candidate to receive EBV - specific T -cells generated from a third party seropositive donor 
that have been generated and stored in  the MSKCC bank of cryopreserved immune T -cells for 
adoptive cell therapy. For these patients, the third party donor derived T cells to be u sed will be 
selected primarily on the basis of 1) matching for , at least,  2 HLA a ntigens  and 2) one restricted 
allele  shared by [CONTACT_694080][INVESTIGATOR_841]. However, priority is given to T cells partially HLA 
antigen matched with, and restricted by,  HLA a lleles  of the transplant donor, since EBV + 
lymphomas in HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694023] (but not always) derived from the transplant donors’ cells.  
 
2) Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_694024]. In these cases, the lymphoma is usually of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694025]. EBV -specific T -cells will 
be selected from the MSKCC Bank expanded from an EBV -seropositive normal donor who is at 
least matched for 1) 2 HLA antigens  and 2) one restricted allele with t he EBV lymphoma. If the origin 
of the lymphoma is unknown, T -cells partially matched with the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694026], 
since these lymphomas are usually of host origin. Using this approach to donor selection, it is 
expected that the EBV -specific,  HLA restricted cytotoxic T -cells expanded from the HLA partially -
matched donor would be able to recognize and kill lymphoma cells presenting EBV antigens in the 
context of an appropriate HLA restricting element.  Priority will be given to the use of partia lly Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

4) Patients who develop EBV lymphomas or lymphoproliferative diseases or other EBV -
associated malignancy as a consequence of profound immunodeficiencies associated with a 
congenital  immune deficit or acquired as a sequela of anti -neoplastic or immunosuppressive 
therapy. For these patients, normal, EBV specific T -cells from third party seropositive donors who 
are HLA compatible in  1) at least  2 HLA antigens  and 2) one restricted allel e shared by [CONTACT_694084].  Again, selection of T cells known to be restricted by [CONTACT_694085].  
 
5) Patients who develop other EBV -associated malignancies without pre -existing immune 
deficiency, including: EBV+ Hodgkin’s and Non -Hodgkin’s disease, EBV+ nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma, EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or EBV+ leiomyosarcoma. Normal, EBV 
specific T -cells from third party seropositive donors who are HLA compatible in 1) at least  2 HLA 
antigens  and 2) one restricted allele shared by [CONTACT_694082].  Again, selection of T cells 
known to be restricted by [CONTACT_694083].

 7.1 Patient Recruitment  
 
Patients with EBV lymphoproliferative diseases, lymphomas or other EBV -associated malignancies 
will be referred  from (but not limited to) the Allogeneic Marrow Transplant program at MSKCC, the 
marrow and organ transplant programs at other centers in New Yo rk, New Jersey and Connecticut 
and from transplant centers participating in the national BMT Clinical Trials Network. We are also

(ie: MSKCC IRB # 95 -024, 05 -065, 07 -055, and 12 -086) and have already provided blood donations 
under those protocols . These donors will be asked to provide separate consent for transf er of their 
cells to the third party bank for potential use in patients enrolled onto this protocol.  Because these 
donors were only under the care of MSKCC for the period in which they donated cells for their 
primary recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694029] , they  will be mailed a copy of the consent form to 
review during the consent discussion, which will occur over the phone . If they  agree to 3rd party use 
of their cells, the consent  will be signed and sent back via MSKCC provided pre -paid/addressed

8.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION  
8.1 Patient Pretreatment Evaluation  
The following evaluations will be performed within approximately 30 business days prior to 
treatment on study , with the exception of EBV DNA and blood samples, which will be drawn 
within approximately  3 business days prior to beginning treatment . Certain tests may be held 
at the discretion of the treating physician : 
 EBV DNA will be quantitated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using a quantitative pcr -

amplified RFLP analyses. They will also be evaluated for the clonality of the lymphoma as 
defined by [CONTACT_694088][INVESTIGATOR_694032].  For patients with other EBV associated malignancies, the 
tumor cells can be analyzed for their expansion of EBV antigens  and for EBV type by [CONTACT_694089]. Pathologically confirmed lymphomas will be characterized by [CONTACT_694090] -associated 
RNAs (EBERs) and proteins such as EBNA -1, EBNA -2 and/or LMP -1. Whenever possible, 
an aliquot of cells will be cryopreserved.   
 Pregnancy Test for women of childbearing age  
Patients will also have blood samples drawn to evaluate:  
 General immune function . These studies will include quantitation of T - and B -cells and their 
subsets by [CONTACT_694091] T -cells to respond 
to mitogens, antigens, and allogeneic cells.  
 EBV-specific immunity . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the patients will be 
evaluated for their capacity to proliferate and to generate cytotoxic T -cells specifically 
reactive against autologous EBV -transformed B -cells. In addition,  limiting dilution analyses 
will be performed to ascertain the frequency of CTL precursors in the peripheral blood T -cell 
population which exhibit specific reactivity against EBV as well as the frequency of T -cells 
exhibiting a capacity to react against a third party allogeneic stimulus.  
 
9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
Each patient consenting to participate in this Phase II trial will be treated with in vitro expanded EBV -
specific T -cells. Patients will be initially stratified into two groups.  
Group [ADDRESS_941409] of:  
A. Allogeneic marrow graft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694033] T cell engraftment and, therefore, could be at risk for GvHD  
B. Patients with severe congenital or antineoplastic drug induced immun odeficiency who 
could  be durably engrafted and a re therefore at risk for GvHD  
Group [ADDRESS_941410] of:  
A. Organ allograft  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Although immunocompromised, these patients can reject third 
party blood cells. Thus, the risk of sustained engraftment or GvHD is low  
B. AIDS patients who will almost invariably reject the infused T -cells and are ther efore at 
very low risk of GvHD  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-[ADDRESS_941411] the infused T cells and are at low or no risk of 
GvHD  
9.1 Treatment for Patients in Group 1 
Patients in Group 1 will each receive a course of three weekly infusions of EBV -specific T -cells. 
Each weekly dose will provide 2 x106 T-cells/Kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593] (+/ - 3 days) from the donor’s EBV -
specific T -cell line. After the third dose, patients will be observed for approximately  3 weeks. If only 
grade  0-2 toxicity  related to the infusion  has been observed  and GVHD ha s not developed or 
exacerbated , patients  in CR, PR , or SD  may be treated with a second course of 3 weekly infusions 
of EBV -specific T -cells. After the second 3 week course of cell infusions , responses will be graded  if 
there is a change in response . If at that time , only 0 -2 toxicity related to the infusion has been 
observed and GVHD has not developed or exacerbated, and no further progression  of the EBV LPD 
or malignancy has been detected, these patients may be treated with additional infusions of EBV -
specific T -cells at the same dose  level.  If, on the other hand, the patient has already achieved a CR 
of the EBV LPD or malignancy, the second ary infusions may be either administered or electively 
held or postponed.  If at any time in the course of these infusions a grade 3 -4 toxicity rela ted to the 
infusion has been observed, no further doses of cells will be administered.  
Because of the potential of EBV LPD and EBV -associated malignancies to progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], p atients 
who continue to show progression following the 3 week observation perio d will be considered for 
alternative therapy (e.g. chemotherapy) or treatment with additional EBV-specific T cells . Patients 
may receive treatment from a different third party donor that is specific for EBV but restricted by a 
different HLA allele shared b y the EBVLPD.   
The rationale for using such EBV -CTL from a second HLA partially matched third party donor is 
based on our prior experience ( 72, 73 ) and that of Gottschalk et al ( 74) indicating that failures of 
adoptive therapy in the treatment of EBVLPD ar e usually due to failure of T -cells generated against 
EBV strain B95.[ADDRESS_941412] 
completion of T -cell therapy.  
 
If the initial planned dose s of EBV peptide sensitized T -cells (2 x106 T-cells/Kg) are not achieved  or 
available , but the cells generated exhibit requ ired levels of EBV specific cytotoxic activity and meet 
all other release criteria, patients may be treated at a dose level of 1 x106 T-cells/Kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_293641]. A +/- 20% variability of total cell dose is allowed.  
 
In certain cases, in order to avoid discarding a large fraction of a vial of the final product to achieve a 
specific dose level, which may affect viability, variability of each dose may exceed +/ -20%. In such 
cases, care will be given to ensure that the to tal combined volume of the 3 doses does not exceed 
the planned dose.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Page 19 of 41  
If there are insufficient cells and no other viable options, patient s may be infused with all available 
cells in two doses or with three doses . If three doses are given each dose should  be as close  to 1 x 
106 T-cells/Kg as possible.   
 
 
 9.2 Treatment for Patients in Group 2 
 
Patients in Group 2 will also receive 3 weekly intravenous infusions of 2 x 106 EBV-specific T -
cells/kg  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593] (+/ - 3 days ). After the third dose, patients will be observed for at least 3 
weeks. If only grade 0 -2 toxicity related to the infusion has been observed  and GVHD ha s not 
developed or exacerbated , patients  in CR, PR, or SD  may be treated with a second course of 3 
weekly infusions of EBV -specific T -cells.  After the second 3 week course of cell infusions, responses 
will be graded  if there is a change in response . If at that time , only 0 -2 toxicity related to the infusion 
has been observed and no further progression of the EBV LPD or malignancy has been detected, 
these patients may be treated with additional infusions of EBV -specific T -cells at the same dose 
level OR at a dose of 1 x 107 T-cells/kg/dose.  If, on the other hand, the patient has already achieved 
a PR or CR of the EBV LPD or malignancy, the second ary infusions may be either administered or 
electively held or postponed. If at any time in the course of these infusions a grade 3 -4 toxicity 
related to the infusion has b een observed, no further doses of cells will be administered.  
This five -fold increment in dose planned for  the secondary  courses, to be administered to patients in 
Group 2 is based on these considerations: 1) the expected low incidence of toxicity and 
comp lications of the T -cell infusions; 2) the expectations that patients in Group 2, once sensitized, 
will eliminate secondary doses of T -cells too rapi[INVESTIGATOR_694034]. This reactivity against donor cells will also likely limit their effectiveness beyond 
two courses of therapy.  
Because of the potential of EBV LPD and EBV -associated malignancies to progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], patients 
who continue to show progression following the 3 week observation period  may be considered for 
alternative therapy (e.g. chemotherapy) or treatment with  additional  EBV-specific T cells . Patients 
may receive treatment from a different third party donor that is specific for EBV but restricted by a 
different HLA allele shared by [CONTACT_694092].  In some cases , patients with aggressive EBV in the 
absence of a grade [ADDRESS_941413] completion of T -cell therapy.  
If the planned dose of EBV peptide sensitized T -cells (2 x106 T-cells/Kg  and/or of 1 x 107 cells/kg ) is 
not achieved, but the cells generated exhibit required levels of EBV specific cytotoxic activity and 
meet all other release criteria, patients may be treated at a dose level of 1 x106 T-cells/Kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_293641].  A +/- 20% variability of total cell dose is allowed.  
 
In certain cases, in order to avoid discarding a large fraction of a vial of the final product to achieve a 
specific dose level, which may affect viability, variability of each dose may exceed +/ -20%. In such 
cases, care will be given to ensure that the to tal combined volume of the 3 doses does not exceed 
the planned dose.  
 
If there are insufficient cells and no other viable options, patients may be infused with all available 
cells in two doses or with three doses. If three doses are given each dose should  be as close to 1 x 
106 T-cells/Kg as possible.  
 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-[ADDRESS_941414] tha t the toxicity associated with the T -cell infusions will be minimal (29, 46, 52, 53). Because 
of the in vitro selection for T -cells reactive against EBV, the frequency of alloreactive T -cells capable 
of inducing GvHD or, in organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], an organ rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_694035]. Nevertheless, the risks of fostering GvHD in marrow allo graft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694036], since these patients will already have been engrafted with an allogeneic 
donor -derived marrow and lymphoid progenitors. On the other hand, AIDS patients , organ graft 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and otherwise normal patients  with other EBV associated malignancies, even in the 
extremes of virus or drug induced immunosuppression, retain the capacity to reject foreign 
hematopoietic cells and do not develop GvHD even when repeatedly transfused with unirradiated 
blood (39). Thus, these patients who constitute group 2would be expected to be at low risk for GvHD 
even if substantial numbers of alloreactive T -cells were to be transfused in the EBV -specific T -cell 
inoculum.  
9.3. Use of Other Medications and Treatments During the Trial o f EBV -Specific T -
Cell Infusions  
1) Graft Versus Host Disease Prophylaxis and Treatment  
Following the infusions of third party donor -derived EBV -specific T -cells, no additional drug 
prophylaxis will be given to prevent GvHD. In patients who do develop GvHD,  standard clinical and 
pathological criteria will be used to establish the diagnosis. GvHD will be graded according to BMT -
CTN and IBMTR systems  clinical criteria as defined by [CONTACT_93128], et al (66). A patient who  develops 
significant (grade II or greater) GvHD following infusion of third party donor -derived EBV specific T 
cells will be considered for treatment with high -dose methylprednisolone. Refractory grade II or 
progressive grade III or IV GvHD will be treated according to separate protocols.  
2) Concur rent Medications  
a) Any non -cytotoxic, non -chemotherapeutic medications needed in the management of the 
patient or the prevention and treatment of bacterial, fungal or parasitic infection are allowed.  Since 
Rituxan is being used to treat EBV+ B cell lympho mas, and most patients referred for  treatment with 
EBV CTLs are those  whose disease continues to progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_694037], ongoing treatment with 
Rituxan will also be permitted.  
b) Marrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_513203], steroids, or antimetabolite drugs as 
immunosuppressive agents for prophylaxis against GvHD should, whenever possible, have these 
agents discontinued at least one week prior to initiation of treatment with EBV -specific T -cells. 
Patients requirin g these agents as treatment for acute or chronic GvHD or as essential prophylaxis 
against organ graft rejection may continue maintenance therapy with cyclosporine, tacrolimus or 
sirolimus since  data from our own and other centers suggest that these  agent s do not preclude  the 
viability or antigen -specific cytot oxic function of pre -sensitized and  expanded  memory T -cells. 
However, t reatment with systemic steroids, anti -thymocyte globulin, and/or Imuran should be 
discontinued whenever possible prior to initiati on of T -cell infusions  since theses agents will 
eliminate the infused T cells or severely compromise their capacity to grow in the treated patient . It is 
recognized, however, that clinical circumstances may mandate maintenance of treatment with 
steroids (e .g., GVH treatment in patients who, by [CONTACT_694093], cannot tolerate 
cyclosporine, or patients to be treated for EBV lymphomas of the brain who may require steroids to 
reduce neurologic symptoms induced by [CONTACT_694094]) . In such cases, doses will 
be maintained at as low a level as considered clinically safe and appropriate prior to initiation of 
infusions of EBV specific T cells.  
c) Organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694038], tacrolimus or sirolimus . Of these, 
sirolimus is preferred since this MTOR inhibitor may, i tself, inhibit gr owth of EBV transferred cells 
(71). If possible, treatment with systemic steroids shou ld be discontinued prior to initiation of T -cell Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: 15-Mar-2018 
 
 
 Page 21 of 41 infusions. Anti-thymocyte globulin  and/or Imuran  should not be given.  Since polyclonal EBV -
lymphoproliferative diseases may regress following cessation of immunosuppression, cessation of 
agents other than cy closporine , tacrolimus or sirolimus should ideally be completed two weeks prior 
to initiation of infusions of EBV -specific T -cells to permit assessment of the effect of altered 
immunosuppression on the progress of the EBV lymphomas to be treated. As for ma rrow graft 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], clinical circumstances may preclude cessation of steroids . In such cases, doses should 
be reduced  to as low a dose  as is safe and appropriate during the T cell infusions and for 3 weeks 
after each course.  
d) AIDS patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_694039].  
e) All patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_694040], zoster or CMV infections may be 
maintained on these agents at the same dose during treatment with EBV -specific T -cells.  
f) Blood support  All blood products for transfusion, except the infusions of EBV -specifi c T-cells 
will be irradiated to inactivate lymphocytes capable of initiating lethal GvHD. Blood products are 
irradiated in the Blood Bank, using a cesium gamma emitter.  
 
10.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
The timing of  evaluations below is approximate . The schedule of tests described should be 
adhered to whenever possible. However, in certain situations, particularly late after 
treatment, circumstances may preclude assessments at the times specified, at which point 
they may be held the discretion of the tr eating physician : 
 
 Patients will be evaluated clinically by [CONTACT_694095] , post,  and at 1 and 2 hours following 
initiation of each i nfusion of EBV -specific T -cells 
 
 Patients will receive interim history, review of systems, and physical exam  prior to starting a 
cycle of EBV -specific T -cells. Assessments will then be performed weekly , as clinically 
indicated,  for the first [ADDRESS_941415] initial infusion  
 
 Patients will als o be assessed for the effects of the adoptively transferred EBV -specific T -
cells on circulating levels of EBV DNA.  For these studies, EDTA blood (10cc) will be drawn 
on day 1, then weekly for the first [ADDRESS_941416] 
initial infusion  
 In order to assess the effects of infusions of EBV -specific T -cells on the level of circulating 
virus-specific cytotoxic T -cells in the circulation, limiting dilution analyses quantitating EBV -
specific CTLp will be performed using [ADDRESS_941417] initial infusio n of EBV CTLs (ie: prior to the 2nd and 3rd T cell doses). 
EBV-specific CTLp will also be assessed on day 15, at weekly intervals for [ADDRESS_941418]-initial infusion  
 Research samples may be collected at approximately day 0, day 7, and day 14 testing for 
cytokines. Additional samples will be collected if there are clinical indications to monitor for 
cytokines.  
 CBC and Flow Cytometry 7 panel will be obtained on t he same days EBV CTLp are drawn  
 
 Evaluations of T -cell proliferative responses to mitogens and non -EBV micr obial antigens will 
be drawn at [ADDRESS_941419] initial infusion of EBV CTLs

 Page 22 of 41  PET/CT and/or MRI scans will be performed on patients with radiologically identifiable 
disease prior to T cell therapy at [ADDRESS_941420] initial infusion . Scans may be performed earlier if clinically indicated.  
 
 In ou r experience, patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinomas do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_694041]. These patients may forgo scans at Week [ADDRESS_941421] completion of a second cycle of cells. Eval uation for 
these patients will occur after a second cycle of cells, unless clinically indicated.  
 
 Whenever possible  and if clinically indicated , lymph nodes or parenchymal sites of 
lymphoma will be biopsied [ADDRESS_941422] and/or second 3 week course of EBV -
specific T -cells to assess the effects of the infusions on the tissues involved. Biopsied tissues 
will be examined f or histopathologic evidence of EBV+ tumor cells . Immunohistochemical 
analyses will also be performed to characterize ce lls infiltrating the biopsied tissues . If 
sufficient biopsy tissue is available,  single cell suspensions will be derived from portions of 
involved tissue and characterized as to immunophenotype, expression of EBV antigens, 
origin (donor or host) and clonal ity. Origin will be determined by [CONTACT_694096] B - and 
T lymphocytes for donor or host unique X, Y and/or autosomal polymorphisms by [CONTACT_694097]/or pcr amplified RFLP analyses. Cells will also be analyzed for residual populations of 
EBV+ tumor cells b earing the distinctive VDJ rearrangement of the Ig gene and the 
distinctive homogenous genomic terminus of EBV epi[INVESTIGATOR_694042].  
 
 Blood samples not to exceed 20 ml/sample and marrow samples not to exceed 10 ml/sample 
will also be drawn at approximately 6 month intervals for 1 year and thereafter as part of 
clinically indicated  evaluation to assess the presence of minimal residual disease, using pcr 
amplified techniques for detection of EBV DNA and, when poss ible, lymphoma -associated 
VDJ rearrangements.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
11.1 Patient To xicities/Side Effects  
On this study, we will be capturing and tracking Grade [ADDRESS_941423] -
infusion. Patients who might subsequently receive donor lymphocytes , boosts,  or a secondary 
transplant will be evaluable up until that time point. Toxicities which are attributable to underlyi ng 
malignancy and/or were present prior to initiation of therapy will not be tracked.  Please see section 
17.2 for Serious Adverse Event reporting.   
Each of the following Toxicities and Side Effects is expected to be unlikely:  
1) Acute Toxicities : The EBV -specific T -cells to be used for adoptive immunotherapy are 
activated T -cells potentially capable of generating significant quantities of cytokine such as IL -2, IFN -
γ and TNF. These cytokines may acutely induce fever and could potentially cause 
hypotension a nd other manifestations of shock, including toxicity to the lung . However, 
experience with infusions of CMV -specific T -cells (55), in vitro expanded tumor infiltrating T -cells 
(54) and existing limited studies of adoptively transferred EBV -reactive T -cells, either as purified 
fractions or in donor leukocytes (34,46, 57, 58) suggest that these infusions will be well tolerated, 
with a low risk of systemic toxicity.  
2) Marrow or Organ Allograft Rejection : Patients receiving third party donor -derived EBV -
specific T -cell infusions for treatment of monoclonal EBV -lymphomas complicating the 
immunoablation used to prepare patients for an allogeneic h ematopoietic transplant or the 
immunosuppression used to sustain an organ allograft may be at risk of an acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_694043] T -cells. Such epi[INVESTIGATOR_694044] T -cells are prese nt in the T -cell inoculum. In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], this could lead to loss of the hematopoietic cell transplant, resulting in marrow aplasia, a 
potentially lethal complication. Therefore, if severe leukopenia or thrombocytop enia is observed that 
is potentially attributable to the infused T -cells, the patient will be treated with prednisone and/or 
anti-thymocyte globulin to eliminate the infused third party T -cells.  
In organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694045]-specific T -cells, upon interaction with 
their targets, will generate cytokines capable of stimulating alloreactive host T -cells that have been 
suppressed by [CONTACT_694098]. If a rejection crisis is precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162], it will be treated as 
recommended by [CONTACT_102]'s transplant physician.  
3) Graft Versus Host Disease : Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) represents an immune 
assault induced by [CONTACT_694099] T -lymphocytes, against host alloantigens Blood/BM samples

Approval date: 15-Mar-[ADDRESS_941424] allogeneic lymphoid cells. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a large  documented experience of 
transfusions of unirradiated cells, no instance of GvHD has been recorded in AIDS patients or 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694046], lung, heart, or liver grafts (59). Thus, these patients are likely not at risk for this 
complication  
On the other hand, m arrow transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_694047] -
matched or HLA -mismatched T -cells capable of responding to host alloantigens. Acute GvHD 
affects 60% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched marrow grafts. Up to 85% of adults transplanted with HLA -
matched marrow from unrelated donors or partially matched related donors will develop moderate to 
severe (grade II -IV) acute GvHD despi[INVESTIGATOR_694048] (60) . This complication is a principal 
contributor to mortality in 40 -50% of cases. Furthermore, 50% of the survivors of acute GvHD will 
develop manifestations of chronic GvHD (61).  
The in vitro propagation of T -cells reactive against autologous EBV -transforme d cells selects for the 
expansion of EBV -specific T -cells and the elimination of other T -cells, including alloantigen -
responsive T -cells (58). As a result, infusions of virus -specific T -cells generated over 4 -6 weeks in 
vitro in our own and other publis hed experience (46, 47, 49, 53 ) have thus far not been complicated 
by [CONTACT_694100][INVESTIGATOR_840] . Nevertheless, there is a risk that small numbers of 
alloreactive T -cells could be transferred with the infusions of EBV -specific T -cells. To counter this  
risk, only HLA matched or HLA partially matched donors will be used as donors of EBV -specific T -
cells and only EBV -specific T -cells tested to be free of cells reactive against allogeneic cells will be 
administered to patients who could be durably engrafte d following a T -cell infusion.  
4) Transmission of Infection : There is a potential that t ransfusions of white cells or T -
lymphocytes may also serve as vectors of serious infection . All precautions to maintain sterility will 
be taken.  
5) Transfusion Reaction s: It is possible that during the course of repeated infusions of EBV -
specific T -cells derived from a normal donor, the host will develop an immune response against the 
donor cells, which could lead to an immediate allergic response, manifested by [CONTACT_694101], angioneurotic edema, or more serious manifestations such as bronchospasm or 
hypotension. Such reactions will be treated symptomatically.  
6) Treatment Failure : Treatment with EBV -specific T -cells may not alter the progression of E BV 
lymphoma or may induce only transient regressions of disease. Furthermore, because of host 
immune responses to donor cells, secondary or subsequent treatment by [CONTACT_694102].  
7) Reproductive Risks : Patients should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_59613]. Women should not breast feed 
while on this study. Women may need to use birth control while on the study, but should check w ith 
their study doctor regarding what type of birth control and how long to use it.  
 
11.1 Donor Toxicity/Side Effects  
Risks of blood donation are minimal and include: minor discomfort at site of blood draw, some 
bleeding and/or bruising, and lightheadedne ss.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-2018 
 
 
 Page 25 of 41 Risks of Leukapheresis include: Lack of feeling or tingling of fingertip s or around mouth, which 
normally last only a short time, and can, potentially, progress to cramps. This is normally treated with 
a calcium supplement.  
Other leukapheresis side ef fects include:  
 - Pain 
 - Bruising at the needle insertion sites  
 - Dizziness  
 - Nausea  
 - Fainting due to temporary lowering of the blood pressure (rare)  
 - Infection (rare)  
   
Platelet count may drop during the leukapheresis and will be measured after  the collection. If platelet 
count falls enough to place the donor in danger of bleeding, count will be checked daily until it 
returns to normal.  
The leukapheresis requires that a needle be placed in a vein in each arm. About 15% of the time, we 
are un able to use the donor’s  arm veins.  The donor may be asked to go through a minor surgical 
procedure to place a central line. The donor  will be asked to sign another consent form if a central 
line needs to be put in.  
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
1) Acute toxicities induced by [CONTACT_694103] -specific T -cells will be graded according to the 
NCI-CTC 4.0  criteria used to grade organ toxicities induced by [CONTACT_694104] (62).

4) The responses of the  clinically and/or radiologically evident  EBV LPD or malignancies  will be 
identified  three weeks post -infusion cycle and may be performed earlier if clinically indicated. In our 
experience, patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinomas do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_694051]. Evaluation for these patients will occur after a second cycle of cells , unless clinically 
indicated. Outcome responses will be captured post-first cycle and post final -cycle of infusions of 
EBV specific T cells. Best response observed in the full course of treatment will also be recorded as 
a distinct entity.

development of EBV LPD   
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the 
US FDA Regulations, a patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason without prejudice to his/her future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  The 
Investigator also  has the right to withdraw patients from the study (see below).  Should a patient 
(or a patient’s legally authorized representative) decide to withdraw, all efforts will be made to 
complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.  
A complete final evaluation should be made at the time of the patient’s withdrawal, the Study 
Status Outcome form in the case report form should be completed with an explanation of why 
the patient is withdrawing, and an attempt should be made to perform a follow -up evaluation.  
Patients may be removed from study , and not followed further,  if one or more of the following 
events occur:  
 Significant noncompliance on the part of the patient  
 Refusal of the patient to continue treatment or observations  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Page 27 of 41  Unacceptable toxicity (i.e.: grade 3 -4 toxicity related to EBV CTL infusion). Removal 
for unacceptable toxicity does not necessarily preclude continued follow -up. 
 Progressive disease that in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_694053]  
 Decision by [CONTACT_309655]’s best medical interest  
 Unrelated medical illness or complication  
 Lost to follow -up 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
A phase 2  trial design will be applied to determine the efficacy of Epstein -Barr Virus Immune T -
lymphocyte lines for the treatment of EBV malignancies.  The e valuation of treatment will be 
assessed separately for 1) patients with EBV -LPD after allogeneic HSCT who a re severely 
immunocompromised or patients with severe congenital or antineoplastic drug induced 
immunodeficiency and 2) patients with EBV -LPD after organ allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], AIDS patients, or 
patients who develop other EBV -associated malignancies without  pre-existing immune deficiency. 
For patients with EBV -LPD, the primary endpoint is complete response or a sustained partial 
response for [ADDRESS_941425] an  EBV-LPD, a two -stage design with a maximum of 28 patients 
will be accrued onto this study.  The therapy is considered active if the probability of a complete or 
sustained partial response for 6 months (CR/SPR) in the population exceeds 0.40. In the first stage, 
16 patients will be enrolled in the stud y. If 6 or fewer CR/SPRs are observed, then the trial will be 
stopped. If at least 7 responses are observed, then 12 additional patients will be accrued, for a total 
of 28 patients. At the conclusion of the trial, if 14 or fewer CR/SPRs are observed, we wi ll conclude 
that the treatment combination is not sufficiently active. This design has power 0.90 for a population 
CR/SPR proportion of 0.[ADDRESS_941426].  At the conclusion of the study, we will 
estimate the probability of a complete r esponse or a sustained partial response for 6 months and the 
95% confidence interval for this response parameter. Kaplan -Meier estimates of overall and disease 
free survival over time will be computed.  
Patients in Group 2 (section 9.0 and 9.2) who develop  an EBV LPD as a complication of an organ 
allograft or AIDS and patients with EBV -associated malignancies without pre -existing immune 
deficiency a re expected to consistently reject the third party cells. As a result, the survival of cells 
post each infusio n is expected to be shorter. Nevertheless, an initial expansion suggests that 50 -
70% of these patients may achieve a durable CR or PR. Therefore, for this group, we will also adopt 
a two stage design, with a maximum of 28 patients to be accrued onto this s tudy. The therapy is 
again considered active if the probability of a complete or sustainable partial response for 6 months 
(CR/SPR)  exceeds 0.20. If at the conclusion of the study [ADDRESS_941427]. The study design has power 0.90 for a six -
month disease free probability equal to 0.40.  At the conclusion of the study, Kaplan -Meier es timates 
of overall and disease free survival over time will be computed.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 11-130 A(23) 
Approval date: 15-Mar-[ADDRESS_941428] will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_694110]4+ and CD8+, CD3+ T-cells, NK cells and B -cells as specified in the 
Schedule of Examinations and Studies Table on Page 22.  Nonparametric curve smoothing methods 
will be employed to estimate the population trajectory of these immunologic recovery factors over 
time. In addition, a generalized estimating equat ion approach will be used to model the relationship 
between the immunologic reconstitution factors and complete response.   
It is anticipated that accrual for both groups will be completed within [ADDRESS_941429] disease or early treatment related mortality during the accrual period.  The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_694054] 1 and Group 2 and are given in the tables below. In the event that the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_694055], the study will continue accrual in the other group.

N/A 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
This is a single institution trial and all patients will be treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center. 
A research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to this study. The responsibilities of the RSA 
include project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, regulatory 
monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of the protocol 
study team. The data manager will also monitor laboratory compliance throughout the study. 
Laboratory data will be tabulated and summarized based on MSKCC normal ranges. 
The data collected for this study will be entered into the MSKCC Clinical Research Data Base 
(CRDB). 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
Registration reports will be generated by [CONTACT_108546] a regular basis to monitor patient 
accruals and completeness of the registration data. Routine data quality reports will be 
generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and 
accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study 
period and potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion 
and action.   
Random-sample data quality and protocol compliance audits will be conducted by [CONTACT_123894], at a minimum of two times per year, more frequently if indicated. 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001. The plans address the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer  
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety 
and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus 
there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our 
clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board.

 Page 32 of 41 During the protocol development and rev iew process, each protocol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) Will be addressed 
and the monitoring pr ocedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
    Consent process : Participation in this trial is voluntary.  All patients will be required to sign 
a statement of informed consent, which must conform to MSKCC IRB guidelines.  
 
    Benefits :  It is not known whether this treatment will improve the overall survival 
of the p atient.  
 
 Risks:  The potential risks of this therapy as described in Section 11 of this protocol may 
outweigh the potential benefits in an individual patient. The potential risks are related to 
adverse effects which could be induced by [CONTACT_145162] T cells d erived f rom EBV sensitized 
T cell lines . Appropriate exclusion of patients are listed in the section of patient eligibility.  
 
    Costs : The patient’s  health plan/ insurance company will need to pay for some or all of the 
costs of treating his/her  disease  in this study , including the production of EBV immune T 
cells. Patients will be charged for physician visits, routine laboratory and radiologic studies 
required for monitoring their condition.   
 
    Alternatives to the Planned Study : Alternative treatment  options include continued 
treatment with Rituxan and standard antiviral drugs used for herpes virus infections and 
treatment with chemotherapeutic agents used for Lymphomas not associated with EBV 
infection in other investigational studies.  If relevant, other investigational options will also 
be outlined.  Issues relating to best supportive care as a treatment option alone will be 
reviewed, given that most chemotherapy responses with standard drugs are infrequent and 
short lived. (see Patient Informed Cons ent). 
 
 Confidentiality : Every effort will be made to maintain patient confidentiality. Research and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333494].  Patient's names or any other personally identifying 
information will not be used in reports or publications resulting from this study.  The Foo d 
and Drug Administration or other authorized agencies (e.g., qualified   monitors from 
MSKCC or the NCI etc.), and appropriate personnel may review patient   records as 
required.  
 
17.1 Privacy  
MSKCC’s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a completed and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A Research Authorization fo rm must be completed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_30505] (IRB/PB).

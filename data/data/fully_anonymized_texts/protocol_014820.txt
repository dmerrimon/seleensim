2/Protocol GO39869, Version 2PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 2:
RATIONA LE
Protocol GO39869 has been amended to limit the highest dose for patients enrolled in 
Cohorts 1 5 of this study to 2.4 mg/kg of DHES0815A every 3 weeks (Q3W ) (see 
Section 3.1).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, this amendment provides updated stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761207] (Section 6.1.2 ). The revised stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761208] a Bayesian posterior 
probability approach (Thall and Simon 1994) to evaluate toxicity in the expansion 
cohorts, including the rate of dose- limiting toxicity (DLT)-equivalent events that occur 
during Cycle 1 of study treatment.  Events that are DLT-e quivalent in the expansion 
cohort are defined by [CONTACT_761237]- escalation cohorts (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Additional clarifications have been made to the exclusion criteria (Section 4.1.2) :
The wash -out period for lapatinib has been qualified to be 14 -days, given its short 
half-life.
Examples of medical conditions for exclusion regarding evidence of significant 
uncontrolled concomitant disease have 
been included : 
Patients with vascular leak syndrome or with a history of or who have active 
interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis or other clinically significant lung 
disease are not eligible for the study .
Patients who have any malignancies other than breast cancer are excl uded 
from thestudy with the exception of patients who have a history of localized 
malignancies andwere treated with curative intent and whose disease is 
unlikely to recur are eligible for thestudy.

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
3/Protocol GO39869, Version 2The following qualification has been included in the exclusion criterion for clinically 
significant history of liver disease to reflect the lower safety risk for asymptomatic 
hepatitis B carriers:
Patients who are asymptomatic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers based on 
serologic studies, with no history of clin ically significant hepatitis, may be 
eligible if peripheral blood HBV viral load is undetectable by [CONTACT_12036] (PCR). HBV carriers should receive prophylactic anti -viral therapy and 
be monitored for active HBV replication during trial parti cipation per local 
standard of care.
Other minor revisions have been made to improve clarity and consistency :
Names of countries in which study will be conducted have been removed from 
Section 3.[ADDRESS_1042436] may evolve with the ongoing needs of the study .
It has been c larified that absolute counts are required for neutrophils and 
lymphocytes ,but that percentages can be reported for other cell counts 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix 1, footnote "o").
The number of ECGs required at screening has been aligned withlanguage in 
Sections 4.1.2 and 4.5.7 (Appendix 1, footnote "k").
Anti-drug ant ibody (ADA) and pharmacokinetic ( PK)sample collection in footnotes 
"d"and "e"of Appendix 2 has been aligned with information provided in the table of 
Appendi x 2.
The Genentech Medical Monitor name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_26704]

End of Study
The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit occurs or the date at 
which the last data point required for statistical analysis or safety follow -up(42days following
last dose) is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later.  The end of the study is 
expected to occur about [ADDRESS_1042454] (IMP) for this study is DHES0815A with no comparator or 
placebo arm.
Test Product (Investigational Drug)
DHES0815A administration will be performed in a setting with emergency medical facilities and 
access to a critical care unit with staff who are trained to monitor for and resp ond to potentially 
serious reactions.  The total dose of DHES0815A for each patient will depend on the dose 
assignment and the patient’s weight on Day 1 of each cy cle (or within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of 
that c ycle). Patients may  receive the initial (Cy cle 1) dose of DHES0815A unless the patient’s 
body  weight has changed by 5% from baseline weight, in which case a new DHES0815A dose 
must be calculated.  This new dose of DHES0815A may be given in subsequent cy cles, unless 
the patient experiences another  5% change in body weight, in which case a new DHES0815A 
dose must be calculated.  DHES0815A will be administered once every 21 days. Patients may 
continue to receive treatment with DHES0815A so long as they meet the criteria to do so or until 
they are r equired or choose to discontinue from study treatment as outlined in the protocol .
DHES0815A will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_761244] a polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) or polyolefin composed of polyethylene and polypropylene (P O-PE-PP)bag containing 
0.9% NaCl and using an infusion set equipped with a 0.2- m in-line filter .  The final 
DHES0815A concentration will be determined by [CONTACT_761245].
Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
The objective of the dose escalation is to de termine the MTD/MAD and RP2D of DHES0815A .
If the safety and PK profile seen in the dose- escalation portion of the study is deemed to be 
favorable to justify further continuation of the study, expansion cohorts will be enrolled to further 
confirm safety  and tolerability and to assess preliminary evidence of anti -tumor activity and 
exploratory pharmacodynamic markers of response.
The final analysis will be based on patient data collected through patient discontinuation or 
study discontinuation, whichever occ urs first.  All analyses will be based on the safety -evaluable 
population.  All summaries will be presented according to the assigned dose level and cohort.  
In general, data will be summarized as warranted, and listings will be used in place of tables 
when the samples sizes are small.  Continuous variables will be summarized using means, 
standard deviations, median, and ranges; categorical variables will be summarized using counts 
and percentages.
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
19/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 24 [ADDRESS_1042455] number 
of patients to be enrolled in the study will depend upon the observed safety and 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile according to the dose -escalation rules .

power and type I error considerations.
Efficacy analyses will be performed on an ongoing basis in close collaboration with the study 
investigators for the expansion portion of the study to g uide potential early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761210].  Decisions to stop enrollment into the expansion 
cohort for futility will be made based on the totality of the available data, taking into account 
both safety and efficacy.  Anti -tumor activity will be summarized by [CONTACT_761246] 80% CI.  
For example, in a cohort with [ADDRESS_1042457] CR or PR, the objective 
response rate and its 80% CI will be summarized as 40% (27% 55%).
Continuous safety monitoring and interim analyses will be performed for the expansion 
portion of the study to guide potential early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761211].  The first safety interim analysis will occur after approximately 
6patients complete [ADDRESS_1042458].
A Bayesian posterior probability approach (Thall and Simon 1994) will be used to evaluate 
the toxicity in the expansion cohorts, including the rate of DLT -equivalent events that occur 
during Cycle 1 of study treatments.  Events that are DLT -equivalent in the expansion cohort 
are defined by [CONTACT_761247] -escalation cohorts.  
During continuous safety monitoring or in an interim analysis, if the number of observed 
DLT -equivalent events indicates that there is an approximately 80% chance that the true 
DLT rate is 25%, accrual to the cohort may be paused.  The Medical Monitor and Safety 
Scientist will determine whether further enrollment in the cohort s hould be halted and may 
provide other recommendations as described in the protocol .  The final decision will be based 
on the totality of the observed DLT -equivalent events, other safety events, as well as feedback 
from study investigators, Biostatistics, a nd Clinical Pharmacology.  The protocol provides 
examples that cover scenarios with different true DLT -equivalent event rate assumptions.  
The examples show the number of observed DLT -equivalent events that might lead the 
Sponsor to stop enrollment and the corresponding operating characteristics using the 
posterior probability approach with a non -informative prior beta (1,1) and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761212].

22/Protocol GO39869, Version 21. BACKGROUND
1.[ADDRESS_1042459] cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women in the world ,with an 
estimated 1.6 8million cases diagnosed globally per year and a mo rtality rate of 
approximately 520,000 deaths per year (Ferlay et al. 2015 ).While advances in early 
diagnosis and adjuvant therapy have led to a decrease in mortality rates from BC in 
developed countries, the prevalence of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is still high and 
MBC is not considered curable ,with the main goals of treatment being to impro ve
patients’ quality of life and prolong survival ( Cardoso et al .2014 ).
HER2, also known as erbB2/neu and p185HER2 ,represents a prominent target in BC 
with approximately 15%20% of patients with primary invasive BC overexpressing the 
HER2 rec eptor ( Reese and Slamon 1997 ;Owens et al. 2004 ;Wolff et al 2013). Inthe 
absence of HER2- targeted therapy, p rimary breast cancers that overexpress HER2 are 
associated with a poor erprognosis, including a greater risk of relapse and shortened 
survival compared with that of HER2 -negative tumors ( Slamon et al. 1987 ; Toikkanen et 
al. 1992 ; Andrulis et al. 1998; Pauletti et al. 2000; Rubin and Yarden 2001).
Until recently, f or patients w ith HER2- positive MBC, the combination of trastuzumab and 
a taxane was widely accepted as the first-line treatment option of choice on the basis of 
the survival advantage demonstra ted in two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518] (Studies H0648g 
[Slamon et al. 2001 ] and M77 001 [ Marty et al. 2005]).  The regimen of pertuzumab, 
which binds HER2 at an epi[INVESTIGATOR_761214], in combination with 
trastuzumab and docetaxel ,has shown clear superiority in terms of both progression -
free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with a generally similar safety profile (Study 
WO20698 /TOC4129g [ Baselga et al. 2012 ;Swain et al. 2015 ])and is the new standard 
of care in many countries. The5-year median OS of 56.5 months with the 
trastuzumab/pertuzumab/docetaxel regimen compared to 40.8 months with 
trastuzumab/docetaxel ( Swain et al. 2015) suggests there may be therapeutic value to 
engagement of HER2 at multiple binding sites. 
In patients with HER2- positive advanced BCpreviously treated with trastuzumab and 
a taxane ,trastuzumab emtansine has sig nificantly prolonged PFS and OSwith a more 
favorable safety profile than lapatinib plus capecitabine (Study BO21977/TDM4370g, 
[Verma et al 2012 ]).Trastuzumab emtansine also improved PFS and OS compared with
physicians 'choice of treatment in patients who previously received trastuzumab, 
ataxane ,and lapatinib ( Study TDM4997g/BO25734 [ Krop et al. 2014 ;Krop etal.2017 ]).
Trastuzumab emtansine is considered standard of care in many countries in the 
aforementioned patient population. However, the combination of trastuzumab 
emtansine with pertuzumab in patients withpreviously untreated MBC , while not inferior
totrastuzumab and docetaxel or pac litaxel, failed to demonstrate superiority 
(Study TDM4788g/BO22589 [ Perez etal.2015 ]). 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
23/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Although the treatment of MBC is palliative rather than curative in intent, improvement in 
survival is an important treatment goal. There is a significant need for n ew agents with 
novel mechanisms of action and acceptable toxicity that may be combined with 
established treatments to improve patient outcomes .  Results to date suggest that 
engagement of HER2 at multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_761215] -directed cytotoxic agents may yield a more optimal safety profile over 
systemic chemotherapy .
1.2 BACKGROUND ON DHES0815A
Amplification of HER2 occurs in approximately 20% of patients with BCs and ,without 
targeted therapy ,is associated with more aggressive disease and shortened survival 
(Slamon etal.1987 ; Dawood etal.2010 ). High expression of HER2 is also found in a 
subset of other solid tumors, including gastric and esophageal junction cancer 
(Bang etal.2010 ; Yanetal.2015 ).DHES0815A is a THIOMAB antibody drug
conjugate that consists of MHES0488A ,a humanized Ig G1 anti -HER2 (also called 
ERBB2) monoclonal antibody (MAb) (murine clone 7C2), conjugated to theDNA 
alkylating agent, pyrrolo[2,1 -c][1,4]benzodiazepin e monoamide (PBD -MA) via a disulfide 
linker. The PBD class of naturally occurring anti -tumor agents binds to the minor groove 
of DNA (Antonow and Thurston 2011 ).Numerous other PBD dimer containing 
antibody drug conjugate s (ADCs )are currently in clinical trials (Kung Sutherland et al. 
2013 ; Rudin etal. 2017 ). The PBD payload on DHES0815A is a monoalkylator, inwhich
one of the two PBD moieties containing an amide functionality is not involved in DNA 
alkylation, making it less p otent than the corresponding bis -alkylator to potentially 
improve tolerability. 
DHES0815A binds domain I of the HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) and has a distinct 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_761216], thereby [CONTACT_761248] s.  When bound to HER2, DHES0815A undergoes receptor -mediated 
internalization and is subsequently trafficked to lysosome swhere it undergoes 
degradation. Following lysosomal degradation ,the disulfide linkage is reduced, resulting 
in self-immolation of the linker and intracellular release of the active PBD -MA
(Zhang etal. 2016 ). The released payload covalently binds to DNA in a 
sequence -selective manner leading to DNA alkylation but not cross -linking. This DNA 
alkylation ultimately results in cell death. DHES0815A was designed us ing
THIOMAB antibody technology enabling the conjugation of two PBD-MAlinker drug 
molecules per antibody to engineered cysteine residues (Junutula etal.2008 ).  
 
. DHES0815A is being developed as a potential therapeutic for 
HER2 -expressing cancers either as a single agent or in combination with existing 
treatments for HER2 -positive BC.  

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
24/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Nonclinically , DHES0815A shows potent anti -tumor activity in murine xenograft models 
of HER2 -positive breast and gastric cancer as a single agent and in combination, has 
acceptable pharmacokinetic ( PK)properties, and has an acceptable safety profile that 
supports its clinical development in patients with HER2- positive cancers. Collectively, 
data from the nonclinical program with DHES0815A support DHES0815A entry into 
clinical trials and provide adequate safety factors to enable a starting dose of 0.6 mg/kg 
in humans. Refer to the DHES0815A Investigator's Brochure for details o n nonclinical 
studies.
1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT RISK A SSESSMENT
Metastatic HER2 -positive BC remains an incurable disease with a median OS of less 
than 5 years reported for patients with previously untreated disease who received a 
combination of a taxane , pertuzumab, and trastuzumab ( Swain et al. 2015 ). Therefore ,
novel treatments that can further improve patient outcomes are needed. DHES0815A is 
being developed for treatment of HER2 -positive malignancies, including metastatic 
HER2 -positive BC. In non clinical models, DHES0815A demonstrated anti- tumor efficacy 
in HER2 -positive models of breast and gastric cancer, including in models insensitive to 
trastuzumab emtansine.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Phase Itrial will enroll patient swith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive
BCto assess safety, tolerability ,andpharmacokinetics and to make a preliminary 
assessment of anti -tumor activity of DHES0815A. Given the relatively poor prognosis 

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
25/Protocol GO39869, Version 2and limited treatment options for these patients, this population is considered 
appropriate for early -stage trials of novel therapeutic candidates ,and the benefit risk 
ratio of a clinical study of DHES0815A is considered acceptable.
Once preliminary DHES0815A safet y data are available and a recommended Phase II
dose (RP2D) has been determined for DHES0815A, a combination of DHES0815A with 
trastuzumab emtansine is planned to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics , 
and preliminary efficacy of this combina tion treatment .
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

(lasting 28 days).  Following confirmation of eligibility, patient swill receive DHES0815A 
by[CONTACT_761251].  A detailed PK evalua tion will be performed 
during Cycle [ADDRESS_1042460] twocycles during dose expansion, and less frequently 
thereafter. Cardiac ejection fraction ( left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF ]) will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_462612] (ECHO )or multiple -gated acquisition scan
(MUGA )at baseline and in the lastweek (Days 1521)of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6, and then 
after every fourcycles thereafter .Ophthalmic examinations (best corrected visual acuity 
[BCVA] and anterior segment slit lamp examina tion with fluor escei n) to monitor for visual 
and/or corneal changes will occur at baseline and during the last week (Days 1521) of 
Cycle s 2, 4, and 6, and every fourcycles thereafter.  Tumor assessment will occur at 
baseline and during the lastweek ( Days 15 21) of every even- numbered cycle until 
Cycle 8 (i.e., at Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8) and atevery three cycles thereafter (i.e., at 
Cycles 11, 14, 17, etc.) until discontinuation orstudy termination . 
Adverse events will be graded according to the Natio nal Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Patients 
deriving clinical benefit may be offered continued treatment with DHES0815A until 
disease progression or intolerable toxicity at the discretion of the investigator (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Disease status will be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , 
Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (Eisenhauer etal. 2009 ;see Appendix 3). Tumor status will 
be categorized as a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease ,or 
progressive disease (PD) ,per RECIST v1.1. Objective response should be confirm ed 
by [CONTACT_761252] -based evaluation [ADDRESS_1042461] v1.1 (see Appendix 3). 
Blood samples will be collected for assessment of molecular and genetic biomarkers at 
baseline and end of study .

(0.6 mg/kg Q3W, 1.2 mg/kg Q3W, 2.4 mg/kg Q3W, 4.0 mg/kg Q3W, and 6.0 mg/kg 
Q3W, respectively) may not receive a dose higher than 2.4 mg/kg Q3W,  

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
29/Protocol GO39869, Version 23.1.1 Dose -Escalation Stage
Approximately 24 30 patients will be enrolled in the dose- escalation stage. Cohorts of 
36patients each will be treated at escalating doses of DHES0815A in accordance with 
the dose -escalation rules described below. The starting dose of DHES0815A is based 
on noncli nical safety assessments and will be no higher than 0.6 mg/kg IV Q3W ( see 
Section 3.3.2 for more details ). For added safety during dose escalation, treatment will 
be staggered such that the first patient treated at each dose level will receive his or her 
first infusion at least 1 day prior to subsequent patients in that cohort.  In addition, 
cohorts may be expanded even in the absence of dose- limiting toxicities ( DLTs) i n order 
to evaluate non -DLT adverse events further or to collect additional safety or PK data.  
Intrapatient dose escalation as per Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be allowed.   
Patients will be closely monitored for adverse events during theDLT assessment 
window, defined as Days 1 21 of Cycle 1 .Adverse events identified as DLTs, as 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS], will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (see
Section 5.3.1 ).
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window 
for reasons other than a DLT will be considered non -evaluable for dose -escalation 
decisions and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)assessments and will be replaced by [CONTACT_454770]. Patients who receive supportive care during 
the DLT assessment window that confounds the evaluation of DLTs may be replaced at 
the discretion of the M edical Monitor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicity
For dose -escalation purposes, a ny one of the following events will be considered a DLT 
if it occurs during the DLT assessment window ,unless clearly attributed to another 
identified etiology by [CONTACT_8647] (e.g.,cancer progression) :
  15% decrease from baseline in LVEF or 10% decrease to less than a 50% LVEF
Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions:
–Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that resolves to Grade [ADDRESS_1042462] -of-care therapy in 7days
–Grade 3 fatigue that resolves to Grade 2 in 7 days
–Grade 3 elevation of serum hepatic transaminase (ALT or AST) without an 
increase in direct bilirubin 2upper limit of normal (ULN)or clinical jaundice 
and lasting 7 days
–Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that are asymptomatic and considered by [CONTACT_761253]
Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 500cells/L) lasting 7 days 
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia 
Grade 4 anemia

Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding
Any increase in hepatic transaminase (ALT or AST) 3baseline in combination 
with either an increase in direct bilirubin 2ULN or clinical jaundice , in the 
absence of cholestasis or other contributory factors (e.g., worsening of metastatic 
disease, concomitant exposure to known hepatotoxic agent ,or documented 
infectious etiology) .
This issuggestive of potential drug -induced liver injury (according to 
Hy’s Law) and will be considered a DLT.
[IP_ADDRESS] Starting Dose, Dose -Escalation Rules , and Determination of 
the Maximum Tolerated Dose
The starting dose of DHES0815A is 0.6 mg/kg administered by[CONTACT_541685] Q 3Wto 
patients in the first cohort.  The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_8622] 100% of the preceding 
dose level for each successive cohort until a safety signal (defined as a DLT in 1 patient 
orstudy drug related Grade 2 major organ adverse event s(unless present at baseline)
in at least 2 patients during the DLT assessment window in a given cohort) is observed.  
Once asafety signal has been observed in a given cohort, the dose may be increased 
by [CONTACT_8622] 50% of the preceding dose level for each successive cohort.  Intrapatient dose 
escalation may be allowed fo r some patients (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Dose escalation of DHES0815A will occur in accordance with the rules listed below .
A minimum of 3 patients will initially be enrolled in each cohort.
If none of the first [ADDRESS_1042463] dose level may proceed.
If [ADDRESS_1042464] dose level may proceed.
If [ADDRESS_1042465] already been 
evaluated at that level.  However, if the dose level at which the MTD is exceeded is 
15% higher than the preceding dose level, 6 patients may be evaluated at an 
intermedia te dose level.
If the MTD is exceeded at any dose level, the highest dose at which fewer than 2 of 
6DLT-evaluable patients (i.e., 33%) experience a DLT will be declared the MTD.
If the MTD is not exceeded at any dose level, the highest dose administered in this 
study will be declared the maximum administered dose ( MAD ).
As long as the MTD has not been exceeded, additional patients may be enrolled at 
a given dose level in a given arm to explore factors influencing adverse events or to 
accumulate additional safety data.
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
31/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Relevant demographic, adverse event, laboratory, dose administration, and PK (if 
available) data will be reviewed prior to dose -escalation decisions, which will be made by 
[CONTACT_761254] a 
committee composed of the following Sponsor representatives:  Medical Monitor and 
clinical safety scientist, with consultation from the statistician, clinical pharmacologist, 
and clinical trial leader .  On the basis of a review of r eal-time safety data and available 
preliminary PK data, dose escalation may be halted or modified by [CONTACT_761255].
[IP_ADDRESS] Intrapatient Dose Escalation
To minimize the exposure of patients to suboptimal doses and t o maximize the collection 
of information at relevant doses, patients may progressively escalate from their current 
dose of DHES0815A to the highest dose level tolerated by [CONTACT_761256] . Patients 
will need to complete at least t hree cycles at their originally assigned DHES0815A dose 
level, as well as at each of the subsequent dose levels, prior to any further dose 
escalation.
Once the MTD is declared and the RP2D is determined, patients who remain in the 
study and continue to tol erate the study drug may escalate their dose to the RP2D level 
or the dose level below the RP2D under their current dosing schedule.  The RP2D will 
beat or below the MTD (or MAD )and determined by [CONTACT_761257], including DLTs, 
safety, activity ,andPK data (seeSection [IP_ADDRESS]).
All intrapatient dose- escalation decisions will be made by [CONTACT_761258] e assessment of safety data within the 
treatment cohorts, as well as the totality of the safety data.
For patients in Cohorts 1 5, please also refer to Section 3.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Continuation of DHES0815A (Cycles 2)
Patients without a DLT during the DLT assessment window will be eligible to receive 
additional infusions of D HES0815 A at the same dose level at which t hey w ere enrolled 
or at an increased dose as detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (theday of infusion being Day 1 of 
each cycle), provided that they meet the following criteria for acceptable toxicity and 
ongoing clinical benefit:
Acceptable toxicity:  All adverse events expe rienced with prior infusions that were 
not attributed to constitutional symptoms of the patient’s cancer or intercurrent
illness must have decreased to Grade 1or baseline grade on or before the day of 
the next infusion.  
Exceptions on the basis of ongoing clinical benefit may be allowed after a careful 
assessment and discussion of benefit versus risk with the patient by t he 
investigator and approval from the Medical Monitor.  In addition, delay of therapy 
because of toxicities not attributed to study drug may not require discontinuation 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
32/Protocol GO39869, Version 2from the study but must be approved by [CONTACT_1689].  Dose modifications 
are des cribed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Ongoing clinical bene fit:  Patients must demonstrate improvement/stabilization in 
tumor burden, according to theRECIST v1.1(Appendix 3) or demonstrate clinical 
signs or symptoms of benefit, as judged by [CONTACT_093], independent of RECIS T.
All tumors assessed at screening must be documented and re -assessed at 
each subsequent tumor evaluation ( see Appendix 1fortumor assessment 
schedule).  For each patient, the same imaging modality should be used 
throughout the study.
For patients in Cohorts 1 5, please also refer to Section 3.1.
Women of childbearing potential will need to undergo a urine pregnancy test prior to 
each DHES0815A cycle (patients whose breast tumor produce s human chorionic 
gonadotropin [h CG]and were co nfirmed not be pregnant prior to enrollment should be 
monitored with serum pregnancy tests rather than urin e pregnancy tests prior to 
each cycle of study treatment ).If a urine pregnancy test result is positive, patient dosing 
will be postponed until the result is confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Patients who 
are pregnant must permanently discontinue study treatment.
DHES0815 A administration will be discontinued in patients who experience a DLT 
during the DLT assessment window (Days 1 [ADDRESS_1042466] cycle) if this toxicity does not 
return to baseline grade within [ADDRESS_1042467] 
cycle (Days 1 21)and whose toxicity ret urns to baseline within 14 days may be 
restarted at a dose level tolerated by [CONTACT_761259]. A treatment delay beyond 14 days may be acceptable upon discussion 
withtheMedical Monitor (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
3.1.[ADDRESS_1042468] that the MTD has been exceeded, accrual at that

patients in an expansion cohort at a lower dose level .
Patients in the dose- expansion cohort will be eligible to receive DHES0815A treatment
after Cycle 1 provided that t hey meet the same criteria for acceptable toxicity and 
ongoing clinical benefit as outlined for the dose -escalation cohorts in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for Patient Population
Patients with HER2 -positive MBC can derive significant clinical benefit from 
HER2 -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_761217]2 -positive MBC that include trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, 
lapatinib, and chemotherapy , HER2 -positive MBC remains an incurable disease. Nearly 
all patients with HER2 -positive MBC will eventu ally suffer disease progression and die 
from their disease (Verma et al. 2012 ;Swain et al. 2015 ).Given the relatively poor 
prognosis for patients with HER2 -positive MBC and limited treatment options , this 
patient population is considered appropriate for early -stage trials of novel therapeutic 
candidates. DHES0815A is a novel ADC designed to target HER2 -positive tumor cells, 
providing a ra tionale for studying this investigational agent in patients with HER2 -positive
BC.

Refer to the DHES0815A Investigator’s Brochure for additional details of the nonclinical 
studies described above.
3.3.3 Rationale for Evaluating Patients in the Dose -Expansion 
Cohort
It is expected that the small number of patients in each cohort during the dose -escalation 
stage will limit the extent to which the relationships between dose, drug exposure ,and 
adverse events related to D HES0815 A can be evaluated.  Therefore, a total of 
approximately 25 patients with HER2 -positive advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer
may be enro lled at the proposed RP2D to further characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
DHES0815 A, collect additional safety data, and assess for evidence of anti -tumor 
activity. 
3.3.4 Rationale for P harmacokinetic Sampling Schedule
The PK sampling schedule that follows the DHES0815A administration is designed to 
capture DHES0815A exposure data at a sufficient number of timepoints to provide a 
detailed profile of the concentration time curve for DHES0815 Atotal antibody 
(alldrug-to-antibody ratios [DARs ]including fully conjugated, partially deconjugated ,and 
fully deconjugated anti -HER2 antibody), antibody -conjugated PBD-MA(acPBD -MA), and 
uncon jugated PBD-MA. 
DHES0815A is designed to be structurally stable in circulation.  However, it is possible 
that catabolism could occur, resulting in for example deconjugation of the cytotoxic 
drug and changes in the overall DAR.  Exploratory structural data (e.g. ,changes in DAR 
distribution) may provide additional insight on the safety and efficacy of DHES0815A.
3.3.5 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
HER2 status is routinely assessed on tumor tissue using approved assays  
 in patients with BC 
to assess whether they may benefit from currently approved HER2 -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The possible relationship between HER2 expression and DHES0815A anti -tumor activity 
will be explored in this Phase Itrial. HER2 expression in available tumor tissue will be

3.3.6 Rationale for Collecting Blood Samples to Identify
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.7 Rationale for Collection of Pre-t reatment Paraffi n-Embedded 
Tumor Samples for Tumor Marker A ssessment and Optional 
Tumor Tissue Biopsy on Progression
Paraffin -embedded tumor samples (either blocks [preferred] or at least  
slides) will be required from all patients for the central laboratory evaluation of HER2 
expression and other biomarker assessments (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Tumor tissue 
obtained at the time of the original diagnosis of HER2 -positive BCandthe most recent 
available metastatic biopsy (if applicable) should be submitted. Patients who only have
available tumor tissue from one timepoint may still be eligible for participation in this 
Phase Istudy upon discussion with the Medical Monitor.
For p atients who consent , an additional optional biopsy may be collected per investigator 
discretion, prefera bly at the time of radiographic progression .Biopsie s should be 
minimally invasive, defined as requiring only local anesthesia , and in general, exclud e
brain, lungs, or any internal organs that may subject patients to significant risk as 
referenced in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
The tumor tissues will be evaluated for HER2 and other biomarkers that are potentially 
relevant tostudy disease evolution , impact o f prior treatments, andDHES0815 A anti-tumor 
activity .Associations between biomarkers with outcomes measures will be explored. 
Tissue may be analyzed using molecular assays including, but not limited to, ,
immunofluorescence , . 

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
36/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Central r eview of HER2 status in patient tumor samples will be performed on an ongoing 
basis  
.  Based on a review of the data ,enrollment into the expansion cohort 
may be restri cted to patients with centrally confirmed HER2 -positive MBC. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_1042471] DHES0815A .  Anti -drug antibody (AD A) 
response and potential correlation of response to relevant clinical safety endpoints will 
therefore be assessed for all treated patients.  This could include ADA to the antibody, 
linker, drug, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_761218].  Although ADA s directed 
against DHES0815A are not expected to result in significant clinical sequelae, patients 
will be monitored for any potential immune response to DHES0815A in the Phase I 
clinical trial.  Validated screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect 
ADAs at multiple timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DHES0815A (see 
analysis Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Serum samples will be coll ected from all patients prior to 
their first dose of DHES0815A and at several additional timepoints (see Appendix 1and 
Appendix 2).

41/Protocol GO39869, Version 24.2 METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT
This is an open -label study.  Patients will be assigned to dose levels in the order in 
which they are enrolled a nd in accordance with the DLT review and dose-escalation and
expansion plan.  
After signed informed consent has been obtained and preliminary eligibility has been 
established for a patient, the study site will submit documentation supporting eligibility to 
the Sponsor and obtain the Sponsor’s approval to enroll the patient.  Once the Sponsor 
reviews and approves the patient for enrollment, the Sponsor will provide the dose group 
assignment.  No pre- planned protocol deviations or waivers will be allowed.
During the dose -escalation stage of the study, when t he last pa tient in a cohort has 
completed the 21- day DLT assessment window, a dose -escalation meeting will be held 
to review whether DLTs were observed in any patients in that cohort, as well as to 
review available cumulative safety data for the current and prior cohorts.  
Dose-escalation decisions will be made and communicated to the sites in writing prior to 
the opening of the next cohort.
Treatment assignment will be conducted using an interactive voice or web -based 
response system (IxRS ).  After writt en informed consent has been obtained, all patients 
will receive a screening number, which will be assigned by [CONTACT_47893].  Following 
completion of the screening period and after all patient eligibility requirements are 
confirmed, the Sponsor will provide th e dose group assignment and patients will be 
assigned an identification number by [CONTACT_47893].

should not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_149941].
Vialcontents should not be frozen or shaken and should be protect ed from light during 
storage. Vials are intended for single use only; therefore, any remaining solution should 
be discarded. For additional information on the formulation and handling of DHES0815A,
see the pharmacy manual.
4.3.[ADDRESS_1042480] administration of DHES0815A should be noted on the 
Study Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) .  Adverse events 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
42/Protocol GO39869, Version 2associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of any of the study treatments 
should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF .
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation for 
patients wh o experience adverse events are provided in Section 5.1.2 .
DHES0815A administration will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and access to a critical care unit with staff who are trained to monitor for and 
respond to potentially serious reactions .  The total dose of DHES0815A for each patient 
will depend on the dose assignment and the patient’s weight on Day 1 of each cycle (or 
within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of that cycle). Patients may receive the initial (Cycle 1) 
dose of DHES0815A unless the patient’s body weight has changed by 5% from 
baseline weight, in which case a new DHES0815A dose must be calculated.  This new 
dose of DHES0815A may be given in subsequent cycles, unless the patient experiences 
another 5% change in body weight, in which case a new DHES0815A dose must be 
calculated. DHES0815A will be administered once every 21 days. Patients meeting the 
criteria outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] may continue to receive treat ment with DHES0815A 
until they meet criteria for study treatment discontinuation ( see Section 4.6.1 ), 
discontinue the study ( seeSection 4.6.2 ),or the Sponsor terminat esthe study.
DHES0815A will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_761244] a polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) or polyolefin composed of polyethylene and polypropylene 
(PO-PE-PP)bag containing 0.9% NaCl and using an infusion set equipped with a
0.2-m in-line filter .  The final DHES0815A concentration will be determined by [CONTACT_761261]. Compatibility t esting has shown that DHES0815A is stable and does not 
adsorb to the IV bags or IV administration sets when diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution in 
PVC or PO -PE-PPbags at expected concentrations.   For additional information on the 
dose solution preparation and h andling of DHES0815A, see the pharmacy manual and 
the DHES0815A Investigator's Brochure .
The initial infusion (i.e., Cycle 1) should be administered over 90 ( 10) minutes. The 
DHES0815A infusion may be slowe d or interrupted for patient s experiencing 
infusion- related adverse events (see Table 3 inSection [IP_ADDRESS] for management 
guidelines for infusion -related adverse events ).If no infusion -related reactions ( IRRs )
are observed for Cycle 1, the time for subsequent infusions (Cycle 2 and beyond) may 
be reduced to 30 ( 10) minutes. Patients will be observed for [ADDRESS_1042481] 
two infusions of DHES0815 A atCycle 1 and Cycle 2. Patient s who experience 
infusion- related adverse events following any given infusion should be observed for 
2hours following the next subsequent infusion .In the absence of infusion- related 
adverse events , infusions of DHES0815A subsequent to Cycle 2 may be administered 
over 30 ( 10) minutes followed by a 30 -minute observation period after the infusion.
DHES0815A infusions will be administered per the instructions outlined in Table 2 .

45/Protocol GO39869, Version 24.4.2 Cautionary  Therapy
[IP_ADDRESS] Medications Given w ith Precaution due to Effects Related to 
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes
DHES0815A consists of a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody, a cleavable disulfide -linker, 
and PBD -MA.  There is a low risk of PKdrugdrug interactions ( DDI)between the 
MAbcomponent and small molecules due to different metabolic pathways that each 
undergo. In vitro data also suggest there is low risk of DDI specifically with the released 
payload from DHES0815A , unconjugated PBD-MA.PBD-MA was found to be a weak 
competitive inhibitor of CYP 2C8 and CYP3A4/5 and a time- dependent inhibitor for 
CYP3A4/5 as well as CYP2B6 at concentrations much higher than expected to be 
reached given the projected administered clinical doses of DHES0815A . Given that the 
expected liver concentration of the PBD-MA will likely be low at the administered clinical 
dose, the DDI potential for the unconjugated PBD-MA as a perpetrator is likely low. In
human and animal liver microsomes the unconjugated PBD-MA was extensively
metabolized by [CONTACT_410141], which are catalyzed mainly by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 as well as 
CYP2J2 (minor). However, in vivo contribution of CYP3A to the total clearance of 
unconjugated PBD -MAfollowing administration of DHES0815A is not known at this time.  
Therefore, the DDI potential for unconjugated PBD-MA is unclear as a victim and the 
use of strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided in patients who are administered 
DHES0815A.  Patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions if taking strong

Patients will provide the following tumor tissue sample s:
1.Tumor tissue sample collected at time of initial diagnosis
2.The most recent available metastatic tumor biopsy tissue
Archival tissue will be used for determination of HER2 status and for 
exploratory biomarker 
research.
Availability of a representative FFPE tumor specimen in a paraffin block (preferred) 
or at least  sections with an 
associated pathology report must be confirmed prior to study enrollment. If less 
than slides are available, the patient may still be eligible for the study after 
Medical Monitor approval has been obtained.
Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  
Samples mus t contain a minimum of 50 viable tumor cells that preserve cellular 
context and tissue architecture regardless of needle gauge or retrieval method. 
Samples collected via resection, core -needle biopsy (at least three cores, 
embedded in a single paraffin bl ock), or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps 
biopsy are acceptable.  Fine -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (defined as samples that do not 
preserve tissue architecture and yield cell suspension and/or smears), brushing, 
cellpellets from pleural effusion, and lavag e samples are not acceptable.  
In the event that enrollment into the expansion cohort of the study is restricted to 
patients with HER2 -positivetumors as prospectively assessed  
(see Sectio n3.3.7 ), tumor samples will need to be submitted and assessed for 
HER2 expression prior to the first dose of D HES0815 A.
Optional Tumor Biopsy
Anadditional optional minimally invasive biopsy may be collected per investigator 
discretion, preferably at the time of radiographic progression. The suitability and 
timing of biopsy collection for individual patients will be based on discussion with 
and the approval of the Sponsor’s Medical Mo nitor.  Patients who agree to undergo 
these additional biopsies will be asked to sign an optional Informed Consent Form.

4.5.7 Electrocardiograms
Triplicate ECG recordings will be obtained at specified timepoi nts, as outlined in the
schedule of activities (seeAppendix 1).  ECGs acquired on different days should be as 
closely time
-matched as feasible. Three interpretable ECG recordings (e.g., without 
artifacts) must be obtained at each timepoint ( 5 minutes ).  The average of the 
three readings will be used to determine ECG intervals (e.g., PR, QRS, QT).  
Single ECG recordings may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints as indicated . 
All ECG recordings must be performed using a standard high -quality, high -fidelity digital 
electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements.  
Lead placement should be as consistent as possible.  ECG recordings must be 
performed after the patient has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 10 minut es.  
All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at that same time 
(e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) and should not be obtained within 3 hours 
after any meal.  Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, including 
environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) ,should be avoided 
during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG recording.
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
tracings.  Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_26650]'s permanent

4.5.11 Optional Sam ples for Research Biosample Repository
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview  of the Research Biosample Repository
The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administere d group of facilities 
used for the long- term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection, 
storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate th e rational design of new 
pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.
Specimens for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participa te in this optional research. RBR specimens will be used to achieve the 
following objectives:
To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression
To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology
To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition
To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays
[IP_ADDRESS] Approval by [CONTACT_761267]'s IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body. 
If a site has not been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol 
(Section 4.5.11 )will not be applicable at that site.

54/Protocol GO39869, Version [IP_ADDRESS] Sample Collection
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, 
including ,but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to DHES0815A or 
HER2 -positive BC:
Blood plasma samples collected at baseline anddisease progression
Tumortissue samples from biopsies performed at the investigator's discretion 
during the study at time of progression ,if deemed clinically feasible, for exploratory 
research on biomarkers
Biopsies at the time of progression should be performed within 40 days after 
progression or prior to the next anti -cancer therapy, whichever is sooner.  
Samples collected via resection, core -needle biopsy (at least three cores 
preferred), or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsy are preferred .
Leftover serum, plasma, and tumor tissue samples (with the exception of remaining 
archival tissue blocks, which will be returned to sites) and any derivatives thereof 
(e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides), including leftover tissue samples from 
medically indicated procedur es (e.g., bronchoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 
colonoscopy) performed at the investigator's discretion during the course of the 
study
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for testing, which may 
include ,but are not limited to ,analysis of germline orsomatic mutations via , whole 
exome sequencing, , or other genomic and molecular analysis methods . 
Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  
 and WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome,
respectively, and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the 
opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_26630].  Data will be analyzed in the 
context of this study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.  
The availability of a larger dataset will assist in identification of important pathways, 
guiding the development of new targeted agents.
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).
[IP_ADDRESS] Confidentiality
Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification 
number.

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
55/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Patient medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_102], 
unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].
Given the complexity and exploratory n ature of the analyses of RBR specimens , data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by [CONTACT_2371].  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the eff ective Sponsor policy on study data publication.
Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_25735], and Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appro priate.
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property 
of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.
[IP_ADDRESS] Consent to Participate in the R esearch Biosample Repository
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time 
and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature [CONTACT_20030] a patient's agreement to provide optional RBR specimens.  
Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by [CONTACT_761268].
In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RBR research.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Reposi tory
Patients who give consent to provide RBR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
consent at any time for any reason.  However, if RBR specimens have been tested prior 
to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests will remain as part of the overall 
research data.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her 
specimens, the investigator must inf orm the Medica lMonitor in writing of the patient's 
wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if the trial is 
ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Research Sample W ithdrawal of 
Informed Consent eCRF.  The patie nt will be provided with instructions on how to 
withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient's withdrawal from Study GO39869
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
56/Protocol GO39869, Version 2does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RBR.  Likewise, a 
patient's withdrawal from the RBR does not constitute withdrawal from Study GO3 9869.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring and Oversight
RBR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management syste m, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the 
Informed Consent Form.  Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to

5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.[ADDRESS_1042497] study 
in which DHES0815A will be administered to humans .  The safety plan for patients in 
this stu dy is based on nonclinical experience with DHES0815A, clinical experience with 
HER2 -targeting molecules (i.e. ,trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine) ,
and published clinical data of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (DLL3 -targeting ADC linked to a 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
58/Protocol GO39869, Version 2PBD dimer; Rudin et al. 201 7) and SJG -136 ( PBD dimer; Hochhause ret al. 2009) .  The 
anticipated important potential safety risks for DHES0815A are outlined below.  Please 
refer to the DHES0815A Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety 
information.
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study.  
Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  
Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study , including assessment of the 
nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events .  In addition, guidelines for managing 
adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification and treatment interruption or 
discontinuation, are provided below .
5.1.1 Potential Risks A ssociated with DHES0815A
[IP_ADDRESS] Left Ventricular Dy sfunction
Patients treated with DHES0815A may be at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_123433].  Significant cardiac events, including LVEF of 40%, have been observed 
with HER2 -targeting molecules (i .e.,trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab 
emtansine) .
Patients must meet specified LVEF requirements to be included in this study (see 
Section 4.1.2 ).
Left ventricular function will be monitored by [CONTACT_761271] (or MUGA) scans as described in Section 4.5.8 and the schedule of activities
(see Appendix 1).
Guidelines for management of patients w ho develop left ventricular dysfunction are 
provided in Table 3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Dermatologic Toxicity
Skin disorders, including hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], erythema, and rash may occur in patients 
treated with DHES0815A.  In nonclinical studies, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_761221].  HER2- targeting 
molecules can cause skin disorder s, including erythema, rash, and pruritus.  Skin 
disorders have also been observed with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007]
, including G rade3 
events of rash, erythema ,and photosensitivity (Rudin et al 201 7).
Patients should be monitored closely for skin toxicity.  Patients are advised to prevent 
exposure to UV light and apply sunscreen to exposed areas of the skin when outside in 
the sun.  If skin toxicity occurs, patients should be evaluated by a dermatologist ,and a 
proper dermatologic diagnosis should be established and recorded on the eCRF.  For 
Grade 2 dermatologic events, photographs of the affected area should be obtained if 
possible and submitted to the sponsor to document the type and course of the skin 
toxicity.   The photographs willbe taken in such a manner as not to create any risk of 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
59/Protocol GO39869, Version 2identifying the patient; photographs will be thoroughly de -identifi ed at the sites prior to 
providing them to the Sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological Toxicity
In nonclinical studies, mild decreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils ,and reticulocytes 
have been observed in cynomolgus monkeys.  In addition, minimal lymphoid depletion 
was not ed in spleen and lymph nodes.  Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients 
in clinical trials of trastuzumab emtansine and cases of severe bleeding events, some 
with a fatal outcome, have been observed (KadcylaU.S. Package Insert ).  Declines in 
other h ematopoietic lineages were less frequent with the use of trastuzumab emtansine 
than that observed for platelets.  Thrombocytopenia also occurred in 12% of patients 
treated with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (including two G rade 4 and one fatal event ; 
Rudin et al.2017).
Hematologic laboratory parameters will be monitored as described in Section 4.5.6 and 
the schedule of a ctivities (see Appendix 1).  Guidelines for management of DHES0815A 
in patients who develop hematologic toxicity are provided in Table 3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Nephrotoxicity
No renal findings orchanges in urinalysis were observed in GLP toxicology studies with 
DHES0815A in cynomolgus monkeys.  However, tubular degeneration had been seen in 
nonclinical studies at higher doses of DHES0815A than were tested in the GLP 
toxicology studies . 
Patients with a baseline serum creatinine level higher than 1.5ULN or creatinine 
clearance 65 mL/min will be excluded from this study.  To address potential renal 
toxicity, BUN and creatinine will be measured frequently and urinalysis will be done at 
each cycle.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatic Toxicity
No pathological liver findings and no changes in liver function tes ts were observed in 
GLP toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys.  Hepatic toxicity (including liver failure 
and death) and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver are identified risks for 
trastuzumab emtansine and e levated transaminases (G rades 24)were observed with 
both SJG-136 ( Hochhauser et al. 2009 ) and rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (Rudin et al. 2017).
Patients must meet specified hepatic laboratory test requirements to be included in this 
study (see Section 4.1.2 ).  Hepatic laboratory parameters will be monitored as described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the schedule of a ctivities (see Appendix 1).

slitlamp examination with fluorescein. Ophthalmic exam inations must be conducted 
during the screening period, during the last week (Days 15 21)ofeven -numbered 
cycle suntil Cycle 6(i.e., at Cycles 2, 4, and 6)and every fourcycles thereafter (i. e., at 
Cycles 1 0, 14, 1 8, etc.), and at the study discontinuation visit (unless the most recent 
ophthalmic examination has occurred within the past 4 weeks). Patients who experience 
ocular symptoms , including but not l imited ,to eye pain, dry eyes, blurred vision ,or a 
decline in visual acuity, will be required to undergo an ophthalmic examination atan 
unscheduled visit as soon as practical.  Such visits should include the same 
assessments as those described above, along with any additional assessments deemed 
clinically indicated per standard of care.   
If no study drugrelated ophthalmic adverse events Grade 2 are reported during dose 
escalation, ophthalmic examinations may not be required for patients enrolled in the
expansio ncohort .
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary  Toxicity
In GLP toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, an increase in alveolar macrophages 
was observed after the administration of DHES0815A.  Mild alveolar degeneration and 
fibroplasia was observed in nonclinical studi es when cynomolgus monkeys received 
DHES0815A at dose levels higher than those given in the GLP toxicology studies .
Cases of interstitial lung disease, including pneumonitis, some leading to acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_761223], have been reported in patients receiving 
HER2- targeting drugs (i.e. ,trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine) .  Sign s 
and symptoms may include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary infiltrates .  Patients 
with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities 
may be at risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, p atients with clinically significant 
pulmonary symptoms or disease will be excluded from this study (see Section 4.1.2 ).

[IP_ADDRESS] Vascular Leak Sy ndrome
GLP studies in cynomolgus monkeys receiving DHES0815A did not reveal indication s
for vascular leak, edema ,or serosal effusion.  In clinical trials with SJG-136 
(Hochhauser et al. 2009 ) and rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (Rudin et al. 2017) , vascular leak 
syndrome, serosal effusions ,and edema were observed.
Patients treated with DHES0815A will be closely monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms indicating vascular leak.  As part of scheduled tumor assessment, CT or MRI 
imaging of chest and abdomen will be performed that may also be assessed for 
evidence of internal effusions .

Gastrointestinal toxicity (watery diarrhea, mucosal atrophy in small and large intestine 
and stomach) was observed in nonclinical studies when cynomolgus monkeys received 
DHES0815A at d ose levels higher than those given in the GLP toxicity study . 
Patients will be closely monitored for clinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity ,and 
supportive treatment will b e initiated at the investigator' s discretion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Reactions, Hy persensitivity , Anaphy laxis
Some MAbs may be associated with the development of allergic or anaphylactic 
reactions to either the active protein or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  True allergic/anaphylactic reactions 
are rare with the first dose of a product, because they requi re prior sensitization.  
Patients with true allergic/anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of the 
product. 
MAbs may also be associated with reactions that are clinically indistinguishable from 
true allergic/anaphylactic reactions but that are mediated through direct release of 
cytokines or other pro -inflammatory mediators.  Such reactions are often termed IRRs.  
IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_570587] a MAb product and are generally less 
frequent and/or less severe with subsequent infusions.  They can often be managed by 
[CONTACT_570664]/or pretreatment with various medications.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_123434] (reactions involving cytokine release) and 
hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions, the clinical manifestations are the same and include 
flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, and 
tachycardia.  Allergic/anaphylactic reactions and IRRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_761225].  The onset of symptoms may be rapid, and 
some reactions may be life threatening.
Patients with a history of allergic/anaphylactic reactions to MAbs , including trastuzumab, 
pertuzumab, or trastuzumab emtansine, will be excluded from this study (see 
Section 4.1.2 ).
Administration of DHES0815A will be performed in a setting with access to emergency 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor and respond to medical emergencies.  
Patients should be closely monitored for IRRs during and after each infusion of 
DHES0815A, as described in Section 4.3.2 .
Guidelines for management of patients who experience IRRs or hypersensitivity 
reactions are provided in Table 3 .Please see Appendix 6for guidance on anaphylaxis 
precautions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity
As with any recombinant antibody, D HES0815A may elicit an immune response and 
patients may develop antibodies against DHES0815A.  ADA response and potential

62/Protocol GO39869, Version 2correlation of response to relevant clinical safety endpoints will therefore be assessed for 
all treated p atients. Validated screening and confirmatory assays with appropriate 
sensitivity and therapeutic tolerance will be employed to detect ADAs at multiple 
timepoints before, during, and after treatment with DHES0815A.  Serum samples will be 
collected from al l patients prior to their first dose of DHES0815A and at several 
additional timepoints (see Appendix 2).
5.1.2 Management of Patients Who Experience A dverse E vents
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose and Schedule Modifications
The dose of DHES0815A can be reduced by [CONTACT_761272] -related toxicities . If further dose reduction is indicated after 
twodose reductions , the patient must discontinue DHES0815 A.  Dose increases after 
prior dose reduction for drug -related toxicities will not be permitted.
DHES0815A treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients who experience 
toxicity considered to be related to study drug.  Dose delays for 14days because of 
toxicity have to be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1689] ;otherwise, the 
patient should be discontinued from DHES0815A.   DHES0815A treatment may be 
suspended for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with 
Medical Monitor approval.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine the 
acceptable length of treatment interruption.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management Guidelines for Patients Who Experience A dverse 
Events
Guidelines for managing DHES0815A -related toxicities other than the ones specified in 
Table 3 are as follows :
For Grade 3 adverse events :  DHES0815A treatment should be withheld for 
Grade [ADDRESS_1042498] not recovered to Grade 1 or 
baseline prior to plan ned dosing.  The next scheduled dose may be delayed by 
[CONTACT_761273]14 days.  Longer dose interruptions are only allowed upon discussion with the 
Medical Monitor.  If improvement to Grade 1 or basel ine does not occur within 
14days (or a longer interval approved by [CONTACT_1689]), DHES0815A 
treatment should be discontinued.  If the DHES0815A- related toxicity improves to 
Grade [ADDRESS_1042499] dose level tested in dose escalation for patients in the dose escalation cohort, 
or by [CONTACT_3450] 25% 50% (upon discussion with the Medical Monitor) for 
patients in the expansion cohort.  No more than two dose reductions are permitted 
onstudy.
For Grade 2 adverse events :  DHES0815A treatment should be withheld for 
Grade [ADDRESS_1042500] not recovered to Grade 1 or 
baseline prior to planned dosing.  The next scheduled dose may be delayed by 
14days.  Longer dose interruptions may be allowed upon discussion with the 
Medical Monitor.  If improvement to Grade 1 or basel ine does not occur within

reduction in LVEF. DHES0815A should be permanently discontinued if a third dose hold 
would be required per algorithm above . 
Management of Increases in QT Interval
Study drug should be discontinued in patients who develop any of the following, unless 
there is a clea r alternative cause for the changes:
Sustained (at least two ECG measurements 30 minutes apart) QTcF that is 
500msand 60mslonger than the baseline value
Sustained absolute QTcF that is 515 ms
An epi[INVESTIGATOR_319041] a new ECG finding of clinical concern
Of note, if there is a new intraventricular conduction block, the increase in QRS complex 
duration should be subtracted from the QTcF change, because this represents an 
increase in QTcF unrelated to alterations in repolarization.  Also of note, it is not 
uncommon to record arrhythmias such as non -sustained ventricular tachycardia, 
supraventricular tachycardia, pauses, or atrial fibrillation in healthy volunteers receiving 
placebo during periods of extended ECG monitoring.  Therefore, it is critical that expert 
cardiology advice be sought to confirm any ECG changes and to ascertain the likelihood 

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
66/Protocol GO39869, Version 2of a drug -induced arrhythmia versus the background occurrence of this arrhythmia.  
Insuch a s ituation, saving all available ECG data is highly suggested.
Management of patients with sustained QTcF prolongation should include close 
monitoring, with ECGs repeated at least hourly until two successive ECGs show 
resolution of the findings, correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, and possible 
discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are known to prolong the 
QTinterval.  Consultation with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist is recommended to 
help in the management of such patients.
Inrare circumstances, it may be acceptable to resume study drug at a lower dose, 
provided that any ECG abnormalities have resolved and the patient is appropriately 
monitored.  Clinical judgment should be applied.
Management of Ocular Toxicities
Atthe first occurrence of asymptomatic ocular findings on ophthalmologic examination 
that are considered related to DHES0815A, the patient may be re- treated with 
DHES0815A as per study schedule (i.e. ,dose hold or dose reduction not required) but 
needs to undergo ophthalmic examinations before each additional dose to reassess the 
ocular finding.  
Ifthe ocular finding does not worsen and does remain asymptomatic in 
fourconsecutive cycles, the patient may continue dosing and resume the standard 
ophthalmic examination schedule ( even -numbered cycle suntil Cycle 6,and every 
fourcycles thereafter as described in Section 4.5.9 ).  
If the ocular finding worsens or if the patient develops ocular symptoms, study drug 
must be held until resolution or clear improvement.  Re -treatment may be initiated 
upon discussion with the Medical Monitor.
Atthe first occurrence of symptomatic ocular finding sconsidered related to study drug, 
DHES0815A must be he ld until resolution of visual symptoms andresolution or clear 
improvement of the ocular finding on ophthalmologic exam .  The patient should undergo 
ophthalmic examinations at least every 3weeks ,or more often as clinically indicated for 
reassessment.  
Once visual symptoms resolve and ocular finding sresolve or improve , re-treatment 
may be initiated upon discussion with the Medical Monitor.
In the case of first re-occurrence of a symptomatic or symptomatic ocular finding s
considered related to study drug, DHES0815A must be he ld until resolution of visual 
symptoms andresolution or clear improvement of the ocular finding.  The patient should 
undergo ophthalmic examinations at least every 3weeks, or more often as clinically 
indicated for reassessment.  
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
67/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Once visual symptoms resolve and ocular finding resolve or improve , re-treatment may 
be initiated upon discussion with the Medical Monitor a t a reduced dose of DHES0815A.

therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal produc t, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for worsening of BC
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior t o assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., th e adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
68/Protocol GO39869, Version 2This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to t he intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; 
see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after le arning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_1042502] (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_33473] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
are as follows :
All DLTs
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include any in crease in hepatic 
transaminase (ALT or AST) 3baseline in combination with either an increase in 
direct bilirubin 2ULN or clinical jaundice, in the absence of cholestasis or other 
contributory factors (consistent with Hy’s Law; Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257] , as defined below :
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.

69/Protocol GO39869, Version 25.2.4 Dose -Limiting Toxicities (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
During the DLT assessment window, adverse events identified as DLTs, as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ,are required to be reported by [CONTACT_761274] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 or 
reporting instructions).
5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CAPTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6.
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.[ADDRESS_1042503].  
Alladverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
After informed consent has be en obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until [ADDRESS_1042504] to follow -up, withdraws consent, initiates 
another anti -cancer therapy, or until study discontinuation/termination, whichever occurs 
first.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event repor ting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
70/Protocol GO39869, Version 25.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 4 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"or "no"
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also
Table 5 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or rein troduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
71/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications kno wn to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Table 5Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the stud y drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_1042506] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion -Related Reactions
Adverse events that occur during study drug administration or within 24 hours after 
study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be 
captured as a diagnosis (e.g., "infusion -related reaction" )on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Ifpossible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and 
symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  If a 
patient experiences both a local and systemi c reaction to the same dose of study drug, 
each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs 
and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
For adverse events other than IRRs , a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
72/Protocol GO39869, Version 2failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  
However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized 
as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, 
allpreviously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified 
and replaced by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting 
date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagno sis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional trea tment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
Another exception issymptomatic ocular events .  In such cases, the symptom s reported 
by [CONTACT_761275].  
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, bet ween 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event become s 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  Details regarding any increases or decreases in severity will be captured on the 
Adverse Event Intensity or Grade Changes eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it 
should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporti ng instructions).  
The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by [CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
73/Protocol GO39869, Version 2to "serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data 
fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifie s as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically s ignificant in the investigator' s judgment 
It is the investigator' s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the a bnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above o r below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality c an be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia "and a decreased 
neutrophil count of 500/mm3should be recorded as "neutropenia ."
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on t he Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_761276]0815A —Genentech, Inc.
74/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator 's judgment 
It is the investigator' s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the A dverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin)
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice
The most appropr iate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see 
Sections 5.2.2 and5.2.3 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported t o the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  
This includes death attributed to progression of BC.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
75/Protocol GO39869, Version 2reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death") .
If the death is attributed to progression of breast cancer , "breast cancer progression" 
should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and the details (e.g. ,clinical course, 
clinical findings, cause of death as per the death certificate) should be recorded in the 
Serious Adverse Event detail field .  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the conce pt 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Breast Cancer
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlyin g disease (e.g.,new lesion, increase in target -or non -target -lesions) should not
be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment 
data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on RECIST 
v1.1.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on 
symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should be made to document 
progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an 
event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26663] (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_761226] a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event :

An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33405] a serious adverse event, but should be repo rted as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25682]
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not 
itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events 
assoc iated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria , the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., nomore than 24 hours after le arning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
No safety data related to overdosing of DHES0815A are available.
5.[ADDRESS_1042507] report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no ci rcumstances should reporting take 
place more than [ADDRESS_1042508] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning

77/Protocol GO39869, Version 2The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Change in the event' s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse

5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 8.[ADDRESS_1042512] 
dose of study drug.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours a fter 
learning of the pregnancy) by [CONTACT_761280] [IP_ADDRESS].   Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, 
discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring 
of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse 
events associated with the pregn ancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother 
during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be 
reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.   In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome 
of the pregnancy becomes available .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
5.5months after the last dose of study drug.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form 
should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately 
(i.e., nomore than 24 hour s after learning of the pregnancy) by [CONTACT_761281] [IP_ADDRESS].  Attempts should be made to

Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
drug orthefemale partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified 
as a serious adverse eve nt, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see
Section 5.4.2 ).  Any abortion should be reported in the same fashion (as the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant).

serious adverse events that are considered t o be related to study drug or trial -related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’ s medical record to facilitat e source data 
verification.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.
5.5.[ADDRESS_1042514], and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123444], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent 
medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER TH E ADVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
80/Protocol GO39869, Version 242days after the last dose of study drug or until the patient is lost to follow -up, withdraws 
consent, initiates another anti -cancer therapy, or study discontinuation/termination, 
whichever occurs first )if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
These events should be reported through use of the Adverse Event eCRF.  H owever, if 
the EDC system is not available, t he investigator should report these events directly to 
the Sponsor or its designee, by [CONTACT_761282]/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number provided 
to investigators.
5.[ADDRESS_1042515] experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislatio n.
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using theDHES0815A Investigator's Brochure
as a reference document.
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
The objective of the dose escalation is to determine the MTD/MAD and RP2D of 
DHES0815A.
If the safety and PK profile seen in the dose -escalation portion of the study is deemed to 
be favorable to justify further continuation of the study, expansion cohorts will be 
enrolled to further confirm safety and tolerability and to assess preliminary evidence of 
anti-tumor activity and exploratory pharmacodynamic markers of response.
Thefinal analysis will be based on patient data collected through patient discontinuation 
or study discontinuation, whichever occurs first. All analyses will be based on the 
safety-evaluable population. All summaries will be presented according to the assi gned 
dose level and cohort. In general, data will be summarized as warranted, and listings 
will be used in place of tables when the samples sizes are small. Continuous variables 
will be summarized using means, standard deviations, median, and ranges; cat egorical 
variables will be summarized using counts and percentages.

(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
The operating characteristics of the dose -escalation stage of this study are shown in
Table 6 , which provides the probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each 
underlying true DLT rate. For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there 
is a 95% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a common toxicity that occurs with a 
rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 5%.

82/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Efficacy analyses will be performed on an ongoing basis in close collaboration with the 
study investigators for the expansion portion of the study to guide potential early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761228].   Decisions to stop enrollment 
into the expansion cohort for futility will be made based on the totality of the available 
data, taking into account both safety and efficacy. Anti -tumor activity will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_761246] 80% CI.  For example, i n a cohort with [ADDRESS_1042519] CR or PR, the o bjective response rate and its 80% CI will be 
summarized as 40% (27% 55%).
Continuous safety monitoring and interim analyses will be performed for the expansion 
portion of the study to guide potential early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761211].  The first safety interim analysis will occur after approximat ely 
6patients complete [ADDRESS_1042520] .
A Bayesian posterior probability approach (Thall and Simon 1994) will be used to 
evaluate the toxicity in the expansion cohorts, including the rate of DLT -equivalent 
events that occur during Cycle 1 of study treatments.  Events that are DLT -equivalent 
in the expansion cohort are defined by [CONTACT_761283] -escalation cohorts (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). During continuous safety monitoring or 
in an interim analysis ,if the number of observed DLT -equivalent events indicates that 
there is an approximately 80% chance that the true DLT rate is 25%, accrual to the 
cohort may be paused.  The Medical Monitor and Safety Scientist will determine 
whether further enrollment in the cohort should be halted and may provide other 
recommendations as described in Section 3.1.1.  The final decision will be based on the 
totality of the observed DLT -equivalent events, other safety events, as well as feedback 
from study investigators, Biostatistics, and Clinical Pharmacology. Table 8provides 
examples that cover scenarios with different true DLT- equivalent event rate 
assumptions.  The examples show the number of observed DLT- equivalent events that 
might lead the Sponsor to stop enrollment and the correspo nding operating 
characteristics using the posterior probability approach with a non -informative prior 
beta (1,1) and the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_761229].

87/Protocol GO39869, Version 27.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_761288], complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_761233], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents th at are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification and review , the investigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for 
trial-related moni toring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also 
allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756].
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site's computerized medical 
record system (i.e. , in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable c omputerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_33508], and date of the change.

occurs first .After th is period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to 
be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.6).The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_093], the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  
Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final 
outcome can be reported.
jPatients will be monitored for any untoward effects for [ADDRESS_1042547] DHES0815A infusion on Day 1 of Cy cle 1 and 
Day1 of Cycle2.  If infusion -related events occur, manage as per Table 3in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Patients who experience infusion -related adverse 
events followi ng any given infusion should be observed for 2 hours following 
the subsequent infusion.  In the absence of infusion -related adverse 
events after Cycle 2, subsequent infusions of DHES0815A may be followed by a 30 -minute observation period (seeSection 4.3.2 ).

Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
version 1.11are presented below, with slight modifications and the addition of 
explanatory text as needed for clarity.2
Measurability  of Tumor at Baseline
Definitions
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable 
or non -measurable as described below.
a)Measurable Tumor Lesions
Tumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size 
as follows: 
10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm)
10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (lesions that cannot be 
accu rately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
[ADDRESS_1042552] be [ADDRESS_1042553] scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below on “Baseline 
Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions” for information on lymph node 
measurement .
b)Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 but 15 mm) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal

c)Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.
Bone Lesions:
Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions.  
However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesions.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic –blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CTor MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.
Cystic Lesions:
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
beconsidered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_607177], simple cysts.
Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are p referred 
for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonst rated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
104/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Target Lesions:  Specifications by  [CONTACT_129918] 
a) Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
b)Method of A ssessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.
Clinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will only be consid ered measurable when they are 
superficial and 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  
Forthe case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion is suggested.
Chest X-Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying 
new lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].
CT, MRI.   CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumpt ion that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1042554] scans with 
intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to 
whether a non- contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the 
patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by [CONTACT_33488].  For patients who develop 
contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to 
whether non- contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should 
also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should 
be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should 
be discussed with the radiologist to determine if subst itution of these other approaches is 
possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point 
forward.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality

DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
105/Protocol GO39869, Version 2and interpretation of non -target disease or new lesions, since the same lesion may 
appear to have a different size using a new modality.
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.
Endoscopy , Laparoscopy , Tumor Markers, Cy tology , Histology.   The utilization 
ofthese techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.
Tumor Response Evaluation
Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necess ary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_70185], as detailed above.
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to 
amaximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be rec orded and 
measured at baseline.  This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or 
two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions 
(two sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable ) in those 
organs will be recorded as non- measurable lesions (even if the size is 10mm by 
[CONTACT_70182]).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements .  It may be the case that, 
onoccasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, 
inwhich circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibl y should 
be selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
thatmay be visible by [CONTACT_33490].  As noted above, 
pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as ta rget 
lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of [ADDRESS_1042555] in which the image is 
Appendix 3Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST):  Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
106/Protocol GO39869, Version 2obtained (for CT this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition 
may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  
Forexample, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm30 mm has a short 
axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In thisexample, 20 mm 
should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with 
short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) should be considered non -target les ions.  Nodes that 
have a short axis of 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and report ed as the baseline sum of diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added 
into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regr ession in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required and these les ions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare 
cases “unequivocal progression.”
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ 
as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF) ( e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).
Response Criteria
a)Evaluation of Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.
Complete response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to 10 mm.
Partial response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters
Progressive disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
Appendix 3Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST):  Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
107/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Stable disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smalles t sum on study
b)Special Notes on the A ssessment of Target Lesions
Lymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to 10 mm on study.  This means that 
when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be 
zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as 
having a short axis of 10 mm.
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   During the study, all lesi ons 
(nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small ( e.g., 2 mm).  However, 
sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
becom e so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an 
exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  W hen this occurs, 
itis important that a value be recorded on the CRF, as follows:
If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8598] e radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, 
themeasurement should be recorded as 0 mm.
If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and BML (below measurable lim it) should 
be ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by 
[CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to b e 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should 
be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML should also be ticked).
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_1042556] diameter for the coalesced lesion.

(RECIST):  Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
108/Protocol GO39869, Version 2c)Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of non -target lesions.  Although some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.
Complete response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and (ifapplicable) 
normalization of tumor marker level
All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size ( 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or 
(ifapplicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits
Progressive disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.
d)Special Notes on A ssessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease
When the Patient Also Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting, to achieve 
unequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall 
level of substantial worsening in non -target disease in a magnitude that, even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or 
more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status.  The desig nation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare.
When the Patient Has Only  Non -Measurable Disease.   This circumstance arises in 
some Phase III tria ls when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  
The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance there 
isno measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
non-measu rable disease burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]:  if all lesions are truly non- measurable), a useful test 
thatcan be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider 
ifthe increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable 
disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare 
PDfor measurable disease, that is, an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% i ncrease in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter 
inameasurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” 
to“large” or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may 
bedescrib ed in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy.”  If unequivocal 
progression is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that 
Appendix 3Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST):  Modified Excerpt from Original Publication (cont.)
DHES0815A —Genentech, Inc.
109/Protocol GO39869, Version 2point.  Although it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable 
disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore, 
theincrease must be substantial.
e)New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
theidentification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings t hought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or 
complete response.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT 
scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned 
atbaseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.
Evaluation of Response
a)Timepoint Response (Overall Response)
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified timepoint, a response assessment occurs.  
Table [ADDRESS_1042557] non- measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table 2 is to 
be used.

a“Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non -target 
disease since stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy  in some trials; thus, assigning “stable disease” 
when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
b)Missing A ssessments and Not -Evalu able Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless 
aconvincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing 
lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This would be most likely 
to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had a ba seline sum of 50 mm

those gave a sum of [ADDRESS_1042558] achieved PD status, regardless of the 
contribution of the missing lesion. 
If one or more target lesio ns were not assessed either because the scan was not done 
or the scan could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, 
theresponse for target lesions should be “unable to assess” since the patient is not 
evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more non -target lesions are not assessed, the response 
for non -target lesions should be “unable to assess” except where there is clear 
progression.  Overall response would be “unable to assess” if either the target response 
or the non -target response is “unable to assess” except where this is clear evidence of 
progression, as this equates with the case being not evaluable at that timepoint.

aIf a CR is truly met at the first timepoint, any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint, even 
disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, qualifies as PD at that point (since disease 
must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether the minimum 
duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes CR may be claimed when subsequent scans 
suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR, at the 
firsttimepoint.  Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the 
best response is PR.
c)Special Notes on Response A ssessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease 
to“normal” size ( 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.

113/Protocol GO39869, Version 2Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not 
adescriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_70186]- target disease as shown in Tables 1 –3.
For equivocal findings of progression ( e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; 
cystic changes or necrosi s in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next 
scheduled assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, 
the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.
In studies for which pati ents with advanced disease are eligible ( i.e.,primary  disease still or 
partially present), the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or non -target lesion, as 
appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of complete response if the primary  tumor 
is still present but not evaluated as a target or non -target lesion.

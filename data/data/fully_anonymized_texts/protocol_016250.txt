cancer (TNBC) ( Gross 2014 ); strong anti-tumor activity correlates with high expression of the 
glutaminase [ADDRESS_393172] received CB -839 + paclitaxel as of the 
23 Nov 2016 data cut-off.  No maximum tolerated dose and no significant safety signals were 
identified, and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and schedule were CB-839 at 800 mg 
PO BID continuously with paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days.  The 
Phase 1 population received a median of 4.5 prior lines of therapy including 3 prior lines o f 
therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.  Prior taxane had been received by 82% of patients and 
39% of patients had received taxane for advanced or metastatic disease.  In 23 response-
evaluable patients, the combination of CB-839 + paclitaxel had an overall response rate (ORR; 
RECIST 1.1) of 22% including 28% (n=5/18) in patients previously treated with a taxane and 
30% (n=3/10 ) in patients who had previously received a taxane for advanced or metastatic 
disease.  Additionally, in 8  patients with reported African ancestry,  there was a 5 0% ORR to the 
combination regimen of CB-[ADDRESS_393173] to uncertainty, there are 
biologic mechanisms by [CONTACT_319327]-839 could work to prevent or reverse taxane resistance in 
patients and by [CONTACT_319327]-839 could be more active in patients with African ancestry in 
particular.  It has been reported that taxane-induced ER stress causes upregulation of the 
ubiquitin ligase RNF5 which, in turn, leads to degradation of the glutamine transporters SLC1A5 
and SLC38A2 and a decrease in intracellular availability of the critical amino acid glutamine and 
ultimately autophagy and cell death.  Taxane resistance has been demonstrated in vitro by [CONTACT_319328]5 
depletion and overexpression of SLC1A5 and SLC38A2.  Interestingly, while not linked directly 
to taxane response, the prognostic significance of the RNF5-SLC1A5/38A2 axis in human breast 
ca
ncer was demonstrated in a tissue microarray (TMA) of [ADDRESS_393174] cancer core biopsies, all of

CONFIDENTIAL  13 which had undergone pathological assessment and included annotated clinical outcomes 
(Jain 2015).  In this analysis, high SLC1A5 expression indicative of high glutamine uptake was 
associated with a significant decrease in disease free survival (p value of 7.5 x 10-5).  High 
glutamine utilization by [CONTACT_319329] a high glutamate to glutamine ratio (the product and substrate of 
glutaminase, respectively) in comparison to TNBC tumors from patients of European ancestry 
(Terunuma 2014 ).  Furthermore, the GG genotype of a SNP within the non-coding RNA CCAT2 
that has a high prevalence in subjects of African ancestry has been shown to promote the 
expression of the more catalytically active GAC splice variant of GLS ( Redis 2016 ). 
9.[ADDRESS_393175] Cancer (TNBC) 
TNB
C is an aggressive histological subtype with limited treatment options and very poor 
prognosis following progression after standard chemotherapeutic regimens.  Patients with a 
diagnosis of TNBC usually receive a combination of surgery with adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for primary sites of cancer.  One standard regimen is 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_319330], although other regimens are also used ( Stover 2016 ).  Resistance to current standard 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  such as anthracyclines or taxanes, limits the available options for previously-treated 
patients with metastatic TNBC to a small number of non-cross-resistant regimens, and there is 
currently no preferred standard chemotherapy.  Duration of response is usually short, with rapid 
relapse very common and median survival of just 13 mo.   The present study will evaluate the 
combination of CB-839 and paclitaxel in metastatic TNBC patients of African ancestry ( AA) and 
non-AA patients who are heavily pretreated (3rd line and later) as well as patients who have 
received no prior therapy for advanced/metastatic disease (1st line). 
9.3 Glutaminase Inhibitor CB-839  
CB-839 is a potent and selective reversible inhibitor of glutaminase activity ( Gross 2014).  It is 
an allosteric and noncompetitive inhibitor of glutaminase, but does not inhibit the liver isoform, 
glutaminase-2.  Incubation of recombinant human glutaminase with CB-839 results in time-
dependent and slowly reversible inhibition of glutaminase activity (IC 50 = 34 nM with 1 hr pre-
incubation).  Glutaminase inhibition is associated with antiproliferative activity in human TNBC 
CB-[ADDRESS_393176] inhibition of glutaminase (≥ 90%) was demonstrated in platelets at exposures that 
are maintained in most patients at interdose trough time points.  Tumor biopsies also 
demons
trated robust glutaminase inhibition (>  75% for most patients). Further information is 
available in the CB-839 Investigator’s Brochure.  
9.6 Safety 
CB-839 was well tolerated, with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) identified.  On the 
rec
ommended dosing regimen (BID with food) in the solid tumor CX-839-001 study, relatively 
few AEs ≥ Grade 3 were reported ( Table 9.6-1 ).  A RP2D wa s established at 800 mg BID, based 
on the PK, PDn and safety profile of CB-839.

9.7 Efficacy of CB-839 + Paclitaxel 
The combination of CB-839 + paclitaxel is being evaluated in TNBC patients as part of the 
ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_393179] had stable disease (SD) for an overall Disease Control Rate (DCR = CR + PR 
+ SD) per RECIST v1.1 criteria of 61 % (Table 9.7-1 ). All of the responding patients were treated 
at the 600 or 800 mg BID dose schedule and the DCR at these doses was 63  and 75%, 
respectively.   
Eighteen of 23 (7 8%) efficacy-evaluable patients on study received taxanes in the metastatic 
setting (10  patients) or in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting (8 patients).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_319311], 10 of 18  patients (56%) showed disease control from CB-839 + paclitaxel ( Table 9.7-1 
and Figure 9.7-1 , Panels B and C).   
Of particular interest, four of eight efficacy-evaluable patients of African ancestry treated with 
CB-839 +
 paclitaxel achieved PRs (50%) (Table 9.7-1).  These four patients had a median of 4 
prior treatments in the metastatic setting (range 1-7) and all four had experienced progressive 
disease on prior taxane therapy, three in the metastatic setting and one in the neoadjuvant setting.  
Patients with African ancestry also showed the deepest responses to the combination ( Figure 9.7-
1, Panels D and E).

also meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study. 
10.1 Screening 
To determine a patient’s eligibility patients will undergo required screening evaluations as 
outlined in Attachment 1 . All previous cancer treatments, including systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], radiation 
and/or surgical procedures, should be recorded on the patients’ electronic case report forms 
(eCRF). Patients must also meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study. 
10.1.1 Prior Treatme nt 
All previous cancer treatments, including systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], radiation and/or surgical 
procedures, must be recorded on the patients’ electronic case report forms (eCRF). 
10.1.2 Concomitant Treatment 
Concomitant treatment is permitted if the medication is not expected to interfere with the 
evaluation of safety or efficacy of the study drugs.  During the study, if the use of any 
concomitant treatment becomes necessary (e.g., for treatment of an adverse event), the treatment 
must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF, including the reason for treatment, name [CONTACT_18467], 
dosage, route, and start and stop dates of administration. 
Use of investigational therapeutic agents other than the study drugs, CB-839 and paclitaxel, is 
NOT permitted while the patient is on study. 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 22      CB-839 is metabolized by [CONTACT_319335].  CB-839 does 
not appear to induce CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes and only weakly inhibits CYP2C9 (~40-
50% inhibition at 5µM) in vitro.  Although CB-[ADDRESS_393182] of medications that are CYP2C9 substrates is provided in Attachment 4. 
Preliminary PK data generated in single agent Phase 1 studies indicate that concomitant use of 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce absorption of CB-839, resulting in decreased systemic 
exposure.  Although patients are not required to discontinue their use of these agents, the strong 
preference is for patients to discontinue PPIs prior to joining the study.   Antagonists of the H2 
histamine receptor (e.g., ranitidine, famotidine, etc.) may be substituted for PPIs.  For patients 
unable to discontinue PPI [INVESTIGATOR_319314], 
administration of CB-839 with an acidic beverage (e.g., orange juice) or supplement (e.g., citric 
acid) may be an option.  If an acidic beverage/oral supplement is approved by [CONTACT_319336]-839 dose, it should be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF, including the identity of the beverage/supplement, dosage, and start and stop dates of 
administration. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_393183] be performed within 28  days before study drug 
administration on C1 D1 according to the Attachment 1 , Schedule of Study Assessments  [with 
the exception of imaging (CT/MRI); scans must be performed  within 21 days  of study drug 
administration prior to C1D1].  Procedures listed below that are performed as part o f the normal 
standard of care and within 28 days prior to C1D1 may be used for screening purposes (unless 
stated otherwise): 
 Demographic information including date of birth, sex, and ethnic origin (this self-
identification of ethnic origin will be used for placement into appropriate cohorts) 
 Medical history including review of prior cancer treatments 
 Review of concomitant medications

CONFIDENTIAL 23       ECOG performance evaluation 
 Complete  physical examination including weight (kg) and height (cm) 
 Vital signs  
 Standard duplicate 12-lead ECG with corrected QT interval by [CONTACT_6550]’s Formula 
(QTcF) 
 Clinical laboratory evaluation (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and

 Serum or urine pregnancy test.  This is only required for patients of child-bearing 
potential and must be negative within 3 days prior to C1D1. 
 Radiographic evaluation of tumor burden (i.e., diagnostic CT or MRI).  Scans must be 
pe
rformed within 21 days prior to C1D1.  See additional details in Attachment 1. Note: 
For this study, evaluation of tumor burden must be based on a diagnostic CT or MRI.

unavailable) will be collected from all patients 
 Whole blood and saliva collection for biomarker and genetic variance analysis 
 Neuropathy assessment 
A patient who meets all of the inclusion criteria will enter the study.  Screen failures will be 
marked in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. 
10.2 Other Schedules and Procedures 
For other schedules and procedures, please refer to the Schedule of Assessments in Attachment 
1.  Radiographic evaluation of tumor burden (e.g., diagnostic CT/MRI ) will occur at Screening 
and approximately every 8  weeks (2 cycles) after study initiation for the first year, or more 
frequently as clinically indicated.  For patients with ≥ SD for at least 13 cycles who are on a 
steady dose for ≥ 2 cycles, study assessments may be reduced to every 3 cycles (i.e., 
approximately every 12 weeks, Cycles 16, 19, 22, etc.) or more frequently as clinically indicated.  
Scans are done locally but must be submitted for central review (please see CT/MRI Scanning 
Guide for additional details).  Patients who come off of study for reasons other than progression 
CB-[ADDRESS_393184] 1.1 as long as the Investigator believes that the patient is still 
receiving clinical benefit from study treatment and that the potential benefit of continuing study 
treatment outweighs potential risks. 
10.3 End of Treatment (EOT) 
The End of Treatment (EOT) visit must occur within 28 days of treatment discontinuation and 
prior to initiation of any new anti-cancer therapy/regimen.  All patients discontinuing study 
treatment for any reason should undergo the following EOT procedures: 
 AE monitoring 
 Recording of concomitant medications 
 Vital signs and weight 
 Complete  physical examination  
 ECOG performance status evaluation 
 Clinical laboratory values (hematology and serum chemistry) 
 Serum or urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential 
 Duplicate 12-lead ECG with QTcF 
 Neuropathy assessment 
 Radiographic evaluation (e.g., diagnostic CT or MRI) of tumor burden. Patients who 
discontinue from study due to objective findings of progressive disease during an on-
treatment evaluation do not need to have repeat scans.  CT or MRI is required for all 
patients who have not had at least [ADDRESS_393185] the patient and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow up with persons authorized by [CONTACT_102].  
10.5 Screen Failures 
Patients who sign an informed consent form and do not receive CB-839 or paclitaxel are defined 
as screen failures.  For all screen failures, the Investigator will enter the screening number, 
patient initials, and reason(s) for screen failure into the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
These data will also be retained in the Investigator’s study files and can be printed by [CONTACT_319337].  
10.6 Safety Evaluation 
Routine safety and tolerability will be evaluated from the results of reported signs and 
symptoms, scheduled physical examinations, vital sign measurements, duplicate 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs; including QTcF intervals), and clinical laboratory test results. 
More frequent safety evaluations may be performed if clinically indicated or at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  All AEs will be recorded from the time of first dose until [ADDRESS_393186] 
dose of either study drug. 
10.6.1 Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will be performed by a licensed physician (or physician’s 
assistant or nurse practitioner) at Screening and End of Treatment.  Symptom-directed physical 
exams are required as clinically indicated. Please refer to the Schedule of Study Assessments 
(Attachment 1).

CONFIDENTIAL 26      10.6.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, and temperature) will be obtained in the 
sitting position.  All patients should be sitting for 3-5 min prior to obtaining vital signs. 
10.6.3 Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiograms will be performed as noted in the Schedule of Study Assessments 
(Attachment 1). Patients should rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_393187], high-
quality, high-fidelity electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer-based interval 
measurements. The average of values will used for Inclusion/Exclusion and AE reporting 
purposes. 
For safety monitoring purposes, the ECG must be reviewed, signed, and dated promptly by a 
qualified physician (or qualified physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) and any clinically 
important finding recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  The Investigator is responsible for 
providing the interpretation of all ECGs.  The results will include heart rate (HR), R-R interval 
(RR), PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTcF interval.  The QT interval will be 
corrected for respi[INVESTIGATOR_319315]:

10.6.4 Safety Laboratory Determinations 
Laboratory evaluations will be performed as noted in the Schedule of Study Assessments 
(Attachment 1). See Atta chment 2  for additional details. 
10.7 Biomarker Samples 
The following biomarker samples may be used for genetic and genomic testing, and exploratory 
analysis to assess markers of response to treatment. They may also be used for the evaluation of 
additional exploratory biomarkers that are not pre-specified in this protocol based upon new 
scientific literature and/or preclinical data. Collection of any of the following biomarker samples 
may be discontinued by [CONTACT_13111].

10.9.2 Bioanalytical Methodology 
The plasma samples will be analyzed for CB-839 by [CONTACT_2329] a validated liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method of appropriate specificity and sensitivity 
according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs). 
11.[ADDRESS_393190] frequent adverse events (AEs) considered possibly or probably related to CB-839 
monotherapy on the CX-839 -001 were fatigue and nausea (Table 9.6-1 ).  These have been 
primarily Grade 1/[ADDRESS_393191] frequent Grade 3/[ADDRESS_393192] 
occurred in 2 to 4% of patients receiving TAXOL in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred 
in patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_250896]. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, 
diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists per product label or may be treated per local institutional 
guidelines.  Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to TAXOL should not be 
rechallenged with the drug.  The most frequent important adverse events observed with 
paclitaxel monotherapy are myelosuppression (most notably neutropenia, but also 
thrombocytopenia and anemia), peripheral neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions (mostly low 
grade) and mild to moderate GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis).

CONFIDENTIAL 29      11.1.3 Pac-CB Combination 
In 17 safety-evaluable patients treated during the Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 + paclitaxel, the 
most frequent adverse events (AEs) considered possibly or probably related to one or both drugs 
were alopecia, fatigue, neutropenia, vomiting and nausea, typi[INVESTIGATOR_319316] (Table 9.6-2).  Low-grade photophobia or photopsia have previously been 
seen with monotherapy CB-839.  The most frequent Grade 3/4 AEs reported for the combination 
regimen were neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased (11% incidence for each). 
11.2 Dose Modifications and Toxicity Management 
The safety and tolerability profile of CB-839 is summarized above ( Section 9.6 ).  In general, 
management of AEs related to CB-839 and paclitaxel includes withholding the medication for 
moderate to severe toxicities and providing the appropriate supportive care. 
The safety and tolerability profile of paclitaxel is well defined and outlined in the Paclitaxel 
Package Insert.  
For patients with Gilbert’s Disease:  toxicity grading and dose modifications should be based 
on liver transaminase levels and not bilirubin. 
11.2.1 Dose Modification Guidelines 
Patients will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study.  Treatment modifications (e.g., 
dose delay) will be based on specific laboratory and AE criteria.  Guidelines for dose 
modifications in CB-839 and paclitaxel due to hematological and non-hematological AEs are 
provided in Table 11.4-1 .  The dose levels for dose reduction of CB-839 are provided in Table 
11.4-2.  These guidelines are based on the Package Insert for paclitaxel and the clinical 
e
xperience with CB-839 and the combination to date.  These guidelines are intended primarily 
for toxicities that are not easily managed with routine supportive care.  For example, alopecia 
does not require dose modification, nor does Grade 2 nausea/vomiting that are easily managed 
with anti-emetics. 
These parameters are only guidelines and are not intended to supersede the clinical judgment of 
the treating physician.   Investigators should contact [CONTACT_2974] 1) a dose

CONFIDENTIAL 30      modification is planned, or 2) there is a preference to deviate from the guidelines for the 
management of AEs or dose modifications.  Holding of the study drug and study discontinuation 
for both non-hematological and hematological toxicities will be based on the Principal 
Investigator’s judgment following discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_393193] dose.  
Delays longer than 4 weeks may be allowed, however prior to re-initiating treatment in a patient 
with a dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_393194] be consulted.  Treatment 
compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_319339]’s medical record and 
eCRF. 
Upon withholding study drugs for adverse events, the study drugs may be restarted when the AE 
has returned to ≤ Grade 1.  In cases in which a particular toxicity is clearly related to CB-839 or 
paclitaxel, the study drug that is not involved in causing the AE may be restarted prior to a return 
to ≤ Grade 1.  If CB-839 is restarted after permanent discontinuation of paclitaxel, CB-839 
should be permanently discontinued for a ≥ Grade 3 recurrence of the AE that resulted in 
paclitaxel discontinuation. 
11.3 Dose Adjustments and Missed doses 
Missed doses of CB-839  or paclitaxel should be skipped.  If a patient forgets to take a dose of 
CB-839 and he/she is outside of the allotted window period (± 6 hr), he/she should be instructed 
to skip that dose
 and NOT to take extra study drug at their next administration.

violation, patient noncompliance, and study termination by [CONTACT_1034]. 
When a patient discontinues or is withdrawn, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor (or 
designee) and should perform all End of Treatment and follow up procedures as indicated in the 
Schedule of Study Assessments  after discontinuation of study drug.

The data will be tabulated and analyzed with respect to patient enrollment and disposition, 
demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medication s, efficacy, and 
safety measures.  The efficacy analysis will be conducted on the Efficacy Evaluable Population, 
and the safety analysis will be performed on the Safety Population. 
All confidence intervals will be constructed at the 95% confidence level. Data listings will be 
created to support each table and to present all data collected. 
14.1.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Cohorts 1 and 3 – Taxane-treated patients with 3rd line+ advanced/metastatic disease 
Cohort 1 will enroll patients with African ancestry and Cohort 3 will enroll non-African anc estry 
patients.  Each cohort  will enroll 28 response-evaluable patients  (Table 14.1-1 ).  We assume that 
a baseline ORR to single agent paclitaxel would be < 10% in this 3rd line+ pati ent population.  
For the result to be acceptable, there must be  ≥ 5/28 responses in the study with  an ORR ≥ 18%. 
This design has a type I error rate of 0.14 if the true response rate is 10% and a power of 0.86 if 
the true response rate is 25%.

CONFIDENTIAL 36      Cohorts 2 and 4 – Taxane-naïve patients with 1st line advanced/metastatic disease 
Cohort 2 will enroll patients with African ancestry and Cohort 4 will enroll non-African ancestry 
patients.  Simon's two-stage design (Simon, 1989) will be used.  The null hypothesis that the true 
response rate is ≤ 25% [p0] will be tested against the alternative hypothesis of ≥45% response 
rate.  In the first stage, 15 patients will be accrued to each cohort ( Table 14.1-1 ).  If there are 3 or 
fewer responses in these 15 patients, accrual to this cohort will be stopped; otherwise, 13 
additional patients will be accrued for a total of 28 patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected 
if 10 or more responses are observed in 28 patients (objective response rate ≥36%). This design 
has a type I error rate of 0.13 when the tru e response rate is 25% and power of 0.87  when the 
true response rate is 45%.

The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) 
for each treatment cohort. 
For each patient with objectively measurable disease, as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1,  response to 
therapy, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival will be calculated.  
Overall Response Rate (ORR) : ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_393213] met. 
Duration of Response (DOR):   For patients achieving a PR or a CR, the duration of response will 
be calculated as the time between the first documentation of a PR or a CR to the first 
documentation of PD or death, whichever occurs first, taking as reference for PD the smallest 
measurements recorded since baseline (i.e. radiographic assessment at screening) .  For patients 
achieving first a PR then a CR, the PR date will be the starting date for response duration 
calculation.  
Stable Disease and Duration of Stable Disease:  for SD, follow-up measurements must have met 
the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_393214] measurements recorded since baseline.

progression.  
Patients missing baseline disease assessment will be censored at time 0. Patients who come off of 
study for reason other than PD or death should continue to be followed with radiographic 
assessment until PD by [CONTACT_393] 1.1, death, withdrawal of consent, or initiation of another 
systemic anti-cancer treatment.  
Clinical Benefit Response (CBR):  CBR is defined as the percentage of patients with best 
response of CR, PR, or SD according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria ( SD defined as stable disease 
lasting ≥ [ADDRESS_393216] line+ patients and [ADDRESS_393217] line patients ).   
Overall Survival (OS):  OS is defined as the time from enrollment date to death due to any cause.  
For patients alive at time of analysis, OS will be censored at the time when the patient is last 
known to be alive.  Patients who discontinue study for reason other than death should continue to 
be followed for survival status until death or withdrawal of consent. 
In addition, relationships between antitumor activity, PDn markers, exploratory biomarkers, and 
drug exposure levels will be explored.  
14.4 Treatment Exposure and Medication Compliance 
Extent of exposure to both study treat ments (CB-839 and paclitaxel ) will be evaluated by

Adverse event s will be coded by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and proportio n of 
patients reporting a  given AE w ill be tabulated by [CONTACT_319342].  Separate tables will be constructed for a) all reported AE’s, b) serious AEs 
(SAEs), and c)  AE’s leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment.  The above t ables 
will also be presented for treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) judged to be related to the study 
treatment.  
Laboratory variables will be examined using mean change in value from baseline to scheduled 
time points.  The baseline value of a variable is defined as the last value obtained on or before 
the date and time of the first dose of CB-[ADDRESS_393218] is consistent across var ious subgroups  for hypotheses 
generation purposes , analyses will be conducted  for the following baseline variables:   
 SNP rs6983267 (CCAT2) variants (GG, GT, TT) 
 TNBC subtypes 
 Multi-SNP analysis (genome-wide association studies)  
 Prior receipt of checkpoint inhibitor therapy such as inhibitors of the PD-1, PD-L1, and

15.1 Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or associated with other protocol interventions in a clinical study.  The event does not 
need to be causally related to the test article.  An AE includes, but is not limited to, the 
following: 
 Any AE not previously observed in the patient that emerges during the protocol 
specified AE reporting period 
 Any clinically significant worsening of a preexisting condition 
 Complications occurring as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedure such as biopsies), including in the period prior to receiving the first dose of 
the test article that are related to the protocol-mandated intervention (e.g.,  medication 
wash out, biopsies) 
 An AE occurring from overdose (i. e., a dose higher than that indicated in the 
protocol) of a test article, whether accidental or intentional 
 An AE occurring from abuse (e.g., use for nonclinical reasons) of a test article 
 An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a test article 
Any treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result which is clinically significant, i.e., meeting 
one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded as a single diagnosis on the adverse 
event page in the eCRF: 
 Accompanied by [CONTACT_319343]-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 41       Leading to a change in study medication (e.g., dose modification, interruption, or 
permanent discontinuation) 
 Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g., addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment)  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is an AE that: 
 Results in death (NOTE:  death is an outcome, not an event) 
 Is life-threatening (NOTE: see definition below) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. 
Clear progression of neoplasia should not be reported as an AE or SAE (unless the 
investigator considers the progression of underlying neoplasia to be atypi[INVESTIGATOR_319317], 
presentation or severity  from the normal course of the disease in a particular patient ).  Findings that 
are clearly consistent with the expected progression of the underlying cancer should not be 
reported as an adverse event, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319318].   All deaths including those related to progression of disease and 
sudden and unexplained death should be reported as an SAE. If there is any uncertainty about a 
CB-[ADDRESS_393220] caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  For example, hepatitis that 
resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening, even 
though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.   Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in 
angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, 
allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243969] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138822]; however, it is not in itself considered 
a serious adverse event (SAE).  In the absence of an AE, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319319].  This is the case in the following situations: 
 The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required 
by [CONTACT_760].   Day or night survey visits for biopsy or surgery required by [CONTACT_319344]. 
 The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_16018] (e.g. , stent removal after surgery).  This should be recorded in the 
study file. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319320]. 
In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156427], for a preexisting condition that 
has not worsened, do not constitute an SAE.  Visits to the Emergency Room that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319321], but may constitute a medically important 
event. 
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 43      If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information is treated 
as an SAE. 
Causality Attribution Guidance: 
AEs should be considered (probably or possibly) treatment-related, unless they fulfill the 
following criteria (in which circumstances it should be considered unlikely related or unrelated): 
 Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the investigational product (e.g.,  
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness,  or concomitant 
medication), and/or 
 The AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the investigational 
product (e.g., a new cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_393221] dose of study drug). 
 
Relatedness to study medication will be graded as either, “probably”, “possibly”, “unlikely”, or 
“unrelated” as follows: 
Probably Related – The adverse event 
 Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration 
 Abates upon discontinuation of the drug 
 Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical 
state 
Possibly Related  – The adverse event 
 Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration 
 Could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_319345]  – The adverse event 
 Is most likely  to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_319346]-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 44      Unrelated  – The adverse event 
 Does not follow a reasonable sequence from drug administration 
 Is readily explained by [CONTACT_319347] [INVESTIGATOR_319322]’s primary malignancy, clinical state , concurrent medical 
conditions,  or by [CONTACT_274437] 
A protocol-related adverse event  is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is not related 
to the test article, but is considered by [CONTACT_319348] (or designee) to 
be related to the research conditions, i.e., related to the fact that a patient is participating in the 
study.  For example, a protocol-related AE may be an untoward event occurring during a 
wa
shout period or an event related to a medical procedure required by [CONTACT_760]. 
Other Reportable Information:  certain information, although not considered an SAE, must be 
recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated for an SAE.   This includes: 
 A case involving a pregnancy exposure to a test article, unless the product is indicated for 
use during pregnancy e.g ., prenatal vitamins.  Information about use in pregnancy 
encompasses the entire course of pregnancy and delivery and perinatal and neonatal 
outcomes, even if there were no abnormal findings.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, test 
article must be discontinued immediately.  All reports of pregnancy must be followed for 
information about the course of the pregnancy and delivery, as well as the condition of 
the newborn.   When the newborn is healthy, additional follow-up is not needed. 
Pregnancies occurring up to [ADDRESS_393222] also be 
reported to the Investigator.  
 Overdose (e.g. , a dose higher than that indicated in the protocol) with or without an AE  
 Abuse (e.g. , use for nonclinical reasons) with or without an AE 
15.2 Recording and Reporting 
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused by [CONTACT_990]- 
mandated interventions (i. e., a protocol-related SAE such as a biopsy)  will be collected. 
CB-[ADDRESS_393223] be recorded on source documents and collected in EDC. 
Although A Es should be based on the signs or symptoms detected during the physical 
examination and on clinical evaluation of the patient, a specific diagnosis should be reported as 
the AE whenever feasible. In addition to the information obtained from those sources, the patient 
should be asked the following nonspecific question:  “How have you been feeling since your last 
visit?” Signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical terminology. 
Any unanticipated risks to the patients must be reported by [CONTACT_319349]/IEC. 
15.[ADDRESS_393224] .  Calithera Biosciences (or 
designee) will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received.  For each SAE 
received, Calithera Biosciences will make a determination as to whether the criteria for expedited 
reporting have been met.   The Medical Monitor should also be contact[CONTACT_319350]-
threatening SAE that is considered possibly or probably related to study drug. 
Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (or designee) is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the 
relevant regulatory authorities and participating Investigators, in accordance with FDA 
regulations 21 CFR 312.32, ICH Guidelines, European Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 
2001/20/EC) , and/or local regulatory requirements and monitoring the safety profile of the study 
drug.  To meet this requirement, Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (or designee) may request additional 
information from the sites including,  but not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78685].  Any requests for 
CB-[ADDRESS_393225] (IRB) or Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) will be done in accordance with the standard operation procedures and 
policies of the IRB/IEC.  Adequate documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB/IEC 
was properly notified. 
16.0 STUDY SUSPENSION, TERMINATION, AND COMPLETION 
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or any part of the study at any time for any 
reason.  If the Investigator suspends or terminates the study, the Investigator will promptly 
inform the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide a detailed written explanation.  The 
Investigator will also return all CB-[ADDRESS_393226] article, containers, and other study materials to the 
Sponsor or designee, or destroy the materials at the investigative site.   Upon study completion, 
the Investigator will provide the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, and regulatory agency with final reports and 
summaries as required by [CONTACT_19124].  
Sites that do not enroll a single patient within the first [ADDRESS_393227] be reviewed by [CONTACT_319351]/IEC. 
Before any procedures specified in the protocol are performed, a patient must:

Sponsor’s Note: CB-839, may affect glucose metabolism in both normal and tumor tissues. 
Preclinical data suggest that glucose uptake may increase with glutaminase inhibition in sensitive 
tissues, reflecting the pharmacodynamics effects of CB-839. False positive interpretations of 
progressive disease with FDG-PET scans may occur. Therefore, all FDG-PET findings 
suggestive of progressive disease should be confirmed by [CONTACT_319354] (CT or 
MRI) for this study. 
Measurability of Tumor at Baseline 
Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as follows. 
Measurable tumor lesions 
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:   
 [ADDRESS_393239] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) 
 10 mm by [CONTACT_7872] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with 
calipers should be recorded as non-measurable) 
 [ADDRESS_393240] X-ray 
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be  [ADDRESS_393241] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.  See also section below on ‘Baseline documentation of target and 
non-target lesions’ for information on lymph node measurement. 
Non-measurable tumor lesions 
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with   10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, peritoneal spread, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_119475]. 
 
 
 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  58 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability 
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment: 
Bone lesions: 
 Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_319355]. 
 Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.  
Cystic lesions: 
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, 
by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
Lesions with prior local treatment: 
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  For this protocol, these tumor lesions will be 
considered non-measurable lesions. 
Specifications by [CONTACT_319356], using calipers if clinically assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of assessment 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging based evaluation should 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  59 always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot b e 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], 
imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at 
the end of the study. 
Chest X-ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. Still, non-contrast CT is preferred over chest X-ray. 
CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_393242] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans). 
If prior to enrolment it is known that a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast 
due to allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (with 
or without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the subject at baseline and follow-up, should be 
guided by [CONTACT_234632].  For 
patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the 
decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) will be performed, 
should also be based on the tumor type, anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized 
to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be discussed with the 
radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the 
patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward . 
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_131811].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead 
of CT in selected instances. 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsi
es are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  60 Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete response.  Because tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for 
their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis.  Sp ecific 
guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer), have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup 
has developed CA-[ADDRESS_393243]-line trials in ovarian cancer. 
Cytology, histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  When effusions are known to be a 
potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive 
disease. 
Tumor response evaluation 
Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  Only patients 
with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objective tumor 
response is the primary endpoint.  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_319357] .  In studies where the primary endpoint is tumor progression (either time to 
progression or proportion with progression at a fixed date), the protocol must specify if entry is 
restricted to those with measurable disease or whether patients having non-measurable disease 
only are also eligible.  
Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’ lesions 
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
This means in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of 
two (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions in that 
organ will be recorded as non-measurable lesions (even if size is greater than [ADDRESS_393244] 
scan). 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
CB-[ADDRESS_393245] meet the criterion of a short axis of 
[ADDRESS_393246] in which the 
image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis. 
For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease. 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression.’  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case report form (e.g., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ o r 
‘multiple liver metastases’). 
Response criteria 
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions. 
Evaluation of target lesions 
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
CB-[ADDRESS_393247] 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression ). 
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions 
Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria 
are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_393248] achieve a short 
axis < 10 mm.  For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be 
included in t
he sum of target lesions. 
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’:  While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes 
which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist 
may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to 
measure’.  When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form: 
 If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and 
is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
and BML (below measurable limit) should be ticked (Note:  It is less likely that this 
rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when 
normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, 
a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML 
should also be ticked). 
This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_393249] slice thickness (but should not be changed with 
varying CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, 
therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon 
measurement error. 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm and in that case BML should not be ticked.  (BML is 
equivalent to a less than sign <)

CONFIDENTIAL  63 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment:  When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions.  While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non- PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
Special notes on assessment of progression of non-target disease 
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows: 
When the patient also has measurable disease :  In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.   A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall 
progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target 
disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
When the patient has only non-measurable disease:  This circumstance arises in some phase III 
trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  The same general 
concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance there is no measurable disease 
assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. 
Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]:  if all lesions 
are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease:  i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  64 additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an 
increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols 
as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’ .  If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient 
should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial . 
New lesions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal:  i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions).  This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not. 
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a brain CT or MRI 
ordered which reveals metastases.  The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) For the purposes of 
this study, progressive disease should not  be made solely on FDG-PET findings because the 
mechanism of the study drug, CB-839, may affect glucose metabolism in both normal and tumor 
tissues. All FDG-PET findings suggestive of progressive disease should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_319354] ( CT or MRI). The following modifications to RECIST v1.1. will be 
applied to this study: 
 Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  *Confirmation of the new lesion by [CONTACT_319358]. 
 No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: 
o If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new sign of disease 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD 
CB-[ADDRESS_393250] scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal *CT scan). 
o If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD. 
*reflects study-specific modification to RECIST v.1.[ADDRESS_393251] 
response designation.  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings 
of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new 
lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may 
also require confirmatory measurement.  Specifically, in nonrandomized trials where response is 
the prim
ary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the ‘best overall 
response’.  This is described further below. 
Tim
e point response 
It is assumed that at each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs.  Table A  
provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who 
have measurable disease at baseline. 
When patients have non-measurable (therefore non-target) disease only, Table B is to be used.  
Missing assessments and not-evaluable designation 
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable at that time point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, 
usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point, unless a convincing argument 
can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. 
For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_393252] 
achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.

CONFIDENTIAL  66 If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done, or could not 
be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the Response for Target Lesions 
should be “Unable to Assess” since the patient is not evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more non-
target lesions are indicated as ‘not assessed’, the response for non-target lesions should be 
“Unable to Assess” (except where there is clear progression).  Overall response would be 
“Unable to Assess” if either the target response or the non-target response is “Unable to Assess” 
(except where this is clear evidence of progression) as this equates with the case being not 
evaluable at that time point.

The best overall response (Table C) will be determined by [CONTACT_319359].

as endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be 
measured is not advised.

a = If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease 
meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have 
reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. 
However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still 
present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the 
original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR. 
 
Special notes on response assessment 
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may 
not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF). 
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘NE’ time point assessments may 
complicate best response determination.  The analysis plan for the trial must address how 
missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression.  For 
example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point responses of PR- NE-
PR as a confirmed response. 
CB-839 Protocol CX- 839-007 
 06 January 2017 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  68 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
‘symptomatic deterioration’.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response:  it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of 
such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease. 
Conditions that define ‘early progression, early death, and non-evaluability are study specific and 
should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity). 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before assigning a status of 
complete response.  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to 
a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the 
protocol and supported by [CONTACT_198369].  However, it 
must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of 
FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If at 
the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected

Furoscix  Infusor  
PROTOCOL NUMBER  scP-01-[ADDRESS_419805]  Furoscix  On-body Infusor drug -device combination produc t (hereinafter referred to as 
Furoscix Infusor ) 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  1. To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization  costs for subjects  treated 
with the Furoscix Infusor  outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (“Furoscix arm”, “Furoscix cohort” or 
“Furoscix Infusor cohort”) compared to  patients receiving intravenous furosemide  
for ≤ [ADDRESS_419806] -discharge from the 
emergency department . 
2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix  administered outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  
3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who 
receive  the Furoscix  Infusor outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339347] . 
STUDY DESIGN  This adaptive clinical trial will include a prospective treatment arm (i.e., Furoscix  
administered via the Furoscix Infusor)  administered outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339348] a propensity -matched histori cal control arm of  patients admitted to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] ≤  72 hours (i.e., T reatment As Usual (TAU) ) that will be derived from 
administrative claims data. Eligible patients for the Furoscix arm will be patients with 
worsening HF due to congestion who initially present to the emergency department 
(ED) and who are expected to require parenteral diuresis.   
 
The control arm will be populated with claims data for patients  who presented to the 
emergency department  with worsening HF  and are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] ≤  72 
hours  for the treatment of HF . The filter will be further strengthened by [CONTACT_339387][INVESTIGATOR_339349]  c were in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339350]. The eligibility 
of patients in the control arm will be determined based on a propensity- matched 
design according to the characteristics of the patients in the prospective Furoscix  arm.  
 
Patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening  HF and meeting all 
study e ligibility criteria may be consented and enrolled in the study to receive diuresis 
outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339351] .  
 
Furoscix  will be administered daily via the Furoscix Infusor whereby 80  mg is 
administered subcutaneously over 5 hours in a biphasic regimen ([ADDRESS_419807] hour, followed by 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent  4 hours). Within a single 24-
hour period, the 80  mg dose can be repeated at the discretion of the investigator > [ADDRESS_419808] dose.  Subjects should be transitioned back to 
their oral maintenance diuretic regimen when clinically indicated at the discretion of 
the investigator (a pproximately 4 doses) . After Subjects have been transitioned to 
their oral maintenance diuretic regimen, additional doses of Furoscix can be 
prescribed during the 30 -day study period as needed based on the presence of clinical 
triggers (dyspnea on exertion, edema, and/or excess weight gain ) as determined by 
[CONTACT_093] . No more than 7 doses of Furoscix is permitted during the 30 -day 
study period. Additional doses beyond 7 requires approval by [CONTACT_7195].

STUDY TREATMENTS  Study Drug: Furos cix, (Furosemide Injection ), 80 mg/10 mL is a proprietary f urosemide  
formulation that is buffered to a neutral pH to enable subcutaneous administration  
and contained in a prefilled Crystal Zenith® (CZ) cartridge .  
 
Study Device:  The Infusor  is a compact, ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilized, single -use, 
electro -mechanical (battery powered, micro -processor controlled), on -body 
subcutaneous delivery system based on the SmartDose® Gen II 10 mL (West 
Pharmaceutical Services).  
 
The Furoscix Infusor is a n investigational drug -device combination product . The Infusor 
is applied to the abdomen via a medical grade adhesive and delivers a subcutaneous infusion of Furoscix t hrough a  pre-programmed,  biphasic delivery profile with 30 mg 
(3.75 mL) administered over the first hour, followed by 12.5 mg (1.56 mL) per hour for the subsequent 4 hours (Total dose is 80 mg (10 mL) over 5 hours) .    
 
NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  Based on an average hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339352] a patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] ≤ 72 hours with a 
primary diagnosis of HF  (Diagnosis Related Group Code  291, 292 and 293) of $8,600 
(standard deviation: $3,045), 68 patients (34 in each group) are required to have an 
80% chance of detecting a decrease in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339353] $6,500 at a significance level of 
5%. The target sample size of the Furoscix  cohort will initially be N= 34 subjects.  
 
Given the anticipated overdispersion of the primary outcome  (i.e., difference in total 
HF-attributable direct medical costs), we will employ adaptive trial design procedures 
for sample size re -estimation.  This adaptive -total information criterion approach was 
taken due to the risk of incorrectly estimating the sample size due to misspecification 
of the cost outcome parameters. This will include re -assessment of the sample size at 
N=34  in the Furoscix cohort by [CONTACT_2329] a group sequential design and testing to allow for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  It is not expected that the sample size for the Furoscix Infusor arm would 
exceed N=75, but the maximum value cannot be definitively stated until the analysis at N=34 is completed.  
 
The methodology by [CONTACT_339388] -estimated and  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s will 
be implemented will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 23 of 51 1.   INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
 Heart failure (HF) affects 6.[ADDRESS_419822] number of 30 -day readmissions 
among Medicare enrollees. It is also estimated that 90% of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with worsening  HF are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339357] 50% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339358].  
 Intravenous furosemide is commonly indicated for the management  edema which is commonly present in 
worsening HF as the absolute bioavailability of oral furosemide is low, highly variable and is exacerbated during an 
acute  event.  Recognizing this limitation of oral furosemide, national and international guidelines recommend  that 
patients should be administered intravenous diuretics when significant  signs and symptoms of volume overload 
are present. Thus, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339359]. Admitting 
patients to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], solely for the administration of intravenous furosemide, is expensive and increa ses risks of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated morbidity and mortality. Alternative treatment paradigms that shift HF management  outside of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339360].  
 
Approximately 60% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339361].  
While subcutaneous administration of furosemide would enable diuresis as  an outpatient, avoiding  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], the current commercially available furosemide injectable products have an alkaline pH and poor 
solubility making them unsuitable for subcutaneous administration. A novel, pH neutral formulation of 
subcutaneous furosemide ( Furoscix , Furosemide I njection 80 mg/10 mL  for subcutaneous use )
  has been

1.1.3.   Risk Management  
 Subjects will be trained by [CONTACT_339392] e study ( based on the Furoscix  Infusor Instructions f or Use)  that 
include information regarding  what to do in case of certain events during the drug delivery period.  
 
Subjects should be transitioned back to their oral maintenance diuretic regimen when clinically indicated at the 
discretion of the investigator ( approximately 4 doses) . After Subjects have been transitioned to their oral 
maintenance diuretic regimen, additional doses of Furoscix can be prescribed during the 30 -day study period as 
needed based on the presence of clinical triggers (dyspnea on exertion, edema, and/or excess weight gain) as 
determined by [CONTACT_093]. No more than [ADDRESS_419825] diuretic therapy.  Two planned in- clinic visits 
will be conducted: the first occurring within Days 2-4 and the second occurring on Day 30 + 3 days.  These visits will 
include laboratory testing of creatine and electrolytes.  
 Unscheduled at-home telephone calls by [CONTACT_339393] , or designee,  and unscheduled in-clinic visits may be 
performed if felt clinically indicated by [CONTACT_339394].  
 2.   STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
The objectives of this study are:  
 
1. To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization  costs  for subjects  treated with the Furoscix Infusor 
outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339364] ≤ [ADDRESS_419826] -discharge from the emergency department.  
2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix  administered outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  
3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who receive the Furoscix  Infusor 
outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339347].  
 
3.   INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
 Overall Study Design and Plan  
 
This adaptive clinical trial will include a prospective treatment arm (i.e., Furoscix  administered via the Furoscix  
Infusor) administered outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339365] a propensity- matched historical control arm 
consisting of  patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] ≤ 72 hours (i.e., TAU) . This h ealthcare cost data from the control 
arm will be generated  from administrative claims data. Eligible patients for the Furoscix arm will be patients with 
worsening HF due to congestion  who initially present to the emergency department and who are expected to 
require  parenteral diuresis.  The decision as to whether a patient will be enrolled in the study to receive Furoscix  
will be made collaboratively by [CONTACT_339395] a heart failure specialist or cardiologist.  
 The control arm will be populated with claims data for patients who presented to the emergency department for 
worsening HF and are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] ≤ 72 hours  for the treatment of HF. . The filter will be further 
strengthened by [CONTACT_339396][INVESTIGATOR_339350] . Furoscix -treated patients  will be matched to

without biasing the variance of the outcome measure. Additional methodological details are described in the prespecifi ed statistical analysis plan.  
 Patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening  HF and meeting all study e ligibility criteria may 
be consented and enrolled in the study to receive diuresis outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339351] . 
 
Furoscix  will be administered daily via the Furoscix Infusor whereby 80  mg is administered subcutaneously over 5 
hours in a biphasic regimen ([ADDRESS_419827] hour, followed 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent  4 hours). Within 
a single 24- hour period, the 80  mg dose can be repeated at the discretion of the investigator > [ADDRESS_419828] treated with IV diuretics as clinically indicated.   During the 
30-day study period, additional doses of Furoscix can be prescribed as needed due to clinical triggers (dyspnea on 
exertion, edema, and/or excess weight gain) as determined by [CONTACT_093].   In addition to the scheduled 
phone and clinic visits,  the investigator can utilize unscheduled clinic or phone visits for additional assessments at 
any time.  
 
 Furoscix Infusor  
 
The Furoscix Infusor is a drug -device combination product consisting of Furoscix ( Furosemide injection , 80 mg per 
10 mL ), a novel, pH neutral furosemide formulation optimized for subcutaneous administration and contained in a 
prefilled, Crystal Zenith® (CZ) cartridge, and a proprietary wearable, pre -programmed on -body delivery system, the 
Infusor , based on the SmartDose® Gen II 10 mL (West Pharmaceutical Services) . 
 
The Infusor is a compact, ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilized, single -use, electro -mechanical (battery powered, micro -
processor controlled), on -body delivery system that administers a fixed dose of drug product from a p refilled 
cartridge assembly into subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen. It is intended for use by [CONTACT_1962], caregivers, or a 
health care professional (HCP) at home or in a clinic setting.   The Furoscix Infusor is 117 mm x 62 mm x 30 mm (length x width x height) and weighs  appr oximately 80 grams 
without the drug cartridge and 90 grams, with a filled drug cartridge  inserted into the drug compartment.  It has an 
integrated, adhesive patch which attaches the Infusor  to the skin for dose administration. The device with 
adhesive is removed from the skin following completion of the dose and discarded.   
 The system delivery parameters will be pre- programmed as part of the manufacturing process to deliver 80 mg (10 
mL) furosemide  over 5 hours using a biphasic delivery profile  of 30 mg furosemide (3.75 mL) over the first hour and 
12.5 mg furosemide (1.56 mL) per hour over the subsequent [ADDRESS_419829]: Matching Patients by [CONTACT_339398].

6.2.7.   Unscheduled Telephone Calls and Clinic Visits  
 There are two forms of unscheduled follow -ups specified in this protocol: telephone call and clinic visit. These may 
be assigned at any time at the discretion of the investigator and may arise from a request by [CONTACT_11870] , a request by [CONTACT_339411] , or designee,  conducting telephone follow -ups, or by [CONTACT_339412] . Note that the investigato r can pre -specify at any time the number and timing of unscheduled follow -
up visits.  
 
If subjects experience worsening signs and symptoms they can be seen in the clinic as an unscheduled visit.  For 
subjects presenting for an unscheduled visit the following assessments will be performed:   
 
• Cardiopulmonary  Exam including NYHA Classification  
• Vital Signs  
• Weight  
• Labs drawn at the discretion of the investigator (including BNP or NT -proBNP)  
• Assess for adverse events  
 
All subjects will have the option to receive unscheduled phone call  by a n HF nurse , or designee,  at any time  
following the initial discharge from the emergency department. The primary purpose is to respond to issues affecting proper use and administration of the Furoscix  Infusor. While these calls will follow according to the 
aforementioned script, the HF nurse , or designee,  will address - per his or her best professional judgement - 
specific issues reported by [CONTACT_144911].  
 Additionally, the HF  nurse , or designee,  will ask (and document the responses) whether the subject has since the 
previous follo w-up: 
 
• Been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339373] -related issues

 BNP or NT -proBNP will be tested at all clinic visits (scheduled and unscheduled) , sent to a local laboratory, and 
values  recorded in the CRF.  
 
6.2.10.   Clinical Laboratory Tests  
 All routine samples will be analyzed by a local licensed clinical laboratory. The clinical laboratory tests are as 
follows:  
• Blood clinical chemistry: Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
magnesium  
• Hematology:  (CBC) : Red blood cell count (RBC) , Total white blood cell count (WBC) , Differential WBC 
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), Hemoglobin, Hematocrit (Hct) , and Platelet 
count  
• Urine Pregnancy test: beta hCG test  
 The investigator is responsible for determining if out -of-range laboratory values are clinically significant or not.  All 
clinically significant values will be followed until stabilization , resolution or loss to follow up or until no further 
improvement  is expected.  
6.2.11.   Heart Failure  Symptom Scoring  
 NYHA Functional classes  will be used in this study.  
 
Class I  - Patients have cardiac disease but without the resulting limitations of physical activity. Ordinary 
physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal pain.  
   
Class II  - Patients have cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or anginal 
pain. 
   
Class III  - Patients have cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea or 
anginal pain.  
   
Class IV  - Patients have cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even 
at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is incre ased.  
 6.2.12.   Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs will include respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_240674]), blood pressure (mmHg) and heart rate (beats per

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 41 of 51 7.   ADVERSE EVENTS  
 The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definition of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event  (SAE) as provided in this protocol. AEs will be assessed continuously through 
the last study visit unless the nature of the AE or SAE requires continued monitoring.  All AEs are recorded as mild, 
moderate or severe, and as Not Related, Possibly Related, Probably  Related, and Definitely Related to the 
investigational product . 
 
 Definition of an Adverse Event  
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an investigational product  in humans, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product . An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product , and does not imply any 
judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the investigational product  (e.g., off- label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
 
A “pre -existing” condition is one that is present prior to a dministration of the investigational product and is 
reported as part of the Subject’s medical history. Pre -existing condit ions should be reported as AEs only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the pre -existing condition worsens during the course of the study.  
 Laboratory or functional test abnormalities generally are not considered AEs unless they are associated wit h 
clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention. A laboratory abnormality (e.g. a clinically significant 
change detected on clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or functional test abnormality (e.g. a clinically 
significant change detect ed on electrocardiogram , pulse oximetry, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) that is independent from a 
known underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to interruption or 
discontinuation  of the investigational product , must be co nsidered an AE.  
 All AEs judged to be clinically significant, including clinically -significant laboratory, electrocardiogram  and 
functional test abnormalities, will be followed until resolution or return to baseline or until no further 
improvement is expec ted. 
 
An AE does include any:  
 
• Exacerbation of a pre -existing illness.  
• Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756].  
• Condition detected or diagnosed after investigational  product placement and/or drug administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following the start of the study.  
 
An AE does not include:  
 • Medica l or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339374], social and/or convenience admissions).  
• Overdose of either study drug or concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms.

CONFIDENTIAL | February  2, 2021   Page 42 of 51 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227522] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen during the study is not 
considered an AE.  
 
 Definition of an Adverse Reaction  
 
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by [CONTACT_20141] . Adverse reactions are a subset o f all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the investigational product  caused the event.  
 
 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibilit y that the 
investigational product  caused the adverse event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the investigational product  and the AE . A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty  about causality than adverse reaction.  
 
 Definition of an Unexpected  Adverse Event  
 An adverse event or Suspected Adverse Reaction is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure, product labeling or is not listed at the  specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 
 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
 An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 a. Death  
b. A life -threatening AE  
o NOTE: Life -threatening means that the Subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred.  This definition does not include an event that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
c. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o NOTE: Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
the event is an SAE.  
o NOTE: “Inpatient” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339375] a hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_7521].  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not include presentation at a “casualty” or emergency 
department . 
d. A disability/incapacity  
o NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, accidental trauma (i.e., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent ev eryday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a Subject who received drug  
f. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339376], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the Subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospa sm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
department or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in Subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
o NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be used in deciding whether prompt reporting is 
appropriate in this situation.

improving.  
   
Unknown  - Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
   
Fatal  - The termination of life as a result of an AE.  
 
 Assessment of Relatedness to Study Product  
 The Investigator will assess each AE and SAE for causality based on their best medical judgment, the observed 
symptoms associated with the event, and the available information on investigational product . The relatedness 
guidance provided below can be used to assist in determining the relationship of the IP to the AE or SAE. However, 
it is ultimately the investigator’s responsibility to determine the relationship based on their best medical judgment, 
knowledge, and experience.  
 
Not Related  - Based upon available information regarding subject history, disease process, relationship of AE 
to dosing and drug pharmacology, there is no reasonable relationship between the 
investigational product and the AE.  
   
Possibly 
Related  - Relationship exists between th e AE and IP, when the AE follows a reasonable sequence from the 
time of the investigational product administration, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_339413].  
   
Probably 
Related  - Relationship exists between the AE and the investigational product when the AE follows a 
reasonable sequence from the time of investigational product administration, follows a known 
response pattern of the drug class, is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_339377].

Related Group Code 291, 292 and 293) of $8,600 (standard deviation: $3,045), 68 patients (34 in each group) are required to have an 80% cha nce of detecting a decrease in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339353] $6,500 at a significance level of 5%. 
The target sample size of the Furoscix  cohort will initially be N= 34 subjects.  
 Given the anticipated overdispersion of the primary outcome (i.e., difference in total HF -attributable direct 
medical costs), we will employ adaptive trial design procedures for sample size re -estimation.  This adaptive -total 
information criterion approach was taken due to the risk of incorrectly estimating the sample size due to 
missp ecification of the cost outcome parameters.  By [CONTACT_339415], which includes no 
penalty for repeated interim analysis, the final sample size will be sufficient to provide adequate power to test the stated hypothesis.   
 
This will include re -assessment of the sample size at N=34 in the Furoscix cohort by [CONTACT_2329] a group sequential design 
and testing to allow for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. It is not expected that the sample size for the Furoscix Infusor arm would exceed 
N=75, but the maximum value cannot be definitively stated until the analysis at N=34 is completed.

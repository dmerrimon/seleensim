2.1 Background and Rationale
Why This Study Is Being Conducted
The ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination is an innovative combination therapy that 
targets non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_226894] (SLE).  As 
described below, Jan us kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibition via upadacitinib is expected to disrupt T -cell activation 
and Type I interferon (IFN) signaling ,whereas elsubrutinib (ABBV- 105) is expected to inhibit B -cell 
activation and immune complex -driven activation of dendritic cells (and neutrophils).  As such, the 
ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination has the potential for differentiated efficacy in SLE 
through concurrent inhibition of multiple pathogenic nodes.
Autoantibody generation by [CONTACT_226899] B cells, which is depen dent on B -cell receptor signaling, is a 
hallmark of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and SLE.1
Bruton 's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non- receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in multip le immune cell types 
associated with the pathogenesis of SLE and other autoimmune diseases.  Bruton 's tyrosine kinase is 
required for the propagation of pro -inflammatory signals downstream of immunoreceptors that 
promote autoimmune disease pathogenesis.
The hematopoietic expression and signaling function of BTK downstream of numerous receptors has 
raised interest in pharmacologic targeting of BTK for immune -mediated inflammatory diseases.[ADDRESS_272814] demonstrated:  1) complete abrogation of arthritis in the collagen- induced 
arthritis model when initiated at disease onset, consistent with the effect of BTK inhibition on 
autoantibody production,3,42) efficacy in myeloid -mediated animal arthritis models, consistent with the 
effects of BTK inhibition on macrophage, mast cell, dendritic cell, and neutrophil activity,3,4and 
3)marked reductions of proteinuria in mouse models of lupus, consistent with the effect of BTK 
inhibition on autoantibody p roduction and/or myeloid cell activation.5-7
Upadacitinib (ABT -494), an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibito r,was approved in 2019 under the brand 
name [CONTACT_226928]™ for the treatment of patients with RA in the [LOCATION_002] (US), the European Union (EU), 
and Japan.  Upadacitinib is being investigated in separate clinical studies in other indications, which 
include p soriatic arthritis, active axial spondyloarthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn 's disease, atopic 
dermatitis, giant cell arteritis, and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Clinical Hypothesis
Inhibition of JAK1 pathways in combination with BT K pathways in SLE will provide greater clinical 
efficacy compared with inhibition of each individual pathway when they are added to current standard 
of care while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.
Page 10 of 95 
  
STUDY M20 -186  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_272815] of care for the treatment of SLE with an 
acceptable safety profile.  The ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combi nation of BTK inhibition by 
[CONTACT_226900]1 inhibition by [CONTACT_226901].
Upadacitinib is approved as a single -ingredient agent for the treatment of RA and is being developed for 
other inflammatory diseases, several of which are in Phase [ADDRESS_272816] on the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) at efficacious drug levels, in 
contrast to its inhibitory effects on JAK1.  The enhanced selectivity of upadacitinib for JAK1 may offer an 
improved benefit /risk profile compared wit h less selective JAK inhibition in patients with 
immune -mediated inflammatory diseases due to reduced JAK2 -related effects such as inhibition of 
erythropoiesis and inhibition of granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) signaling, 
the latte r of which plays a critical role in a myelopoietic response to microbial infection.  In addition, 
there is reduced potency of upadacitinib against JAK3 thereby [CONTACT_226902] 
(NK) cells.  Hence, the JAK2 -and JAK3 -sparing proper ties of upadacitinib may manifest as a reduced risk 
of anemia and infection compared with less selective JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib (Xeljanz ®)and 
baricitinib (Olumiant ®).  On the basis of this differentiated selectivity profile for the inhibition of JAK 
kinases, there is potential for an improved benefit /risk profile of upadacitinib compared with other JAK 
inhibitors currently in clinical trials.
Identified risks for upadacitinib are summarized in the upadacitinib Investigator 's Brochure8and include:  
serious infections, opportunistic infections and tu berculosis (TB), and h erpes zoster .  Potential risks for 
upadacitinib include:  malignancies, including lymphoma and non -melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hematologic changes 
(anemi a, neutropenia, and lymphopenia), increased serum creatinine and renal dysfunction, hepatic 
events and increased hepatic transaminases, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), embolic and 
thrombotic events (non -cardiac, non -central nervous system [CNS]), an d fetal risks.
As of [ADDRESS_272817] 1 dose of elsubrutinib; the most 
common side effect reported was headache, mild in severity.
As of 06 May 2020, from the Phase 2 RA and SLE studies, there are no identifie d safety risks for 
elsubrutinib or for ABBV- 599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination.
A detailed description of the preclinical pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicology datasets can be 
found in the elsubrutinib9and upadacitinib8Investigator 's Brochures.  The results of genetic toxicology 
testing indicate that elsubrutinib and upadacitinib are not genotoxic.  Preclinical embryo fetal 
development studies indicate that elsubrutinib and/or upadacitinib are embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and/or 
teratogenic.
Systemic lupus erythematosus patients are known to have an increased risk of thrombosis.  Based on 
this and the potential risk of throm bosis with the use of JAK inhibitors, the use of estrogen -containing

contraceptive should be carefully considered.
In LTE Study M20 -186, benefit/risk assessment of treatment groups for rollover may require subjects to 
be reassigned or discontinued based on the outcome of the unblinded interim analysis from the feeder 
Study M19 -130 (See Section 4Investigational Plan).  Routine safety evaluation sof all treatment groups
will be performed.  These include assessments of deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), non -serious 
adverse events (A Es), withdrawals, and pregnancies, as well as routine monitoring by [CONTACT_65093], vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms, (ECGs), and clinical laboratory testing 
(hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis).
For the safety of subjects, the followi ng exclusions and ongoing assessments are included in the 
protocol:
Exclusion of subjects with chronic or recent infections including active TB.
Evaluating subjects for TB [TB as assessed by [CONTACT_226903] (IGRA QuantiFERON ®-TB 
Gold In- Tube test o r equivalent), and/or a purified protein derivative (tuberculin) ([COMPANY_003]) test (or 
both if required per local guidelines)].
If different national regulations exist for evaluating TB while being on immunosuppressive 
treatment, these national regulations will b e applied, respectively.
If a subject develops a serious infection (including coronavirus disease 2019 [ COVID -19]) or 
serious opportunistic infection (excludes non -serious oropharyngeal candidiasis) with study 
treatment, study drug should be interrupted, and appropriate treatment of the infection should 
be initiated.
Review SAEs of infection on a real -time basis and query for additional information as clinically 
indicated.
A supplemental herpes zoster form will be used to collect additional information for any herpes 
zoster events.
See Section 3.4for detailed safety endpoints and Section 6.3for information on the Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC).
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the elsubrutinib9
and upadacitinib8Investigator 's Brochures.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit /risk profile of various immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226895] -19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the effects of elsubrutinib and upadacitinib on the course of 
COVID -19 are not well- defined.   Further guidance regarding COVID -19 infection is provided in 
Section 6.2.

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, double -blind LTE Phase 2 study to investigate the longer -term safety and efficacy of 
elsubrutinib and upadacitinib given alone or as the ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination in 
subjects with moderately to severely active SLE.  The study population will consist of approximately [ADDRESS_272819] of care therapy.
Subjects who participated in Study M19 -130 may be offered the opportunity to consent for this study.  
The number of subjects participating in this study will not be greater than the number randomized into 
Study M19 -130.  Subjects discontinuing study drug prematurely in Study M19 -130 are not eligible to 
participate in the LTE study.
In Study M19 -130, subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 5 treatment groups: 
Elsubrutinib 60 mg once a day (QD) and upadacitinib 30 mg QD (projected n = 65)
Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib 15 mg QD (projected n = 65)
Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib placebo QD (projected n = 65)
Elsubrutinib placebo QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD (projected n = 65)
Elsubrutinib placebo QD and upadacitinib placebo QD (projected n = 65) 
Prior to the planned Study M19 -130 Interim Analysis, q ualified subjects entering into LTE Study M20 -186 
stayedin their original treatment group from Study M19 -130 if on an ABBV -599 
(elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination, elsubrutinib 60 mg monotherapy, or upadacitinib 30 mg 
monotherapy.  Those originally assigned to the placebo group in Study M19 -130 were randomized
centrally in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacit inib) combination treatment groups.
Prior to the planned Study M19 -130 Interim Analysis , there were 4treatment groups in this LTE study:
Group 1:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD
Group 2:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib 15 mg QD
Group 3:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg QD and upadacitinib placebo QD
Group 4:  Elsubrutinib placebo QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD
A planned unblinded interim analysis for Study M19 -130 was scheduled when 50% of the planned 
subjects completed their Week 24 assessments .  The objective of this analysis was to reassess the 
treatment regimens in Study M19 -130 and the benefit/risk for rollover into LTE Study M20 -186.
The Study M19 -130 Interim Analysis was performed by [CONTACT_226906] t from the blinded study team for Study M19 -130.  The M19 -130 study team will 
remain blinded through the Study M19 -130 Week 24 Primary Analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].An Interim Unblinding Plan (IUP) was developed separately describing the analyses to be performed and 
included execution logistics, an unblinded analysis team, and the data chain of custody to protect the 
integrity of the study.
An Internal Executive Review Committee (IERC) review edthe interim unblinded results as specified in 
the IERC charter and decided which tr eatment group(s) should be continued in Study M19 -130 and for 
rollover into LTEStudy M20 -186.  Study sites and subjects remain edblinded to treatment assignment in 
Study M19 -130 and LTEStudy M20 -186 throughout the studies.
Based on the benefit/risk assessment of the planned Study M19 -130 Interim Analysis, subjects in 1 or 
more groups of LTE Study M20 -186 may be discontinued.  Subjects in any discontinued group(s) should 
return for a Premature Discontinuation (PD) visit and h ave a follow -up phone call [ADDRESS_272820] 
study drug dose.
Subjects originally assigned to the placebo group in Study M19 -130 will be rolled over and will be 
randomized to an active treatment group in LTE Study M20 -186.
This study includes a 56 -wee k double -blind treatment period with study visits conducted at Weeks 48, 
56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, and 104 (from the Baseline visit of Study M19 -130), and a subsequent telephone 
follow -up call [ADDRESS_272821] visit to determine the status of any ongoi ng AEs/SAEs or the 
occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  The plan is to extend the trial if data support the safety and efficacy 
endpoints during the 56 -week LTE study duration.
An interim analysis for LTE Study M20 -186 may be performed to aid data interpretation and to facilitate 
interactions with regulatory authorities.
The schematic of the study is shown i n Figure 1.  Further details regarding study procedur es are located 
in the Operations Manual ( Appendix H ).  See Section 5for information regarding eligibility criteria.

4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Choice of Control Group
There will not be any placebo control in LTE Study M20 -186.  Subjects in LTE Study M20 -186 will roll 
over from Study M19 -130.  Th e objective of this LTE study is to evaluate longer -term safety and 
tolerability of elsubrutinib, upadacitinib, and ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) combination in SLE, 
and thus the primary comparison will be relative to the safety profile observed in each treatment group 
during the initial randomized study.
Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  All safety and 
efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessi ng disease activity in subjects with SLE being 
treated with immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are 
standard and generally accepted.

STUDY M20 -186  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_272823] is willing and the investigator 
believes that continuing therapy is appropriate.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose selection in Study M19 -130 was based on analysis of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, 
safety, and efficacy (upadacitinib only) data from Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers for elsubrutinib, 
Phase 2 and Phase 3studi es for upadacitinib in RA, as well as a published study of baricitinib in SLE.8-10
The 60 mg dose of elsubrutinib is intended to target exposures at or greater than those needed to 
achieve maximal peripheral BTK occupanc y.  Following QD dosing of elsubrutinib 60 mg, peak and 
trough BTK occupancy at steady -state are predicted to be 99% and 89%, respectively.  Furthermore, the 
elsubrutinib dose of 60 mg (administered alone or with upadacitinib 30 mg) has been shown to be sa fe 
and well-tolerated in Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects.
The selected dosing regimens of upadacitinib are 15 and 30 mg QD (testing both dose levels in the 
ABBV -599 [elsubrutinib/upadacitinib] combination and only the higher dose in the upadacitinib 
monotherapy treatment group).  These doses are based on the well -tolerated safety profile of 
upadacitinib in Phase 3 RA studies as well as extrapolation of data from a recently published 
Phase 2study of baricitinib in SLE.10  In that study, the baricitinib 2 mg QD dosing regimen demonstrated 
negligible efficacy while the 4 mg QD regimen provided evidence of therapeutic benefit; indicating that 
higher doses of baricitinib may be needed to demonstrate efficacy in SLE compared with RA.10  
Furthermore, comparison of in vitro cellular inhibition of Type I IFN signaling showed compar able 
potency between upadacitinib and baricitinib (i.e., comparable concentration producing 50% inhibition 
[IC 50] values).  Predicted plasma- concentration time profiles for upadacitinib and baricitinib indicate that 
the upadacitinib 15 mg QD dosing regimen is predicted to result in plasma concentrations that provide 
higher inhibitory efficacy (e.g., time above IC 50) compared with the baricitinib 2 mg QD dosing regimens; 
whereas the upadacitinib 30 mg QD regimen is predicted to provide similar or higher inhi bitory efficacy 
compared with the baricitinib 4 mg QD dosing regimen.
Doses selected for continuation in the LTE study may be modified or discontinued at any time based on 
the outcome of the planned Study M19 -130 Interim Analysis and at [COMPANY_013] 's discretion .

potential risk of thrombosis with the use of JAK inhibitors.  The use of estrogen -containing 
contraceptives may further increase the risk of thrombotic events; therefore, the choice of 
contraceptive should be carefu lly considered.
Page 20 of 95 
  
STUDY M20 -186  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT [ADDRESS_272830] follow the following contraceptive guidelines as specified:
Females, Non -Childbearing Potential
Women do not need to use birth control during or following study drug treatment if considered 
of non -childbearing potential due to meeting any of the following criteria:
Postmenopausal, age > 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an 
alternative medical cause.
Postmenopausal, age ≤ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an 
alternative medical cause AND a follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 IU/L.
Permanently surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or 
hysterectomy).
Women of Childbearing Potential 
WOCBP must avoid pregnancy while taking study drug(s) and for at least [ADDRESS_272831] commit to one of the following highly effective methods 
of birth control with:
Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) horm onal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of ovulation.
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated 
with inhibition of ovulation.
Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligatio n (can be via hysteroscopy, provided a 
hysterosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_17165]).  For Japan:  only bilateral tubal 
ligation.
Vasectomized partner, provided the partner has received medical confirmation of 
surgical success, and is the sole sex ual partner of the WOCBP trial participant.
Intrauterine device (IUD).
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
Practice true abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the pre ferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods, and withdrawal] are not acceptable).
For the local requirements for contraception in Japan, please refer to Appendix F .
If required per local practices, WOCBP must commit to using 2 methods of contraception (either 2 highly 
effective methods or 1 highly effective method comb ined with 1 effective method).
Effective methods of birth control are the following:
Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action.
Male or female condom with or without spermicide.

(double -barrier method).
A condom is required in the following countries:  [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]), [LOCATION_013], and Spain.
If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal (defined 
above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
It is important to note that the contraception requirements described above are specifically intended to 
prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (elsubrutinib and/or upadacitinib).  
For concomitant immunosuppressive agent(s) (i.e., MTX, azathioprine, mycophenolate, leflunomide, 
etc.) that have been pres cribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are allowed to be 
continued during the study, contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant 
immunosuppressive agent(s).  The duration of contraception after discontinuation of the se 
immunosuppressive agent(s) should be based on the local product labeling.  Urine pregnancy testing 
shall be performed at monthly intervals in the study activity schedule.
Additional local requirements may apply and should be followed accordingly.

6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.[ADDRESS_272844]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may inc lude, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, de vice not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site 's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigatio nal) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.

STUDY M20 -186  |  Version 4.0  |  EudraCT 2020 -001690 -72
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol, as well as from accidental or 
intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal .  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or 
illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in 
discon tinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol -specific 
criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity managemen t), and/or if the investigator considers them to be 
AEs.  Worsening SLE including flares will be captured and analyzed via the disease activity forms (SLEDAI, 
BILAG, CLASI, and SFI) and will be analyzed as part of efficacy.  As such, worsening SLE and flar es will not 
be captured as AEs unless they result in serious outcomes.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AE on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.  If the subject 
undergoes elective surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at least [ADDRESS_272845] undergo emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at the 
time of the surgery.  For both elective and emergency surgery, allow reintroduction of study drug once 
the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of 
infection.
If any of the following events ( Table 3) are reported, then the following supplemental report must be 
completed.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantiall y interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
Adverse Event Collection
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_272846].  
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in death, are 
life-threatening, require inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], result in persist ent or significant disability or incapacity, or are a 
congenital anomaly or birth defect.
S[LOCATION_003]R A suspected unexpected SAR:  refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical 
trials where a causal relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected 
by [CONTACT_226915], is not listed is the applicable 
Reference Safety Inform ation (RSI), and meets one of the following serious 
criteria:  results in death, is life -threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194636], results in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
requirements.

The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the 
study drug will be c onsidered "associated."   Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "not associated. "  In addition, when the investigator has not 
reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will c onsider the event associated.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].6.2 Toxicity Management
The toxicity management of the AEs including AESI consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an 
ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of saf ety issues by [CONTACT_226916]), 
interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management if applicable, and 
discontinuation of the subjects from study drug.
The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is discus sed below and described in Table 4.  
This includes AEs of serious infections, opportunistic infections, GI perforations, cardiovascular events 
(MACE), th romboembolic events, malignancies, and ECG abnormalities.  This also includes the following 
laboratory abnormalities:  hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, alanine 
transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST), serum creatinine , CPK, lymphocyte count, total
white blood cell (WBC) count, and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) .
For all other AEs or laboratory -related AEs, study drug will be interrupted immediately if a subject 
experiences a confirmed severe (Grade 3) clinica l AE or SAE for which the investigator considers the 
relationship to the study drug to be a reasonable possibility.  For confirmed Grade [ADDRESS_272850] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 
1business day of the study site 's knowledge of the event.  Product complai nts occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion .
All follow -up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and 
documented in source as required by [CONTACT_1034].  Product complaints associate d with AEs will be 
reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Management of Serious Infections
Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during 
and after tre atment with study drug.  Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious 
infection (including COVID -19) or a serious opportunistic infection (excludes non -serious oropharyngeal 
candidiasis).  A subject who develops a new infection during t reatment with study drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As appropriate, 
antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored.  Study drug may 
be restarted once the i nfection has been successfully treated.  Subjects who develop active TB must be 
discontinued from the study drug.
Canada only:  Investigators should be advised to follow local public health guidelines in order to prevent 
subjects enrolled in these trials f rom acquiring TB.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19. Consider

Management of Thrombosis Events
Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated 
appropriately.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or non -cardiac, 
non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug.
Management o f Select Laboratory Abnormalities
For any given laboratory abnormality, the investigator should assess the subject and apply the standard 
of care for medical evaluation and treatment following any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity 
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Table 4and may require a 
supplemental eCRF to be completed (see Section 6.1).  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_111002] a satisfactory resolution.  If a repeat test is 
required per Table 4, the repeat testing must occur as soon as possible.

Laboratory Parameters Toxicity Management Guidelines
Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by 
[CONTACT_176448] a new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline without an 
alternative etiology, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by 
[CONTACT_111003].
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline and an alternative 
etiology is known, the subject may remain on study drug at the 
investigator' s discretion.
If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value 
returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) If confirmed < 750 cells/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt 
study drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or 
its baseline value.  Subjects who meet this criterion should be evaluated 
for an alternative etiology and closely monitored for infections .
 The alternative etiology should be documented appropriately in the 
eCRF.   If restarting study drug, documentation should include the 
reason rechallenge is expected to be safe.
Platelet count If confirmed < 30,000 platelets/µL by [CONTACT_111003], 
interrupt study drug dosing until platelet count returns to normal
reference range or its baseline value.

alanine transaminase (ALT) Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 ×ULN 
by [CONTACT_176451] a total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN or an INR > 1.5.
 INR will only need to be measured in subjects with ALT or AST 
>3 × ULN by [CONTACT_2237].  A repeat test of INR is not 
needed for determination if above toxicity management 
criteria are met.
 Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AS T > 3 × ULN 
by [CONTACT_226918], nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, or tenderness, 
fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).
 Interrupt study drug immediately if ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by [CONTACT_176449].
 Interrupt study drug immediately if ALT or AST > 8 × ULN and 
contact [CONTACT_26275].
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an 
alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as 
medically appropr iate.  The investigator should contact [CONTACT_226919] a subject when an alternative 
etiology has been determined.  The alternative etiology should be 
documented appropriately in the eCRF; study drug should be 
discontinued if no alternative etiology can be found.
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > 3 ×ULN, complete 
supplemental hepatic eCRF.

 ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily 
identified. 
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will require 
immediate interruption of stu dy drug (per local guidelines) and a 
hepatologist consultation should occur within 1 week for 
recommendation regarding subsequent treatment.
Serum Creatinine  If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and > ULN, repeat 
the test for serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to 
confirm the results.  If the results of the repeat testing still meet this 
criterion then interrupt study drug and re- start study drug once 
serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and ≤ ULN.
 If confirmed new serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL, interrupt study drug 
and re -start study drug once serum creatinine returns to normal 
reference range or its baseline value.
For the above serum creatinine elevation scenarios, complete 
supplemental renal eCRF(s).

7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock.  The statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all subjects received at least [ADDRESS_272856] 1 dose of study drug in 
LTEStudy M20 -186.  Subjects will be grouped according to treatment sequence actually received.  The 
Safety Analysis Set will be used for safety a nalyses.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment sequence as 
randomized for Study M19 -130 and continued/reassigned to rollover into LTE Study M20 -186.  The 
analysis will be based on As Observed (AO) data, and no imputation will be conducted.  The treatment 
groups will be described as follows whenever applicable indicating treatments from Study M19 -130 to 
LTE Study M20 -186:
Group 1:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg / upadacitinib 30 mg to elsubrutinib 60 mg / upadacitinib 30 mg
Group 2:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg / upadacitinib 15 mg to elsubrutinib 60 mg / upadacitinib 15 mg 
Group 3:  Elsubrutinib 60 mg to elsubrutinib 60 mg
Group 4:  Upadacitinib 30 mg to upadacit inib 30 mg
Group 5a:  Placebo to elsubrutinib 60 mg / upadacitinib 30 mg
Group 5b:  Placebo to elsubrutinib 60 mg / upadacitinib 15 mg
The Baseline for all secondary efficacy analyses in this study will be the Baseline in Study M19 -130.
There is no primar y efficacy endpoint and no formal statistical tests will be applied.  Only descriptive 
statistics will be used for all efficacy endpoints.  Descriptive statistics will be provided for each treatment 
group for all visits.  These include the number of observ ations; mean with 95% confidence interval, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous endpoints (or the change from 
baseline measurements); and frequencies and percentages with 95% confidence interval for binary 
endpoints.

7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.
All treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AESI will be 
collected during the study.  A TEAE is defined as an event with onset or worsening after the first study 
dose of study drug and within [ADDRESS_272858] dose of study drug administration.  The number and 
percentages of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the Medical Dictionary for Drug 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Summaries 
(including percentages and events per 100 patient -years) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and AESI will be provided as well.  For selected laboratory and vital sign parameters, 
mean change from Baseline and the percentage of subjects with evaluations meeting pre -defined 
criteria for Potentially Clinically Important values will be s ummarized.
7.5 Interim Analysis
An interim analysis may be performed as needed in order to provide long -term safety data to inform the 
benefit -risk assessment of elsubrutinib, upadacitinib, and ABBV -599 (elsubrutinib/upadacitinib) 
combination .  All endpoints w ill be summarized using descriptive statistics, and summaries will be

Clarification for Japan Contraception Recommendations
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must avoid pregnancy while taking study drug(s) and for at 
least [ADDRESS_272875] commit to one of the following highly 
effective methods of birth control with:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal,* 
transdermal,* injectable*) associated with the inhibition of ovulation.
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral,** injectable,* implantable*) associated with 
inhibition of ovulation.
Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation (in Japan, only bilateral tubal occlusion).
Vasectomized partner, provided the vasectomized p artner has received medical confirmation of 
surgical success, and is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant.
Intrauterine device (IUD).
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
Practice true abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements):  Refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (periodic 
abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods, and withdrawal] 
is not acceptable).
* Not ap proved in Japan.
** Not applicable in Japan due to the approval only for emergency contraception.

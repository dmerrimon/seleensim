PHARMACODYNAMICS , AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF TRC253,  AN ANDROGEN RECEPTOR 
ANTAGONIST , IN PATIENTS  WITH METASTATIC CASTRATION -RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER  
Study center(s): 6 centers in Part 1, and a pproximately 20 centers  in Part 2,  in the [LOCATION_002]  
Studied period:   
Date first patient enrolled: May 2017

Rational e:  
TRC253 is a high -affinity, small molecule antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) with inhibitory 
activity against wild type AR and specific mutated variants of AR. TRC253 blocks AR nuclear 
translocation as well as AR binding to DNA and is an antagonist o f transcription for wild type AR and 
mutated AR. TRC253 is orally active and does not have agonist activity towards either the wild type or 
mutated ARs. TRC253  treatment in the Hershberger assay results in complete inhibition of androgen 
sensit ive organ de velopment. TRC 253 is efficacious in an LNCaP xenograft model driven by  F877L 
(previously  known as F87 6L) mutant AR  and inhibited other known AR resistance mutations, including 
L702H, in preclinical models .

 Study Design :  
This is a multi -center, first -in–human, open -label, Phase 1/2 A dose-escalation study in which eligible 
patients  with metastatic castration -resistant prostate carcinoma  (mCRPC) will receive oral doses of 
TRC253 . The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

During Part [ADDRESS_385445] completed the 28-day dose-limiting 
toxicity ( DLT ) evaluation period. Dose escalation in Part 1 will follow single -patient dose escalation 
design until drug -related toxicity occurs per Table  4. When an initial drug -related toxicity occurs per 
Table  4 or DLT per  
Table  6 in a single patient the cohort will be expanded according to 3+3 design rules.  Cohort s may be 
expanded to include additional patients for purpo ses of collecting additional safety, PK, PD (FDHT -
PET) , and PSA response data . A single cohort may expanded to a maximum of twelve patients to help 
inform selection of a MED , as long as that dose level remains below the MTD (see below).  
Subsequent dose lev els will enroll patients based on 3+[ADDRESS_385446] been 
exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients experie nce DLT at a given dose level. DLT will have occurred when a 
patie nt has [ADDRESS_385447] 28 days of dosing.  Patients who exit 
the study  for reasons other than DLT prior to completion of the 28 -day DLT evaluation period will be 
replaced to ensure an adequate safety assessment in each cohort. Patients who experience DLT who 
receive less than the prescribed dose of TRC253  due to documented t oxicity during the DLT evaluation 
period will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes. At the MTD  or MED , up to  twelve  
patients may be enrolled  prior to confirming the RP2D . Dose escalation will take into account all Part 1

Dosage and Administration  
Part 1 : a single dose of TRC253  will be  taken on the first day (i .e., Cycle 1 Day 1) of a 7 -day cycle . 
During Cycle 1 , the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a single dose of TRC253  will be investigated.  
TRC253  will be administered orally once daily in the morning  in 28 -day cycles  starting in Cycle 2 . 
Starting with treatment Cycle 2 Day 1, TRC253  will be taken once daily in the morning . The proposed 
TRC253  doses are 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg, 320 mg, and 400 mg ; however, intermediate dose 
level s may be implemented based on  safety, tolerability, PK, PD and other observations at each dose 
level  following review of data with the principal investigators at all treating sites.  
Part 2 : TRC253  capsules are taken once daily in the morning  starting on Cycle [ADDRESS_385463] 2 hours before and 1 hour 
after dosing.  
Withdrawal Criteria :  
Patients  will be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is medically 
necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient. In addition, patients  will be withdrawn from treatment for 
any of the following reasons:  
1. Lost to follow -up or noncomp liant 
2. Withdrawal of consent  
3. The sponsor terminates the study  
4. Disease progression  according to PCWG3 criteria  (Appendix  2, Appendix  3) 
a. Patients may continue on study drug if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], patient is 
deriving benefit from continuation of therapy. Con tinuation of therapy must be 
approved by [CONTACT_1034].  
5. Dose delay greater than 21 days  
Note:  In part 1, o nly patients who have received >75% of TRC253 doses during the DLT 
evaluation period will be considered evaluable. Patients who have received ≤75% of TRC253 
doses during the DLT evaluation period due to reasons other than toxicities, such as but not 
restri cted to disease progression, missed appointments, non -compliance, and patient

8. Patients who experience QTcF prolongation > 500 ms or > 60 ms change from baseline 
without electrolyte abnormalities and without response to TRC253  (See Section 8.5.3)  
 
If a patient  discontinues study drug and withdraws from the study, the off -study visit assessments 
should be obtained.  
If a patient  is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_1758] -site personnel to 
contact [CONTACT_313199]/withdrawal. The measures taken to 
follow up must be documented.  
Study drug assigned to the withdrawn patient  may not be assigned to another patient . Patients  who 
withdraw for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety  evaluations : 
Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of clinical 
laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements, and physical examinations.  
While ECG readings at the sites will be used for patient management purposes, an additional central 
read will be performed by a third -party vendor.  
Pharmacokinetic evaluations:  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of TRC253 will be derived from plasma concentration versus time data 
after single and repeat ed doses, as applicable.  
Biomarker evaluations:  
Part [ADDRESS_385465] dose levels will undergo positron emission tomography 
(PET) scans using 1 6β [18F]fluoro -α-dihydrotestosterone (FDHT), a radiopharmaceutical specifically 
designed to image binding to AR. AR -positive lesions will be determined by [CONTACT_313200] -PET images.  Imaging will occur at 1 or more centers under their ex isting IND and 
institutional protocol .   
Part 2  
Patients  with and without AR ligand -binding -domain (LBD) mutations  will be identified using ctDNA  
from plasma .  A validated and CLIA -certified Clinical Trial Assay (CTA) utilizing highly sensitive 
BEAMing emu lsion PCR platform will be used to detect AR mutations. Patients  who are positive for 
the AR F87 7L mutation will be enrolled in Cohort 1 , patients  without  AR F877L and without sole AR 
L702H mutation s will be enrolled in Cohort 2 , and patients who are positive for sole AR L702H 
mutation will be enrolled in Cohort 3 . Note that Cohort 1 patients may be positive for F877L alone or 
F877L associated with any other AR mutation.

 Parts 1 and 2  
Available a rchival formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks or slides will be collected 
from all patients  to evaluate primary response and high -risk markers, including but not limited to 
TMPRSS2 -ERG, PTEN, FGFR, PI3K , BRACA1, BRCA2, and ATM . 
Whole blood w ill be collected from all patients  to enumerate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and assess 
the expression of high risk markers , including AR -V7. Plasma will be collected to assess the 
development of AR mutations in response to TRC253 treatment.  
Serum will b e collected from all patients  before, during, and after therapy and analyzed for total 
testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_21907] 
(DHEA -S), androstenedione, and sex hormone -binding globulin (SHBG).   
Efficacy  evaluations : 
Efficacy evaluations include disease outcome assessments, PSA, time to PSA progression, soft tissue 
disease, bone disease, and rPFS.   
Statistical methods:  
Sample size determination : 
The sample size for this study is not calculated based on statistical power but to obtain safety, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments of oral doses of TRC253 .  
In Part 1 , dose escalation  will follow a single -patient  dose escalation design until initia l drug-related 
toxicity occurs per Table  4. Subsequent dose levels will enroll patients based on 3+3 design  
(Section  5.1). At the maximum tolerated dose or minimum efficacious dose, up to 12 patients may be 
enrolled.  
In Part 2 , dose expansion, approximately  60 patients  will be enrolled in three  cohort s to further 
characterize safety and PK , as well as efficacy . For example, i f the true PSA response rate in cohort 2 
is 50%, the probability of observing at least 11 responders out of 30 is 95%. If the total of 30 patients  
from this example , 15 are PSA responders, then the response rate (95% CI) will be 50% (31.3%, 
68.7%).  
Safety analyses:  
All patients  who receive at least one dose of study drug will be analyzed for safety. The safety 
parameters to be analyzed are adverse events (DLT, all advers e events, Grade 3 or greater adverse 
events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment, adverse events 
leading to death), as well as clinically significant changes in the patient ’s physical examination 
findings, ECGs, v ital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory results. Exposure to study drug and 
reasons for discontinuation of study treatment will be tabulated.  
Exposure -QTcF analysis of TRC253  will be performed using triplicate  approximately  ± [ADDRESS_385466] -party vendor.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize TRC253  plasma concentrations at each sampling time 
point, by [CONTACT_15994]/study part. Pharmacokinetic parameters of TRC253  will be determined using non -

 compartmental analysis and summarized by [CONTACT_15994]/study  part. Mean and individual plasma TRC253  
concentration time profiles will be plotted (linear and semilog) after the first dose of study drug and at 
steady state. Analysis of dose proportionality and steady state versus Day 1 accumulation ratios will be 
conducted.  
Population PK analysis of plasma concentration -time data of TRC253  will be performed using 
nonlinear mixed -effects modeling. Available baseline patient  characteristics (demographics, laboratory 
variables, race, etc.) may be tested as potential cova riates affecting PK parameters. Data from this study 
may be pooled with other data for the population analysis.  
Biomarker analyses:  
FDHT -PET: The maximum standard uptake value will be calculated for each lesion at each tested dose 
level and for all lesion s. The percent decline in maximum standard uptake will be directly proportional 
to AR occupancy and therefore can be used to estimate EC 90 which will be taken into consideration for 
the selection of the RP2D.  
Exploratory biomarkers: CTC number at baseline,  and change in CTC counts will be descriptively 
summarized. Prostate -specific antigen changes at Week 12 will be correlated with expression of 
molecular markers to identify novel sensitizing mechanisms. Whole blood and plasma samples 
collected will be used  to estimate frequency of expression of resistance and high risk markers. 
Associations will be made with time to clinical endpoints and expression of resistance biomarkers.  
The association of biomarkers with clinical response or relevant survival endpoints  may be assessed 
using appropriate statistical methods (e .g., analysis of variance, categorical or survival models) 
depending on the endpoints. Analyses may be performed within the treatment group. Other clinical 
covariates (such as baseline tumor characte ristics and patient  demographics) may also be included in 
the model. Correlation of baseline biomarker expression levels with clinical response or relevant time 
to-event endpoints may be performed to identify responsive (or resistant) subgroups. Associatio n of 
biomarkers with clinical response or relevant time -to-event endpoints will also be explored in the 
overall population.  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses will be performed using data from all patients  
who have sufficient data available to evaluate anti -tumor effects of TRC253 . The population PK/PD 
analysis will us e concentration as a n independent variable . Pharmacodynamic endpoints such as percent 
decline in SUV max-avg from baseline (estimate EC 90) from FDHT -PET, time to PSA progression, and 
percent change in PSA relative to baseline will be considered using non -linear mixed -effect modeling.  
Efficacy a nalyses  
Patient  listings will be provided for efficacy evaluations including PSA  response rate , time to PSA 
progression, and rPFS.  
Post-treatment percent change in PSA relative to baseline will be reported at Week 12 (or earlier for 
those who discontinue therapy), and separately, the maximal change at any time on study will also be 
reported for each patient  using waterfall plots.  
For Part 2, efficacy summaries by [CONTACT_313201] (PSA response, time to PSA progression, and 
rPFS ) will be performed. Median time to PSA progression will be determined separately for each of 
the expansion cohorts and K aplan -Meier  curves may be plotted. If there are sufficient data, rPFS will

inhibitory activity against wild type AR and specific mutated variants of AR  ligand binding 
domain . TRC253  blocks AR nuclear translocation as well as AR binding to DNA and is an 
antagonist of transcription for wild type AR and mutated AR. TRC253  is orally active and does 
not have agonist activity towards either the wild type or mutated ARs. TRC253  treatment in  the 
Hershberger assay results in complete inhibition of androgen sensitive organ development. 
TRC253  is efficacious in a n LNCaP xenograft model driven by F87 7L mutant AR .  The AR 
F877L mutation results in an alteration in the ligand binding domain that do es not alter the 
response of AR to androgens, but does confer resistance to current AR inhibitors . TRC253 also 
inhibit s other known AR resistance mutations , including L702H , in preclinical studies.  For the 
most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical infor mation regarding TRC253 , refer to the latest 
version of the Investigator's Brochure for TRC253 .  
2.1. Background  
Activation of AR signaling is crucial for the growth of prostate cancer at all stages of the disease. 
It is of critical importance that even cas tration -resistant prostate carcinomas (CRPC) are still 
dependent on functional AR. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain this 
continued addiction of CRPC to a functional AR signal transduction pathway. These molecular 
mechanisms includ e AR overexpression as well as AR aberrations such as gene amplification, 
constitutively active splice variants, and point mutations. Amplification of the AR leading to AR 
overexpression and mutations in the ligand -binding domain (LBD) of AR in CRPC can re nder 
the receptor more sensitive to growth -stimulating effects of low androgen concentrations. By 
[CONTACT_313204], the first generation cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 17A1 inhibitor abiraterone acetate and the second gener ation AR inhibitor enzalutamide 
have been approved for the treatment of CRPC. Patients with CRPC taking these agents 
experience a clear therapeutic benefit , including extended overall survival , as well as marked 
responses in prostate -specific antigen (PSA)  suppression, radiographic tumor response, and 
extended time to progression of their disease. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_313185], 
resistance to these AR -targeting agents, evident by [CONTACT_313205], develops in nearly all men with CRPC. Three different patterns 
of PSA biomarker response have been described to characterize the sensitivity and the emerging 
resistance to the second generation AR inhibitor enzalutamide ( Figure 2) [1].

The emergence of an “acquired resistance” to enzalutamide is characterized by [CONTACT_313206] ≥50% compared to the baseline serum level at treatment week 12, 
followed by a slow PSA rise up to or close to baseline serum levels up to treatment week 60.  
The molecular mechanisms leading to intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti -androgen 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_313186], and one of the prevailing hypotheses is 
outlined in Figure 3 [2]. It appears that the selective pressure exerted by [CONTACT_313207]-targeting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_313187]. 
According to this model, resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and first generation 
anti-androgens appears to be driven by [CONTACT_313208], overexpression, or mutation. Tumor 
clones acquiring these AR phenotypes  remain addicted to AR and are sensitive to second 
generation anti -androgens such as enzalutamide and apalutamide.  
However, in a next step the CRPC clones acquire AR mutations or AR variants which render 
them insensitive to second generation anti -androgen s. Certain mutations in the LBD of AR, 
including the recently described F87 7L missense mutation (i .e., substitution of phenylalanine by 
[CONTACT_313209] 87 7 in the LBD), have been shown to mediate this acquired resistance by 
[CONTACT_313210]  [3-5]. 
TRC253  has been specifically developed to inhibit these AR LBD resistance mutations arising in 
response to second generation anti -androgen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Thus, TRC253  will address a currently 
unmet medical need. It is expected that treatment with TRC253  will re -sensitize these tumors to 
AR-inhibition after disease progression on a prior second generation anti -androgen therapy. To

 determine the RP2D of TRC253 , positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging using a 
radiolabeled analog of dihydrotestosterone (16β [18F]fluor o-α-dihydrotestosterone [FDHT]) will 
be used as a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker to define binding to AR. To maximize the clinical 
benefit of TRC253 , patients  will be screened for LBD mutation s in Part 2 (dose expansion) , and 
segregated into three cohorts : those with F87 7L mutant AR , those with sole L702H mutant AR,  
and those without either of these mutation s. 
To better understand the resistance markers at baseline and those that may emerge during 
treatment, patients  will be screened for AR alterations, includ ing AR amplification, and 
additional high -risk markers, including ARV7  before, during, and after therapy.

type AR and AR F87 7L. Moreover, TRC253  showed no agonistic activity in the wild type AR 
and AR  F877L in these assays. In the VP -16 AR reporter assay, TRC253  inhibited androgen -
induced DNA binding of AR (wild type and F87 7L) wit hout agonistic activity. TRC253  blocked 
androgen -induced nuclear translocation of the AR and did not induce translocation in the 
absence of androgen.  
The ability of TRC253  to inhibit other clinically relevant AR resistance mutations within the 
ligand binding domain was analyzed. These data demonstrate t hat TRC253  is an effective 
antagonist of mutations in the AR ligand binding domain , including L702H,   with nearly no 
agonist activity.  
The molecular activity of TRC253  determined in receptor binding or reporter assays as the 
estimated 50% inhibitory concen tration (IC 50) is summarized in  the Investigator ’s Brochure  and 
the table below .

TRC253  inhibits the androgen -dependent proliferation of wild type AR - and mutant F87 7L-
driven tumor cells in vitro . TRC253  did not stimulate tumor cell proliferation in the absence of 
androgen in any of the tested cell lines in vitro . 
As expected from the mechanism of action of AR inhibition, TRC253  is a potent antagonist of 
androgen -sensitive organ development in vivo . 
TRC25 3 treatment led to complete stasis of tumor growth inhibition in a F87 7L-driven xenograft 
at 30  mg/kg once daily in the morning  dosing. In a tumor xenograft expressing wild type AR, 
TRC253  resulted in complete stasis at 30 mg/kg.

 2.2.2.  Safety Pharmacology  
Cardio vascular safety was evaluated in vitro  and in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vivo  
studies. In a human Ether -à-go-go Related Gene (hERG assay; non -GLP), TRC253  inhibited the 
membrane K+ current with an estimated IC 50 of 2.8  μM. In a human cardiomyocyte a ssay, 
TRC253  reduced the amplitude of the Ca2+ transients at 0.3 to 3 µM, increased the beat rate at 3 
µM, and stopped cell beating at 10 and 30  µM, and no “arrhythmia -like” activities (such as early 
after depolarization -like or ventricular fibrillation -like) were noted. In GLP studies in beagle 
dogs dosed orally with TRC253 , dose -dependent heart rate -adjusted QT prolongation occurred 
after single doses of 10, 20, and 40  mg/kg and after repeated dosing for 28  days at 7.5 and 
25 mg/kg/day but not at 2.5 mg/k g/day. After a 28 -day recovery for the 25  mg/kg/day group, all 
electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were within normal limits, indicating that 
cardiovascular effects were completel y reversible.  
No notable clinical signs related to effects on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y system were noted in 
Sprague -Dawley rats treated with up to 100 mg/kg/day of TRC253  in a GLP 28 -day oral toxicity 
study.  
TRC253  did not induce convulsions in mice dosed orally for 3 days at 200  mg/kg/day. In a 
functional observation battery conducted as part of a GLP repeat -dose toxicity study, there were 
no central nervous system -related findings in male rats administered single oral doses up to 
100 mg/kg/day (high dose). Central nervous system safety was also confirmed by [CONTACT_313211] -related clinical observations up to the high dose of 120  mg/kg/day in rats 
and 30  mg/kg/day in dogs in non -GLP 14 -day oral toleration studies and up to the high dose of 
100 mg/kg/day in rats and 25  mg/kg/day in dogs in GLP [ADDRESS_385478] Metabolism in Animals  
In male animals (mouse, rat, dog, and monkey), TRC253  is a low clearance molecule with a 
large volume of distribution (6 -20 L/kg) and high oral bioavailability (79% to 91% except in 
mouse). The appare nt elimination half -life (t 1/2) after an oral dose was longer in the dog and 
monkey (58 and approximately 50  hours) than in the mouse and rat (approximately 6 and 
8 hours). In vitro  plasma protein binding of TRC253  (1 to 20  µg/mL) was concentration 
depende nt and generally similar for male animals and male humans, with the % free fraction 
ranging from 9.2% to 18.3% and 13% to 15.4%, respectively. Consistent with the large volume 
of distribution, extensive tissue distribution was observed in rats.  
After repea ted oral administration, absorption was moderate to slow in the male rat and dog 
dosed for up to 28 days (time of maximum observed plasma concentration [t max] generally 2 to 
7 hours), in tumor -bearing castrated mice dosed for 8  days (t max 4 hours), and in castrated rats 
dosed for 10 days (t max 3 to 14  hours). The dose -exposure relationship was generally nonlinear 
and there was evidence of accumulation in the rat and dog.  
Limited metabolism was observed in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes (human, rat, and 
dog) in vitro . Although TRC253  is not highly metabolized, flavin -containing monooxygenases [ADDRESS_385479]

 80% of unchanged drug recovered in the urine and feces. M5,  a pharmacologically inactive 
phenolic metabolite formed by [CONTACT_313212], was predominant in plasma (9.8% of the 
total drug related radioactivity) and was also present at low levels in urine and feces. After oral 
dosing, 92.9% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine (17.7%) and feces (75.2%) within 
[ADDRESS_385480] in the male rat.  
In CYP induction and inhibition studies, TRC253  was not an inducer of hu man CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 
or 3A4 at concentrations up to 10  µM (not assessed at 30 µM due to cytotoxicity) and was not an 
inhibitor of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4 at concentrations up to 100  µM. 
TRC253  was a weak inhibitor of CYPs 2B6 and 2C19 (IC 50 values of 52 and 97  µM, 
respectively); however, significant drug -drug interactions are not expected at the predicted 
maximum observed plasma concentration at steady state (C max,ss; 206 ng/mL; 0. 41 M to 
2,688  ng/mL; 5.3 M) at the proposed clinical dose r ange 40 mg to 480 mg (highest proposed 
dose)/daily in this first -in-human study.  
In drug efflux transporter studies, TRC253  was a substrate but not an inhibitor of multi -drug 
resistance protein 1, and was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of breast canc er resistance 
protein.  
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
After a single oral dose up to 300 mg/kg, there was no mortality in the rat.  
In GLP repeat -dose toxicity studies, TRC253  was administered by [CONTACT_313213] -Dawley rats (0, 25, 50, and 100  mg/kg/day) and male b eagle dogs (0, 2.5, 7.5, and 
25 mg/kg/day) for 28  days followed by a 28 -day recovery period for the control and high -dose 
groups. M icroscopic findings consistent with exaggerated pharmacology (anti -androgenic) in 
animals were observed in all doses in both species. A dose -related increase in the severity and 
incidence of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD) in numerous tissues was observed in rats at ≥50 mg/kg/day 
and in dogs at ≥7.5  mg/kg/day. Elevated urinary di -22:6-bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate levels 
(a noninvasive biomarker for PLD), positive lysosome -associated membrane protein -2 
immunohistochemical staining, presence of vacuolated lymphocytes in blood smear evaluation, 
and transition electronic microscopy confirmed the occurrence of PLD. Findings considered to 
be effects secondary to PLD were also noted in both species. In the rat, these included vascular 
changes (vascular/perivascular infiltrates) in various tissues at ≥50 mg/kg/day,  and 
degeneration/necrosis in the kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle  at 100  mg/kg/ day. In the dog, 
these included vacuolar degeneration of bile duct and mixed cell inflammation at 
≥7.5 mg/kg/day, and hepatocyte necrosis and portal fibrosis at 25 mg/kg/day. Following the 
recovery period, these findings were partially to fully reversible.  Additional findings at 25 mg/kg 
in the dog were hyaline cast and glomerulopathy in the kidneys which completely recovered and 
necrosis in the bone marrow which partially recovered. Based on these findings, the 
No Observed Adverse Effect Level for 28 -day a dministration was the low dose of 25  mg/kg/day 
for the male rat (Day 28: C max 1,390  ng/mL, area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from time zero to 24 hours [AUC 0-24h] 23,100  ng.h/mL) and 2.5  mg/kg/day for the male dog 
(Day 28: C max 1,360  ng/mL, AU C0-24h 25,700  ng.h/mL).

demonstrated clinical activity by (1) suppressing the rise of PSA, (2) by [CONTACT_313214],  (3) by [CONTACT_313215], a nd (4) in the case of enzalutamide, 
by [CONTACT_313216]. However, the long -term clinical benefit of AR antagonists is restricted by 
[CONTACT_313217], as evidenced by [CONTACT_313218].  
TRC253  was developed to address specific mechanisms of resistance to AR antagonists and to 
meet the medical need of prostate cancer patients whose disease has progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_313188].  
This study will be the first -in-human (FIH) study of TRC253  in patients  with metastatic CRPC. 
The study will consist of a dose escalation phase followed by [CONTACT_171342]. The purpose 
of dose escalation is to identify a TRC253  dose and regimen that can be safely administered to 
patients  with advanced prostate cancer. The purpose of dose expansion is to further characterize 
the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of the RP2D as well as to 
explore clinical activity.  
2.4. Phase 1 and Phase 2 253PC101  Ongoing Study Resu lts 
Twenty -two patients participated in the dose escalation portion of the study and initially enrolled 
at TRC253 doses of 40 (n=1), 80 (n=1), 160 (n=2), 240 (n=6), 280 (n=2), and 320 mg (n=10) 
and [ADDRESS_385482] dose; thus, a total of patients were evaluated at 280 mg 
prior to determination of t he RP2D.  There were no deaths, no drug -related serious adverse events 
(SAEs), and no grade 4 adverse events  (AEs).    
The maximum tolerated dose was not reached .  However, the single  DLT observed in  the study 
of grade 3 QTcF prolongation occurred at the 320 mg dose level and  steady state drug  exposure 
at the 320 mg dose level significantly exceeded the target concentration .  Therefore, dose 
escalation did not  proceed to the 400 mg  dose level and the 280 mg dose le vel was explored and 
declared the RP2D b ased on the lack of DLT and consistent steady state exposures above the 
target concentration.  In general, TRC253 has been well -tolerated.  Three patients discontinued 
due to  AEs: [ADDRESS_385483] compression secondary to disease 
progression , and 2  patients discontinued  due to QT cF prolongation , both of which were 
suspected related to TRC253.   Prolongation of QTcF of grade 1 or 2 severity has been seen in the 
majority of patients and requires serial monitoring of ECGs .

 2.4.1.   Phase 1 and Phase 2 253PC101 Ongoing Study Results – Safety  
Patients have received  TRC253 for up to [ADDRESS_385484] 1 
dose of TRC253 in part 1 or part 2.  There were no deaths, and no grade 4 adverse events (AEs).  
There were 12 SAEs (all grade 3), all considered unrelated to TRC253 investigational dru g.  
There was a single dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 QTcF prolongation in a  patient who 
receiv ed 22 days of continuous daily dosing of 320 mg  of TRC253.   This patient remained on 
study at a reduced of 240 mg  and discontinued the study due to pati ent decision without further 
grade 3 toxicity.  One additional patient with a pre-existing right bundle branch block  dosed at 
240 mg experienced grade 3 QTcF prolongation after 28 days of continuous daily dosing and 
continued on study without subsequent gr ade 3 QTcF prolongation for 12 months prior to 
discontinuing the study due to disease progression.  One additional patient dosed at 320 mg  had 
> 60 msec increase in QTcF from baseline (grade 2) after 28 days of continuous daily dosing 
(cycle 3 day 1) and d iscontinued the trial due to this event as per institution policy.  One 
additional patient  dosed at 240 mg also had > 60 msec increase in QTcF from baseline ( grade 2) 
at his 28 -day follow -up visit ; the patient had discontinued  study  drug approximately 28  days 
earlier and TRC253 was not detected in plasma; therefore this event was considered un related to 
TRC253.   There were no DLTs and no grade 3+ toxicities at the 280 mg dose level, which was 
determined to be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).  Twelve patients have enrolled in the 
dose expansion portion of the trial (part 2).  One patient initiated dosing at [ADDRESS_385485] discontinued due to AEs : [ADDRESS_385486] possibly related to TRC253 study drug in the ongoing

patients (6%) with grade 3.     Other adverse events occurring in ≥ [ADDRESS_385487] 
possibly related t o TRC253 study drug (as assessed by [CONTACT_96517] ) include : fatigue 
(7 patients, 20.59%), vomiting (3 patients, 8.82%), and diarrhea, nausea, and peripheral edema , 
increased aspartate aminotransferase (2 patients each, 5.88%).  All other adver se events 
considered at least possibly related to TRC253 study drug were grade 1 or 2 and occurred in a 
single  patient.   
2.4.2.   Phase 1 and Phase 2 253PC101 Ongoing Study Results – Efficacy  
Two patients have had partial responses. One  F877L mutation patient had a stable PSA for [ADDRESS_385488] defined radiographic partial response one month following dose 
escalation to 240 mg .  This patient was on study for 12 months and discontinued the study due to 
disease progression.  A n additional  patient withou t any AR mutations had a radiographic partial

 activity as follows.  One patient dosed at 160 mg  had a >50% PSA decrease , and remained on 
study with radiographic stable disease for 10 months prior to with drawing from the study for 
disease progression .  Two additional patients dosed at 280 mg had PSA declines as follows: 
30.1% PSA decline in a patient who is ongoing in cycle 8 ; and a 40% PSA decline by [CONTACT_5265] 3 
day 1  in another patient ; however , this  patient  discontinued the trial in cycle 5 due to QTcF 
prolongation (60 msec increase from baseline, grade 2) . 
2.4.3.  This amendment include s a new cohort of 15 patients with sole L702H mutation.  
Phase 1 253PC101 Study Results – Pharmacokinetics   
In Study 253PC101 , TRC25 3 demonstrated  a relatively long half -life (>24 hours) ; steady state 
was generally achieved after 4 weeks of daily dosing .  Plasma concentrations of TRC253 
following 1 week of daily dosing at 280 mg and 320 mg consistently exceeded the target 
concentration  of 335 ng/mL associated with activity in preclinical models.

eligible fo r enrollment.  Any QTcF greater than 450 ms ( on the average of 3 readings taken 
approximately 2 minutes apart for each time point), but less than [ADDRESS_385491] ance of QTcF prolongation as an AE in the database; thus, 
the incidence of worst grade QTcF prolongation across all patients treated was calculated based 
on available ECG data.  All 34 patients treated on study as of the time of this writing had 
available ECG data.  Twenty -two of 34 patients (65%) experienced QTcF prolongation: 17 
(50%) with grade 1 QTcF prolongation, 3 (6%) with grade 2, and 2 patients (6%) with grade 3.  
Two patient s discontinued study treatment due to QTcF prolongation and 1 patient dose  reduced.  
One patient dosed at 240 mg, who had a screening Q TcF of 448.5 ms and a baseline predose  
QTcF  of 463.1 ms , had  grade 3 QTcF prolongation ( mean  of 522 ms ) five weeks after 
continuous daily dosing .  This patient had a pre -existing right bundle bra nch block that 
complicated automated the  interpretation of ECG tracings.  Manual review by a cardiologist 
determined the QT interval was  less than or equal to 480 ms.   This patient continued on study 
without subsequent grade 3 QTcF prolongation for 12 mont hs prior to discontinuing for disease 
progression.  One DLT of grade 3 QTcF prolongation occurred in a  patient receiving 320 mg 
three weeks after daily dosing.  This patient dose reduced to 240 mg  and discontinued the study 
due to patient decision.  One ad ditional patient dosed at 320 mg  had > 60 ms increase in QTcF 
from baseline (grade 2 adverse event) after 4 weeks of daily dosing and discontinued the trial due 
to this event.  One patient  dosed at 240 mg also had > 60 ms increase in QTcF from baseline 
(grade 2) [ADDRESS_385492] dose of study  drug and TRC253 was not detected in plasma;  
therefore this event was  considered un related to study drug .  At the RP2D of 280 mg, 6 out of the

prolongation (7%) and grade [ADDRESS_385493].   The following adverse events might be anticipated: asthenia and fatigue, nausea, 
diarrhea, arthralgia and musculoskeletal pain, hot flush, peripheral edema, and hypertension.  
Other R isks 
This study treatment may involve risks to unborn children therefore patients should not father a 
baby [CONTACT_52304]. Partners of  patients  should not nurse while on  this study.  
Men with pregnant partners and men with non-pregnant  partners that are of childbearing 
potential must agree to use at least two acceptable  method s of birth control , one of which must 
be highly effective , during the study , and for 120 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_201340] 253. The long term 
risk of infertility is unknown.  
Acceptable birth control methods considered highly effective:  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Vasectomy that has received medical assessment of surgical success  
• Sexual abstinence*  
* In the context of this protocol, sexual abs tinence is considered a highly effective method of 
birth control only if refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
(i.e., during study treatment, including temporary breaks from treatment, and for at least 120 
days after sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_201340] 253). If sexual abstinence is the highly effective method of birth 
control used, a second acceptable method is not required.

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101 Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_385495] -in–human, open -label, Phase 1/2A  dose-escalation study in which 
eligible patients  with metas tatic CRPC will receive oral doses of TRC253 . The study will be 
conducted in 2 parts as shown in  Figure  1. 
5.1.1.  Part 1 (Dose Escalation)  
During Part 1 of the study, patients  will be assigned sequentially to increasing TRC253  doses. 
The starting dose of TRC253  is 40 mg once daily in the morning , orally (see Section  5.4 for 
starting dose justification). TRC253  doses will be escalated in subsequent cohorts after all 
patients enrolled in a given cohort have completed the 28-day DLT evaluation period.  Dose 
escalation in Part 1 will follow s ingle -patient dose escalation design until  initial  drug-related 
toxicity occurs per Table  4. When an initial drug -related toxicity occurs per Table  4 or DLT per  
Table  6 in a single patient  the cohort will be expanded according to 3+3 design rules . Cohorts 
may be expanded to include additional patients for purposes of collecting additional safety, PK, 
PD (FDHT -PET), and PSA response data. A single cohort may expanded to a maximum of 
twelve p atients to help inform selection of a MED, as long as that dose level remains below the 
MTD (see below).  
Subsequent dose levels will enroll patients based on 3+3 design, whereby 3 patients will be 
initially enrolled and treated at each dose level. If one o f these 3 patients experiences a dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) during the initial [ADDRESS_385496] been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients experience DLT 
at a given dose level. DLT will ha ve occurred when a patient has [ADDRESS_385497] 28 days of dosing. Patients 
who exit the study for reasons other than DLT prior to completion of the 28 -day DLT evaluation 
period will be replaced to ensure an adequate safety assessment in each cohort. Patients who 
experience DLT who rec eive less than the prescribed dose of TRC253  due to documented 
toxicity during the DLT evaluation period will be considered evaluable for dose escalation 
purposes. At the MTD or MED, up to 12 patients may be enrolled.

 Dosing during the study will occur  as follows:  
• The first cohort will receive the oral TRC253  starting dose of 40 mg daily.  
• The proposed TRC253  doses are 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg, 320 mg , and 400 
mg; however, intermediate dose level s may be implemented based on  safety, 
tolerability, PK, PD and other observations at each dose level  with consent of the 
medical monitor and Principal Investigators . Escalati on to the next dose level will 
occur with consent of the medical monitor and treating Principal Investigators 
following review of safety, tolerability, PD and other observations at previous  dose 
levels.   
• Intra -patient  dose escalation is allowed. A patient  may dose escalat e to a dose level at 
or below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) if ( 1) the new dose level has been 
declared  safe by [CONTACT_313219] , (2) the medical 
monitor has been consulted, ( 3) the disease has not progres sed, and (4) the patient  has 
completed three  28-day cycle s of treatment at a given dose level (multiple dose 
escalations are permitted ).  
The MTD, maximum administered dose (MAD), minimum efficacious dose (MED), and RP2D 
are defined as follows:  
• Maximum -tolerated Dose: MTD is the highes t TRC253  dose at which the probability 
of DLT is < 33% (or < 2 out of 6) .  
• Maximum -administered Dose: MAD is the highest TRC253  dose administered in 
case the MTD cannot be defined.  
• Minimum Efficacious Dose: MED is defined as the lowest TRC253  dose 
administered at which PK, mean plasma trough concentration (C trough) >335 ng/mL 
(623 nM)  with demonstrable PD and efficacy data . In addition, data from FDHT -PET 
scans may be used to confirm the MED.  
• Recommended Phase 2 Do se: RP2D will be equal to or below  the MTD  (or the 
MAD ) and the MED. A l ower dose of TRC253  may be selected  as the RP2D  on the

5.3. Study Design Rationale  
The purpose of Part 1 (dose escalation) is to identify a TRC253  dose and regimen that can be 
safely administered to patients  with advanced cancer. The purpose of Part 2 (dose expansion) is 
to further characterize the safety, PK, and PD of the recommended d ose as well as to explore 
clinical activity.  In addition, the clinical activity of TRC253  in patients  with metastatic CRPC 
whose tumors harbor an acquired resistance to enzalutamide  or apalutamide  driven by [CONTACT_313220] 
F877L mutation (Cohort 1) , a yet unknown mechanism sensitive to TRC253  treatment 
(Cohort  2), or the sole AR L702H mutation (Cohort 3)  will be explored.  
5.4. Starting Dose Rationale  
The TRC253  starting dose for this study is 40 mg once daily in the morning . This TRC253  
starting dose  is less than the sa fe starting dose  according to Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) guidelines for oncology agents in cancer patients, using nonclinical safety data.  
The selection of the TRC253  starting dose is supported by  [CONTACT_313221]. In the rat, the severely toxic TRC253  dose in 10% of the rats 
(STD10) was determined to be 100 mg/kg. The human equivalent dose (HED) was calculated by 
[CONTACT_313222]253  dose to the body surface area. A default safety factor o f 10 was 
applied to provide a margin of safety for protection of human patients  relative to STD10 and a 
TRC253  dose of 60 mg/m2 was determined. In consequence, for a human with a surface area of 
1.[ADDRESS_385501] of 
TRC253  on androgen dependent organ development ) to estimate the potential efficacious 
TRC253  concentrati on and plasma exposure  in humans . Applying these parameters, a TRC253  
starting dose of 65 mg once daily was projected to achieve the median target human exposure  
(335 ng/mL ) over the 24 hr dosing interval .  A dose of 40 mg per day was therefore selected to  
provide for a starting dose expected to be safe without causing complete AR receptor occupancy.

 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Study Procedures  
6.1.1.  Trial Overview  
The study is divided into 3 -4 periods: a Pre -Screening Period  (Part 2 only) , a Screening Period, a 
Treatment Period, and a n End of Treatment/ Follow -up Period. The Schedules of Assessments  
(Table  7 and Table  8) summarize the frequency and timing of efficacy, PK, PD, biomarker, and 
safety measurements applicable to this study.  
Adverse events and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_313189] [ADDRESS_385502] dose or patient ’s participation in the study if the last scheduled visit occurs 
at a later time. Follow -up toxicity assessments will be obtained monthly until study treatment -
related toxicities have resolved (baseline or ≤ Grade 1) or are deemed irreversible . 
6.1.2.  Pre-Screening Period  (Part 2 Only)  
Blood samples will be collected and screened  for LBD mutations of the AR using a ctDNA 
based assay. Up to [ADDRESS_385503] sign the separate ICF authorizing the collection, transfer, storage, and 
processing of the AR mutation sample(s) for gen etic research. Consent must be obtained prior to 
collection of the first AR mutation sample. Participation in this genetic research is required for 
participation in the study. The status of the F87 7L and L702H  mutation s must be reported on the 
enrollment c hecklist in order to confirm eligibility and assignment to Cohort 1 , 2, or 3 .  
6.1.3.  Screening Period  
Parts 1 and 2:  
All patients  must sign the main  ICF prior to the conduct of any study -related procedures. 
Screening procedures will be performed up to [ADDRESS_385504] dose of drug.  
During the Screening Period, medical history and eligibility criteria will be reviewed and a 
complete clinical evaluation will be performed, which includes a physical examination, vital 
signs measurements, physical measurement s, and ECG. A brain MRI (or if contraindicated, CT) 
scan will be performed to determine eligibility.  
Laboratory tests (performed at the local laboratory) noted in the inclusion criteria ( Section  7.2) 
must be within the limits specified in the inclusion criteria prior to the start of dosing.

and heart rate will be measured prior to dose administration and hourly (±  15 minutes) for the 
first [ADDRESS_385506] ion of  the R P2D, patients  may undergo PET scans using FDHT, a 
radiopharmaceutical specifically designed to image binding to AR.  In these patients, FDHT -PET 
scans will be obtained before initiation of therapy.  Imaging will occur at 1 or more centers under 
their existin g IND and institutional protocol.  
Safety, PD, biomarker, and disease evaluations will be performed as specified in the Time and 
Events Schedule for Part 1 ( Table  7). 
Treatment Cycles  
TRC253  capsules will be self -administered once daily in the morning  from Cycle 1 Day  1 
onwards  (Cycle 2 Day 1 onwards for Part 1) . On extended PK days, no food should be consumed 
for at least [ADDRESS_385507] 2 hours before and 1 hour after dosing.  
Safety, PK, PD, biomarker, and disease evaluations will be performed at the time points 
specified in the Schedules of Assessments  (Table  7 and Table  8). 
Treatment will continue until one or more of the withdrawal criterion are met (refer to 
Section  7.4.3 ). 
Part 1:  Once the first expansion cohort reaches its primary endpoint, patients  from the dose 
escalation phase of the study who continue to derive benefit from TRC253  treatment will be 
allow ed to stay on treatment and will attend monthly  visits, which are to occur a minimum of 
once every 4 weeks (± 2 days).  
Part 2:  Once the primary endpoint is reached in the expansion cohort, patients  who continue to 
derive benefit from TRC253  treatment will  be allowed to stay on treatment and will attend 
monthly  visits, which are to occur a minimum of once every 4 weeks (± 2 days).  
Study procedures to be performed at the monthly  visits are specified in the Schedules of 
Assessments  (Table  8). 
6.1.5.  End of Treatment and Follow -Up Period

Page  58 of 102 according to 3+3 design rules.  Any single patient cohort may be expanded to include additional 
patients for purpose s of collecting additional PK, PD (FDHT -PET), and PSA response data to 
help inform selection of a MED.  
Subsequent dose levels will enroll patients based on 3+3 design, whereby 3 patients will be 
initially enrolled and treated at each dose level. If none of  these 3 patients experiences a dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) during the initial [ADDRESS_385535] been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients experience DLT 
at a given dose level. DLT will hav e occurred when a patient has [ADDRESS_385536] 28 days of dosing. Pat ients 
who exit the study for reasons other than DLT prior to completion of the 28 -day DLT evaluation 
period will be replaced to ensure an adequate safety assessment in each cohort. Patients who 
experience DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose of TRC253  due to documented 
toxicity during the DLT evaluation period will be considered evaluabl e for dose escalation 
purposes.  At the MTD  or MED , up to twelve patients may be enrolled  prior to confirming the 
RP2D . Dose escalation will take into account all available data including PK/PD data and the 
safety profile of prior cohorts, as evaluated by [CONTACT_313225] . 
Part [ADDRESS_385537] of t hree cohorts of initially up to 15 patients  (Coho rt 1), up to 30 patients  
(Cohort 2) , and up to 15 patients (Cohort 3)  to receive TRC253 at the RP2D  of [ADDRESS_385538] received prior treatment with enzalutamide or 
apalutamide. Patients  will be centrally screened for the presence of the AR F87 7L and AR 
L702H  mutation s from a pla sma sample and enrolled into Cohort 1 (AR F87 7L positive) , Cohort 
2 (patients without AR F87 7L and without sole AR L702H  mutation s), or Cohort 3 (sole AR 
L702H mutation positive) .  
Patients  may be moved from a lower to a higher TRC253  dose not exceeding the MTD or MED 
once it has been deemed safe by [CONTACT_313226] . 
8.5. TRC253 Dosage and Administration  
TRC253 will be administered orally once daily in the morning  in [ADDRESS_385539] day (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 1) of a 7 -day 
cycle. During Cycle 1, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a single dose of TRC253 will be 
investigated. Starting with treatment Cycle 2 Day 1, TRC253 will be taken once daily in the 
morning . The original proposed TRC253 doses were  40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg, 320 mg, 
and 400 mg ; and intermediate dose levels could  be implemented  based on safety, tolerability, 
PK, PD and other observations at each dose level following review of dat a with the principal 
investigators at all treating sites.  
While the maximum tolerated dose was not reached, PK exposures at the 320 mg dose level 
significantly exceeded the target efficacious concentration and a decision was made not to 
proceed to 400 mg. Based on review of PK and safety, the RP2D of 280 mg was chosen.  
In Part 2 , TRC253 capsules are taken once daily in the morning  starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 at the 
MTD or MED.  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664

between doses.  
8.5.2.  TRC 253 Dose Modification/Dose Interruptions  
The phase 2 dose of TRC253 is 280 mg daily.  
Dose modifications and/or dose interruptions may be warranted for patients who experience 
toxicities. Patients with toxicities that are manageable with supportive care (i.e., nausea or 
vomiting) may  not warrant dose reduction. For any  occurrence of grade [ADDRESS_385541] resolved or improved to grade 
1 or baseline, then resume drug at the same dose if the event was a tolerabl e grade 2  (at PI ’s 
discretion).  Dose interruption or reduction to 240 mg  is also permitted for grade 2 toxicity at the 
discretion of the investigator.  If the event is grade 3 or 4, the study drug dose should be reduced 
to 240 mg  when resuming drug administration. F or a subsequent  epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a grade 3 adverse 
event, dose reduction to 200 mg is warranted once patient has recovered. If there is no recovery 
to ≤ grade 1 or baseline after a 21 day delay, the patient should be discontinued from the study.  
Dose modificatio ns or interruptions may be necessar y for liver enzyme elevations. For grade 2 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (>3 times to <5 
times the upper limit of normal), without signs of severe liver damage, stop study dr ug until liver 
enzymes return to baseline values. Once liver enzymes have returned to baseline values, 
treatment may be reintroduced at [ADDRESS_385542] or ALT elevations 
>5X ULN or for patients who meet Hy ’s Law criteria (concurrent elevation of AST or ALT >3X 
ULN and total bilirubin >2X ULN).  
Dosage modification or treatment interruptions may also be necessary for patients with diarrhea 
or nausea/vomiting. Treat diarrhea at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal 
medica tion (e.g., loperamide), and consider treatment interruption if diarrhea continues. For 
grade ≥ [ADDRESS_385543] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] , patient should hold TRC253 until ≤ grade 1 or baseline, 
then may restart at 240 mg . After a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a grade 3 adverse  event, further dose 
reduction  to 200 mg  is warranted once patient has recovered. If no recovery to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_385544] ion. For grade ≥ [ADDRESS_385545] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] - patient should hold TRC253 until ≤ grade 1 or baseline, then may restart at 240 mg . 
After a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a grade 3 adverse event, dose further dose reduction to 200 mg is 
warranted once patient has recovered. If no recovery to ≤ grade 1 or baseline after a 21 day 
delay, patient should be discontinued from the study.

  Dated 30May2019  
Page  60 of 102 Further dose re ductions below 200 mg may be permitted following discussion with the Sponsor.  
Additionally, in Part 2, patients should be considered for dose reduction if they experience 
toxicities outlined in Table  6. 
Dose interruptions are allowe d for a maximum of 21  days; if dosing is not restarted in that time  
frame, the patient should be discontinued from the study.  
8.5.3.  Management of QTcF Prolongation  
If > 60 ms change from baseline occurs OR QTcF > 500 ms, TRC253 should be held and 
electrolytes ev aluated and repleted (if required). Other possible etiologies should be investigated 
(e.g., cardiac ischemia), and telemetry monitoring initiated if indicated. Patients who experience 
QTcF prolongation > 500 ms or > [ADDRESS_385546] rolyte abnormalities 
should permanently discontinue treatment except  in patients who are responding to the drug, in 
whom a favorable benefit -risk exists per the Investigator and where the patient re -consents to 
continued treatment.  Patients discontinued due to a > 60 ms change from baseline OR QTcF > 
[ADDRESS_385547] two weeks and one QTcF assessment after four weeks.  
 If > 60 ms change from base line occurs OR QTcF > 500 ms p atients can be re -challenged at the 
same dose if there were electrolyte abnormalities present during the initial finding of QTcF 
prolongation, and after repleting electrolytes, the QTcF recovers to < 450 ms, and a favorable 
benefit-risk exists per the Investigator .  Re-challenge patients should re-consent to continued 
treatment.   
If there were no electrolyte abnormalities present initially during the finding of QTcF 
prolongation, but the patient is responding and a favorable b enefit -risk exists per the Investigator 
patients should dose reduce  to 240 mg and may resume treatment at th is lower dose after 
recovery of the QTcF to < 450 ms . An additional dose reduction to 200 mg should be 
implemented  for a subsequent >60 ms change fr om baseline or QTcF > 500 ms seen at the 240 
mg dose level .  
While ECG readings at the sites will be used for patient management purposes, an additional 
central read will be performed.  Sites will receive clinical alerts for QTcF values  > 500 ms  and for

9.3. Precautions with Concomitant Medications  
TRC253 was not an in vitro  inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4 or a time -dependent 
inhibitor of CYP 3A4, and thus has a low drug -drug interaction risk as a perpetrator. TRC253 is 
a low C YP-mediated clearance compound. However, strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP 
enzymes should be used with caution in patients  receiving TRC253 . 
Medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval should be avoided when possible. Refer to a list of 
common medicati ons that may prolong the QT interval in Appendix  6 .

12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of 
clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations. For safety 
evaluation time points, see the Schedules of Assessments  (Table  7 and Table  8). 
Safety parameters will be evaluated by 2 different safety committees: the TRACON Safety 
Monitoring Committee (SMC) and the Inde pendent Safety Committee (ISC); refer to  
Section  12.4.  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events that occur between the signing of the informed consent through [ADDRESS_385552] be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the eCRF.  
Adverse events reported by [CONTACT_102]  (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
patient 's legally acceptable representative) during the study will be followed by [CONTACT_313229]  12.3, Adverse Event Reporting . 
Abnormal and clinically significant laborat ory tests should be recorded as adverse events. To 
meet the definition of clinically significant, the test result generally requires a change in medical 
management (e.g., new medication, unplanned treatment, additional tests, etc.).  
12.1.2.  Clinical Laboratory Tes ts 
Blood samples for serum hematology, coagulation, and chemistry will be collected prior to each 
study drug administration  according to the frequency specified in the Schedules of Assessments  
(Table  7 and Table  8). More frequent clinical laboratory tests may be performed if indicated by 
[CONTACT_313230]. Screening l aboratory results must be available to the investigator for evaluation 
before the first dose of study drug and at the start of each cycle thereafter. The investigator must 
review the laboratory reports, document this review, and ensure that any clinically relevant 
changes occurring during the study are recorded in the adverse event section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  
The following tests will be performed by [CONTACT_12082]:  
• Hematology  panel : CBC with dif ferential and platelet count . Iron studies (serum iron, 
ferritin and total iron binding capacity)  
• Coagulation: Prothrombin Time (PT) , aPTT,  Internalized Normalized Ration (INR) , 
and fibrinogen  will be assessed  
• Serum Chemistry: Total bilirubin, alanine tran saminase (ALT), aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, total protein, albumin, 
sodium, magnesium, potassium , bicarbonate, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, blood 
urea nitrogen, creatinine,  and glucose

  Dated 30May2019  
Page  67 of 102 • Urinalysis: Microscopic analysis and/or urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR) should 
be performed as clinically indicated  
• Fasting lipid panel : Total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, high -
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides  
• Thyroid -stimu lating hormone  
• Testosterone, free testosterone, DHT, estradiol, DHEA -S, androstenedione, and 
SHBG  
12.1.3.  Electrocardiograms  
QTc intervals will be determined in triplicate from ECGs taken at time points specified in the 
Schedules of Assessments  by [CONTACT_313231] (Table  7 and Table  8). During the 
collection of ECGs, patients  should be in a quiet setting without distractions (e .g., television, cell 
phones). Patients  should rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes before ECG collection 
and should refrain from talking or moving arms or legs. If blood sampling or vital sign 
measurement is scheduled for the same time point as ECG recording, the procedures should be  
performed in the following order: ECG(s), vital signs, blood draw.  
The [ADDRESS_385553] -party vendor will perform central over -reads of all ECGs.  The measured ECG 
intervals will be used to perform an overall concentration -QTcF analysis.  
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. B lood pressure (systo lic and 
diastolic) and heart rate measurements will be assessed (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/semi -recumbent) with a 
completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements should be pr eceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_385554] in a quiet setting without distractions (e .g., television, cell phones).  
12.1.5.  Physical Examination  
The screening physical examination will include, at a minimum, patient ’s height, general 
appearance, examination of the skin , ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities, 
musculoskeletal system, lymphatic system, and nervous system. Weight will be measured at the 
start of each treatment cycle. A symptom -directed physical exam will be conducted at 
subsequent time poin ts. 
12.2. Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of suspected causal relationship to 
TRC 253 study drug will be reported as described below. Medications administered and all other 
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_385555] medical occurrence in a trial patient who is administered a 
drug or biologic (medicinal product); the event may or may not have a causa l relationsh ip with 
the medicinal product. Examples of adverse events include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs including:  
− Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial .  
− Signs and symptoms resulting from drug overdose, abuse, misuse, withdrawal, 
sensitivity, dependency, interaction or toxicity.   
− All possibly related and unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a 
preexisting illness.  
− Injury or accidents.  Note that  if a medical condition is known to have caused the 
injury or accident (hip fracture from a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical 
condition (dizziness) and the outcome of the accident (hip fracture from a fall) 
should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.   
− Symptoms or signs resulting from exposure in utero . 
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat confirmatory 
test).  
• Laboratory abnor malities that meet any of the following (Note: merely repeating an 
abnormal test, in the absence of any of the below conditions, does n ot constitute an 
adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an adverse event.):  
− Test result that is associated with accompanying symptoms  
− Test result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention  
− Test result that leads to a change in TRC253  study drug dosing not stipulated in 
the protocol,  or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therapy  
− Test result that is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_28132]  
12.2.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event that meets one or m ore of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as a 
serious  adverse event : 
• Results in death  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #43  
  Dated 30May2019  
Page  69 of 102 • Is life -threatening ( i.e., at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent o r significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judg ment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of 
drug dependence or drug abuse.  
Serious also includes any other event that the Investigator or sponsor judges to be serious, or 
which is defined as serious by a regulatory authority  in the cou ntry in which the event occurred.   
Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should be reported as an SAE if it meets the criteria for seriousness .  
The onset date of an SAE is defined as the date on which the  event initially met serious criteria 
(e.g., the date of admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  The end date is the date on which the event no longer 
met serious criteria (e.g., the date the patient was discharged from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28073] -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of an existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], are considered serious.  Any initial admission, even if the duration is less than 24 
hours is considered serious. In addition, any transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l to an acute/intensive care 
unit is considered serious (e.g., transfer from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor or transfer 
from a medical floor to a coronary care unit). However, the following situations  should not  be 
considered serious:  
• Rehabilitat ion facility admission  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28075]  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
• Skilled nursing facility admission  
• Nursing home admission  
• Emergency room visit  
• Outpatient s ame day surgery /procedure  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313191]:  
− Admission for treatment of preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new or worsened adverse event

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #43  
  Dated 30May2019  
Page  70 of 102 − Social admission  
− Administrative admission (e.g. for yearly physical exam)  
− Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial  
− Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g. 
for elective cosmetic surgery)  
− Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures  that are not related to an SAE  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313192]  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, 
should not be reported as AEs.  The medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should  be reported if it meets the definition of an AE (e.g., acute 
appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE 
and the append ectomy should be recorded as a Concomitant Procedure ). 
12.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
12.3.1.  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_313232]. In addition, each trial patient will be questioned 
about adverse events at each clinic visit following initia tion of treatment. The question asked will 
be, “Since your last clinic visit have you had any health problems?”  
12.3.2.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period for this trial begins with informed consent and ends following the 
completion of the [ADDRESS_385556] or study procedures during the screening period, the event 
will be tracked on the Patient Screening Log and the event will be assessed for reportability. All 
events that occur following enrollment, even if the patient does not go on  to receive study 
treatment, will be entered on CRFs. AEs occurring prior to the initiation of the study treatment 
will be considered “baseline -emergent adverse events” and will be recorded on the 
corresponding CRFs.  
All AEs that occur in trial patients du ring the AE reporting period specified in the protocol must 
be reported to TRACON, whether or not the event is considered study treatment -related . In 
addition, any known untoward event that occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the 
Investigator assess es as a suspected adverse reaction to the investigational medication/product  
should also be reported as an AE. 
12.3.3.  Reporting Requirements  
Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_28135]  (see 
Section  12.2.2  for serious adverse event definition) . This classification of the event determines 
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_385557] notify the Sponsor of any AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE 
immediately upon learning of the event. Any subsequent revisions that are made to information 
pertaining to serious adverse ev ents (e.g., change in seriousness criteria, relationship to study 
drug, etc.) should also be communicated to TRACON immediately. This notification should be 
made to:  
Primary Medical Monitor

Office  Phone:  [PHONE_4334] x233 
Cell Phone:  [PHONE_925]  
Email: [EMAIL_437]   
 
Following this notification, the Investigator will report the SAE in the AE CRF via the data 
management s ystem. The initial AE CRF is to be updated with followed more detailed SAE  
information within 5 calendar days  of the event.  
In case the Investigator is not immediately aware of an SAE  (for example, if the patient seeks 
urgent medical attention  elsewhere), the Investigator is to notify the Sponsor immediately upon 
learning of it and document his/her first awareness.  
Each SAE should be followed until resol ution, returns to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline 
status, or until such time as the Investigator determines that it has become stable. Information 
pertaining to follow -up of SAEs should also be sent to the TRACON Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
SAEs  that are une xpected and reported as associated with use of TRC253  will be submitted  to 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , Competent Authorities , and Ethics Committees in 
other  countries taking part in the study, as well as all participating clinical sites in all countries  as 
required by [CONTACT_112103] . Investigators should report to their local IEC/IRB 
as dictated by [CONTACT_313233]’s policies and procedures.  For events which are fatal or life -
threatening, unexpected, and  reported as  associated with use of the investigational product, a [ADDRESS_385560] , a written report will be made no more than 15

  Dated 30May2019  
Page  72 of 102 calendar days from the date TRACON learns of the event. Participating clinical sites will be 
notifi ed of these events in parallel.  
All AEs, including SAEs, are to be reported on the AE CRFs.  
12.3.4.  Recording Adverse Events in the Case Report Forms  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_201387]. In addition, each trial patient will be questioned about AEs. All AEs that meet the 
criteria specified in Section  12.2.1  are to be recorded on patient source documents and on the 
CRFs. AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology  on the CRFs .  
12.3.5.  Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
To report AEs on the CRFs, the Investigator will use the severity grading as described  in NCI 
CTCAE (Version 4.0 3).   
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_313234]. However, the diagnosis term should not be altered to accommodate the CTCAE 
dictionary.  If the Investigator is unable to  assess severity because the term is not described in 
NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 3, severity of MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING, 
or FATAL may be used to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of 
consistency, these intensity grades are de fined as follows:  
Table  10: Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Non-CTCAE Severity  Definition  
1 Mild  Does not interfere with patient’s usual function  
2 Moderate  Interferes to some extent with patient’s usual function  
3 Severe  Interferes significantly with patient’s usual function  
4 Life-Threatening  Results in immediate risk of patient’s death  
5 Fatal  Results in patient’s death  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with 
patient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious  unless it met one of the criteria for 
serious events.     
12.3.6.  Relationship to TRC 253 Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to TRC 253 study drug should be classified by [CONTACT_313235]:  
• Not related:  
− Applicable to those AEs that are clearly due to extraneous causes (concurrent 
drugs, environment, etc.) and do not meet the criteria for drug relationship listed 
under UNLIKELY , POSSIBLY , PROBABLY , and RELATED . 
• Unlikely related:  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #43  
  Dated 30May2019  
Page  73 of 102 − Applicable to those AEs jud ged to be unlikely to be related to the study drug 
administration. An AE may be considered UNLIKELY RELATED when it meets 
at least two (2) of the following criteria:  
− It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug.  
− It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.  
− It does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the study 
drug.  
− It does not reappear or wo rsen when the study drug is re -administered.  
• Possibly related :  
− Applicable to those AEs judged to be perhaps related to the study drug 
administration. An AE may be considered POSSIBLY RELATED when it meets 
at least one (1) of the following criteria:  
a) It fol lows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug.  
b) It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.  
c) It follows a known or  expected response pattern to the study drug.  
• Probably related:  
− Applicable to those AEs that are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related 
to the study drug administration. An AE may be considered PROBABLY 
RELATED if it meets at least two (2) of t he following criteria:  
a) It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug.  
b) It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_191683]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes 
of the rapy administered to the patient.  
c) It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in study drug dose. 
There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation 
of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly exists (e.g., bone marrow 
depressio n, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc.).  
d) It follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug.  
• Definitely  related :  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #43  
  Dated 30May2019  
Page  74 of 102 − Applicable to those AEs that are incontrovertibly related to study drug 
administration. An AE may be assigned to thi s category if it meets at least the first 
three (3) of the following criteria:   
a) It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug.  
b) It could not reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_191683]’s clinical sta te, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes 
of therapy administered to the patient.  
c) It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in study drug dose. 
There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation 
of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly exists (e.g., bone marrow 
depression, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc.).  
d) It follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug.  
e) It reappears or worsens when the study drug is re -administered.  
Causality ass essment should be reported for every AE. Please refer to Section  2.5.1  for TRC253 
potential risks ; for complete reference, please use the most current version of the TRC253 IB . 
Note: an AE could be considered as definitely related, probably related , or possibly related to 
study drug  even if not referenced in the IB if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_313193] a 
reasonable possibility that the drug(s) may have caused the AE. AEs related to TRC253 study 
drug are considered Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR).  
For the pu rpose of analysis, AEs assessed on the CRF as “Possibly Related,” “Probably 
Related,” or “Definitely Related” will be grouped as suspected adverse reactions, and AEs 
assessed on the CRF as “Not Related” or “Unlikely Related” will be grouped as non -related AEs.  
12.3.7.  Expectedness Assessment  
All TRC253 AEs and suspected adverse drug reactions are considered “unexpected” if not listed 
in the applicable section of the current TRC253 IB or not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed and listed in the IB. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would 
be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes 
or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpect ed 
(by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," 
as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as antic ipated from the pharmacological properties of 
the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.  
12.3.8.  Pregnancy  
All initial reports of pregnancy in partners of male patients  must be reported to the sponsor by  
[CONTACT_1758] -site personnel within  24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate 
pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e .g., spontaneous abortion, fetal 
death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are cons idered serious adverse events 
and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   IND 132664  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol   253PC101  Protocol Amendment #[ADDRESS_385561] of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male patients  
included in the study will be reported as noted above.  
Follow -up in formation regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the 
infant will be required.  
12.3.9.  Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or return to the patient’s pre -treatment 
baseline, or the Investigator assesses them as stable ; every effort should be made to make this 
determination by [CONTACT_941] 28 day follow -up visit . Any increase or decrease in AE grade should be 
recorded as a new AE.  
All serious and those non -serious events assessed by [CONTACT_225033] (i.e., 
at least possibly related ) to the investigational medication/product must  be followed even after 
the patient’s withdrawal from the study  until the  event is eith er resolve d, improved  to the 
patient’s pre -treatment baseline  or better , stable  without anticipated future change, or the patient 
is lost to follow -up, or in the case of a suspected adverse reaction, later determined to not be 
related to the investigationa l medical product ; every effort should be made to make this 
determination by [CONTACT_941] 28 day follow -up visit.    
12.4. Safety Monitoring  
The TRACON Clinical Team will monitor safety throughout the study via the following 
activities:  
• Surveillance and reporting of  SAEs  according to regulatory guidelines  as outlined in 
the safety plan  
• Routine monitoring of non -serious AEs as they are recorded in the CRFs  and the 
source documents at study sites  
• Periodic teleconferences with the Principal Investigators to share experiences  and 
ensure communication  
• New t oxicity information that may affect the treatment of patients on this study will 
be promptly communicated in writing to all participating clinical sites and institutions 
partic ipating in this clinical trial  
• There are 2 commit tees monitoring safety across all studies of TRC253; a  separate 
charter  for each committee will define the roles and responsibilities.   
− An external Independent Safety Committee (IS C) 
− A formally chartered TRACON in -house Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)

13.1. Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma samples will be collected to evaluate the PK of TRC253 . Plasma collected for PK may 
also be used for metabolic profiling. Patient  confidentiality will be maintained. For PK collection 
times, see the Schedules of Assessments  (Table  7 and Table  8). 
13.2. Biomarkers  
While the current anti -androgen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_313194], resistance 
mechanisms ultimately develop, which results in lethal metastatic disease. Resistanc e can be 
acquired through alterations in the AR or by [CONTACT_313236]. Since the 
currently available anti -androgens target the business end of the AR, the LBD has emerged as a 
mutational hotspot. TRC253  has been developed to treat patients  with AR LBD mutations, and 
thus addresses a clinically unmet need. The goals of this biomarker plan are to utilize 
FDHT -PET as a PD marker to define TRC253  binding to AR in Part 1, stratify patients  based on 
AR-LBD mutation status in Part 2 utilizi ng companion diagnostic assay, understand resistance 
mechanisms, and measure response.   
For biomarker collection times, see the Schedules of Assessments  (Table  7 and Table  8). 
13.2.1.  Part [ADDRESS_385562] been observed in 10 -20% of patients  who have progressed on first 
generation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  [6, 7]. The five clinically relevant LBD mutations include L70 2H, T877A, 
W741C, W874L, and F87 7L. Importantly, the frequency of F87 7L increases from 2% at baseline 
to 11% in metastatic CRPC patients  who have  progressed on apalutamide  [1]. 
In Part 2, patients  with and without AR LBD mutations will be identified using a ctDNA based 
assay.   A Clinical Trial Assay (CTA) uti lizing highly sensitive BEAMing emulsion PCR 
platform will be used to detect these mutations.   The assay has been validated and CLIA 
certified.  Patients  who are positive for the AR F87 7L mutation will be enrolled in Cohort 1 , 
patients  without the AR F877L  and without sole AR L702H  mutation s but potentially positive 
for a different AR mutation or for any other mechanism of acquired resistance will be enrolled in 
Cohort 2 , and patients positive for the sole AR L702H mutation will be enrolled in Cohort 3 .  
Note that Cohort 1 patients may be pos itive for F877L alone and any other AR mutation.  
The CTA is considered a non -significant risk investigational in vitro  diagnostic device (IVD).

for serious risk to the patient.  
13.2.3.  Parts 1 and 2  Biomarkers  
To determine the frequency of CTC and molecular alterations in CTCs, whole blood will be 
collected before, during, and after treatment for CTC enumeration and molecu lar 
characterization of a panel of markers including AR -V7. 
Serum will be collected from all patients  before, during, and after therapy and analyzed for total 
testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_198295] (DHEA -S), androstenedione, and sex hormone -binding globulin (SHBG)  and analyzed 
locally . 
13.3. Archival Tumor Specimens   
Archival specimens (formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded) of the primary cancer and/or metastatic 
cancer specimen for each study participan t will be obtained, if they are available , to evaluate 
primary response and high -risk markers, including but not limited to TMPRSS2 -ERG, PTEN, 
FGFR, PI3K, BRACA1, BRCA2, and ATM . It is preferable that the entire paraffin block be 
submitted, but if this is not feasible, then at least 10 unstained slides are requested for 
immunohistochemical analysis (sections of ~5 microns are preferred). Samples will be stored at 
room temperature and shipped to a third party laboratory for storage until the time of analysis .  
See separate laboratory guide for further collection and shipment information.    
13.4. Sample Collection and Handling  
The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the eCRF or laboratory 
requisition form.  
Refer to the Schedules of Assessments  (Table  7 and Table  8) for the timing and frequency of all 
sample collections.  
Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples ar e found in the 
laboratory manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples 
must be under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature conditions as indicated 
in the laboratory manual.

will be summarized using the number of observations and percentages as appropriate. 
Time -to-event endpoints will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier estimates.  
14.1. Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations a re as follows:  
• Safety population:  This population includes all patients  who received at least 1 dose 
of study drug.  
• DLT evaluable analysis set:  This set is a subset of the safety population. Patients  
who receive >75% of planned doses of TRC 253 or who had a DLT during the DLT 
evaluation period will be included in this analysis.  
• PK analysis set:  This set consists of all patients  who receive at least [ADDRESS_385565] dose concentration me asurement of TRC 253. This group 
will be used for summaries (tables and listings) and listings of derived PK parameters. 
Note:  patients  will be removed from the estimation of certain PK parameters on an 
individual basis due to, for example, missing PK sampl es such that the PK parameters 
cannot be appropriately derived. These patients  will be identified at the time of the 
analyses along with their reason for removal.  
• Efficacy analysis set:  This population includes all patients  who received at least 1 
dose of study drug  and underwent a relevant efficacy assessment.  
14.2. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study is not calculated based on statistical power but to obtain safety, 
PK, and PD assessments of oral doses of TRC 253. In Part 1, dose escalation,  patients  up to six 
patients per dose level will be enrolled to evaluate for DLT. In Part 2, dose expansion, 
approximately  60 patients  will be enrolled into three separate cohorts for further safety and PK 
evaluation. For example, i f true PSA response rate  is 50%, the probability of observing at least 
11 responders out of 30 in cohort 2 is 95%. If the  total of 30 patients  from this example , if 15 are 
PSA responders, then response rate (95% CI) will be 50% (31.3%, 68.7%) .

Page  79 of 102 14.3. Endpoint Definitions  
PSA Response at Week 12  
PSA response is defined as a ≥50% decline from baseline according to PCWG3 criteria 
(Appendix  2). An additional PSA obtaine d at least [ADDRESS_385566] show ≥50% decline from 
baseline to confirm the response.  
Time to PSA Progression  
Time to PSA progression is measured from the start of treatment until the criteria for PSA 
progression according to the PCWG3 are met ( Appendix  2). Patient  without PSA progression 
will be censored at the last PSA assessment.  
Radiographic Progression -Free Survival (rPFS)  
Radiographic Progress ion-Free Survival (rPFS) is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for radiographic disease progression are met or death occurs, whichever is first. 
Patient  will be censored at the last disease assessment when no rPFS event is observed . 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of TRC 253 will be derived from plasma concentration versus time 
data after single dose and repeat dose, as applicable. The pharmacokinetic parameters to be 
assessed are shown below. Other parameters may also be assessed.  
Cmax Maximum observed plasma concentration for each patient  
Cmin Observed plasma concentration at the end of dosing interval for each 
patient  
tmax Time of maximum observed plasma concentration  
AUC τ Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zer o to 
24 hours (dosing interval) at steady state  
AUC last Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the 
last time measured  
AUC ∞ Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero 
extrapolated to infinite time calculated as AUC last + C last/λz, where C last 
is the last observed measurable (non -BQL) concentration; 
extrapolations of more than 20.00% of the total AUC are reported as 
approximations  
λz Apparent terminal elimination rate constant, determined by [CONTACT_313237] -linear phase of the log transformed

The following requirements should be met for an acceptable calculation of t 1/2term , λz, AUC ∞, and 
related parameters:  
A) at least 3 data points are used in the calculation, otherwise t 1/2term , λz, AUC ∞, and related 
parameters are not assessable;  
B) coefficient of determination (r2adj) is at least 0.90.  
If requirement (B) is not m et, t 1/2term , λz, AUC ∞, and related parameters will be reported as 
approximations.  
Actual sampling times will be checked for major aberrations. In case a major aberration occurs 
for an actual sampling time of >20% deviation from the scheduled time (relative to study drug 
intake), this plasma concentration will be excluded from descriptive statistics in the plasma 
concentration table.  
14.4. Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses are to be performed on data from the safety population, which is the same as 
all treated population. The baseline value for safety assessment is defined as the value collected 
at the time closest to, but prior to, the start of study drug administration. The safety parameters to 
be evaluated are the incidence, severity, and type of adve rse events, clinically significant changes 
in the patient ’s physical examination findings, vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory 
results. Exposure duration of investigational product and reasons for discontinuation of study 
drug will be tabulat ed. 
14.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by [CONTACT_313238]. Treatment -emergent adverse events are 
adverse events with onset during the treatment  period to [ADDRESS_385567] 1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Adverse Event Reporting and graded according to the NCI -CTCAE (Version 
4.03).  
Summaries, listings, datasets, or patient  narratives may be provided, as appropriat e, for those 
patients  who die, discontinue treatment due to an adverse event, or experience a severe or serious 
adverse event.  
Specifically, the following adverse events will be summarized:  
• Incidence of DLT (Dose escalation: Part 1)

Page  81 of 102 • All adverse events  
• Grade 3 or greater adverse events  
• Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
• Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment  
• Adverse events leading to death  
14.4.2.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_154924]. Descripti ve statistics will be 
calculated for each laboratory analyte at baseline and for observed values and changes from 
baseline at each scheduled time point. Changes from baseline results will be presented in  
pre- versus posttreatment cross -tabulations (with c lasses for below, within, and above normal 
ranges). A listing of patients  with any laboratory results outside the reference ranges will be 
provided.  
Laboratory parameters with predefined NCI -CTCAE toxicity grades will be summarized. 
Change from baseline t o the worst adverse event grade experienced by [CONTACT_313239].  
14.4.3.  Electrocardiogram  
Summary statistics will be provided for the ECG intervals and their changes from baseline by 
[CONTACT_313240].  
Exposure -QTcF analysis of TRC 253 will be performed using triplicate ± [ADDRESS_385568] quantifiable concentration or missing data will be 
labeled as such in the concentration data presentations or SAS dataset. Concentrations below the 
lower quantifiable concentration will be treated as zero  in the summary statistics. All patients  
and samples excluded from the analysis will be clearly documented in the Clinical Study Report.  
Data will be listed for all patients  with available plasma concentrations per dose level/Part. 
Patients  will be exclude d from the PK analysis if their data do not allow for accurate assessment 
of the PK (e .g., incomplete administration of the study drug; missing information of dosing and 
sampling times; concentration data not sufficient for PK parameter calculation).

  Dated 30May2019  
Page  82 of 102 Desc riptive statistics will be used to summarize TRC 253 plasma concentrations at each sampling 
time point, by [CONTACT_15994]/study part. Pharmacokinetic parameters of TRC 253will be determined 
using non -compartmental analysis and summarized by [CONTACT_15994]/study part . Mean and 
individual plasma TRC 253 concentration time profiles will be plotted (linear and semilog) after 
the first dose of study drug and at steady state. Analysis of dose proportionality and steady state 
versus Day 1 accumulation ratios will be conducted.  
A snapshot date for PK samples to be analyzed may be defined, if required. Samples collected 
before this date will be analyzed for TRC 253and included in the PK analysis. Samples collected 
after the snapshot date may be analyzed at a later date, and may be included in a PK re -analysis 
when they become available after database lock.  
Population PK analysis of plasma concentration -time data of TRC 253will be performed using 
nonlinear mixed -effects modeling. Available baseline patient  characteristics (demographics, 
laboratory variables, race, etc.) will be tested as potential covariates affecting PK parameters. 
Data from this study may be pooled with other data for the population analysis. Details will be 
given in a population PK analysis plan and the results of the population PK analysis will be 
presented in a separate report.  
14.6. Biomarker Analyses  
14.6.1.  FDHT -PET  
The maximum standard uptake value will be calculated for each lesion at each tested dose level 
and for all lesions. The percent decline in maximum sta ndard uptake will be directly proportional 
to AR occupancy and therefore can be used to estimate EC [ADDRESS_385569] the RP2D . 
14.6.2.  Exploratory B iomarkers  
CTC number at baseline, and change in CTC counts will be descriptively s ummarized. Prostate -
specific antigen changes at Week 12 will be correlated with expression of molecular markers to 
identify novel sensitizing mechanisms. Whole blood and plasma samples collected will be used 
to estimate frequency of expression of resistanc e and high risk markers. Associations will be 
made with time to clinical endpoints and expression of resistance biomarkers.  
The association of biomarkers with clinical response or relevant survival endpoints may be 
assessed using appropriate statistical me thods (e .g., analysis of variance, categorical or survival 
models) depending on the endpoints. Analyses may be performed within the treatment group. 
Other clinical covariates (such as baseline tumor characteristics and patient  demographics) may 
also be inc luded in the model. Correlation of baseline biomarker expression levels with clinical 
response or relevant time to -event endpoints may be performed to identify responsive (or 
resistant) subgroups. Association of biomarkers with clinical response or relevan t time -to-event 
endpoints will also be explored in the overall population. Appropriate details of these exploratory 
analyses will be included in the statistical analysis plan. Results of these exploratory analyses 
will be presented in separate technical re ports.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses will be performed using data from all 
patients  who have sufficient data available to evaluate anti -tumor effects of TRC 253. The 
population PK/PD analysis will us e concentration as a n independent variable . Pharmacodynamic 
endpoints such as percent decline in average maximum standardized uptake value (S UV max-avg) 
from baseline (estimate EC 90) from FDHT -PET, time to PSA progression, and percent change in 
PSA relative to baseline will be considered using non -linear mixed -effect modeling analysis.  
14.8. Efficacy Analyses  
Patient  listings will be provided for effi cacy evaluations including PSA  response rate , time to 
PSA progression , and rPFS.  
Post-treatment percent change in PSA relative to baseline will be reported at Week 12 (or earlier 
for those who discontinue therapy), and separately, the maximal change at an y time on study will 
also be reported for each patient  and summarized using waterfall plots.  
For Part 2, efficacy summaries by [CONTACT_313241]. Median time to PSA 
progression will be determined separately for each of the expansion cohor ts and K aplan -Meier  
curves may be plotted. If there is sufficient data, rPFS will be summarized and median rPFS will 
be assessed. If deemed appropriate, patients  receiving the same dose from Part 1 may also be 
combined  with Part 2 patients .

17.1. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/ Institutio nal 
Review Board s  
This study will be undertaken only after the IEC/IRB has given full approval of the final 
protocol, amendments (if any, excluding the ones that are purely administrative, with no 
consequences for patients , data or study conduct, unless r equired locally), the ICF, applicable 
recruiting materials, and patient  compensation programs, and the sponsor has received a copy of 
this approval. This approval letter must be dated and must clearly identify the IEC/IRB and the 
documents being approved.  
All correspondence and other evidence of appropriate and timely communications with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator/site files. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28078]/IEC approvals should 
also be forwarded to TRACON.  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to relevant  approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that 
event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC /health authorities  and TRACON in writing 
within 5 business days after the implementation.  
At the end of the study, the investigator (or sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/IRB 
about the study completion.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The investigator is responsible for e nsuring the trial is performed in accordance with the 
protocol, applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, and the International Conference on 
Harmonization Guideline on Good Clinical Practice, which supports the application of ethical 
principles t hat have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (see ICH E6, §2.1).  
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The informed consent form language must be agreed upon by [CONTACT_28148]/IEC and 
must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and l egal requirements. 
The informed consent information must not be changed without prior approval by [CONTACT_28149]/IEC. The informed consent form used in this trial, and any changes made during the 
course of the trial, must be approved by [CONTACT_28150]/IE C and TRACON, or designee, before 
use.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to give each patient full and adequate verbal and written 
information regarding the objective and procedures of the trial and the possible risks involved.  
This informatio n must be provided to each patient prior to undertaking any trial -related 
procedure. The patient  will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask 
questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be a ppropriately 
recorded by [CONTACT_106201] ’s personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, 
a copy of the ICF must be given to the patient . 
Each  patient must be informed about her right to withdraw from the trial at any time.  
Furthermor e, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure each patient is  appropriately

the informed consent discussion should also be obtained prior to undertaking any trial -related 
procedure. Consent by a legally authorized representative is not permitted. Should an impartial 
witness be needed, ICH  E6 requirements for impartial witnesses will apply.  
The Investigator will retain  each patient’s  original s igned consent form in the Investigator/site 
files.  
17.4. Patient Compensation  
Patient s will not be compensated for participation in this trial; this will be outlined in the

without written permission from TRACON (except for authorized representatives of the HRA 
and in accordance with HIPAA regulations).  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRF 
data. The investigator will sign off on his/her data per patient. These signatures serve to attest 
that the investigator has reviewed and approved the information contained on the cas e report 
forms and that the information is complete, accurate, and true. At all times, the Investigator has 
final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data 
entered on the CRFs.   
The use of electronic CRF s (eCRFs) to capture study data using automated computerized data 
capture systems does not change the principles and requirements for collecting study data. The 
investigator still retains final personal responsibility for eCRF data and any associated data 
pertaining to it (e.g. metadata including any record of change to the originally recorded data).  
The investigator’s signed approval of the eCRF data serves to attest that the electronic data and 
all of its associated metadata (including changes) has been reviewed and accepted as complete, 
accurate, and true for each patient in the study.  
All CRF/eCRF data must be verifiable in the patient’s source records by [CONTACT_28177]. TRACON will review CRF data as compared to source records in an attempt to 
identify missing and spurious data and notify the investigator of findings so that proper 
corrections can be made. TRACON representatives (monitors and auditors), and regulatory 
inspectors shall have direct access to the original source records in its orig inal recorded format: 
electronic or hardcopy.   
TRACON (or its designee) will perform all data management functions associated with the 
study.  Data will be captured electronically. Automated data verification (“edit checks”) will be 
used to ensure that th e data are logical and consistent. Any inconsistencies will be queried for 
clarification or correction as appropriate by [CONTACT_977].   
18.2. Retention of Records  
To allow for appropriate evaluations and/or audits by [CONTACT_28178], the 
Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent 
forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], source documents, and detailed rec ords of treatment disposition.

Anticipated Event  
An anticipated event is an adverse event (serious or non -serious) that commonly occurs as a 
consequence of the underlying disease or condition under investigation (disease related) or 
background regimen.  
For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events in the 
study population of patien ts with metastatic, castration -resistant prostate cancer:  
• Urinary problems (including but not restricted to urinating frequently, not being able 
to urinate, difficulties to start and/or stop the flow of urine, and pain during urination)  
• Erection problems  
• Blood in urine or semen  
• Pain in the lower back, abdomen, hip, or pelvis  
• Bone pain  
• Edema in the lower extremities  
• Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, rectal urgency, fecal incontinence, 
constipation, and abdominal and/or rectal pain  
Reporting of An ticipated Events  
All adverse events will be recorded in the eCRF regardless of whether considered to be 
anticipated events and will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section  12.2.1 , Adverse 
Events. Any anticipated event that meets serious adverse event criteria will be reported to the 
sponsor as described in  Section  12.2.2 , Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are 
exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases to Health Authorities. However if 
based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event is  possibly related to 
study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner.

Page  96 of 102 APPENDIX  2. OUTCOME MEASURES FOR  CLINICAL TRIALS IN 
PROSTATE CANCER: PSA  RESPONSE ACCORDING TO 
PCWG3  [8]  
• Recognize that a favorable effect on PSA may be delayed for ≥12 weeks, even for a 
cytotoxic drug  
• Monitor PSA by [CONTACT_313244] a minimum of 12 
weeks unless other evidence of progression  
• Ignore early rises (before 12 weeks) in determining PSA response  
• Endpoints for control/relief/elimination  
− Record the percent change from baseline (rise or fall) at 12 weeks depending on 
trial design  
− Separately record the maximal change (rise or fall) at any time using a waterfall 
plot 
− Separately report the proportion of patients  who have undergone radical 
prostatectomy and achieved a nadir less than 0.2 ng/mL and primary radiation 
therapy -treated patients  who achieved a nadir less than 0.5 ng/mL  
− Describe absolute changes in PSA over time from baseline to best response  
• Endpoints for delay/prevention/progression:  
− After decline from baseline: record time from start of therapy to first PSA 
increase that is ≥25% and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a 
second value ≥3  weeks later (i .e., a confirmed rising trend); the requirement for an 
increase of 5 ng/mL was decreased to 2 ng/mL, and the requirement for a 50% 
increase was reduced to 25%  
− Standards for reporting PSA progression date may not indicate a need to stop 
treatment  
• Recording the duration of PSA decline is of little value  
• No decline from baseline:  
− PSA progression ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 
weeks  
• Relate to mechanism of drug and anticipated timing of potential 
favorable/unfavorable effects on PSA, if present

PROSTATE CANCER: RES PONSE BY [CONTACT_313245]3 [8] 
General  
Endpoints for control/relief/elimination  Record changes in lymph nodes, lung, liver, adrenal, and 
CNS sites separa tely 
Record up to five lesions per site of disease.  
Record changes in size using waterfall plot.  
Use RECIST 1.1 with caveats:  
• Confirm favorable change with second scan. Record 
changes in size using waterfall plot  
• Record complete elimination of disease at any site 
separately. Confirm favorable change with second 
scan 
• Record complete elimination of disease at any site 
separately  
Nodes  
Only report changes in lymph nodes that were ≥1.[ADDRESS_385576] changes in pelvic (regional) nodes and extra pelvic  (distant/metastatic) nodes separately  
Visceral  
Use RECIST 1.1 with caveats:  
• Record changes in liver, lung, adrenal, and CNS separately  
• Only report changes in lesions ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_385577] dimens ion 
Nodal and Visceral  
Endpoints for 
delay/prevention/progression  Record changes in nodal and visceral (lung, liver, adrenal, 
and CNS) disease separately  
Use RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_385578] type of progression  
(growth of existing lesions and development of new lesions)  
separately by [CONTACT_313246] -metastatic CRPC 
and metastatic CRPC  
Record up to five lesions per site of spread  
Report the proportion who have not progressed at fixed time  
points (6 or 12 months)  
Note that for some treatments, a lesion may increase in size  
before it decreases  
Nodal  Previously normal (<1.0 cm) lymph nodes must have grown 
by ≥5 mm in the short axis from baseline or nadir and be 
≥1.[ADDRESS_385579]  to clinical discretion, and nonmeasurable  
For existing pathologic adenopathy (≥1.5 cm), progression is 
defined per RECIST 1.1  
Bone Metastatic  
Endpoints for control/relief/elimination  Record changes as improved or stable (no new lesions) or  
worse (new lesions) or resolved bone lesion  
Changes in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute  
progression or regression  
No new lesions: continue therapy in absence of other signs 
of progression

delay/prevention/progression  Exclude pseudoprogression in the absence of symptoms  
or other signs of progression  
At least two new lesions on first post-treatment scan, with  
at least two additional lesions on the next scan (2+2 rule)  
If at least two additional new lesions are seen on the next  
(confirmatory) scan, the date of progression is the date  
of the first post -treatment scan, when the first two new 
lesions were documented  
 For scans after the first post -treatment scan, at least two new  
lesions relative to the first post -treatment scan confirmed  
on a subsequent scan  
 Date of progression is the date of the scan that first  
documents the second lesion

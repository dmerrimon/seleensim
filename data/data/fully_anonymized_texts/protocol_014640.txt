PRIOR APPROVALS: The current study is funded by [CONTACT_211078] (NIAAA).  4. OBJECTIVES* The U.S. Deaf community – 500,000+ Americans who communicate using American Sign Language (ASL) – experiences nearly triple the rate of lifetime problem drinking compared to the general population and twice the rate of trauma exposure. Although there are validated treatments for comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in hearing populations, there are no evidence-based treatments to treat any behavioral health condition with Deaf clients. Current treatments fail to meet Deaf clients’ unique linguistic and cultural needs. Deaf people’s median English reading level falls at the fourth grade, and many have low health literacy due to reduced incidental learning (e.g., inability to communicate with hearing parents, overhear family conversations, or understand spoken health information on TV/radio/public service announcements). Written treatment materials, therefore, require plain text revisions, ASL translations, or ASL narrative storytelling. Equally important are materials that incorporate Deaf values and social norms, increasing clinicians’ cultural competence and enhancing client engagement.   To address these barriers, the PI [CONTACT_441888] a KL2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_418544] a prototype of Signs of Safety: a Deaf-accessible toolkit to be used alongside a widely-disseminated protocol for addiction/PTSD – Seeking Safety. Seeking Safety has demonstrated efficacy for reduction of AUD and PTSD symptoms in hearing populations. Among available evidence-based protocols, Seeking Safety is the optimal choice to adapt for Deaf clients – its focus on simple copi[INVESTIGATOR_494400] (or either alone) is an ideal match for Deaf people’s language and learning deficits, which prohibit use of verbal problem-solving and cognitive processing strategies that other psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_457967]. Yet, Seeking Safety’s client materials rely on written English and are not well understood by [CONTACT_494456]. As such, the Signs of Safety toolkit includes a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494401]-specific client materials (e.g., visual handouts; ASL teaching stories on digital video). It is designed for Deaf/signing clinicians, as well as non-signing clinicians working with ASL interpreters.   Data from the PI’s KL2 Signs of Safety single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n = 13) show significant reductions in alcohol use frequency and PTSD severity from baseline to immediate post-treatment follow-up. Participants also reported high levels of satisfaction with the model, and provided detailed feedback about how to further improve Signs of Safety for a professional-quality, second iteration (See Section 5. d. for more detailed results). The proposed study builds upon the PI’s KL2 work by [CONTACT_57148] a final, professional iteration of Signs of Safety to be used in future efficacy work. Based on KL2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690], we will create a second iteration of the Signs of Safety toolkit, including re-filming ASL teaching stories, re-designing visual handouts, and

 Page 2 of 24 Version 2/13/[ADDRESS_636000] will compare the 12-session protocol of Seeking Safety + Signs of Safety toolkit with an assessment-only waitlist control. Across conditions, assessment will occur at baseline, week 4, week 8, immediate post-treatment/week 12, and one-month follow-up/week 16. We will analyze key aspects of feasibility for both study arms (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment process). Primary clinical outcomes at immediate post-treatment and one-month follow-up are past 30-day alcohol use frequency/quantity and past 30-day PTSD severity. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine potential moderators and mediators of change (e.g., motivation for treatment, provider cultural competency, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], self-compassion, understanding of health information) leading to positive outcome. Results from this study will produce feasibility and preliminary efficacy data to support for a full-scale RCT to evaluate Signs of Safety, and a community-engaged model for conducting RCTs with Deaf participants.  5. BACKGROUND*  a. Deaf people experience triple the rate of lifetime problem drinking and double the rate of trauma exposure compared to the general population. The U.S. Deaf community – a group of 500,000+ Americans who communicate using American Sign Language (ASL) – reports nearly three times the rate of lifetime problem drinking compared to the general population (33.0% vs. 12.3%). An estimated 15% of Deaf Americans meet criteria for current alcohol use disorder (AUD). High rates of comorbid trauma complicate the treatment course for this unique clinical population, with Deaf people twice as likely to experience lifetime and past-year trauma exposure compared to individuals in the general population. While 25% of hearing women report lifetime prevalence of domestic violence, this figure surpasses 50% among Deaf women. This disparity has also been documented for rates of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and child abuse.   Risk for AUD is heightened among trauma survivors compared to individuals without history of trauma – 6.5 times more likely among hearing men with PTSD and 4.5 times more likely among hearing women with PTSD than those without PTSD. Among Deaf people in AUD treatment, 74% report lifetime and 44% report past-year physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, as compared to 60% and 34% of hearing peers in treatment, respectively. Comorbid AUD/PTSD complicates treatment and affects multiple domains of functioning. Hearing individuals with this comorbidity have greater physical and social impairment, higher rates of mood, anxiety, and personality disorders, and increased trauma-related craving (i.e., craving substances in response to PTSD symptoms) compared to those with AUD alone. Deaf people show even greater impairment than hearing peers, with poorer outcomes in socialization, employment, and physical health. Although AUD treatment in the general population doesn’t typi[INVESTIGATOR_494402], given that most Deaf clients who enter behavioral health treatment have trauma histories and 74% of Deaf people in AUD treatment have experienced abuse, it is logical to integrate trauma treatment into interventions designed for this population. 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 3 of 24 Version 2/13/2020  b. Although there are validated treatments for comorbid AUD/PTSD in hearing populations, there are no evidence-based treatments for any behavioral health condition for use with Deaf people. Currently available treatments fail to meet the unique linguistic and cultural needs of Deaf clients. Deaf people’s median reading level falls at the fourth grade, and many present with low health literacy due to reduced incidental learning throughout the lifespan (e.g., inability to communicate with hearing parents, understand spoken health information on TV/radio/PSAs). Written English treatment materials, therefore, require plain text revisions or ASL translations. Additionally, treatments commonly used for PTSD (e.g., Cognitive Processing Therapy, Prolonged Exposure, EMDR) rely on the client’s ability to formulate a trauma narrative – either for restructuring maladaptive cognitions or exposing oneself to triggering content. Due to lack of early language exposure and poor educational experiences, many Deaf adults enter treatment unable to formulate a narrative or report a coherent timeline of events. This prohibits use of verbal problem-solving and cognitive processing strategies that these evidence-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_457967].   Equally important are treatment materials that increase clinician cultural competence and enhance client engagement by [CONTACT_494457], acknowledging Deaf people’s history of oppression, and embracing Deaf people’s identity as a cultural – not disability – group.  Whereas clinicians often adopt a medical view of “hearing impairment,” most Deaf clients do not view themselves as “impaired,” but as members of a rich community with shared experience, history, and culture.   c. To address these access barriers, during her KL2, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494403] a multidisciplinary Deaf and hearing research team to create “Signs of Safety,” a culturally and linguistically Deaf-accessible toolkit to be used alongside an existing, present-focused, first-stage manualized treatment for trauma and addiction – Seeking Safety. Although there is preliminary-to-promising evidence for a number of other manualized treatments for comorbid AUD/PTSD – Prolonged Exposure (PE), modified Prolonged Exposure (mPE), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT), Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure (COPE) – these treatments rely on the client’s ability to formulate a trauma narrative, either for restructuring maladaptive cognitions or exposing oneself to triggering content. Due to lack of early language exposure, poor educational experiences, and resulting long-term language dysfluency, most Deaf adults enter treatment unable to construct a narrative or a coherent timeline of events. Verbal problem-solving and cognitive processing strategies required by [CONTACT_494458]-based AUD/PTSD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920], therefore, contraindicated in the treatment of Deaf clients.   Given this contraindication, our team selected Seeking Safety as the base intervention due to its present-focus (i.e., no need to retell the trauma narrative) and reliance on simple copi[INVESTIGATOR_494400]. Session content engages clients in themes relevant to addiction and PTSD, and to help them learn a specific skill to target symptoms of both disorders (e.g., “Copi[INVESTIGATOR_494404],” “Asking for Help”). It has been used successfully with diverse populations, translated into 12 foreign languages, and aligns with many recommended practices 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 4 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 for Deaf-friendly treatment (i.e., skill-building and psychoeducation, structured sessions, case management, present focus, strength-based work).   Recent studies of Seeking Safety with comorbid AUD/PTSD outcomes are as follows:  (1) Najavits et al. (2018) conducted an RCT with 52 male and female veterans comparing 17 sessions of Seeking Safety with Creating Change. There were no significant differences between conditions. Both led to reductions in alcohol use and PTSD symptoms from baseline to end-of-treatment. PTSD gains were sustained and reductions in alcohol use continued to improve through three-month follow-up.  (2) A 2016 pi[INVESTIGATOR_494405] 24 outpatient military members reported significant reduction in alcohol and drug use as measured by [CONTACT_494459], with both alcohol and drug abstinence among all participants at end of treatment.   (3) Hien et al. (2015) conducted an RCT comparing 12-session Seeking Safety plus sertraline versus Seeking Safety plus placebo among 69 men and women with AUD/PTSD. Both conditions evidenced clinically significant improvement in AUD and PTSD at end of treatment and at 12-month follow-up.   (4) Kaiser et al. (2015) evaluated 12-session Seeking Safety in a sample of 53 German female outpatients with current substance use disorder and PTSD. Among minimum completers (i.e., 6+ sessions attended, PTSD symptoms improved significantly by [CONTACT_124702]-of-treatment, with gains sustained through three-month follow-up. Alcohol use improved significantly only at follow-up.  (5) Myers at al. (2015) conducted an RCT comparing [ADDRESS_636001]-treatment; however, given the small sample size entered into the analyses (Seeking Safety n = 14; 12-Step n = 4), the study may have been underpowered.  (6) Zlotnick et al. (2009) conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_494406]-only among 49 incarcerated women with substance use disorder and PTSD. Neither condition was superior; both showed improvements in PTSD and substance use from intake to 3- and 6-month follow-up. Only women in TAU showed a significant decrease in alcohol use from intake to 3-month follow-up.   (7) Hien et al. (2009) compared 12 sessions of Seeking Safety versus Women’s Health Education among 353 women with substance use disorder and PTSD as part of NIDA’s Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Results indicated large, clinically significant reductions in PTSD, but no differences between conditions. No improvement in substance use was found for either condition, likely due to a 46% abstinence rate at baseline and resulting floor effects. Specific to alcohol outcomes, a secondary analysis by [CONTACT_168656]. (2010) reported that participants with baseline alcohol misuse enrolled in Seeking Safety showed 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 5 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 significantly greater reductions in PTSD at follow-up compared to those enrolled in health education.    Despi[INVESTIGATOR_494407], the PI’s secondary analysis of NIDA CTN data found that, among women with physical disabilities, those treated with Seeking Safety experienced sustained reductions in PTSD symptoms while women in Women’s Health Education experienced full PTSD recurrence by 12-month follow-up. Changes in AUD over time could not be investigated, as the majority of the sample reported no baseline alcohol use. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_419120], our analysis provided preliminary support that Seeking Safety might be an engaging and effective approach for individuals with disabilities, including Deaf individuals.   d. Results from the PI’s KL2 single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_494408]-treatment. Participants in the Signs of Safety single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n = 13) reported high levels of satisfaction, supported by a 23% attrition rate (3/13), lower than the average rate of 27% observed in addiction longitudinal studies. Reported reasons for attrition were lack of interest, readiness, or motivation to engage in the study protocol. Our attrition rate is especially noteworthy given that participants retained in treatment completed the full 25-session treatment protocol and end-of-treatment assessment. 8 participants (61.5%) became abstinent or evidenced clinically meaningful reduction in percent days of alcohol use by [CONTACT_57627]. Participants also exhibited a 10-point mean reduction on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a clinically meaningful improvement on this measure.    Pi[INVESTIGATOR_494409]. Suggestions included, but are not limited to: revised ASL translations of certain recovery concepts; specific plot changes in the ASL Teaching Stories to better reflect the process of recovery from AUD and PTSD; changing gender of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494410]; and inclusion of greater diversity with respect to age and sexual orientation of ASL Teaching Story characters. Our proposed aims will, therefore, build upon the PI’s KL2 work by [CONTACT_57148] a final, professional iteration of Signs of Safety, training study clinicians, and moving this behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494411] a two-arm feasibility and pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].   6. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA* We aim to enroll [ADDRESS_636002] that 45 of 60 participants (conservative retention rate of 75%) will complete end-of-treatment assessment.   Inclusion criteria: • Self-identification as a Deaf ASL user • Age 18 or older • Past-month alcohol consumption, as measured by [CONTACT_494460] • Subthreshold or full PTSD on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (past-month referent time period; “subthreshold” = endorsement of at least two B-E criteria at a severity of “moderate” or higher)

We will create a professional-quality iteration of the Signs of Safety toolkit (see attached scripts), develop a clinician training program, and certify four study clinicians.

Individuals who consent to participate will then be immediately screened by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_459849]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a structured clinical interview via videophone to determine whether each individual satisfies inclusion and exclusion criteria. Past-month alcohol consumption will be assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. “Subthreshold or full PTSD” will be assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5).   Study Conditions. After enrollment, the Study Assessor will conduct the baseline assessment via videophone. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Seeking Safety + Signs of Safety toolkit, or (2) assessment-only waitlist control. Randomization will occur within each study site and stratified by [CONTACT_547]. The Biostatistician will generate a computerized random number series and place numbers in individual sealed opaque envelopes.

Intervention: Participants randomized to receive the intervention will be provided weekly individual treatment with one of four ASL-fluent study clinicians, based on preferred location and transportation needs. Each participant in this condition will receive [ADDRESS_636006] and study site on treatment outcome.  Treatment sessions will be provided in each study clinician’s private practice office, in direct response to findings from the PI’s NIDCD R21, which revealed Deaf people’s communal fear of academic research settings due to a long history of mistreatment by [CONTACT_494463] (e.g., eugenics) (Anderson, Wolf Craig, & Ziedonis, 2016; Anderson et al., 2018; Anderson, Wolf Craig, & Ziedonis, 2017; McKee, Schlehofer, & Thew, 2013; Lane, 2005). As such, study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494422]. Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494423] $80 a session – a rate that is comparable to the average insurance reimbursement for individual therapy sessions with Deaf clients. Proof of sufficient liability insurance will be obtained from each study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494424].   Waitlist Control: Following the final assessment at [ADDRESS_636007] control participants will be offered the opportunity to receive the 12-session Seeking Safety + Signs of Safety protocol. This [ADDRESS_636008] to receive psychotherapy services through the PI’s outpatient clinic. Participants who are randomized to the waitlist, but express immediate need for services during the waitlist period will be provided referral to non-study treatment options (i.e., supportive psychotherapy provided either directly in ASL or with an ASL interpreter) and subsequently coded as a non-retained waitlist participant.  Assessments. Using measures validated in the general population, we will assess clinical outcomes and mechanisms of change at baseline, two within-treatment time points (after session 4 and 8), immediate post-treatment (within one week after session 12), and one-month follow-up. The Study Assessor, blind to study condition, will administer assessments as structured ASL interviews via videophone. (Note: the Study Assessor will remain blind to study condition until the end of the post-treatment assessment, at which point she will administer a client satisfaction measure that will unblind the Co-I to which subjects are in the waitlist control group.) Any Likert-scale-type questionnaires that are administered during the study interview will be presented directly in American Sign Language; the interviewer will also display a visual aid of the response options to assist participants in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_494425].  Compared to in-person assessments, our proposed method of remote videophone assessment is more responsive to Deaf people’s transportation barriers, financial barriers, and technology preferences. This videophone method was used successfully in the Signs of Safety one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], as well as other previous studies with Deaf individuals. Participants will be compensated

In the control condition, assessment will occur at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 (to approximate immediate post-treatment), and week 16 (to approximate one-month follow-up). Such repeated assessment in the control arm will allow us to quantify and control for participants’ natural change over time and assessment reactivity.  Feasibility measures: We will collect data on recruitment, retention, and other key aspects of feasibility (Table 3). We will augment client satisfaction measures with questions specific to Signs of Safety. All intervention sessions will be videotaped, with 25% (3 sessions per participant) rated for fidelity on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_494464], capture fidelity throughout the treatment process, and evaluate impact of site differences on study findings, one tape will be randomly selected from sessions 1 - 4; one from 5 - 8; and one from 9 - 12. Sessions will be rated with the Seeking Safety Adherence Scale plus the Signs of Safety Fidelity Scale.                 Measures of clinical outcome, moderators, and mediators: Using measures validated in the general population, we will assess clinical outcomes and mechanisms of change at baseline, two within-treatment time points (week 4 and 8), immediate post-treatment (within one week after session 12), and one-month follow-up. We will report internal consistency of all measures in our study sample when administered in ASL format, compared with the general population. Measures of clinical outcome are: the Alcohol Timeline Followback, which assesses daily drinking frequency and quantity for a selected range of 30 to 360 days (we will use 30 days); the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Scale – Brief Version, a 15-item measure of positive/negative expectancies and valuations of various possible consequences of drinking; the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), a 5-item instrument assesses study participants’ self-report craving levels for alcohol; the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item measure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms that is reliably used to monitor symptom change; the Trauma Symptom Checklist – 40 (TSC-40), a 40-item measure of the long-term effects of complex trauma; and the Behavior and Table 3: Feasibility Measures Component Feasibility Quantification Client  Satisfaction - Seeking Safety End of Session Questionnaire* - Seeking Safety End of Treatment Questionnaire* - Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (post-TX)  Treatment  Fidelity - Rates of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494426]  - Treatment receipt (i.e., number of sessions completed, comprehension of session content) - Rates of participants’ treatment enactment (i.e., completing “homework” between sessions) Assessment  Process - Proportion of planned ratings completed - Duration of assessment call - Psychometrics of clinical outcome measures *Measures that include open-ended items for qualitative data analysis.

 Page 11 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 Symptom Identification Scale – 24 (BASIS-24), a 24-item measure of psychiatric and substance-related symptoms and level of functioning.   Given the limited scope of the proposed study and the resulting proposed sample size, we will collect only preliminary data on mechanisms of change and conduct exploratory analyses of these potential mechanisms. We identified potential mechanisms from published studies of Seeking Safety, the alcohol treatment literature, and Deaf mental health literature. Potential mediators are participants’ reported ability to use copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], practice self-compassion, and understand health information. Potential moderators are motivation for treatment and participant-reported provider cultural competency. These constructs will be measured by [CONTACT_494465][INVESTIGATOR_170294]-Efficacy Scale, a 26-item measure of perceived ability to cope with past-month challenges; the Self-Compassion Scale – Short Form, a 12-item measure of self-compassion in instances of perceived failure, inadequacy, or suffering; the Ask, Understand, Remember Assessment (AURA), a 4-item measure of one’s ability to obtain, understand, and remember health information communicated by a provider; the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES 8A), a 19-item measure assessing readiness for change among individuals with AUD; and Patient-Reported Healthcare Provider Cultural Competency, a 9-item measure rating a provider’s ability to interact with patients from one’s cultural group.   Exit Interview (optional). After a participant’s participation in the study is complete, they will be given the option to participate in a videophone exit interview. This interview will be conducted by [CONTACT_494466]-fluent interviewer. The participants will be asked their opi[INVESTIGATOR_494427] (see Signs of Safety Exit Interview questions attached). For example, participants will be asked questions about their experience of participating in the research study, including logistics, accessibility, communication, and technology. The exit interview will take approximately 60 minutes. Participants will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_636009] if they choose to participant in the exit interview.  12.

For quantitative feasibility outcomes, we will calculate descriptive statistics for the overall sample and separated by [CONTACT_2939]: mean number of participants screened and enrolled per week; rate of retention; clinician treatment fidelity (rates of integrity, rates of differentiation); participant adherence (number of sessions completed, rates of between-session homework completion); and assessment process (proportion of assessments completed, mean duration of assessment calls). We will compare retention, fidelity, and adherence between the two treatment conditions using chi-square and t-tests.    Precision of rate estimation: Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690], we anticipate at least [ADDRESS_636011]-attrition sample size and retention rate.   For qualitative feasibility outcomes, open-ended responses to the End of Session and End of Treatment Questionnaires will be analyzed in ATLAS.ti for themes regarding satisfaction with each study arm (e.g., What comments or suggestions do you have about today’s session?, How could this treatment be more helpful to you?). We will use an iterative, grounded theory approach employing two major techniques: (1) content analysis, where the number of similar responses will be tallied and described; and, (2) a summary of the answers to questions outlined by [CONTACT_494469] (e.g., What ideas will be especially useful for the intervention?).  Analytic plan for preliminary clinical outcomes. We will compare treatment arms using two primary clinical outcomes at immediate post-treatment and one-month follow-up: (1) past 30-day alcohol use frequency/quantity (from Alcohol Timeline Followback); and, (2) past 30-day PTSD severity (from PCL-5). For alcohol use, outcome variables are: % drinking days per week (i.e., days with 1+ drink); % binge drinking days per week (i.e., days with 5+ drinks for men, 4+ for women); and mean number of drinks per week. These variables will be calculated from daily data collected with the Alcohol Timeline Followback for 30 days (4 weeks) prior to the last drink before baseline assessment, throughout the 12-week intervention or waitlist period, and throughout the one-month follow up period. Such a weekly measure will allow for estimation of changes per weekly intervention session in the experimental condition as compared to waitlist control.   Our initial unadjusted group comparisons at immediate post-treatment/week 12 and at the end of the one-month follow-up period/week [ADDRESS_636012] (or Wilcoxon non-parametric test, depending on the outcome distribution). Below, we describe models for analyzing adjusted group differences and for analyzing the longitudinal data. We acknowledge that, with the small sample size of this feasibility study, the following models may be optimistic in terms of their capability to reliably estimate and to test interactions. However, they will provide insight into possible effect sizes for planning the larger clinical trial.  We will first compare differences in weekly drinking between the two study conditions at pre-, during, and post- intervention periods using mixed effects models (Model 1):  
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 13 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 Y = b0 + b1*int_pr + b2*fu_pr + b3*e + b4*int_pr*e+ b5*fu_pr*e + other predictors (p_chars, c_chars, clinician, study site, etc.) + random effects  Where: Y = alcohol use dependent variable; int_pr = 1 for intervention period, = 0 otherwise; fu_pr = 1 for follow-up period, = 0 otherwise; e = 1 for experimental arm, = 0 for control arm; p_chars are participant characteristics (e.g, age, gender); c_chars are clinician characteristics (e.g, age, gender); clinician indicators will capture differences in clinician approaches; and, study site indicators will capture differences in location of intervention delivery. Random effects (i.e., participants) will account for unmeasured participant characteristics.  We will examine the linear time trend of intervention effects using interrupted time series analysis (Model 2):  Y = a0 + a1*wk + a2*int_pr + a3*wk_aft + a4*e + a5*wk*e + a6*int_pr*e + a7*wk_aft*e + other predictors (p_chars, c_chars, clinician, study site, etc.) + random effects  Where: Y = alcohol use dependent variable; wk = week number starting with [ADDRESS_636013] week of data collection; int_pr = 1 for intervention period, = 0 otherwise;  wk_aft = # of week after the intervention starts; e = 1 for experimental arm, = 0 for control arm; and other predictors and random effects as defined in Model 1. Both models will include multilevel clustering to account for repeated measures from the same participant, as well as correlation among participants receiving intervention in the same study site.   For PTSD symptoms, the primary outcome is past 30-day total symptom severity on the PCL-5. We will compare study conditions on the PCL-5 total symptom severity score at each time point using a mixed effects model (Model 3). Fixed effects are: study condition (experimental vs. control), time point (four indicator variables with baseline as the reference group), and interaction of study condition and time point. Similar to Models [ADDRESS_636014] for participant and clinician characteristics; within-clinician, within-site, and repeated measures correlation; and random effects (i.e., unmeasured participant characteristics).   Sample size and power calculation: Our proposed sample size is based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_494428]. A clinically significant effect should be used for planning a future full-scale RCT. For example, a clinically significant change score for the PCL-[ADDRESS_636015] 80% power to detect a large effect size (0.80) comparing two means using a two independent sample t-test for the unadjusted group comparisons. To detect a smaller effect size (e.g., clinically significant effect size of 0.47), a larger sample size would be needed, but is not feasible due to the scope of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]. We used the unadjusted t-test for the power calculations due to the largely unknown assumptions required to calculate the power for a mixed effects model; however, the mixed effects models will have more power than the unadjusted t-test due to the partitioning of the variance among the various components.   Analytic plan for potential mechanisms of change. We will examine potential moderators and mediators of intervention effects. We will compare the two treatment arms on these variables at 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 14 of 24 Version 2/13/[ADDRESS_636016] of moderators/mediators, we will follow the approach of Kraemer et al., as described below, and will classify baseline factors (e.g., stable patient characteristics, motivation for treatment, perceived provider cultural competency) as moderators and factors that may be related to the intervention as mediators, such as copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], self-compassion, and understanding of health information.  In the mixed effects models, we will include the individual mediator (or moderator) as well as the treatment*mediator (or moderator) interaction term. We will maintain the hierarchy of the interaction and main effect, so that the main effect will stay in the model regardless of its significance if the interaction shows a significant effect. The interpretation of the treatment*mediator interaction is that the treatment has a differential effect on the outcome through the mediator; for example, participants who understood more of the health information presented during the intervention may have a different response to the treatment than those who understood less. In the case of moderators, the interaction would indicate a differential treatment effect in various subgroups of patients. The interpretation of the model will vary depending on whether the main effects are significant (and which ones) and whether the interaction is significant (with or without significant main effects). Because of the sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], we cannot power the study to identify significant interactions (except for large effects), but can use the interaction effect size to better plan for future efforts.  14. PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS*  The PI, Co-I/AUD Research Consultant, and Biostatistician will monitor individual data over the course of the study to identify any participants who may need additional intervention. Frequency and quantity of weekly alcohol and drug use will be collected at the beginning of each session during the structured check-in process. PTSD symptoms will be collected at baseline, after session 4, after session 8, immediate post-treatment, and one-month post-treatment follow-up. Suicidal thoughts, plans, or intent will be assessed at the beginning of each session during the structured check-in if the participant reports feelings of depression, as well as at baseline, after session 4, after session 8, immediate post-treatment, and one-month post-treatment follow-up if the participant endorses suicidal ideation during clinical outcome assessments. Additionally, there is a check-out process at the end of each session (part of the manualized Seeking Safety/Signs of Safety protocol) that asks participants what they got out of the session and if any problems arose for them, and participants complete an end-of-session satisfaction questionnaire that assesses any points of dissatisfaction about the session.   After each assessment time point, the PI, Co-I/AUD Research Consultant, and Biostatistician will review data to ascertain if any particular participants are reporting significant clinical deterioration (i.e., “clinically meaningful” increase of 10+ points on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, increase in AUD category of severity based on DSM-5 criteria). Should a participant be identified as experiencing significantly worsening distress over the course of the study, the PI, Co-I/AUD Research Consultant, and Biostatistician will determine appropriate course of action (e.g., withdrawal from study and referral to outside treatment). Once stabilized, the participant would have the option to return to our study.   
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 15 of 24 Version 2/13/[ADDRESS_636017] the option to return to our study.    Should a participant arrive at a study session under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the study clinician will be trained to discontinue the session, reschedule the visit for a later date, and work with the participant to arrange safe transport home (e.g., being pi[INVESTIGATOR_494429], taking a taxi, etc.).   Should a participant communicate distress and intent to withdraw from the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494430] a list of [LOCATION_005] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494431]/or trauma therapy and provide services in ASL, should they desire treatment outside of the research study.  Study clinicians and Study Assessor will be trained to follow written protocols and contact 911 in the event of a dangerous situation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_494432]-call phone consultation for less urgent clinical crises. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_494414] a participant’s distress cannot be contained or in cases where anyone appeared truly unsafe (e.g., suicidal intent, threatening harm, or other unsafe behavior). Although it is anticipated that this reaction is highly unlikely, should it occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494415], if needed, will call for assistance.    As the PI [CONTACT_832] a licensed psychologist, in the event that a participant is found to pose imminent harm to themselves or others, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_494433]. Therefore, an additional risk, though highly unlikely, is that a participant would need to be admitted to a psychiatric inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494434].  15. WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT*  It is unlikely that we will need to withdraw participants from the study. Participants will only be withdrawn if they pose harm to themselves or others (i.e., physical aggression, verbal threats). Although this reaction is highly unlikely, should it occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494435]. In the event that a participant is found to pose imminent harm to themselves or others, as a licensed psychologist, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494433]. Available data collected prior to withdrawal will be included in statistical analyses, unless the participant revokes consent during the withdrawal process.   16. RISKS TO SUBJECTS*  There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. There is a potential risk of discomfort or increased mental health symptoms associated with completing study interventions and 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 16 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 assessments. There is also a potential risk of experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. We address each below:   Risks associated with potential loss of confidentiality. There is a slight risk that research records (e.g., assessments, video recordings) might be obtained by [CONTACT_35532]. There is a slight risk that research data files might be compromised and obtained or viewed by [CONTACT_35532]. Our procedures for protecting against such risks are described in Section 26: Confidentiality.    Risks associated with study interventions and assessments. Potential risks to participants include an increase in mental health symptoms while participating in Seeking Safety/Signs of Safety therapy, a known risk of participating in treatment in general, but not a pattern that has previously been identified with Seeking Safety or in the Signs of Safety one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Rather, participants in Seeking Safety are instructed not to delve deeply into trauma details, with the purpose of minimizing exposure and adverse responses to trauma triggers. Additionally, completing study-related assessments may cause potential risk to participants, including discomfort, embarrassment, triggers of PTSD symptoms, or triggers of substance cravings. Every possible effort will be made to ensure the safety of participants. Any adverse events will be reported to the UMMS Institutional Review Board. Our procedures for protecting against and managing such risks are described in Section 14: Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects.   Risks associated with reductions in alcohol use. Another potential risk to participants with severe AUD is symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Study clinicians and Study Assessor will assess withdrawal symptoms on an as-needed basis (e.g., if participants report abrupt alcohol discontinuation) using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar). Team members will be instructed to discuss minor concerns during weekly research meetings; moderate-to-severe concerns will immediately be discussed with the Addiction Psychiatrist, who will be available for on-call phone consultation. Adverse events reports will be completed and submitted to the UMMS Institutional Review Board.   Any serious adverse events, unanticipated problems, or breaches of confidentiality that occur during the intervention period and/or the one-month follow-up period will be reported to the UMMS Institutional Review Board and the NIAAA project officer within [ADDRESS_636018] BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS*  The following potential benefits cannot be guaranteed. Potential benefits to participants include:  • Access to an evidence-based intervention (Seeking Safety) and treatment materials that they may not otherwise be able to access. • Decrease in mental health symptoms and addiction severity. • Increase in safe copi[INVESTIGATOR_494436].  
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 17 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 Additionally, Deaf individuals are often not consulted for their opi[INVESTIGATOR_494437]. Therefore, by [CONTACT_494470], participants may experience increased feelings of empowerment and self-efficacy.   18. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS*  We will not specifically recruit members of vulnerable populations. We will not knowingly include pregnant women as participants; however, we will not assess participants’ pregnancy status.  19. MULTI-SITE RESEARCH* N/A  20. COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH*  Community-based participatory research is a central value in the planning and execution of the proposed study. The majority of our research team is composed of ASL-fluent researchers and/or members of the Deaf community. We will also hire a Deaf Community Advisor with lived experience of addiction and trauma recovery to provide expertise and input on Signs of Safety materials. See Section 23: Resources Available for more detail on our research team.   21. SHARING OF RESEARCH RESULTS WITH SUBJECTS*  A summary of the research findings will be shared through conference presentations, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and dissemination of SPARC research products- via ASL videos and plain written English products (written in simple, non-academic language and intended to be more accessible for community members). Individual data will not be available for release.  22. SETTING  Department of Psychiatry The UMMS Department of Psychiatry is home to the Division of Addiction Psychiatry, whose mission is to enhance understanding of the causes and consequences of addictive behavior, to strengthen recovery and rehabilitation methodologies, to develop new approaches to treatment, and to share knowledge in the field across the country and around the world. The Division’s current research efforts include, but are not limited to, developi[INVESTIGATOR_494438], treating opi[INVESTIGATOR_494439], treating nicotine use disorder, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_494440]. Current initiatives are intended to produce novel pharmacological interventions for treatment, identify brain regions associated with addictive behavior and inhibitory control, and develop treatments and cessation techniques specifically tailored to individual needs. To achieve these aims, the Division of Addiction Psychiatry collaborates with partner agencies, such as Veterans Affairs, and draws on the rich experience of highly acclaimed faculty members – leaders in their fields – whose 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 18 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 expertise ranges from psychopharmacology, to multiculturalism and addiction, to state-of-the-art psychosocial intervention techniques. While collaborating with our community-based partners and other research and educational institutions, the Division nurtures rising academic careers in the study of addiction and translates evidence-based treatments into clinical care practices.  Another division of the Department of Psychiatry and home of the PI’s research lab, the Systems and Psychosocial Advances Research Center (SPARC), is a [LOCATION_005] Department of Mental Health (DMH) Center of Excellence. SPARC is an internationally-recognized academic center conducting research on the development, implementation, and effectiveness of behavioral health services. SPARC provides a collaborative environment within which to conduct multifaceted research. SPARC faculty and staff are a multidisciplinary team of researchers, psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists, rehabilitation professionals, statisticians, trainers, attorneys, policy-advisors, and persons with lived mental health experience dedicated to preventing the development or recurrence of mental health conditions, and improving the lives of individuals living with these challenges. Research consultation and analytic support are available on a daily basis from UMMS colleagues and staff.   SPARC has a strong track record of NIH funding, long-standing partnerships with many national foundations, and is deeply committed to state and local issues – as evidenced by [CONTACT_494471]. In FY 2016, SPARC leveraged [LOCATION_005] DMH-supported infrastructure into over $9.8 million in external funding for research, training, and services. Some examples of our areas of expertise include clubhouses through the Program for Clubhouse Research, vocational rehabilitation models, parenting and mental health, women’s perinatal mental health, integrated care, multicultural research, and wellness, including tobacco cessation and mindfulness-based interventions. Additionally, SPARC has strong ties in the UMMS Department of Psychiatry with colleagues in the Divisions of Child/Adolescent and Addiction Psychiatry, the Center for Comparative Neuroimaging, and the National Center on Homelessness among Veterans. Their partnerships also extend to Commonwealth Medicine, several other UMMS departments, and the UMass [LOCATION_011] and Lowell campuses.  SPARC encourages and supports lived experience and multicultural voice in all SPARC activities, and contributes to the development of dissemination strategies and products targeted to diverse users. National dissemination activities have grown to include a newsletter, issue briefs available via email and on the SPARC website, and two eJournals available through the Lamar Soutter Library institutional repository web site. SPARC leads efforts to disseminate evidence-based practices and information on the latest mental health research; engage academics, providers, and individuals with lived mental health experience in a dialogue about research and evaluation; and assist faculty and staff in conducting clinical research and developi[INVESTIGATOR_494441]. SPARC is particularly focused on non-traditional translation of academic research, both in target audience (i.e., individuals with lived experience of utilizing mental health services and their families) and mechanism (i.e., user-friendly web-based platforms that are accessible to individuals with severe mental illness). This infrastructure provides the platform for knowledge translation activities that actively engage individuals with severe mental illness, providers and researchers.

 Page 19 of 24 Version 2/13/[ADDRESS_636019] in Shrewsbury, MA. The SPARC space includes offices, break rooms, and both small and large conference rooms. The space is clean, modern, handicap-accessible and facilitates teamwork and efficiency among SPARC faculty and staff and our collaborators. SPARC’s computer hardware and software equipment are located in this space and SPARC employees utilize restricted access UMMS servers encrypted with password protection that can be accessed both on site and remotely (Note: When the camcorder SD card is full, study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494442] a password-protected lock box and mail to UMMS research staff using UPS Next Day Air shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Research staff will then download and store the data onto our secure, encrypted drive at UMMS.) PCs are equipped with data management programs (e.g., Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, EndNote) for data coding and storage, statistical and qualitative data analysis software (e.g., SAS, SPSS, N6, STATA), and desktop publishing programs (e.g., Adobe PhotoShop, Quark Express, Microsoft Publisher) for use in knowledge dissemination. SPARC and UMMS provide our faculty access to the full range of telecommunication methods, including web-based video-conferencing options and wireless accessibility.  Department of Quantitative Health Sciences The UMMS Department of Quantitative Health Sciences (QHS) is the newest UMMS department and was conceptualized by [CONTACT_494472] [ADDRESS_636020]. Jeroan Allison. Drs. Kiefe and Allison are nationally-known quantitative scientists who were previously at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Since establishing the Department in 2009, four senior researchers have also been recruited to lead the Divisions of the QHS: [CONTACT_494478] (Biostatistics and Health Services Research), [CONTACT_494479] (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]), [CONTACT_494480] (Health Informatics and Implementation Science), and [CONTACT_494481] (Outcomes Measurement). The Department has a complement of approximately [ADDRESS_636021] managers, biostatisticians, and data analysts. Our Biostatistician is Research Professor in QHS and the Director of the UMass Quantitative Methods Core.  The vision of QHS is to contribute to the health of populations and individuals and to the transformation of health care through methodological innovation. In particular, QHS will become a premier nationally and internationally recognized resource for T2/T3 research, while contributing to UMMS's prominence in T1 research. This includes not only bringing basic science progress to fruition for individual patient-level and population health, but also, in a truly bidirectional fashion, allowing T2/T3 research to suggest lines of basic science research with the potential to fill important knowledge and health care gaps.   The Mission of QHS is (a) to fulfill the quantitative health science needs of the academic medical center to become a leader in clinical and translational research; (b) to weave service to the academic medical center into discovery of new approaches to address the health care needs of the Nation; and (c) to train the next generation of scientists to fulfill the Vision. QHS also houses the Quantitative Methods Core, led by [CONTACT_494473]. The Quantitative Methods Core provides integrated services for study design, development of measurement tools, study logistics, data collection, data management, and data analysis expertise for clinical and 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 Page 20 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 translational researchers at UMMS. QHS is housed in the newly-completed Albert Sherman Center, a state-of-the-art biomedical facility that was designed around QHS’ needs.   Clinician Private Practices in [LOCATION_005] We will recruit and train four ASL-fluent study clinicians with private practices located in Eastern [LOCATION_005], Central [LOCATION_005], and Western [LOCATION_005] (for participant convenience). Treatment sessions will be provided in each study clinician’s private practice office, in direct response to findings from the PI’s NIDCD R21, which revealed Deaf people’s communal fear of academic research settings due to a long history of mistreatment by [CONTACT_494463] (e.g., eugenics) (Anderson, Wolf Craig, & Ziedonis, 2016; Anderson et al., 2018; Anderson, Wolf Craig, & Ziedonis, 2017; McKee, Schlehofer, & Thew, 2013; Lane, 2005). As such, study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494443]. Proof of sufficient liability insurance will be obtained from each study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494444].

 Page 21 of 24 Version 2/13/2020 Fidelity Consultant: The Fidelity Consultant will be responsible for conducting fidelity ratings for the study. Qualifications include certification in Seeking Safety fidelity rating.  Study Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]: Four ASL-fluent study clinicians independently licensed in [LOCATION_005] will provide treatment sessions to participants within their own private practice. Clinicians will take on professional liability for all the cases, which will be seen in their own psychotherapy offices. Proof of sufficient liability insurance and will be obtained from each study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494444].  Deaf Community Advisor: The Deaf Community Advisor (DCA) is a member of the Deaf community with lived experience of recovery from trauma and addiction as well as experience working with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494447]. The DCA will provide consultation and feedback on Signs of Safety toolkit and create recruitment materials. The DCA will not have contact [CONTACT_494474].     PTSD Research Consultant: The PTSD Research Consultant will not have contact [CONTACT_494474].  Exit Interviewer: The Exit Interviewer will conduct optional exit interviews that take place after all study procedures are completed. The exit interview will focus on participants’ experience the research study, including logistics, accessibility, communication, and technology.  All study staff will be CITI trained and either added to the Project Personnel tab in eIRB or submitted to the IRB office with HRP-215 Non-UMass Personnel Form.  24. LOCAL RECRUITMENT METHODS  We will recruit participants using ASL YouTube videos and plain English flyers disseminated on Deaf listservs (e.g., MassDeafCare, MassDeafTerp), Deaf Facebook groups (e.g., The Voice of the Deaf Community in MA, MA Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, MA State Association of the Deaf), and sent to local Deaf-specialized agencies (e.g., Center for Living & Working, Deaf Inc., Advocates, Alternatives, Our Deaf Survivors Center, North Suffolk Mental Health, Northeast Independent Living Program). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_494448]. Please note that recruitment materials for the proposed study (ASL YouTube videos, flyers) will be created using expertise of the Deaf Community Advisor and, therefore, will be submitted to the UMMS IRB as a modification.   25. LOCAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  We will enroll [ADDRESS_636022]-treatment (60 enrolled participants x a conservative 0.75 retention rate), or [ADDRESS_636023] behavioral therapy study - “15 to 30 participants per cell” - and is “based on the pragmatics of recruitment and the necessities for examining feasibility.”

Only members of the research team (except for the Deaf Community Advisor and PTSD Research Consultant) will have access to identifying information, which will be kept separate from participant data. An NIH Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained to protect participants from disclosure of sensitive data, especially information related to substance use, similar to procedures used for the Signs of Safety one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Any breach of confidentiality will be reported to the UMMS Institutional Review Board.   All intervention sessions will be videotaped by [CONTACT_75872]. The video camcorders will be stored in locked file drawers in locked therapy offices. When the camcorder SD card is full, the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_494449] a password-protected lock box and mail to UMMS research staff using UPS Next Day Air shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Research staff will then download and store the data onto our secure password-protected, encrypted internal server hosted within the UMMS Systems and Psychosocial Advances Research Center (SPARC). Video recordings of intervention sessions are for fidelity testing only and will not be used for participant data collection; as such, the recordings will not be transcribed. Video recordings of the exit interview will be used for data analysis only. Any results will be reported by [CONTACT_494475]; data will not be individually tied to specific participants.  All data will be entered into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure, web-based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies.  REDCap is hosted locally by [CONTACT_494476]-based security. The REDCap application resides in an isolated secure network segment designed for PHI, PII, and other types of regulated data. Web-based data entry is via an SSL cryptographic transport protocol. Additional security procedures are in place for data access. The environment logs are audited by [CONTACT_136186]. Paper data will be stored in locked file cabinets in locked offices.  At the end of each treatment session, participants will complete the Seeking Safety End of Session Questionnaire via the web-based REDCap Survey interface using a 32GB 12.9inch iPad Pro that will be provided to each study clinician for the duration of the study. (These iPads will also be used to of show Signs of Safety video materials to participants.) Both the REDCap database and the iPad will be password-protected.  Data will be exported to SAS and ATLAS.ti for quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. All analytic files will be stripped of personal identifiers. Only CITI-trained personnel with appropriate authorization and relevant project need will be allowed data access. All paper records, video recordings, and electronic data records will be destroyed three years after completion of the grant period, in accordance with NIH policy. Individual data will not be available for release.  27. PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF SUBJECTS

COMPENSATION FOR RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY  Prior to the beginning of the study, participants will be informed that there is no available compensation for research-related injury. This information will also be located on the Informed Consent Form.  29. ECONOMIC BURDEN TO SUBJECTS  We do not anticipate economic burden to participants. Our proposed method of remote videophone assessment is responsive to Deaf people’s transportation barriers, financial barriers, and technology preferences. This method was used successfully in the Signs of Safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_494450]. With clinicians in Eastern, Central, and Western MA, maximum travel time from highly Deaf-populated towns (e.g., [LOCATION_011], Framingham, Springfield) to an available treatment site is less than [ADDRESS_636026] informed consent procedures. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_494451] (HRP-802).  Prior to the call, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494420]-approved, written English informed consent form (e-Consent) via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). During the call, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_494452] e-Consent form in ASL (e.g., “What are the risks of being in this study?”, “What happens to information about me?”), pausing after each section for questions and discussion. Individuals who wish to enroll will sign the e-Consent form in REDCap, by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_494453] “wet signature” feature. Rather than conduct informed consent in person, which would require study staff to travel across the state of MA, e-Consent is a newly evolving platform that can be leveraged to overcome these logistical barriers. e-Consent can be accessed by [CONTACT_494477], mobile phone, or tablet.

1.0 Background  
Mycosis fungoides (MF)  is an incurable extranodal, T- cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that 
accounts for 80% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. Affected individuals initially 
develop pruritic  patches  initially  in sun protected  anatomic  sites.  Most  presentations are 
indolent but 20% progress in  a stepwise  fashion from  patch  disease to raised  plaque and 
nodular skin lesions with variable degrees of lymph node, blood, and visceral organ involvement (Wilcox, 2017). 
 
Patients who fail skin directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_674949], interferon, extracorporeal photopheresis, deacetylase inhibitors, methotrexate, pralatexate, gemcitabine, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, bortezomib, and denileukin diftitox (Devata et al., 2016; Trautinger, 2017). These agents  may be combined after the 
failure of monotherapy or rotated therapeutically if toxicity or efficacy limits use.  
 
Patients  with advanced  stage disease  have a 5- year survival of 17-40%, and  ultimately  die 
of lymphoma and infectious complications associated with disease progression after 2-[ADDRESS_912164] clinical activity in MF previously treated with one systemic agent and also in patients with Sézary syndrome (SS) (Khodadoust et al., 2016). 
 
Pembrolizumab is presently FDA approved for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, as first- line treatment of patients with metastatic non -small cell 
lung cancer  (NSCLC)  with high PD-L1 expression, recurrent  or metastatic  head  and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression, and in refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_912165] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer 
tissue  and favorable prognosis in various malignancies.  In particular,  the presence 
of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T- cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
 
The PD -[ADDRESS_912166] hijacked by [CONTACT_70710]. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate 
unwanted or excessive immune  responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 
(encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD- L2). 
MC1788  7 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved. PD- 1 and family members are 
type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type (V- type) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic  tail which  is responsible 
for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 
tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosinebased switch motif (ITSM). 
 
Following T- cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_912167] from that of CTLA -4 
as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971]. PD- 1 was 
shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells. Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T- cells as 
well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors. Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC -like 
domains in the extracellular  region and contain  short cytoplasmic  regions with  no 
known signaling motifs. 
 
Binding of either  PD-[ADDRESS_912168] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD- L2 
protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  
 
PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, 
whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral 
tissues.  Although healthy  organs express  little (if any) PD-L1, a variety  of cancers 
were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T- cell inhibitor. PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor- specific T -cell expansion in subjects with 
melanoma (MEL). This suggests that the PD-1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical 
role in tumor immune evasion and should be conside red as an attractive target  
for therapeutic intervention.  
 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between  PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) 
has recently  been  approved in the United  Stated  for the treatment  of patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
 
1.2 Rationale  
MC1788  8 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
1.[ADDRESS_912169] 
been conventionally divided into skin- directed therapy and systemic therapy.  
Patients  with early  stage disease (patch/plaque  disease without nodal or visceral 
involvement) are treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], topi[INVESTIGATOR_674950], 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775], superficial radiotherapy, and phototherapy. These modalities 
are rarely remittive but may temporarily clear involved skin and improve 
pruritus.  
 
For progressive early stage MF, high risk early- stage MF (thick plaques or 
follicular involvement), advanced- stage MF (presence of tumors, nodal 
involvement,  erythroderma, visceral  involvement), or SS, systemic  therapy  is the 
standard of care. Biologic response modifying agents such as IFN-alpha, bexarotene, or HDAC  inhibitors  are considered first line, as systemic  multi- agent 
chemotherapy provides no survival advantage. 
 
However, the optimal treatment sequence is unknown and there is no clear 
evidence that sequential or step -wise combination systemic therapy is more 
efficacious or contributes to long -term survival or cure. Early/initial use of 
pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced MF is postulated to have a unique 
therapeutic synergy, whereby [CONTACT_674973] -tumor 
response that is subsequently amplified with additional scheduled tr eatments. 
This rationale supports the use of pembrolizumab as initial first line systemic therapy, as the endogenous anti-tumor host response is more  robust earlier  in the 
disease course and is thus more likely to produce clinical clearance of lesional skin. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_912170] been conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab. The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated  three  dose levels,  1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered  every 
2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels 
were well tolerated and no dose limiting toxicities were observed.. Recent data 
from other clinical studies within the pembrolizumab program has shown that a 
lower dose of pe mbrolizumab and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for 
target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to 
IB). Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay)  suggested  that peripheral target 
engagement is durable (>21 days). This early PK and pharmacodynamics data 
provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule. 
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum 
concentration time data from [ADDRESS_912171] a wide 
MC1788  9 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
therapeutic range  based  on the melanoma  indication.  The differences in exposure 
for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab in the melanoma indication. The exposure 
margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety  in melanoma  at 10 
mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher 
dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC an d melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no 
anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of 
pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of 
pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure- response relationships of pembrolizumab for both 
efficacy  and safety  in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W  to 10 mg/kg  Q3W,  3) the 
lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab  (as assessed  by [CONTACT_517942])  and 4) the assumption 
that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed 
dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of 
pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally  consistent  with those obtained with the 2 
mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy 
response  and 3) will maintain  individual patients exposure in the exposure  range 
established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
 
A fixed dose regimen  will simplify  the dosing regimen  to be more  convenient for 
physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors. A fixed dosing scheme will 
also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce 
wastage.  
 
1.23 Rationale for Endpoints  
The proposed primary and secondary efficacy endpoints conform to 
recommended consensus definitions of the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL), the [LOCATION_002] Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC), and the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force of the European 
Organization for Research  and Treatment  of Cancer  (EORTC)  and will permit  a 
relative comparison to other published work using these definitions. 
 
The Primary  efficacy  endpoint will be the overall cutaneous response rate at 
week 27 by [CONTACT_674974] (mSWAT) score.  
 
The mSWAT  is calculated using body surface area (BSA) of each MF lesion 
(palm plus fingers of the patient ≈ 1% BSA) in each of 12 areas of the body, 
multiplying the sum of the BSA of each lesion type by a weighting factor 
(patch=1, plaque=2, and tumor  =4) and generating  a sum of the subtotals of each 
lesion subtype. 
MC1788  10 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
 
Hypothesis: Biopsies  in MF reveal  an abnormal accumulation  of clonal  CD4+ 
helper T- cells initially in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_674951].  
There is also a characteristic anti-tumor host response of infiltrating CD8+/TIA- 
1+ cytotoxic T- lymphocytes in lesional skin. Histologically, the intensity of this 
infiltrate  diminishes with disease progression from  patch,  plaque to tumor  disease 
and has been postulated to reflect the suppressive effects of TH2 cytokine 
production and CD25+ TReg phenotypic induction by [CONTACT_674975]4+ T- 
cells (Phillips et al., 2016; Rozati et al., 2016).  
 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against the 
receptor  PD-1 (programmed cell death -1) expressed  on the surface of activated  T 
cells (Nguyen et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2017).  
 
We hypothesize PD -1 inhibition will preserve and enhance the anti- tumor 
responses in MF through effector  T cell activation  and TReg  inhibition.  (Wang  et 
al., 2018) 
We have also  conducted a preliminary  analysis of PD -1/CD279 expression in a 
representative group of patch, plaque, and tumor MF biopsy specimens and found expression in nearly  all cases;  this finding further  supports the hypothesis 
that pembrolizumab may have value in the management of all stages of MF.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_912172] common presenting morphology (i.e. patch, plaque, or tumor) will be obtained for each study 
participant; at the second cycle (week 6), an additional 6 mm punch skin biopsy 
of the same morphologic  type will be  obtained. Immunohistochemistry will then 
be used to assess the levels of CD4, CD8, PD -1/CD279, and PD-L1 expression 
before and after treatment with pembrolizumab.

6.0 Registration Procedures  
6.1 Registration:  
6.11 Registering  a patient  
To register  a patient, access  the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) web page 
and enter the registration/randomization application. The registration/ 
randomization application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Back up 
and/or system  support contact  [CONTACT_674976].  If unable 
to access the website, call the MCCC Registration Office at  
between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Time (Monday through Friday).  
The instructions for the registration/randomization application are available on 
the MCCC web page and detail the 
process for completing and co
 nfirming patient registration. Prior to  initiation of 
protocol treatment,  this process  must be  completed  in its entirety  and an  MCCC 
subject ID number must be available as noted in the instructions. It is the 
responsibility  of the individual registering  the patient  to confirm  the process has 
been successfully completed prior to release of the study agent. Patient registration via the registration/randomization application can be confirmed in 
any of the following ways: 
• Contact [CONTACT_128743]  I
 f the patient 
was fully  registered,  the MCCC Registration  Office  staff can access the 
information from the centralized database and confirm the registration.  
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section “Finding/Displaying  Information  about A Registered  Subject.” 
6.2 Verification  of materials  
Prior  to accepting  the registration,  registration/randomization  application  will verify  the 
following:  
• IRB approval at the registering  institution  
• Patient  eligibility  
• Existence  of a signed  consent form  
• Existence  of a signed  authorization  for use and disclosure of protected health 
information  
6.3 Documentation of IRB approval  

MC1788  18 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
Documentation of IRB  approval must  be on file in the Registration  Office  before an 
investigator may register any patients.  
In addition to submitting initial IRB approval documents, ongoing IRB approval 
documentation must  be on file (no less than annually) at the Registration  Office  (fax:  
). If the necessary  documentation  is not submitted  in advance of attempting 
patient registration, the registration will not be accepted and the patient may not be enrolled in the protocol until the situation is resolved.  
When  the study has been  permanently  closed  to patient  enrollment,  submission  of annual 
IRB approvals to the Registration Office is no longer necessary.  
6.4 Correlative  Research  
A mandatory correlative research  component  is part of this study, the patient will be 
automatically registered onto this component (see Sections 17.1 ). 
6.[ADDRESS_912190]  begin  ≤28 days after registration.  
6.7 Pretreatment  
Pretreatment  te
 sts/procedures (see Section  4.0) must  be completed  within  the guidelines 
specified on the test schedule.  
6.8 a Baseline symptoms  
All required baseline symptoms (see Section  10.6) must  be documented and graded.  
6.8b Study drug 
Study drug is available  on site. 
6.8c Study Conduct  
The clinical trial will be  conducted in compliance with regulations (21 CFR 312, 50, and 
56), guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH Guidance E6), and in accordance with general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki; informed consent will be obtained from all participating patients; the protocol and any amendme nts will be 
subject to approval by [CONTACT_349651], in accordance with 21 CFR 56.103(a); and subject records will be stored in a secure location and subject

There  are no prohibited  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_323737]-Treatment  Follow-up Phase.  
9.6 a Toxicity  management  for immune -related  AEs associated  with pembrolizumab  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. 
These immune- related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one 
body system simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is 
critical to reduce complications. Based on existing clinical trial data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of 
corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests 
such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of  the evaluation. 
Based  on the severity  of irAEs,  withhold  or permanently  discontinue pembrolizumab  and 
administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in the table in Section 8.1.

For this trial, male  subjects will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they 
have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying 
medical condition).  
 
Female  subjects  will be considered  of non-reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used  to 
confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is  insufficient.); 
 
OR 
 
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_139595]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
 
OR 
 
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner,  respectively,  while  receiving  study drug 
and for [ADDRESS_912210] dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]: 
 
(1) practice abstinence†  from  heterosexual activity;

Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
o intrauterine  device (IUD) 
o vasectomy  of a female subject’s  male  partner 
o contraceptive rod implanted  into the skin 
Combination method (requires use of two  of the following):  
o diaphragm  with spermicide  (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
o cervical  cap with spermicide  (nulliparous women  only) 
o contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women  only) 
o male  condom or female condom (cannot be used together) 
o hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_401115]- only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]),  contraceptive  skin patch,  vaginal contraceptive ring, or 
subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently  employed  as the subject’s preferred  and usual lifestyle 
and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,  ovulation, sympto -thermal,  post-ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
‡If a  contraceptive method  listed  above is  restricted  by [CONTACT_56819]/guidelines,  then 
it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at 
sites in this country/region. 
Subjects should be informed  that taking  the study  medication  may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate  in the study subjects  of childbearing  potential  must  adhere to the contraception 
requirement (described above) from the day of study medication initiation(or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study 
period up to [ADDRESS_912211] monthly  and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed 
or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to Mayo Clinic and to 
[COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic and within 2 working days to 
[COMPANY_006] if the out come is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, conge nital 
anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn). 
 
The study  investigator  will make every  effort to obtain  permission to follow the outcome 
of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn. If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to Mayo Clinic and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as 
described above.

Definitions  
Adverse Event  
Any untoward m edical  occurrence associated  with the use of a drug in humans,  whether or 
not considered drug related. 
Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event  for which  there  is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused  the adverse 
event.  
Expedited  Reporting  
Events reported  to sponsor within  [ADDRESS_912212]  
Events that would  not typi[INVESTIGATOR_647191], but 
that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to  facilitate the 
review of safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]). 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales  found 
in the revised  NCI Common  Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version  
5.[ADDRESS_912213]  access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
 
a. Identify the gr ade and severity  of the event using the CTCAE  version 5.0. 
b. Determine whether  the event is expected  or unexpected (see Section  10.2).  
c. Determine if the adverse event  is related  to the study intervention  (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether  the event must  be reported  as an expedited  report.  If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other  reporting  is required  (see Section  10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms  defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 
18.0). 
NOTE:  A severe  AE is NOT  the same as a serious AE, which  is defined  in Section  10.4. 
10.2 Expected  vs. Unexpected  Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form,  package insert  (if applicable),  and/or the investigator brochure,  (if 
an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general investigational plan).  
Unexpected  adverse  events  or suspected  adverse reactions are those not listed  in Section  
15.0 of the protocol, the study  specific consent  form,  package insert  (if applicable),  or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 

MC1788  31 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
Unexpected also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned  in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class  of drugs but have  not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational  agent/intervention  might  exacerbate  the expected AEs associated  with a 
commercial  agent.  Therefore,  if an expected  AE (for the commercial  agent)  occurs  with a 
higher degree of severity  or specificity,  expedited  reporting is required. 
NOTE:  *The consent form  may contain  study specific information  at the discretion  of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refer to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution  to agent(s)  or procedure  
When  assessing  whether  an adverse event  (AE)  is related  to a medical  agent(s)  medical  or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unrelated  - The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the agent(s)/procedure.  
10.31 EXPECTED  Serious  Adverse Events:  Protocol  Specific  Exceptions  to 
Expedited Reporting  
For this protocol  only, the following  Adverse  Events/Grades  are expected  to occur 
within  this population and do not require  Expedited Reporting. These events  must still 
be reported  via Routine  Reporting (see Section  10.6).*  
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction  (at your study site) over  that which  is listed  in the protocol  or 
investigator brochure as an expedited event. 
*Report an  expected  event  that is greater  in severity  or specificity  than expected 
as an expedited event.  
*Specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting should be reported 
expeditiously by [CONTACT_674977].

Unanticipated  Problems Involving Risks to  Subjects or  Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) in 

MC1788  34 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
 general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
MC1788  35 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
 1. Unexpected (in terms  of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the  
MC1788  36 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
IRB-approved research  protocol and informed  consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related  or possibly related  to participation  in the research  (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and 
3. Suggests that the research  places subjects  or others at a greater  risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the 
physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place  subjects or others  at increased  risk of harm,  but no 
harm occurs. 
Note: If there is no language in the protocol indicating that pregnancy is not 
considered  an adverse  experience for this trial, and if the consent form  does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pregnant/impregnate others, then any 
pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously 
reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the 
study should be reported a s a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845].  
Mayo Clinic  Cancer Center (MCCC)  Institutions:  
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable Event/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845], provide the appropriate documentation and use the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Expedited Event Report form 
 
Th
e Mayo C linic  Compliance Unit will 
review and process the submission to the Mayo Clinic IRB and work with the IN
D Coordinator for submission to FDA. 

MC1788  37 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
10.52  Death  
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless  as noted  below.  Attribution  to treatment  or 
other cause must be provided.  
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_912219] dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND requires expedited reporting within 24- 
hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND requires expedited 
reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death  
• Death  attributable  to a CTCAE  term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128746] 28 days of life. 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• D eath  due to progressive disease that cannot be attributed  to a CTCAE  term 
associated with Grade 5 should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease  
progression” under the system organ class (SOC)  of General disorders and  
administration site conditions. Evidence that the death was a manifestation  
of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process)  
should be submitted. 
10.53  Secondary Malignancy  
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer  caused  by [CONTACT_674978] a previous 
malignancy  (e.g., treatment  with investigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary  malignancy is not considered a metastasis  of 
the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary  malignancies that occur  following  treatment  with an agent  under 
an IND will be reported. Three  options are available to describe the event:  
o Leukemia secondary  to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  
o Treatment -related  secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy  possibly related  to cancer  treatment  (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported  via the routine reporting mechanisms  outlined  in each 
protocol.  
10.54  Second Malignancy  
A second  malignancy is one unrelated  to the treatment  of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT  a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require  ONLY 
routine reporting unless otherwise  specified.  
MC1788  38 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
10.[ADDRESS_912220] (or female partner of a male subject) taking investigational 
product becomes pregnant, the subject taking should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female should be advised to call her healthcare provider 
immediately.  The patient  should have  appropriate follow -up as deemed  necessary 
by [CONTACT_140711]. If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, a second expedited report is required. 
Prior  to obtaining private information  about a pregnant woman  and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
form will need to be submitted to the IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obtained, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion, the mother  is the patient.  In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient.  
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for “Pregnancy”,  “Pregnancy  loss”,  or “Neonatal  loss”,  the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical 
documentation. Include this form: 
 
 
10.551 Pregnancy  
P
regnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is 
known. 
10.552 Fetal  Death  
Fetal death  is defined  in CTCAE  as “A  disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128747]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516],  heartbeat,  or definite  movement of a voluntary  muscle  after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.” 
Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy  loss)”  under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. 
10.553 Death  Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_674979] 28 days of life” that is felt by 
[CONTACT_454514]/intervention, should be reported expeditiously.  
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “General disorders  and administration  - Other  (neonatal loss)” 
under the General disorders and administration SOC.

10.[ADDRESS_912221] be reported by [CONTACT_19449]- in or other run-in 
treatment,  if the event  cause  the participant  to be excluded  from  the study, or is 
the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, or a procedure. 
o All AEs from  the time  of treatment  allocation/randomization 
through [ADDRESS_912222] 
be reported by [CONTACT_093]. 
o All AEs meeting  serious criteria,  from  the time of treatment 
allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_912223] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
o All pregnancies  and exposure  during breastfeeding,  from  the 
time of treatment  allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_912224] be reported immediately by [CONTACT_459713] -related.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE or other reportable 
safety  events in former study  participants.  However,  if the investigator  learns of 
any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged 
from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the 
study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify 
[COMPANY_006].  
 
10.82  Definition  of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
MC1788  41 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
For purposes of this study, an overdose of pembrolizumab  will be defined  as any 
dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose). No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, the participant should be observed closely for signs of 
toxicity. Appropriate suppo rtive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated. 
 
If an adverse event(s)  is associated  with (“results from”)  the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] 
product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no 
other seriousness criteria are met.  
 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product  meeting  the protocol  definition  of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the 
terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 
 
All reports  of overdose  with and without an  adverse event must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_912225]  feeding  are not considered 
adverse events,  it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to  report 
any pregnancy or lactation in a participant (spontaneously reported to them) that 
occurs during the study. 
 
Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeeding that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/randomization must be 
reported by [CONTACT_191217], or are the res ult of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited  to washout or discontinuation  of usual  therapy, diet, placebo  treatment  or 
a procedure.  
 
Pregnancies and infant exposures during breastfeeding that occur from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 120 days following cessation of Sponsor’s product, or [ADDRESS_912226] be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous 
abortion, missed  abortion, benign hydatidiform mole,  blighted ovum, fetal death, 
intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.  
 
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006]  Global  Safety.   
 
 
10.84  Immediate  Reporting of Adverse  Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
A serious adverse  event  is any adverse event  occurring at any dose or during any 
use of [COMPANY_006]’s product that:  

MC1788  42 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persisten  or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect;  
• Is an other  important medical  event  
• Note: In addition to the above criteria,  adverse events meeting  either 
of the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are 
reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet 
certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered 
serious by [CONTACT_131892]. 
o Is a new can cer (that is not a condition of the study);  
o Is associated  with an overdose. 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious 
adverse event, including death due to any cause that occurs to any participant 
must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006]  Global  Safety  if it causes  the participant  to be excluded from  the trial, or 
is the result of a protocol- specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure.  
 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_912227]  be followed  up for outcome.  
 
SAE  reports  and any other  relevant safety  information  are to be forwarded 
to the [COMPANY_006] Global Safety facsimile number:

11.0 Treatment Evaluation/Measurement of Effect  
Patients  must  have  measurable  disease.  
 
The primary  endpoint is the evaluation  of cutaneous disease as measured  by [CONTACT_503852]  (5). 
Disease progression will also be measured by [CONTACT_532319], visceral disease and blood. 
11.[ADDRESS_912230] x -ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_912231] component of a PET/CT, or MRI. 
11.113  A malignant lymph  node is considered  measurable if its short axis is 
≥1.[ADDRESS_912232] scan (CT scan slice thickness  
recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).  
11.2 Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
11.21  Evaluation of primary  cutaneous lesion  
 
mSWAT  is calculated using body surface area (BSA) of each MF lesion (palm 
plus fingers of the patient ≈ 1% BSA) in each of 12 areas of the body, 
multiplying the sum of the BSA of each lesion type by a weighting factor 
(patch=1, plaque=2, and tumor  =4) and generating  a sum of the subtotals of each 
lesion subtype. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_912233]  
• Overall  cutaneous response  rate (ORR)  = proportion of patients with 
a 50% or greater reduction of baseline mSWAT score 
• Complete  cutaneous response rate (CR)  = proportion of patients with 
a 100% reduction of baseline mSWAT score 
• Cutaneous 90 response  rate (CR90)  = proportion of patients  with a 
90% or greater reduction of baseline mSWAT score without the 
development of new tumors 
• Cutaneous partial  response rate (PR)  = proportion of patients  with a 
50-90% baseline reduction of mSWAT score without the development of new tumors 
• P
rogressive cutaneous disease (PD) = greater than 25% increase in 
baseline mSWAT or  the development of new tumors.  However,  if in 
the judgement of the investigator, the increase in mSWAT is the result of inflammation due to treatment and/or the unmasking of 
subclinical skin involvement, this increase in mSWAT shall not be 
considered  evidence of progressive  cutaneous disease and the patient 
shall otherwise be classified as stable cutaneous disease (SD).  
• Stable  cutaneous disease (SD)  = <25% increase to <50%  reduction 
in baseline mSWAT without the development of new tumors ; or patients with a greater  than 25% increase baseline mSWAT  due to 
MC1788  45

the result  of inflammation  due to treatment  and/or the unmasking  of 
subclinical skin involvement.  
• Relapsed  cutaneous disease  = Any disease recurrence in those with 
complete response  
 
11.22  Evaluation of target  visceral  lesions  or target  lymph  nodes  
 
11.223  Identification of target  lesions  
• Measurable  lesions  (as defined in Section  11.1) up to a maximum of 
5 representative of all involved organs, should be identified as 
“Target Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline.  
• Target  visceral  lesions  and target  lymph  nodes should be selected  on 
the basis of their size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest  lesion  (or malignant lymph  node) does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected. 
11.224  Measurement  Methods  
• All measurements should be recorded  in metric  notation  (i.e., 
decimal fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be 
used to characterize  each identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline,  at 
the end of cycle 4 and at the end of treatment. 
11.225  Acceptable modality  
• Tumor imaging  will be performed using  a full body PET-CT. If the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral 
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements.  
11.226  Evaluation of target  lesions  
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD):  A sum of the longest diameter 
for all target  visceral  lesions  plus the sum of the short  axis of all the 
target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor  response in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD):  A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target visceral lesions plus the sum of the short axis 
of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the 
post-baseline sum of dimensions  (PBSD).  If the radiologist is able to 
provide an actual measure for the target visceral lesion (or target 
lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If 
the target visceral lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measu re, a default value 
of 0.[ADDRESS_912234] 
that the target visceral lesion or target lymph node has likely 
disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm.  
MC1788  46 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
• The minimum  sum of the dimensions (MSD)  is the minimum of the 
BSD and the PBSD.  
11.[ADDRESS_912235]  
• Complete  Response  (CR):All  of the following  must  be true: 
a. Disappearance  of all visceral  lesions.  
b. Each  target  lymph  node must  have  reduction in short axis to 
<1.0 cm. 
• Partial  Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD  (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target visceral lesions plus the sum of the 
short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking 
as reference the BSD (see Section 11.226).  
 
• Progression (PD): At least one of the following  must  be true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph node that was normal  at baseline  (<1.0 cm short  axis) 
and increased to ≥1.[ADDRESS_912236] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest 
diameter for all target visceral lesions plus the sum of the 
short axis  of all  the target  lymph  nodes at current  evaluation) 
taking  as reference the MSD  (Section  11.41). In addition, the 
PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least  
0.5 cm from  the MSD.  
• Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage to qualify  for PR, 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the 
MSD.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_912237] results will be collected and the ratio CD4:CD8 will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602].  
11.[ADDRESS_912238]  
• Complete  Response (CR):  No blood involvement.  
• Partial  Response (PR):  50% decrease in CD4  count or CD4:CD8  ratio ≤10. 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  50% increase from  baseline (≥5,000  CD4+cells  in 
blood or CD4:CD8 ratio ≥15).  
• S table  Disease (SD): Not CR, PR or PD. 
 
 
11.4 Measurement  at Follow-up Evaluations  
11.41  Cutaneous lesions  
• mSWAT  will be collected  at baseline,  end of every  cycle  of treatment  and 
during clinical follow -up at 30 and 90 days. 
• mSWAT  response will be recorded  as per Section  11.211. 
 
11.42  Target  visceral  lesions and lymph nodes.  
MC1788  47 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
• Subsequent PET-CT scans must be obtained after cycle 4 and the end of 
treatment visit following initial documentation of objective cutaneous 
response  status  of either  complete  response (CR)  or partial  response (PR).  
• In the case of stable  disease  (SD),  follow-up measurements must  have  met 
the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 3 weeks.  
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or stable  disease (an effusion may be a side effect  of the treatment) 
and progressive disease. 
11.43  Peripheral  blood 
T and B- Cell Quantitation  will be performed  at baseline,  end of cycle  4, and at 
end of treatment.  
11.5 Overall  Objective  Status  
Overall  systemic  response rate is defined as 50% or greater  reduction of baseline 
mSWAT score without evidence of progressive nodal, visceral, or blood involvement.

15.1 Pembrolizumab  (MK -3475, SCH 900475, Keytruda®)  
15.11  Background : Pembrolizumab  is a potent  humanized  IgG4  monoclonal antibody 
with high specificity of binding to the PD- 1 receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with PD- L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab  has high  affinity  and potent receptor blocking activity  for PD -1. 
 
15.12  Formulation : 
 
Pembrolizumab  is available  as a liquid  25 mg/mL,  100 mg/vial.  
 
15.13  Preparation  and storage : 
 
Vials  should be stored  in the refrigerator  at temperatures between  2-8°C. 
 
Drug concentrate is further diluted with normal saline (or 5% dextrose) in 
the concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/mL. The infusion solution in the IV 
bag should be immediately administered. Diluted pembrolizumab 
solutions  may be stored at room temperature for a cumulative period of up 
to [ADDRESS_912240] can also be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C for no more than [ADDRESS_912241] be discarded after 6 hours at room temperature or 96 hours under 
refrigeration.   
15.14  Administration: Pembrolizumab is administered by [CONTACT_162141] 
[ADDRESS_912242] be 
between 1 and 10 mg/mL. Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 
mL/minute  through a peripheral  or indwelling catheter.  Flush  the line with 0.9% 
NaCL following the completion of the infusion. 
 
 
15.15  Pharmacokinetic  information : 
a) Absorption –Because  pembrolizumab  is administered  intravenously, it 
is immediately and completely bioavailable. Steady -state concentrations 
of pembrolizumab are reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with a 
Q3W regimen and the systemic accumulation is 2.1-fold. The peak 
concentration, trough concentration, and area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve at steady state of pembrolizumab 
increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg Q3W. 
b) Distribution  – Pembrolizumab  has a limited  volume  of distribution.  

MC1788  51 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
c) Excretion  – CL is approximately 23% lower  after achieving maximal 
change at steady state compared with the first dose. The terminal 
elimination half -life (t½) is estimated to be 22 days at steady state.  
d) Metabolism  - Pembrolizumab  is catabolized  through non-specific pathways; 
metabolism does not contribute to its CL.  
 
There are limited clinical studies on the subcutaneous formulation. Model -
based analysis showed an estimated bioavailability of 64% (95% CI: 54% to 
74%; variability, 128% CV). This is consistent with the reported 
bioavailability for other mAbs (range: 50% to 85%) given SC. Clearance was 
the same for the IV and SC formulations. The mean time to achieve maximum 
concentration (Tmax) with pembrolizumab SC was estimated to be 5.5 days 
(range: 3 days to 14 days).

16.0 Statistical  Considerations  and Methodology  
16.1 Overview  
This is a phase II study designed to assess the overall  cutaneous response rate at cycle 9 
in MF patients treated with pembrolizumab. It is a single one-stage design with an 
interim analysis based on the Simon optimal design with 85% power and 10% Type I 
error.  
 NOTE: As per Amendment 4, accrual will cease after the enroll ment of 10 patients due 
to sponsor decision on funding.  Thus, the study power and type I error will not be 
appropriate  for the analysis, as the study will not be able to go to full accrual.  The study 
will be analy zed at the pre- defined interi m step.  
 
16.11 Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is overall cutaneous response (cutaneous complete 
response (CR), cutaneous 90 response (CR90) or cutaneous partial response 
(PR)) as defined using the mSWAT score as stated in  section  11.0. Throughout 
Section 16.0, CR, CR90 or PR will be considered synonymous with “success”, unless specified  otherwise.  All patients  meeting  the eligibility  criteria  who have 
signed a consent  form  and have  begun treatment  will be evaluable for response.  
 
16.2 Statistical  Design  
16.21  Design: The largest success proportion where the proposed treatment regimen 
would be considered ineffective in this population is 15%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed 
regimen  in this patient population is 35%.  This design  uses [ADDRESS_912247] 15%.  
16.22  Interim  Analysis:  Enter  [ADDRESS_912248] 2, we will continue accrual.  
16.23  N/A as per Amendment 4: Final  Decision  rule: If [ADDRESS_912249] 7, this will be considered evidence of promising activity and the treatment may be recommended for further testing i n subsequent studies.  
16.24  N/A as per Amendment 4: NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interim analysis to allow the first 10 patients to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity 
is observed. Given the limited overall sample size and the inclusion of an 
adverse events stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we feel it is ethical to not halt accrual for the interim analysis. However, if accrual  is extremely  rapid,  we may temporarily  
suspend  accrual  in order  to obtain safety data on these patients before re-opening 
accrual to further patients.  
16.3 Sample  Size,  Accrual  Rate  and Power  and Significance  Level  
16.31  Sample Size: This study  is expected  to require a  minimum of  10 and a maximum 
of 28 evaluable patients. We anticipate accruing 3 (10%) additional patients to account  for ineligibility,  cancellation,  major  treatment  violation, or other  reasons. 
Therefore, the study is expected to accrue a maximum of 31 patients overall.   As 
per Amendment 4, accrual will cease at 10 patients.  
16.32  Accrual Rate and Study Duration: The anticipated accrual rate is 10 evaluable patients per year. Therefore, the accrual period is expected to be 3.1 years. The

Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
 primary  endpoint will be evaluated  approximately  3.[ADDRESS_912250] patient accrued has received 24 months of treatment.  
16.33  Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially  distributed, the significance level  is .10, i.e. there  is a 10% chance of 
finding the drug to be effective when  it truly  is not. The probability of declaring 
that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) under various

16.34  Other  considerations: Adverse events,  quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or 
changes in standard care will be taken  into account in  any decision to terminate 
the study. 
 
16.4 Analysis Plan 
16.41  Primary Outcome Analysis: The mSWAT score at baseline and cycle [ADDRESS_912251] to  follow 
up, or exit the study per protocol. The proportion of successes will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_674980] –Whitney U for nonparametric data and the student t - 
test. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner (Duffy D 1987).  
16.42  Secondary Outcome Analysis: These analyses will include all patients meeting the eligibility  criteria  who have  signed  a consent  form  and have  begun treatment, 
including patients who fail to achieve a complete or partial response. 
 
Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade 
for each  type of adverse event  will be recorded  for each patient,  and frequency 
tables will be  reviewed  to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of 
the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
 
Response Rates:  
Changes in mSWAT  scores  from  baseline  will be evaluated  at cycle  9. 
Summary statistics will be calculated.  
 
Patients will be assigned response based on the mSWAT criteria in 
section 11.0. Proportions of patients will be calculated and described 
using summary statistics. Proportions of interest are patients having 
CR, CR90 and PR; patients having stable subcutane ous disease; 
patients having progressive cutaneous disease;  and patients having an 
overall systemic response rate.  
Progression free survival time is defined for all evaluable patients as the time from registration to relapse or death due to any cause. Patients  are censored if 
they have not achieved a progression at the time of analysis. The distribution of progression- free survival will be estimated  using the method of Kaplan -Meier.  
In addition, the progression- free survival rate at 5 years after registration will be 
reported.  
MC1788  59 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have 
achieved  a CR, CR90  or PR  as the date at which  the patient’s  objective 
status is first noted to be a CR, CR90 or PR to the earliest date relapse 
is documented. The distribution of duration of complete response will 
be estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier.  
Time  to response  is defined as the time from  registration  to CR, CR90 
or PR. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan- Meier (Kaplan and Meier 1958).  
Overall  survival  time is defined as the time from  registration  to death 
due to any cause.  Patients  are censored  if they are alive at the time of 
analysis.  The distribution  of survival time will be estimated  using the 
method of Kaplan-Meier (Kaplan and Meier 1958). In addition, the 
overall survival rate at 2 years after registration will be reported.  
Additional Analyses: All endpoints may be analysed using patient 
characteristics to explore  possible associations of demographics with 
the endpoints. Possible characteristics include clinical stage, gender 
and prior treatments. 
 
16.43  Correlative  Analyses  
Immunohistochemistry will be used to quantify levels of CD4, CD8, PD- 1/CD279, and PD- L1 expression  before and after treatment  with pembrolizumab 
and will be used for change in baseline calculations at baseline and end of cycle  
2. Qualitative  measures  of the strength  of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression will use 
published standardized grading scales for categorical classification purposes. 
 
16.5 Primary  Endpoint  Completion Date  for  Reporting  
For purpose of reporting, the Primary Endpoint Completion Date 
(PECD)  for this  study is the time the last patient  registered  has been  followed  for at least 
7 months. 
 
16.6 Data  Safety  and Monitoring  
16.61  The study statistician will review the study weekly to monitor accrual, endpoints  
and adverse events. Additionally, the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data 
Safety  Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  is responsible for reviewing accrual  and safety 
data for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  
16.62  This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) 
version 2.0. A full report containing cumulative CDUS data will be submitted 
quarterly  to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075].  Reporting time points are: January  31, 
April 30, July 31, and October 31. 
16.63  Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_674966]. We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_674967] (1) the study  re-opening to 
accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the 
treatment(s) under  investigation.  The study  team  may choose to suspend  accrual  

MC1788  60 
Protocol  Version  Date:  30NOV2022    
  
 
because of unexpected  adverse  event  profiles  that have not crossed  the specified 
rule below. 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute  specified  as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite”)  that satisfy 
one of the following: 
• if [ADDRESS_912252] 10 treated  patients  (20%)  experience a grade 
[ADDRESS_912253] possibly related to 
treatment.  
• if after the first [ADDRESS_912254] been treated, 20% of all patients experience 
a grade [ADDRESS_912255] possibly related  to 
treatment.  
We note that we will review  grade  4 and 5 adverse events deemed  “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment- related adverse event.  
 
16.63 Accrual  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_674968] 2 patients will accrue per month, leading to a 26 -month 
total accrual.  At 6 months, if the total accrual  is below 50% of the  expected  (fewer  than 6 
patients) then the significance and power will be much better than designed for and a 
sample size reduction may be called for. Consequently, we will update the design and may adjust sample size and/or duration of follow-up. At 6 months, if the total accrual is 
above 200% (more than 24 patients) then we may have lost significance and/or power 
and an increase in sample size or a lengthening of total observation time may be necessary. Consequently, we may pause accrual or update the design and may adjust the 
sample size to achieve the desired significance and power.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_912256]  based  on race,  the sample  size is 
not increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses. 
16.73  The geographical region served by [CONTACT_128776] a population which includes 
approximately 3% minorities. Based on prior MCCC studies involving similar disease sites,  we expect  about 3-5% of patients  will be classified  as minorities  by 
[CONTACT_31961] 30% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by [CONTACT_128777]:

Histologic factors such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_674970], the extensive of dermal involvement, 
and cytomorpholo gic features are all of import. Immunohistochemistry is 
additionally routinely utilized in  classifying  the nature of the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_674971]. Histopathology will be 
used for diagnostic con firmation  and to assess for evidence of histologic  regression 
of tumor with treatment. Immunohistochemistry will be used to quantify levels of CD4, CD8, PD -1/CD279, and PD-L1 expression before and after treatment with 
pembrolizumab and will be used for change in baseline calculations at after registration  and Cycle 2, Day 15. Qualitative measures  of the strength of PD -1 and 
PD-L1 expression will use published standardized grading scales for categorical 
classification purposes.

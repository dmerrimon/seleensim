1 | P a g eTitle: Utility of Continuous Pulse Oximetry for Pediatric Patients with Stable Respi[INVESTIGATOR_237482]:
Background: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_237483] [1]. The most common respi[INVESTIGATOR_237484], acute bronchiolitis, and asthma [1].
Pneumonia is one of the top three illnesses requiring pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237485] a significant cause or 
morbidity and mortality [4,5]. The incidence of pediatric pneumonia varies depending on the country and 
age group, but worldwide the annual incidence in children younger than five years of age is 150 million 
and approximately 2 million pediatric deaths, per year, are attributed to pneumonia [5]. Therefore, it is 
important to understand this disease and how it impacts pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614].
Pneumonia is defined as an acute infection of the lung parenchyma secondary to an infectious etiology 
such as viruses or bacteria [2,3]. When an infectious organism is present, the defense mechanisms of the 
body, including the lungs, are disturbed and the resultant inflammation gives rise to parenchymal damage 
[3]. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath [5]. Findings on imaging can 
demonstrate infiltrates in the lungs [5]. Vital sign testing can show elevations in a child’s heart rate and 
decreases in the amount of oxygen present in the blood (pulse oximetry) secondary to the infiltrative 
processes in the lungs.
Pneumonia is the most common serious infection in the pediatric population and accounts for up to 1-4% 
of all pediatric Emergency Department (ED) visits in the [LOCATION_002] (US) [4]. Furthermore, of the 
pediatric patients that present to the ED with pneumonia, 20-25% are admitted to the inpatient pediatric 
unit for further management [4]. This decision to admit a child to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237486], medical conditions, and severity of illness [2]. One of the factors that is 
considered when deciding whether to admit a child to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237487], or 
the amount of oxygen in the blood.
Bronchiolitis is another common respi[INVESTIGATOR_237488] 100,000 US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237489] [6]. There is a seasonality with most infections 
occurring in the fall and winter months [6]. It is the leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237490] [6].
Acute bronchiolitis refers to lower airway inflammation and obstruction secondary to a viral infection [6]. 
When a virus infects the terminal bronchiolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_237491], damage to 
these cells results and subsequently causes cellular sloughing and inflammation [6]. This inflammation, 
coupled with mucous build-up, accounts for the obstruction that is seen in acute bronchiolitis [6]. 
Symptoms include rhinitis, congestion, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, and accessory muscle use [6]. Like 
pneumonia, hypoxemia (decreased oxygen content in the blood) can occur with acute bronchiolitis with 
the most severe complication being acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_61160] [6].
The third most common respi[INVESTIGATOR_237492]. 
Asthma affects 1 in 12 children in the US and is a leading cause of ED visits [8]. It is the most common 
chronic disease in childhood in developed countries and an estimated 8.3% of children in the US had been 
diagnosed with asthma in 2016 [9].
Asthma is a complex, multifactorial, immune-mediated disease and is defined by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_237493] [8]. Triggers for asthma exacerbations can include infections,

2 | P a g eenvironmental allergens, and other irritants [8]. Smooth muscle constriction in the airways and 
inflammation/edema result in intermittent and reversible lower airway obstructions [8]. Symptoms of 
asthma include cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Like the other respi[INVESTIGATOR_237494], asthma can also result in hypoxemia.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711], including pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, and pneumonia pose a significant threat 
to the pediatric population and are major causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In the 
US, most pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237495]. Specifically, the most ideal 
technique to monitor for hypoxemia is one of current debate.
Currently, there are two main ways to monitor for hypoxemia in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. The first is to have a 
pediatric patient on continuous monitoring, which involves the child being continuously connected to a 
monitor that displays various vital signs, one of which being oxygen saturation (SpO2). This technique 
has been studied over the last several years and many concerns have been raised regarding alarm fatigue, 
or the phenomenon that occurs when a patient is continuously connected to a monitor and the monitor 
alarms an overwhelming amount [10]. One study found that this form of monitoring was used in up to 
50% of children in non-ICU settings and that up to 99% of the alarms did not require clinical action [10]. 
In fact, this study found that more than 10,000 alarms can occur in a pediatric unit in 1 week and that 
greater than 150 alarms can occur on any one patient each day [10]. Furthermore, while these continuous 
monitors are meant to identify patients who are deteriorating, it has been suggested that the efficacy is 
limited by [CONTACT_237503] [10]. Finally, 
a recent study also demonstrated that the second form of monitoring, scheduled vital checks, may be 
superior to electronic measurements when assessing patients for deterioration [10]. Currently, there are no 
guidelines to recommend what form of monitoring, continuous monitoring or scheduled vital checks, is 
superior and studies evaluating the rationale behind widespread continuous monitoring techniques are 
lacking [10].

Primary admission for non-respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]
Corrected gestational age less than 3 months
Age greater =>14 years
History of Chronic Lung Disease and age less than 1 year
Home oxygen use
Tracheostomy dependent
Neuromuscular disease or hypotonia secondary to a chronic/congenital disease
Cardiac malformation treated with medication
Transfers from the Beaumont Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237499]: Participants will be screened and enrolled on the pediatric floor at William 
Beaumont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The explanation to participants and the families of the participants (given that 
participants are minors) will include brief descriptions, in simple terms, of common respi[INVESTIGATOR_237500].  Participants will be told about the two main ways that we 
monitor patients admitted for respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711] (continuous monitoring and vital checks) and that both 
are considered to be standard of care. Participants will be told that through a randomized process one of 
these monitoring systems (continuous monitoring or vital checks) will be used through the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
They will also be informed that if at any point a child required increased monitoring, they will received 
that increased monitoring and be removed from the study. Participants will be told that they will be given 
a survey to complete at the time of discharge. They will be informed that no names or identifying 
information will be presented but that only the chief investigators will have access to that information 
through the data collecting process. Participants will have the option to opt out of the study at any time 
and this information will be included in the initial consent explanation. Participants will be given the 
opportunity to ask questions about their involvement in the study.
Information sheets will be handed out either by [CONTACT_237504]/participants, which will only be Paige Bicoll, DO. The questionnaires 
will be handed out by [CONTACT_237505]. If nursing staff is unable to hand out or collect 
questionnaires because they are involved in other patient care, residents will be handing out and collecting 
completed questionnaires.
Proposed Intervention: Randomized assignment to either continuous vital monitoring or vital sign 
checks (intermittent monitoring every 4 hours). Additionally, a survey will be handed out to parents to 
gauge their comfort in discharge. 
When a child who meets inclusion criteria is admitted to the pediatric floor, the primary resident 
conducting the research (Paige Bicoll, DO) will hand out an information sheet to the legal 
guardian(s) of the child to be enrolled in the study. The resident will then obtain consent from the 
family and either place the child on continuous monitoring or vital sign checks in the computer. 
This will be randomized. At the end of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], the parents/legal guardians will receive a 
survey which they will be asked to fill out and return prior to discharge. The length of stay will 
then be tracked for all patients and a comparison will be made between the two groups 
(continuous monitoring and vital sign checks). There will be a container of envelopes in the 
resident work room on the pediatric floor. When there is a child that can be enrolled in the study, 
the next up envelop will be chosen and it will tell the primary resident which group (continuous

the envelop for data collection later on. When the survey is completed, this will also have the 
patients MRN on it and will be placed with the envelop for data collection. 
oIf a patient decompensates and requires closer monitoring, the patient will be removed 
from the study. 
Risks: none
Benefits: none
Eligibility Criteria: minors will be included in the study. Pregnant women will be excluded. Neonates 
and fetuses are excluded. Economically or educationally disadvantaged individuals will not be purposely 
included or excluded. No information will be gathered regarding economic or educational background on 
research subjects. Any concern regarding a subject's participation due to economic or educational 
disadvantages will be addressed on an individual basis. To address educationally disadvantaged 
individuals, the study participation consent will be explained and written in simple terms.
Data Analysis: Data will be collected on length of stay for all participants and survey answers. The data 
will be analyzed to determine if there is a difference in length of stay between the two groups and if there 
is a difference between legal guardian comfort in discharge between the two groups. This information can 
be used to help guide monitoring guidelines for inpatient pediatric patients with stable respi[INVESTIGATOR_237501]. 
Existing Data: No similar study was done and is available for review in the literature.

   2.0   INTRODUCTION AND R ATIONALE   
2.1   General Background  
Over  15 million cases of root canal therapy (RCT) are performed each year in the [LOCATION_002]1. 
If performed effectively, RCT can be the best treatment for a necrotic or irreversibly inflamed 
pulp. However, the current methodologies rely on technologies invented over [ADDRESS_866314] does not uniformly and completely clean canals. Although  
metallic files (e.g nickel titanium)  are flexible and conform to the curvature of a canal, they still 
do not touch all root canal surfaces as they are fundamentally rigid, round pi[INVESTIGATOR_646991]. 
Therefore , it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_646992] 35% (and as high as 50%) of the canal surface to be passed 
over during instrumentation
2, 3. This by[CONTACT_6476], combined with the inefficiency of current irrigation 
methods , results in 40% to 60% of canals still yielding positive cultures after instrumentation 
and irrigation with different sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ) concentrations4, 5. 
Another factor increasing the chance of leaving uninstrumented recesses is the canal curvature. This issue is specifically the case for long and narrow oval canals (ratio of major/minor canal 
diameters is greater than 2.0). Hulsmann et al.
6 studied the RC Ts performed on mandibular 
molars using two different rotary instruments. They found that 81 -88% of the canals will be left 
with some degree of uninstrumented recesses. Vaudt et al.7 compared the performance of the 
Alpha System and ProTaper Universal with  manual techniques and found that in 80% of the 
manually treated curved mesial canals of mandibular molars more than 25% of the canal surface 
remain ed uninstrumented.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_866315] System  Sonendo, Inc.  
Study Protocol# CS -[ADDRESS_866316]. The presence of a ledge might exclude the 
possibility of achieving an adequately shaped canal that reaches the ideal working length, which 
may result in incomplete instrumentation and disinfection of the root canal system, as well as 
incomplete filling of the canal. The root canal space api[INVESTIGATOR_646993]; therefore, ledges frequently result in persistent periapi[INVESTIGATOR_646994]. Consequently, there is a causal relationship between ledge formation and unfavorable endodontic treatment outcomes
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Some of the reported frequencies 
of ledge formation include: 11% by [CONTACT_647103].17, 10% by [CONTACT_647104].18, 46% by [CONTACT_647105]15, 52% by [CONTACT_647106]12, and 25% by [CONTACT_647107]19. In 
one study12, endodontists performed RCTs and reportedly created ledges in 33% of previously 
untreated canals and 41% of endodontic retreatment cases.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_866317] serious implications, occur in approximately 2 –12% of 
endodontically treated teeth20, 21, 22, 23. Bacterial infection eman ating either from the root canal 
or the periodontal tissues, or both, prevents healing and promotes inflammatory sequels where 
the supporting tissues have been exposed. This bacterial exposure may be followed by [CONTACT_647108], abscesses, and fistulae,  including bone resorption processes. Once an infectious 
process has established itself at the perforation site, prognosis for treatment is precarious and 
the complication may prompt extraction of the affected tooth23. 
2.2.5 Penetration of Instruments into the P eriapi[INVESTIGATOR_646995], which results in damage to the periapi[INVESTIGATOR_646996] (Figure 1). It is well accepted and proven that instrumentation 
beyond the api[INVESTIGATOR_646997]
24, 25, 26, 27. In clinical 
The Sonendo GentleWave System  Sonendo, Inc.  
Study Protocol# CS -06 Revision B  23 March 2015  
Proprietary and Confidential Page 20 of 76 
   practice, one of the major difficulties is that the api[INVESTIGATOR_646998]29. According to ElAyouti et al.28, the endodontic instruments penetrate beyond 
the api[INVESTIGATOR_646999] 25% of cases. In 10% of cases, the file penetration is greater than 1mm. 
They argued that this penetration is mainly due to the fact that the api[INVESTIGATOR_647000] 78% to 93% of the cases. ElAyouti et al.28 determined that a seemingly accurate 
working length (ending radiographically 0 to 2mm short of the radiographic apex) frequently 
resulted in instrumentation beyond the api[INVESTIGATOR_647001]. Even the advent of apex locators has not 
been able to resolve the issue as the function of apex locators is consistent in only 85% of 
patients29. 
 
 
Figure 1: The photograph of the extracted tooth illustrates the file beyond the api[INVESTIGATOR_647001]. Examiners indicated that the file was 
at the correct radiographic working length. This penetration error is an example of an underestimation of the actual working length 
distance, causing the file to be too long30. 
2.2.6 Instrument Separation  
After deca des of research and development, intracanal breakage of root canal instruments 
continually causes endodontists and pati ents considerable anxiety. Removal of separated 
instruments requires additional dentin removal and irrigation which generally results in 
perforated or severely weakened roots. An 18 -month study involving 7,159 discarded rotary NiTi 
instruments from 14 endodontists worldwide reported a frequency of 5% instrument 
separation31. A review of the literature reveals that the mean prevalence of retained fractured 
endodontic hand instruments (mostly stainless steel files) is approximately 1.6%, with a range of 0.7% to 7.4%
32. However, it bears mentioning that much of the published literature is comprised 
of outcome studies that do no t specifically evaluate prevalence of instrument fracture. The mean 
clinical fracture frequency of rotary NiTi instruments is approximately 1.0% with a range of 0.4 to 3.7%
32. Suter et al.33 analyzed the probability of removing fractured instruments from root canals.  
During an 18-month study , they  found that a fractured instrument was left inside 1% of all the 
root canals treated .  
2.2.7 Extrusion of Debris into the Periapi[INVESTIGATOR_647002], irrigant (i.e. sodium hypochlorite) and debris (e.g. bacteria, dentin debris, and necrotic tissue) are often extruded into the periradicular region, leading to periapi[INVESTIGATOR_647003] -ups
34. It is known that inflammatory reactions can cause 

The Sonendo GentleWave System  Sonendo, Inc.  
Study Protocol# CS -[ADDRESS_866318] is associated with some level of api[INVESTIGATOR_647004], which affects the healing process significantly.  
2.2.8 Extrusion of Sodium Hypochlorite into the Periodontal Tissues  
Root canal irrigation with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) plays an important role in the debridement and disinfection of the root canal system and is an integral part of traditional root 
canal procedures. However, sodium hypochlorite has a pH of approximately [ADDRESS_866319] 
a cumulative number over a range of follow -up periods. An approximate success rate for 1 year 
follow -up would be 68 -70% while that success rate would increase to 80 -85% after four years.   
While effective chemomechanical canal prepa ration is extremely important, the literature 
indicated other factors significantly affected long -term prognosis for the patient.  If a patient 
presented with api[INVESTIGATOR_647005] a periapi[INVESTIGATOR_213216], the long -term success was 
significantly lower.  Thus, including a large number of patients with a pre -operative periapi[INVESTIGATOR_647006] -term success rates. Effective obturation to within [ADDRESS_866320] System  Sonendo, Inc.  
Study Protocol# CS -[ADDRESS_866321]. (S ee Appendix I. Healing Literature Report)  
2.[ADDRESS_866322]  System (System) introduces a novel method of cleaning root canals 
that may be safer, less  invasive, and more efficient. It has been designed to conserve more of 
the natural structure of the tooth and to minimize procedural and safety issues. The S ystem , 
when used in combination with the Molar Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]  (Figure 2),  has been designed to clean roo t 
canals of molar teeth without requiring excessive enlargement of root canals. Traditional root 
canal therapy devices enter into the root canal of the tooth, whereas the System ’s treatment 
tube (guide tube ) is designed to enter only to the pulpal chamber.  It has been designed to clean 
the root canals remotely and simultaneously in a matter of minutes.  
  
Figure 2: Illustrations of the Molar H andpi[INVESTIGATOR_647007] a molar tooth. The H andpi[INVESTIGATOR_647008] a stream of treatment fluid in such  a way as 
to generate a set of physicochemical phenomena that effectively, yet safely, clean the pulpal space of the tooth.  
The Sonendo GentleWave  treatment is designed for use  with minimal instrumentation of the 
root canals in order to facilitate obturation of the root canal system . It is also thought that by 
[CONTACT_647109][INVESTIGATOR_139484], a large amount of tooth structure may be saved,  as opposed to 
traditional practice , which typ ically removes this structure . In addition, the System  may reduce 
the risks associated with instrumentation, i.e. ledge formation, instrument separation, and perforation. Unlike conventional root canal treatment , irrigation solutions are  delivered into the  
root canal system  without requiring the irrigation component (i.e. the needle) to be inserted 
inside each individual canal. With  the System , the solution enters the tooth at about [ADDRESS_866323] System  Sonendo, Inc.  
Study Protocol# CS -[ADDRESS_866324] System  (System)  is comprised of two units: the Sonendo 
GentleWaveTM Console (Console) and  the Molar Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]) . The Console prepares 
and delivers treatment fluid to the Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_647009].  
The System delivers treatment fluid into the axis cavity of the tooth in such a way that it creates 
hydroacoustic waves within the treatment fluid accumulated inside the tooth. The treatment 
fluid delivered into the tooth removes organic tissues and smear layer from the root canal 
system . The Console aspi[INVESTIGATOR_647010] /inorganic  matter from the tooth 
into the Console waste canister. The Console is designed for use with a treatment fluid of 8 -10% 
sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) without surfactants, 17% neutral pH buffered 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) , and distilled water.  
All of t he materials coming in to contact [CONTACT_181535]/or the treatment fluid have known 
biocompatibility and a history of acceptable use in medical device applications.  
2.5.1  Console  
The Console (Figure 3) is a semi- stationary unit designed to prepare and deliver treatment fluid  
to the H andpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. It is comprised of a treatment fluid Delivery H ose, a Suction H ose, a Purge 
Port, Evacuation T ubing , a User Interface Screen, a distilled water Reservoir, an NaOCl Reservoir, 
an EDTA Reservoir, a Waste C anister, and a Foot P edal. Similar to the dental handpi[INVESTIGATOR_647011], the System is activated by a foot  pedal , which must remain 
depressed in order to operate the S ystem.  
The Console is made up of five  functional subgroups of components : 
1. Delivery System  
The Delivery System is composed primarily of a pump. This pump operates in two cycles: a delivery cycle and a retraction cycle. During the delivery cycle, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_647012]. 
The pump operate s with two cylinders/pi[INVESTIGATOR_349170] (continuous flow). During the

The Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] , containing proprietary features such as a nozzle and a 
treatment  tube (also called a guide tube), delivers a stream of treatment fluid 
into the pulp chamber of the tooth. This is completed  in such a way that it 
creates hydroacoustic waves within the treatment fluid accumulated inside the 
tooth. The treatment fluid is a low concentration sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 
solution , which is  the most  commonly used irrigant in traditional endodontic 
procedure s for dissolution of organic matter and for added sterility. The stream 
of solution delivered into the tooth is designed to be dispersed and deflected by [CONTACT_647111]. This is designed  
to create a safe yet ef fective circulation (irrigation) of the solution within the 
tooth. These physicochemical phenomena occurring inside the pulpal space 
may be powerful enough to remove all of the  organic tissues and 
microorganisms from the root canals in just a few minutes , yet gentle enough 
not to affect the har d structure of the tooth or the periodontal tissues enclosing 
the roots. The used treatment fluid flows  from the tooth into a Waste  Canister 
rendering the procedure dry and contained.  
The Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_647014]. They are checked for dimensional 
accuracy, performance, production, and inclusion of appropriate material certifications in the shipment documentati on.  
2. Single Use Suction H ose 
The single use Suction H ose is designed to suction air and fluids during the 
procedure.  The Suction H ose is made from Tigon tubing and Policarbonate 
fittings.  
3.  Occlusal P late 
The Occlusal P late features a handle, a circular ar ea, and a pin protruding from 
the middle of the circular area. This pin helps locate the center of the tooth 
surface in order to facilitate locating  the pulp chamber.  The Occlusal P late is 
used to form a flat surface, called an Occlusal P latform, so that t he Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_647015] a seal against it. The Occlusal P late is made from polycarbonate.

2.5.3 Treatment Fluids  
The three  treatment fluids utilized during the System operation are sodium hypochlorite 
(NaOCl), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (EDTA)  and distilled water. All fluids are introduced for 
treatment through the Console and Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_6928].  
The first treatment fluid is a NaOCl  solution . NaOCl is the most commonly utilized irrigation fluid 
during traditional root canal therapy, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_647019] a dental syringe. This 
solution is prepared by [CONTACT_647112], which mixes distilled  water and regular 8-10% NaOCl .  
In addition, the root canals will be irrigated with EDTA solution. This solution is prepared by [CONTACT_647113], which mixes distilled water and 17% EDTA. The System automatically introduces EDTA 
into the tooth, while standard dental practice uses a dental syr inge to release EDTA.

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS     
10.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign or symptom, intercurrent illness, injury, or 
disease temporally associated with treatment whether or not related to the procedure or device.
  
• Mild:   The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
• Moderate :  The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual  
activities.  
• Severe :  The AE causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities, may 
be incapacitating and may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

   10.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that results in a ny of the following 
outcomes:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as any AE that places a person, in the view of the I nvestigator, 
at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to  conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
10.3 Adverse Event Assessments  
Adverse Events (AEs)  that occur during the Baseline, T reatment Visit(s) and all the other Follow -
up Visits including the Unscheduled Visits will be assessed by [CONTACT_976], recorded in the patient ’s study 
chart and then transcribed onto the Adverse Event Form  Case Report Form  (CRF ).  
Pain, inflammation, swelling, or other reactions that are expected and associated with standard 
traditional root canal or dental procedures will not be considered adverse events for the study.  
Those events that may be exacerbated intra -procedure or post- procedure will be considered 
adverse events if the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_647068].  
AEs include, but are not limited to, the following:    
• Observed or volunteered problems  
• Complaints  
• Physical signs and symptoms  
• Medical condition which occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline  
• Medical condition present at baseline, which appears to worsen during the study.  
AEs related to only dental and endodontic procedures wil l be collected for the study.  
In addition to recording the AE on the Adverse Event CRF, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_647069] (a complete written summary of the event and its outcome). Each AE must be described 
as follows:  
• Describe the event by [CONTACT_647136] (the diagnosis), coexisting disease, or 
other.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous or colloquial expressions, the AE should be 
recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the subject’s own words when

   possible  
• Note the duration by [CONTACT_647137], and date of resolution.  If the event is 
present at the final study visit, the ongoing box must be marked  
• Note the worst severity of the event as mild, moderate, or severe using the definitions provided  in the protocol  
• Note the outcome of the event  
• Note the action taken as none, medical and/or surgical 
• Note the relationship to surgical procedure and device  
• Note any seriousness criteria  
Any medication necessary for the treatment of an AE  must be recorded on the C oncomitant 
Medication CRF.  If more than one distinct adverse event occurs, each event should be recorded 
separately.  
In addition, PIs must report all AEs to their Institutional Review Board ( IRB) and regulatory bodies 
according t o applicable guidelines and regulations. A copy of the notification  must also be 
submitted to the S ponsor.

10.9 Other Potential Risks  
10.9.1  Radiation Risks  
Radiation exposure will occur during radiograph  examinations. Exposure to ionizing radiation 
while a low risk, has the potential to cause cancer and other risks.  
There are also additional fetal risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure. Ionizing radiation 
is utilized in diagnostic procedures, such as radiograph s, because without these procedures 
diagnostics on pulp diseases and other conditions would not occur.  
 
10.9.2  Cone Beam Computed Tomography  (CBCT) Radiation Risks  
Although the radiation doses from dental CBCT exams are generally lower than other cone beam exams, dental CBCT exams typi[INVESTIGATOR_647074].  
10.9.3  Pregnancy  (risks for the fetus) 
As dental procedures  are associated with risks for pregnant women and the fetus, pregnant 
women will not be included in this research study. It will be recommended for subjects to avoid becoming pregnant during the study.  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the duration of the study, the clinical site will document the pregnancy with a Memo to File.  Study required radiographs or cone beam will not be collected for pregnant subjects but these subjects will still be followe d for the duration of the 
study. The clinical site designee will not complete a Protocol deviation CRF for study required 
radiograph assessment not completed  due to pregnancy .  A Memo to File documenting this 
deviation will suffice.  
10.10   Definitions of Advers e Events

• Provide long -term pain relief  
• Improved quality of life  
These benefits are consistent with the effectiveness criteria studied in similar devices.  
12.[ADDRESS_866400] 
the study according to the Clinical Protocol.  
A clinical designee should notify the Sponsor of any protocol deviation( s), preferably via email. 
Deviatio ns must be reported to the Sponsor regardless of whether medically justifiable, pre -
approved by [CONTACT_1034], or taken to protect the subject in an emergency.  PIs  must also adhere 
to procedures for reporting protocol deviations to the IRB in accordance with their specific IRB’s 
reporting policies and procedures.  
Regulations require that PIs maintain accurate, complete and current records, including 
documents showing the dates of and reasons for each deviation from the protocol.  For reporting purposes, the Sponsor classifies  study deviations as major and minor:  
• Major deviatio n:  Any deviatio n from subject ’s Inclusion and Exclusion C riteria, subject ’s 
informed consent procedures or unauthorized device use. This also includes enrollment 
in another clinical study within 30 days of enrollment.  
• Minor deviation:  Deviation from a protocol requireme nt such as incomplete/inadequate 
subject testing procedures, follow -ups performed outside specified time windows, etc.  
It is untimely the PI’s  responsibility to determine the protocol deviation classification.   
12.1.1  Protocol Deviation Types  
The Sponsor has designated the following protocol deviation types for reporting purposes:  
• Deviation from Informed Consent Process  
• Patient did not meet Inclusion and/or met Exclusion Criteria  
• Patient study visit out of study window  
• Patient missed a study visit

13.0  STATISTICAL METHODS    
All required data for this study will be collected on paper or electronic Case Report Forms (CRFs). 
The Investigator (or des ignated study staff) will assure primary data collection based on source 
documented dental chart reviews. Independent monitoring will be performed to ensure that the investigator and his/her study team conducted the clinical investigation in accordance wit h 
contract specifications, study protocol, Declaration of Helsinki
73, and applicable local or national 
regulations, to ensure adequate protection of the rights and safety of subjects and the quality and integrity of the resulting data.  
In general, quantitative variables will be summarized to indicate the population sample size (N), number of patients with available data (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum values. Qualitative variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_647139]  (N), number of 
patients with available data (n), number of patients in each category, and the percentage of 
patients in each category. Analyses will be based on the Safety Population defined as all patients 
who receive the Sonendo GentleWave System proced ure. Details of analysis methods will be 
described in the statistical analysis plan.
 
13.[ADDRESS_866402] procedure. A sample size of 108 subjects, assuming a 
20% lost to follow -up or Treatment Incomplete Cohort  rate, will result in approximately 86 
subjects who would be evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint.  A sample size of 86 evauable 
subjects provides approximately 90% powe r to detect a difference between a 85% response rate 
for subjects using the Sonendo GentleWave System against a null hypothesis of a 70% response 
rate based on data presented in literature for traditional root canal therapy, using a two -sided 
binomial test  at the 5% level of significance.   
13.[ADDRESS_866403] System procedure.  
The Efficacy Evaluable population is defined as all subjects who enroll  in the study and who 
receive 100% of the Sonendo GentleWave Treatment  (Treatment Complete Cohort)  over the 
course of no more than two visits.  Analysis of efficacy data will be performed using the Efficacy 
Evaluable population.  Efficacy analyses will be based on observed data only; no imputation 
methods will be used. Dropout subjects will not be replaced.

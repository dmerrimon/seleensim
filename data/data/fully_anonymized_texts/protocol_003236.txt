III Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel -group 
study consisting of a screening period of at least 2  week s (a maximum 6 week s), an 18-week 
placebo -controlled treatment period (Treatment A  period ), followed by a n 18-week treatment 
period (Treatment  B period ), and a 20 -week follow -up period.  
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1258988] ( IP) every 2 weeks under double -
blind conditions (Weeks 0 [Day 1], 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 
and 34). The last dose will be administered at Week  34, and subjects wi ll complete the 
treatment period at Week  36 (end of treatment [EOT]). Subsequently, subjects will be 
followed up at Weeks 40, 44, 48, 52, and 56. The study period will be a maximum of 
60 weeks.  
1) Screening Period  
The Investigator  will register subjects  who provi de written informed consent in an interactive 
web response system (IWRS)  to start screening those subjects withi n [ADDRESS_1258989]’s signature [CONTACT_898340] . Subjects will undergo baseline assessments at 
least [ADDRESS_1258990] 1 week before baseline visit  through  Week 36  assessment . 
2) Treatment Period  (Day 1 to Week 36)  
Randomization will be performed within 3 days after baseline visit.  
Subjects will start study treatment on the day of or the day after randomization (date of the 
first dose of IP will be regarded a s Day 1). The treatment period is defined as the period 
between Day 1 and the end of the Week 36 assessment.  
The study consists of 2 treatment periods.  
Treatment A period  (last dose at Week 16)  
All subject s who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the  exclusion criteria during the 
screen phase will be randomized to one of the treatment groups (placebo, KHK4083 150 mg 
Q4W , 300 mg Q2W, 600  mg Q2W, or 600 mg Q4W) . In the 150 mg Q4W group and the 
600 mg Q4W g roup, placebo will be administered between KHK4083 injections to ensure 
blinding.  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -7-  Treatment A period  is defined as the period between Day 1 and Week 18 pre  (before IP 
administration at Week 18).  
In order to ensure the study blind, the efficacy data until Week 16 shall be entered into the 
electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA) . 
Treatment B period  (last dose at Week 34)  
Treatment B period  is an extension phase where all subjects will receive KHK4083 for an 
additional 18  weeks under double -blind conditions ( from Week [ADDRESS_1258991]  [IP administration at 
Week 1 8] through  Week 36).  
In Treatment B period , subjects randomized to the placebo group in Treatment A period  will 
receive SC injections of 600 mg KHK4083 every 2 weeks starting at Week 18. Subjects 
randomized to any of the KHK4083 groups in Treatment A period  will receive KHK4083 at 
the same dose and dosing interval as in Treatment A period . 
Subjects who meet withdrawal criterion 5) (Section 4.4.1 ) based on the IGA score at 
Week  26 will discontinue IP administration at Week 26, undergo end -of-study assessments, 
and then be withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects receiving rescue treatment  (See Section 6.3.3 ) during the period between the start of 
IP administration and the end of the Week 36 assessment will discontinue IP, undergo end -
of-study assessments, and subsequently be withdrawn from the study . 
3) Follow -up Period  (up to Week 56)  
Subjects will enter the follow -up period after the end of the Week 36 assessment and will be 
followed up every 4 weeks until Week 56. Subjects who received rescue treatment  after 
Week 36  will not b e withdrawn from the study  and will be ob served until the end of the study  
up to We ek 56.  
4) Other Potential Study Assessments  (optional)  
Sampling for exploratory biomarkers:  Exploratory biomarkers to characterize KHK4083 
pharmacodynamic activity will be assessed . At selected investigative sites in the United 
States and Canada, blood and skin samples will be collected from subjects who voluntarily 
provide consent to undergo both serum analyses ( including but not limited to serum cytokines 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -8-  and chemokines) and skin biopsy. At all investigative sites in Japan, blood and skin samples  
will be collected from subjects who voluntarily provide consent to undergo both flow 
cytometry (OX40 -positive  T cell and cutaneous lymphocyte -associated antigen [CLA] -
positive  T memory cell) and skin biopsy.  
Pharmacogenetic testing:  The purpose of this  assessment  is to explore the association 
between individual differences in responses to KHK4083 and mutations in DNA sequence. 
Blood samples will be collected before IP injection at Week 0 from subjects who voluntarily 
provide consent.  
IV Number of Subjects  
A total of approximately 2 50 subjects will be randomly assigned by a 1:1:1:1 :1 ratio to 
4 active treatment groups (50 subjects in each group) and one placebo group (50 subjects) in 
Treatment A period.  
V Target Subjects  
Subjects with moderate to severe AD  whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_898240] . 
To allow efficacy and safety assessments in subjects without previous use of biological 
products , enrollment of subject s who have received previous treatment with biological 
products for treatment of AD will be limited to no t more than 50% of total enrollment . 
VI Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be enrolled in this study:  
1) Voluntarily signed  informed consent to participate in the study;  
2) Men and women ≥18 years at the time of informed consent;  
3) Chronic AD, according to  American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria 
(Eichenfield  et al,  2014) or  the local diagnostic criteria, that has been present for at least 
1 year before screening;  
4) EASI score ≥16 at screening and baseline ; 
5) IGA score ≥3 (moderate) at both screen ing and baseline;  
6) BSA ≥10% at both screening and baseline;  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -9-  7) Documented recent history (within 1 year prior to screening visit) of inadequate response 
to treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_319023] (e .g., because of important side effects or safety risks);  
Note:  
• Inadequate response is defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or a low disease activity 
state (comparable to IGA 0 = clear to 2 =mild) despi[INVESTIGATOR_12847] a daily regimen of t opi[INVESTIGATOR_898241] (± topi[INVESTIGATOR_898242]), applied 
for at least [ADDRESS_1258992] prescribing information 
(e.g., 14 days for super -potent topi[INVESTIGATOR_33424]), whichever is shorter.  
• Patients with documented systemic treatment for AD in the past 1 year are also considered as 
inadequate responders to topi[INVESTIGATOR_898243]4083 
after appropriate washout.  
• Important side effects or safety risks are those that outweigh the potential treatment benefits and 
include intolerance to treatment, hypersensitivity reactions, significant skin atrophy, and system ic 
effects, as assessed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or by [CONTACT_102] ’s treating physician.  
8) Women of childbearing potential  (WOCBP)  and fertile  men must agree to use highly 
effective contraceptive methods per the approved local guidance in each country  from the 
time of informed consent to [ADDRESS_1258993] dose of IP (for women) or from the  
start of IP administration to [ADDRESS_1258994] dose of IP (for men) . WOCBP  must 
have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urinary pregnancy 
test result at baseline ass essments.  
For the [LOCATION_002]  and Canada, WOCBP who have sexual intercourse with a non -
surgically sterilized male partner must agree and commit to the use one of the following 
highly effective methods of contraception (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group, 2014) from 
the time of informe d consent to [ADDRESS_1258995] dose of IP. Contraceptive methods 
considered acceptable for use in this study include:  
a) Established use ( ≥2 mont hs prior to the screening visit)  of oral, injected, transdermal 
or implanted combined estrogen -progestogen hormonal methods of contraception. 
Subjects who have used such methods for less than 2 months at the screening visit are 
required to use one of the methods described under b) or c) until the establishment of 
hormonal contraception methods.  
b) Double barrier contraception: use of occlusive diaphragm (cap or cervical/vault caps) 
with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. In countries where spermicidal 
condoms are not allowed ordinary condoms could be used in combination with 
spermicidal creams. Appropria te measures are to be determined by [CONTACT_898288], in accordance with the standard of care in the country where 
treatment is administered. A female condom and a male condom should not be used 
together as friction between the tw o can result in either, or both product(s) failing.  
c) An intrauterine device or system.  
For [LOCATION_013], WOCBP and fertile men must agree to use highly effective contraceptive 
methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year from the time of inf ormed 
consent to [ADDRESS_1258996] dose of IP (for women) or from the start of IP 
administration to [ADDRESS_1258997] dose of IP (for men). WOCBP must have a 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1258998] result at screening and a negative urinary pregnancy tes t 
result at baseline assessments and at each dose interval.  
Birth control methods considered highly effective used consistently and correctly include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovula tion 
– oral 
– intravaginal  
– transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
– oral 
– injectable  
– implantable  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomised partner  
• Sexual a bstinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if 
defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of the 
study treatments).  
Note:  
• WOCBP  exclude women who have undergone permanent sterilization, those who are postmenopausal 
[defined as the absence of menstruation for at least 12 consecutive months without any other medical 
reason  (or in postmenopausal range per local laboratory standards) ], and those anatomically having 
no childbear ing potential.

CONFIDENTIAL  -27-  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Medical Background  
OX40 (CD134, TNFR  superfamily 4), a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family 
member, represents a novel target mole cule. OX40 costimulatory signaling has been shown 
to play a key role in maintaining late T -cell proliferation and survival and in inducing T -cell 
memory formation ( Salek -Arda kani et al, 2006; Croft , 2010; Croft  [a], 2009). Survival is 
increased by [CONTACT_898292] ( Song  et al, 2005; Rogers  et al, 2001). OX40 is mostly 
expressed on activated, but not naïve, CD4  and CD8 T cells such as  T-helper (Th)1, Th2, and 
Th17 lymphocytes ( Croft , 2010). The OX40 transient expression pattern is unique, increasing 
only after antigen -specif ic major histocompatibility complex -induced T cell receptor (TCR) 
activation and decreasing quickly after activation.  
The OX40 ligand is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the TNF superfamily and 
its expression is induced on antigen -presenting c ell including activated B cells, mature 
conventional dendritic cells , Langerhans cells, and macrophages. OX40 ligand is also 
inducible on some activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells , mast cells and during conditions 
of inflammation, on vascular endothelia l and smooth muscle cells ( Croft , 2010; Croft  [b], 
2009). Blocking  OX40 signaling has resulted in inhibition of T cell responses and pathogenic 
symptoms in animal models of autoimmune diseases ( Salek -Arda kani et al, 2006; Croft  [a], 
2009).  
In humans, OX40 expression has been observed on T cells in diseased, but not in non -
diseased, areas in psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atopic dermatitis 
(AD) ( Matsumura  et al, 2003 ; Cavanagh  and Hussel, 2008). OX40 expression has been also 
observed on human T cells in several  immune -based diseases including inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), type 1 diabetes, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus ( Dolff  et al, 
2010), lupus nephritis ( Farres  et al, 2011), bone marrow transplants, skin allografts, and heart 
disease (acute myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy) ( Salek -Arda kani et al, 2006; Croft , 
2010). The infiltration of OX40+ T cells is enhanced in the gastrointestinal tissue of patients 
with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease ( Stüber  et al, 2000).  
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259010] atopic diathesis (personal or  family history 
[one or more of asthma, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, and AD], or predisposition to 
overproduction of immunoglobulin [Ig] E antibodies) (Bieber , 2010 ). 
For the diagnosis of AD , the diagnostic criteria defined by [CONTACT_898293] 1980 are 
frequently used for the diagnosis of AD  in the world  (Hanifin  and Rajka, 1980 ). A revision of 
the diagnostic criteria was accomplished by [CONTACT_153532] ( Williams  et al, 1994).  
The atopic dermatitis severity classifications that are mainly used are the Severity Scoring of 
Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) established by [CONTACT_898294] D ermatitis 
(European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis , 1993) and the Eczema Area and Severity Index 
(EASI) (Hanifin  et al, 2001). In addition to these severity classifications, measurements such 
as peripheral blood eosinophil count, serum total IgE, lactate dehydrogenase, and thymus and  
activation regulated chemokine (TARC) are used as reference indicators of severity or 
disease activity of AD.  
AD is a disease due to multiple causes including gene factors. At present, there are no drugs 
that can completely heal the disease. Therefore, al l available drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_898250]. The main drug therapy for skin 
inflammation is topi[INVESTIGATOR_898251] ( TCSs) or tacrolimus 
ointment ( Saeki  et al, 2016). T CS of appropriate potency is selected for use according to the 
severity of each eruption. Tacrolimus ointment is used for eruptions that are difficult to treat 
with existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_898252]. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_898253]; however, since AD is a long -standing 
disease, discomfort associated with some types of ointment bases and burden for patients and 
their family of applying topi[INVESTIGATOR_898254], which takes more time 
and trouble t han taking oral corticosteroids, lead to low treatment compliance ( Ohya  et al, 
2001). Side effects caused by [CONTACT_898295], skin atrophy, and induction of 
skin infections, and the higher the potency of the TCS, the more attention is required to side 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259011] symptoms of skin 
inflammation in patients with sever e or very seve re AD ( Saeki  et al, 2016). Oral 
corticosteroids are used at the time of acute flare or for patients with severe or very severe 
AD as induction therapy. However, the use of oral corticosteroids should be minimized, 
considering systemic side effects due to long -term use such as adrena l function suppression 
and rebound phenomenon after discontin uation of treatment ( Saeki  et al, 2016). Oral 
cyclosporine is indicated only for a dult patients with severe AD who have inadequately 
responded to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_898255] s or tacrolimus ointment and have 30% or more 
skin involvement by [CONTACT_898296]. Although the efficacy of oral 
cyclosporine on eruptions has b een demonstrated, the target patients and treatment duration 
are limited because of its side effects such as renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and 
infections . 
1.3 KHK4083   
KHK4083 is a fully human, non -fucosylated IgG 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed by 
[CONTACT_898297]., Ltd  (formerly, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd) . KHK4083 binds  to OX40 
and blocks the action . It is known that the removal of the core fucose from the biantennary 
complex -type oligosaccharides attached to  the Fc region of the antibody therapeutics 
dramatically enhances the antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity 
mediated by [CONTACT_898298] γRIIIa. The mechanism of action of KHK4083 includes the 
selective depletion of activated T cells by [CONTACT_898299] T 
cell expansion.  
OX40 is known to have an important role in the signaling and induction of Th2 cells in AD 
(Guttman -Yassky  et al, 2013). KHK4083, selectively depleting OX40+ activated T cells by 
[CONTACT_138779], is expected to improve AD, which is a disease caused by [CONTACT_898300]2 cells ( Leung  
and Guttman -Yassky , 2014 ; Malajian  and Guttman -Yassky , 2015 ). 
Allergy is induced by a series of immune cascades consisting of generation of multiple 
cytokines, induction of lymphocyte activation including IgE -producing B cells, and activatio n 
of multiple immune cells including eosinophils and mast cells. As one of the triggers of the 
immune activation cascades, myeloid dendritic cells are activated by [CONTACT_898301] (TSLP) of epi[INVESTIGATOR_898256]40 ligands and CCL17 (TARC). It 
activates the activation and sustained growth of effector Th2 cells, causing induction and 
exacerbation of allergic inflammation  (Ito et al, 2005 ; Wang  et al, 2006). Immune responses 
induced by [CONTACT_898302] (e.g., Th2 inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine secretion, and 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -30-  IgE production) were inhibited in mice with OX40L -blocking ( Seshasayee  et al, 2007). These 
findings indicate that the anti -OX40 antibody KHK4083 may contribute to establish a new 
treatment strategy for AD . 
1.3.1  Non-Clinical Studies  
The generation of the KHK4083 mAb and its in vitro characterization as well as the 
nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology study reports are 
thoroughly described in the Investigator’s Brochure. All nonclinical safety studies were 
conducted in Japan, a country which is one of the mem bers of the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development Mutual Acceptance of Data Program , and were also 
conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP).  The 
nonclinical/toxicological program includes two pi[INVESTIGATOR_898257]: 
a 4-week intravenous (IV) study (SBL303 -081) and a 26 -week subcutaneous (SC) study 
(SBL303 -104).  
In Study SBL303 -081, no toxicologically significant changes were observed at doses up to 
100 mg/kg when KHK4083 ( 0, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg ) was intravenously administered to 
male and female cynomolgus monkeys once weekly for 4 weeks. In Study SBL303 -104, 
KHK4083 (0, 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered to male and female 
cynomolgus monkeys once every 2 weeks for 26  weeks. An IV group given 30 mg/kg 
KHK4083 was included to compare toxicity with the SC group. There were no toxicological 
changes in any groups including the IV group, and the no -observed -adverse -effect level 
(NOAEL) of KHK4083 was 30 mg/kg (both SC and IV) in male s and females. A 4 -week 
toxicological study of SC doses of KHK4083 (0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg ) administered every 
2 weeks was conducted by [CONTACT_2329] a highly concentrated IP formulation (Process 2 
formulation), which was expected to be used in clinical studies. The study was conducted for 
determination of local tolerance, toxicokinetic assessments, measurement of anti -KHK4083 
antibodies, and supplemental toxicological examinations. In this study, neither systemic 
toxicity nor local irritation was observed at the site of administration up to 100 mg/kg . 
1.3.2  Clinical Studies  
The Phase 1a (single ascending dose)/Phase 1b (double -blind, placebo -controlled, single 
ascending dose) study of KHK4083 in subjects with mild to moderate plaque -type psoriasis 
was conducted in Canada by [CONTACT_898303], Inc. (KKD), the 
Sponsor, and completed in Decembe r 2014 (Study 4083 -001). In this s tudy, a total of 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -31-  55 subjects received 0.003 to 10 mg/kg KHK4083 (IV dose at 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 .0, 
3.0, or 10 mg/kg and SC dose at 1 mg/kg)  (Papp  et al, 2017) . No dose -limiting toxicity was 
identified at any dose, and KHK4083 was well -tolerated.  
Currently, a Phase 2a (double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple ascending dose, long -term 
extension) study of multiple IV doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg KHK4083 or placebo is ongoing in 
66 subjects randomized with moderately active UC in Europe and the [LOCATION_002] (Study 
4083 -002).  No dose -limiting toxic ities were identified in that t rial, as per  the cut off date ( Oct 
2018 ). KHK4083 had demo nstrated reasonable safety and tolerability  in subject s with UC. 
In Japan , a Phase 1 ( Study 4083 -003), single -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, single -
dose or open -label multiple -dose study of KHK4083 in healthy male adults and subjects with  
moderately active UC was conducted by [CONTACT_898304], the Sponsor, and  complete d the last protocol -
specified exa mination  in February 2018 . In Part 1 of the study, 32 Japanese  subjects  (8 
subjects [KHK4083, 6  subjects; placebo, 2 subjects] per cohort × 4 ) or 16 Caucasian  subjects  
(8 subjects [KHK4083, 6 subjects; placebo, 2 subjects]  per cohort × 2 ) receive d a single  IV 
infusion (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) or SC injection (3 mg/kg) of KHK4083 in a placebo -controlled, 
single -blind manner. In Part 2 of the study, 8 subjects with UC receive d multiple IV infusions 
of 10  mg/kg KHK4083  in an open -label manner.  No dose -limiting toxicity was observed 
during a 6 -week open -label treatment period when 3  IV doses were administered every 2 
weeks at dose  of 10 mg/kg and during a [ADDRESS_1259012] s with moderately 
active UC, and the efficacy of KHK4083 was demonstrated in  subjects with UC . 
In addition, a Phase 1  (Study 4083 -004), open -label, repeated -dose study  of KHK4083 in 
subjects with mo derate to severe AD was conducted in Japan by [CONTACT_898304], the Sponsor, and 
complete d the last protocol -specified examination  in February 2018. In Study 4083 -004, a 
total of 22 subjects received multiple IV doses of 10 mg /kg KHK4083 . In this study, the 
safety and tolerability of KHK4083 were demonstrated during a 6 -week open -label treatment 
period when 3 IV doses (10 mg/kg) were  administered every 2  weeks . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_898258] t he efficacy of KHK 4083 was  demonstrated in these subjects over the 
course of the treatment and 16-week follow -up period s.

CONFIDENTIAL  -32-  1.4 Risks and Benefit s 
1.4.1  Risks  
As a result of an overall evaluation of safety data obtained from the clinical studies of 
KHK4083, “infusion /injection -related reactions”  were defined as identified  risks of 
KHK4083 and “reactivation of latent infections and development of new infections” were 
defined as potential risks of KHK4083.  
1.4.[ADDRESS_1259013] the 
various aspects of patients’ daily life such as sleep ( Zuberbier  et al, 2006 ). 
The potential benefit of treatment with KHK4083 is to improve skin symptoms in patients 
with AD, which is mainly caused by [CONTACT_78443]2 cells ( Leung  and Guttman -Yassky , 2014 ; Malajian  
and Guttman -Yassky , 2015). Continuation of therapy is expected to sustain improved skin 
symptoms and also improve other symptoms of AD .

CONFIDENTIAL  -37-  3.1.1  Screening Period  
The Investigator will register subjects who provide written informed consent in an interactive 
web response system (IWRS) to start screening those subjects within [ADDRESS_1259019]’s signature [CONTACT_898340].  Subjects will undergo baseline assessments at 
least [ADDRESS_1259020] 1 week before baseline visit through Week 36 assessment.  
3.1.2  Treatmen t Period (Day 1 to Week 36)  
Randomization will be performed within 3 days after baseline visit.  
Subjects will start study treatment on the day of or the day after randomization (date of the 
first dose of IP will be regarded as Day 1). The treatment period is defined as the period 
between Day 1 and the end of the Week 36 assessmen t. 
The study consists of 2 treatment periods .  
Treatment A period  (last dose at Week 16)  
All subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion crit eria during the 
screen phase will be randomized to one of the treatment groups (placebo, KHK4083 150 mg 
Q4W , 300 mg Q2W, 600  mg Q2W, or 600 mg Q4W). In the 150 mg Q4W group and the 
600 mg Q4W group, placebo will be administered between KHK4083 injections t o ensure 
blinding.  
Treatment A period  is defined as the period between Day 1 and Week 18 pre  (before IP 
administration at Week 18) .  
In order to ensure the study blind, the efficacy data until Week 16 shall be entered into the 
electronic Clinical Outcome A ssessment (eCOA) .  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -38-  Treatment B period (last dose at Week 34)  
Treatment B  period  is an extension phase where all subjects will receive KHK4083 for an 
additional 18  weeks under double -blind conditions (from Week [ADDRESS_1259021]  [IP administration at 
Week 18] through  Week 36).  
In Treatment B  period , subjects randomized to the placebo group in Treatment A period  will 
receive SC injections of 600 mg KHK4083 every 2 weeks starting at Week 18. Subjects 
randomized to any of the KHK4083 groups in Treatment A period  will rec eive KHK4083 at 
the same dose and dosing interval as in Treatment A period . 
Subjects who meet withdrawal criterion 5) (Section 4.4.1 ) based on the IGA score at 
Week  26 will discontinue IP administration at Week 26, undergo end -of-study assessments, 
and then be withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects receiving rescue treatment  (See Section 6.3.3 ) during the period between the start of 
IP administration and the end of the Week 36 assessment will discontinue IP, undergo end -
of-study assessments, and subsequently be withdrawn from the study . 
3.1.3  Follow -up Period (up to Week 56)  
Subjects will enter the follow -up period after the end of the Week 36 assessment and will be 
followed up every 4 weeks until Week 56. Subjects who received rescue treatment  after 
Week 36  will not be withdrawn from the study and will be observed until the end of the study 
up to Week 56.  
3.1.4  Other Potential Study Assessments  (optional)  
Sampling for exploratory biomarker s: Exploratory biomarkers to characte rize KHK4083 
pharmacodynamic activity will be assessed . At selected investigative sites in the United 
States and Canada, blood and skin samples will be collected from subjects who voluntarily 
provide consent to undergo both serum analyses ( including but no t limited to serum cytokines 
and chemokines) and skin biopsy. At all investigative sites in Japan, blood and skin samples 
will be collected from subjects who voluntarily provide consent to undergo both flow 
cytometry (OX40 -positive T cell and cutaneous lym phocyte -associated antigen [CLA] -
positive memory T cell) and skin biopsy . 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -39-  Pharmacogenetic testing:  The purpose of this assessment  is to explore the association 
between individual differences in responses to KHK4083 and mutations in DNA sequence. 
Blood samp les will be collected before IP injection at Week [ADDRESS_1259022] 
the efficacy , will be prohibited from 1 week before the start of IP administratio n until the end 
of the treatment period. During this period, an emollient will be used instead of TCSs. 
In a Phase 1 study (Study 4083 -004), a total of 3 doses of 10 mg/kg KHK4083 were 
intravenously administered every [ADDRESS_1259023] improvement of skin 
symptoms was sustained even in a 16 -week follow -up period after the end of treatment with 
KHK4083. On the basis of this finding, a placebo -controlled  treatment phase (Treatment A) 
will be followed by [CONTACT_1629] 18 -week extension phase ( Treatment B period ) in this study so as to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of the long -term administration of KHK4083 after the 
primary efficacy evaluation at Week  16. In addit ion, as with Study [ADDRESS_1259024] completed assessments 
at Week 16 and Week 36 to obtain preliminary information for planning a future study of 
KHK4083 for the treatment of AD . 
3.3 Enrollment  
A total of approximately 250 subjects with moderate to severe AD will be enrolled in this 
study.  
The Investigator  will enroll subjects according to the following procedure.  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -40-  1) Before starting the study -specific procedures, written informed consent (or assent, if 
applicable) should be o btained from potentially eligible subjects.  
2) At each investigative site, a subject identifier (ID) will be assigned through the IWRS to 
each subject who provides consent, according to the following rule. The same ID will be 
used from the time of informed co nsent through the end of the study.  
ID: 4083 -006-XX-YY-ZZ 
XX: Country code ( e.g., JP, Japan , US, the [LOCATION_002] , CA , Canada,  GE, [LOCATION_013] ) 
YY: Investigative site code  
ZZ: Sequential number for subjects providing consent at the investigative site  
For exam ple, the subject ID of the first subject who provides consent at ### hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(investigative site code: 01) in Japan is 4083 -006-JP-01-01. 
3) Subjects will be assessed for eligibility.  
4) Eligible subjects will be registered as an enrolled subject in the IWRS.  
5) A subject who is not eligible may be re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator  after 
re-obtaining written informed consent. Subjects will be permitted to be re -screened only 
once. Chest X ray (or CT scan) at re -screening may be omitted upon consultation with the 
Sponsor only if there are no findings suggestive of tuberculosis ( TB) at the initial 
screening . The subject ID of re -screened subjects will be the same as that initiall y 
assigned.  
Details of the subject enrollment method are specified in separate written procedures.  
3.4 Randomization and Blinding   
3.4.1  Randomization  
Randomization will be performed through the IWRS in the order of enrollment. Subjects who 
meet all of the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 150 mg Q4W , 300 mg 
Q2W, 600 mg Q2W , or 600 mg Q4W  KHK4083 or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 :1 ratio by  [CONTACT_898306] a dynamic allocation procedure. Randomization will be performed within 3 days 
after baseline assessments. The severity of AD (moderate, IGA=3; severe, IGA=4)  at baseline , 
region (Japan, rest of world ), and previous use of biological products (Yes, No)  for the 
treatment of AD  at baseline will be used as stratification factors for randomization  by 
[CONTACT_898307] . Detailed written procedures for randomization will be provided  separately  
from the protocol . 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259025]  treatment arm allocation and 
at the same time indicated drug number (Kit  No.) to be dispensed. The Kit No. shall be 
entered into the electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF ). 
3.4.2  Blinding  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Creation and Storage of Allocation Table  
PAREXEL International Inc ., Japan  will prepare a drug randomization list and allocate IP to 
each subject with the IWRS according to separate written procedures.  
The drug randomization will be adaptive based on separ ate written procedures.  The subject  
treatment group  will be allocated by [CONTACT_898308]. 
PAREXEL International Inc., Japan  will create treatment assignment list that will be 
provided at the interim analysis  following separate written procedures  and will provide a 
record of emergency unblinding from the  IWRS as required . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blinding Method  
The st udy will be blinded to all  study personnel/consultants, investigative site personnel, and 
study subjects.  However, the study will be unblinded to selected personnel as follows.  
In this study, a pharmacist who is unblinded to treatment assignment (“unblinded 
pharmacist”) (or qualifi ed designee) will be registered at each investigative site beforehand. 
The unblinded pharmacist (or qualified designee) will prepare the IP dose for SC injection 
according to the assigned treatment. Details are specified in the Pharmacy Manual, which is 
separately provided.  
Persons to be unblinded from the start of this study include unblinded pharmacist  (or 
qualified designee) , unblinded drug supply managers responsible for managing IP logistics  
and unblinded monitor  responsible for monitoring the IP is st ored, controlled  and prepared 
according to the procedures of the Contract Research Organization (CRO), and safety 
personnel of the Sponsor who reports certain serious adverse events ( SAE s) to the regulatory 
authorities ; and persons to be unblinded after the interim analysis at Week 16 include 
personnel  at interim analysis center of CRO and person responsible for PK and biomarkers of 
the Sponsor.  The individuals will be identified in the separate document of Blinding Pla n and 
Unblinding Processes.  
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259026]  
(or qualified designee)  will be given information  on the IP allocation electronically via the 
IWRS.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Measures Taken to Maintain Blindness  Assignment Based on 
Known Information on KHK4083  
Test results on serum KHK4083 concentrations, anti -KHK4083 antibodies, TARC, serum 
total IgE, OX40 -positive cells in skin and peripheral blood, and CLA -positive memory T 
cells in peripheral blood  (Japan only ) may unblind the subject treatment group based on 
serum drug concentration, immune response or KHK4083 mechanism of action . Therefore, 
those results must not be provided to the Investigator  or site staff, who  are involved in 
treatment or clinical assessme nts of subjects, or Sponsor/CRO personnel (except personnel at 
interim analysis center of CRO and person responsible for PK and biomarkers of the 
Sponsor) until the study is unblinded by [CONTACT_1034], with the exception of when the 
knowledge of the test res ult is necessary to ensure subject safety or to submit an expedited 
report of a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) to the Regulatory 
agencies . The Investigator  must notify the Sponsor if they become aware of any test result 
regardless of the reason.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unblinding  
The Sponsor reserves the right to  unblind an individual subject 's treatment for the purposes of 
fulfilling regulatory requirements for expedited reporting  of adverse events ( AEs) and/or 
subject  safety. A subject’s treatment assignment should only b e unblinded by [CONTACT_898309]/or subsequent cohorts.  The 
emergency unblinding process  will be identified in the separate document of Emergency 
Unblinding Procedure . 
In the following cases, the Investigator  will immediately notify the Sponsor and withdraw the 
relevan t subject from the study . 
• Any study staff (the  Principal Investigator , sub -Investigator, or clinical research 
coordinator) other than the unblinded pharmacist becomes aware of the treatment 
assignment of the subject.  
• The knowledge of the treatment group of the subject is necessary to take measures 
against a TEAE. (The Investigator  should report to the Sponsor before disclos ing the 
emergency key code.)  
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259027] completed the scheduled assessments and the database has been 
locked, the study will be unblinded to all study personnel . 
3.5 Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Sponsor and CRO will monitor subjects’ safety and compliance with the protocol (e.g., 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, concomitant medications, and st udy visits) according to the 
procedures of the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor has primary responsibility for the ongoing medical review of safety data 
throughout the study.  
Recommendations will be made with the input of the Medical Monitor to the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223458] .  
Currently, based on safety observations from existing clinical trials, the infusion or injection  
reactions are identified as AE of special interest for KHK4083. However, the following 
safety events will also be considered as  AEs of special interest . Detailed written procedures 
for the follow -up AEs of special interest will be provided separately from the protocol . 
• Malignancy  
• Infec tions (particularly TB , serious infections, opportunistic infections, or infections 
requiring systemic antibiotic therapy)  
• Injection site reactions  
• Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)  
• Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic and serum sickness -like reactions)  
• Neuropsychiatric events ( including suicidal ideation and behavior)  
3.5.[ADDRESS_1259028] 30 minut es after IP administration.  However, subjects will stay longer at the site for 
observation whenever it is clinically required and at the discretion and clinical judgment of 
the Investigator.  Refer to Section 6.2.3  for detail on measures to be taken for acute reactions. 
No pre -medication (e.g., acetaminophen, anti -emetic; 5HT3 blocker; histamine H1 and/or H2 
blocker[s]) is planned to be routinely/prophylactically administered prior to IP administration 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -44-  in this study. However, pre -medication may be used prior to IP administration as per the 
decision of the Investigator  upon approval of the Sponsor; or the Sponsor may recommend 
the pretreatment of subjects to the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_898260]  (Grade 1 ) and/or 
moderate  (Grade 2 ) injection reactions are observed during the course of the study . Refer to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting an injection -related  reaction  including descriptions of specific 
symptoms observed or reported by [CONTACT_423].  
Each investigative site must have trained staff and immediate access to emergency supplies 
and equipment including, but are not limited to, drugs needed to treat a subject in case of a 
life threatening emergency.

The volume of SC injection will be 6 mL (divided into  three  syringes) per dose regardless of 
treatment assigned to subject. Each subject will r eceive three SC injections of [ADDRESS_1259046] (or qualified designee) at each investigative site will 
withdraw the required amount of IP from des ignated 7 vials into syringes . The method of IP 
administration is specified in the Pharmacy Manual.  
The Principal Investigator, sub -Investigator, clinical research coordinator (nurse), or other 
healthcare professional will administer IP subcutaneously in t he abdomen, thigh, upper arm, 
or other appropriate sites. The site of injection should be rotated so that IP is not injected into 
the same site consecutively. Before IP administration, the Investigator should make sure that 
there are no skin disorders such  as erythema, redness, pain, or swelling in the area for 
injection . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1259047] can be rechallenged with IP. Subjects will discontinue IP 
according to the withdrawal criteria, as indicated in Section  4.4.1 , if two consecutive doses

(both A and B)  due to the reason other than the logistical issues caused by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_1259048] after injection as speci fied below.  
Day 1, Weeks 2, 18, and 20 : Vital signs will be measured before IP administration. Subjects 
will remain and be monitored at the investigative site for at least 2 hours  after IP 
administration. In addition, vital signs  will be measured 2 hours  (±10  minutes) after IP 
administration.   
Week s 4 and 22 : Vital signs will be measured before IP administration. Subjects will remain 
and be monitored at the investigative site for at least 2 hours after IP administration.  
Administr ation time points other than above:  Vital signs will be measured before IP 
administration. Subjects will remain and be monitored at the investigative site for at least 
30 minutes  after IP administration.  However, subjects will stay longer at the site for 
observation whenever it is clinically required and at the discretion and clinical judgment of 
the Investigator.  
No pre -medication (e.g., acetaminophen, anti-emetic; 5HT3 blocker; histamine H1 and/or H2 
blocker[s]) is planned to be routinely/prophylactically  administered prior to KHK4083 
injection in this study. However, appropriate measures should be selected to treat individual 
subjects at the discretion of the Investigator  upon approval of the Sponsor . If consistent mild  
(Grade 1)  and/or moderate (Grade 2)  injection reactions are observed, the Sponsor may 
recommend the pretreatment of subjects to the Principal Investigator . 
Any subject experiencing an acute reaction must receive immediate medical assessment and 
indicated supportive management according to t he institutional standard of care and local 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_898267]/symptoms of the reaction have resolved . Refer 
to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for reporting an injection -related  reaction including descriptions of specific 
symptoms observed or reported by [CONTACT_546569]. 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259049] OX40 was saturated at approximately 10  μg/mL 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the Investigator’s Brochure Edition 07). The ADCC activity of 
KHK4083 almost reached the maximum at approximately 1 μg/mL (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the 
Investigator’s Brochure Edition 07). In Study 4083 -004, the amount of unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_620368]40 
recovered from around Week 14, and the serum concentration at the same time point was also 
around 10 μg/mL  (Figure 6.2.4 -1). The effective serum concentration in patients with AD 
was thus estimated to be 10  μg/mL. The comparison of serum concentration betwee n 
observed values and the median of a [ADDRESS_1259050] simulation (solid line; dotted line = 5 and 
95 percentiles) is shown  in Figure 6.2.4 -1.

Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -59-  The trough concentration following multiple SC doses of KHK4083 every 2 or 4 weeks was 
simulated using the population PK parameters in patients with AD and the PK parameters of 
absorption phase after SC dosing in Study 4083 -003 ( Figure 6.2.4 -2). The trough 
concentration at week 16 was expected to reach the estimated effective serum concentration 
(10 µg/mL) in almost all patients with AD at 300 mg Q2W, 600 mg Q4W, and 600 mg Q2W. 
On the other hand, the serum trough concentration of KHK4083 at week 16 was estimated to 
exceed 10 µg/mL in only 20% of the patients at [ADDRESS_1259051] antibodies is approximately 10% ( Lobo  et al, 2004; Wang  et al, 2008 ), 
when the serum concentrat ion of KHK4083 exceeded 100 µg/mL, the estimated effective 
concentration was expected to be achieved also in the skin, which is the site of the disease, 
providing an additional pharmacological effect. The serum trough concentration at week 16 
was estimated to exceed 100 µg/mL in 50% o f the patients at 600 mg Q2W .

Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -71-  7.3.1  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  
In the EASI assessment, the severity of 4 elements of eczema (erythema, 
induration/papulation, excori ation, and lichenification) at each of 4 body regions (head and 
neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) will be a ssessed on a scale of 0 to 3 
(0 = None , 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe). Half scores (1.5 and 2.5) are allowed, with 
the ex ception of 0.5. Any signs must be at least 1 (mild) in severity (see  Appendix 1). In 
addition, the extent of eczema at each of the 4 body regions will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 
6 (0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 9%, 2 = 10% to 29% , 3 = 30% to 49% , 4 = 50% to 69%, 5 = 70% to 
89%, 6 = 90% to 100%).  
Scores calculated according to the expression “total score of 4 elements of eczema × area 
score of eczema” will be mul tiplied by 0.1 for head and neck, 0.2 for upper extremities, 0.3 
for trunk, and 0.4 for lower extremities. The 4 region scores obtained will then be summed up 
(maximum score: 72)  as EASI score . To ensure consistent evaluation, individual subjects 
should be evaluated by [CONTACT_109426] (whenever possible) at baseline and all subsequent 
visits. The Investigator  will complete the EASI assessment  on the eCOA device at each visit.  
Time points: scree ning, baseline, Week 1 to 56 , early termination . 
7.3.2  SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)  
In the SCORAD assessment, the extent of AD will be calculated as the sum of the percentage 
of each defined body area, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the o verall 
SCORAD calculation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD will be assessed using the 
following scale: 0  = none, 1  = mild, 2  = moderate, 3  = severe, with a maximum score of 
18 (assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). Itch and sleeple ssness will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_388149] a visual analogue scale (VAS) , where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) 
and [ADDRESS_1259066] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum score of 20 (assigned 
as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The SCORAD s core is calculated as A/5 + 7B/2 
+ C. 
Refer to Appendix 2 for the SCORAD assessment tool.  Subjects will complete SCORAD (C)  
on the eCOA device at each visit before the assessments of EASI, SCORAD (A and B), IGA, 
and BSA. To ensure consistent evaluat ion, individual subjects should have the same 
representative area evaluated by [CONTACT_109426] (whenever possible) at baseline and at all 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -72-  subsequent visits. The Investigator  will complete the SCORAD assessment on the eCOA 
device at each visit.  
Time point s: screening, baseline, Week 1 to 56, early termination . 
7.3.3  Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA)  
In the IGA, t he Investigator  will evaluate the overall skin symptoms of subjects at each visit 
on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) .  
Refer to Appendix 3 for the IGA assessment tool.  To ensure consistent evaluation, individual 
subjects should be evaluated by [CONTACT_109426] (wheneve r possible) at all visits.  The 
Investigator  will complete IGA  on the eCOA device at each visit.  
Time points: screening, baseline, Week 1 to 56, early termination.  
7.3.4  Body Surface Area of Involvement of AD  (BSA)  
The Investigator  will calculate the percentage ( %) of the total body surface area affected by 
[CONTACT_898314].  To ensure consistent evaluation, 
individual subjects should be evaluated by [CONTACT_109426] (whenever possible) at all visits.  
Time points: screening, baseline, Week 1 to 56, early termination . 
7.3.5  Pruritus  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  
The worst degree of i tch experienced during 24 hours before the time point will be assessed 
on a NRS (see  Appendix 4). The degree of itch wil l be scored on an 11-point scale , with 0 
being “no itch” and 10 being the “worst itch imaginable.”  
Subjects will complete pruritus NRS on the eCOA  device at each visit before the assessments 
of EASI, SCORAD  (A and B) , IGA, and BSA.  
Time points: screening, baseline, Week 1 to 56, early termination . 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -73-  7.3.6  Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  
Daily sleep disturbance in the last 24 hours before the relevant time point will be assessed on 
a NRS (see  Appendix 5). Subjects will score the degree of their sleep disturbance on a n 11-
point scale ranging from ‘no sleep loss’ (0) to ‘I cannot sleep at all’ (10).  
Subjects should complete the sleep disturban ce NRS on the eCOA  device at each visit before 
the assessments of EASI, SCORAD  (A and B), IGA, and BSA . 
Time points: screening, baseline, Week 1 to 56 , early termination.  
7.3.7  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The effects of skin symptoms on daily living in the last 1 week will be assessed by [CONTACT_148676] (see  
Appendix 6). DLQI consists of 6 subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, 
work and school, personal relationships, and treatment), which are scored on the basis of 
10 questions.  The scoring of each question is as follows:  
Response  Score

7.7 Pharmacogenetic s 
The purpose of the pharmacogenetic  testing  is to explore the association between individual 
difference s in responses to KHK4083 (e.g.,  efficacy, adverse drug reactions, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics) and mutations in DNA se quence (e.g.,  genetic 
polymorphism). Only subjects who provide additional consent to participation in the study 
and to the collection, storage, and use of blood samples for pharmacogeneti c testing will be 
involved in this exploratory assessment . 
Blood  samplin g for the pharmacogeneti c testing  should be completed be fore IP 
administration at Day [ADDRESS_1259068] the sample -archiving facility to destroy the relevant 
samples. The sample -archiving facility will destroy the samples and submit a certificate of 
destruction to the Sponsor. The Sponsor will designate a biobanking manager . 
The pharmacogeneti c testing using archived samples will be conducted only if the Sponsor 
considers it useful to explore mutatio ns in DNA sequence (e.g.,  genetic polymorphism) that 
are associated with responses to KHK4083. Candidate genes may include, but are not limited 
to, IL-4R, FLG, IL -4, IL -13, SPI[CONTACT_66150]5, and STAT 6. 
When the s chedule or contents of pharmacogenetic testing using samples is specified, a 
“Pharmacogenetic Tes ting Protocol” will also be prepared before the testing is initiated. 
Measurement of pharmacogenetics will be conducted by [CONTACT_18484] a company working 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -78-  with the Sponsor. The results of this pharmacogenetics may be reported separately and may 
not form pa rt of the Clinical Study Report.  
The scientific reliability, such as accuracy or certainty, of resu lts obtained from 
pharmacogeneti c testing using archived samples is unknown at present. Therefore, any 
obtained results ( e.g., pharmacogen etic test results) will not be disclosed to subjects. 
However, the obtained information will be disclosed to subjects (1) when the subject requests 
disclosure of test results according to laws related to personal information protection and the 
claim is considered to meet rel evant requirements; or (2) when an ethics review committee 
established by [CONTACT_898315]. As a general rule, the information will be disclosed only to the 
subject in both c ases.  
The samples derived from the subjects who have provide d consent for the storage and use of 
samples for pharmacogen etics will be stored for [ADDRESS_1259069] schedule provided in Section 7.1. Samples should be collected before IP 
injection if  the admi nistration of IP is scheduled at  the same time.

at screeni ng, baseline , Week s 18 and 36 . 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259072]. Vital signs will be measured at all study visits for screening and during the 
treatment period and the follow -up period. Vital signs should be measured before IP i njection 
if the administration of IP is scheduled at the same time. In addition, on Day 1 and at 
Weeks  2, 18 , and 20, vital signs should be measured 2 hours  (±10  minutes) after IP 
administr ation . 
Additional vital sign measurements will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator  if 
any clinically significant signs or symptoms occur.  Refer to Section 6.2.3  for detail on 
measures to be taken for acute reactions.

unfavorable and/or unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal labor atory finding), symptom or 
disease whether or not considered related to the product.  
An AE i ncludes but is not limited to : 
• Any clinically significant* worsening of a pre -existing condition ;  
• A clinically significant* new/worsened laboratory abnormality ; 
• Any clinically important changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
12-lead ECGs, X -rays, or any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these  
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760];  
• An AE occurring from overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that prescribed by a 
healthcare professional for clinical reasons, or a dose higher than that described on the 
marketed product label) of an investigational or marketed product, whether accidental 
or intentional;  
• An AE occurring f rom abuse (e.g., use for non -clinical reasons) of an investigational 
or marketed product.  
*Clinically significant may include, but is not limited to, abnormalities that meet the 
definition of “serious” (see Section 7.9.5 ), or an event that leads to an intervention such as  
premature discontinuation of I P or the addition of concomitant/corrective therapy.  
The collection of AE and SAE information commenc es following the subject’s written 
consent to participa te in the study. The Investigator  will inquire about AEs at all subject visits 
by [CONTACT_63397] a non -leading question such as: “How have you been feeling since your 
last visit?” Al l AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_849689], must be 
collected. If a subject  experiences an AE or SAE, the subject will receive appropriate 
treatment and support ive care as necessary, and the Investigator  will continue to follow up 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259075]’s baseline condition, or until a clinically satisfactory 
resolution is achieved.  
In addition to the Investigator ’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be coded by [CONTACT_898316] (MedDRA) .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Intensity  
All AEs will be classified either as  Grade 1 to 5  in intensity as defined below:  
• Grade 1 (Mild ) − Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
• Grade  2 (Moderate ) − Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) (e.g., preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money).  
• Grade  3 − Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden).  
• Grade  4 − Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade  5 − Death related to a n AE (fatal) . 
The Investigator  will be instructed to closely monitor  each subject who experiences a n AE 
(whether ascribed to the IP  or not ) until the outcome of the AE has been determined. The AE 
must be monitored until the return to the subject’s baseline condition or until clinically 
satisfactory resolution is achieved (e.g., Grade 1 or stable).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Relationship to Study Treatmen t 
The causal relationship to study treatment  should be assessed as one of the following:  
• Related  − There is a reasonable causal relationship between the IP administration and 
the AE. The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship.  
• Not related  − There is not a reasonable causal relationship between t he IP administration 
and the AE.  
• Unknown  − The causal relationship cannot be determined.  
7.9.5  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE  is an event defined as below.  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  − The term “life -threatening” as part of the definition of “serious” 
refers to an event in  which the subject was at risk of immediate death at the time of the 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -85-  event; it does not  refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe;  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869]  − Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_898271];  
• Persistent  or significant disability  
• Congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
• Other medically important  are those that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
or blood dyscrasias that does not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
All AE s, whether non -serious or serious, must b e recorded on the AE page of the eCRF . In 
addition, any AE  that is initially considered serious or becomes serious m ust be reported on 
the SAE  form . The SAE information entered on the eCRF must be consistent with the 
information entered on the SAE form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs require expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. Any SAE 
occurring in a clinical study and follow -up must be reported to the Sponsor or designee

7.9.6  Definition of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is herein defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject who received an IP (KHK4083 or placebo). A TEAE can therefore be 
any unfavorable or unintended signs (including any abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, 
or disease that occurred a fter treatment with the IP, whether or not considered related to the 
IP.  
A TEAE of which causal relationship to IP is assessed as “related” or “unknown” is defined 
as a drug -related TEAE.  
Results of laboratory tests will be checked against the normal ran ge for any deviations 
(abnormal test results) and any abnormal test results will be compared with those obtained 
prior to treatment with the IP to determine whether such a change is clinically significant 
(abnormal change).  
Any abnormal changes in signs, symptoms, and laboratory data associated with a disease 
(diagnosis) are regarded as a n AE whose name [CONTACT_898345]. If an injection  
reaction  occurs, the presenting signs or symptoms of the reaction will be regarded as TEAEs 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Any individual atypi[INVESTIGATOR_898272], separately from the diagnos is. 
7.9.7  Definition of Other Significant Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
Other significant TEAEs are defined as any non -serious TEAEs that lead to interruption or 
discontinuation of IP.  
7.9.8  Other Significant Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events Requiring 
Special Han dling  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Injection -related  Reactions   
The signs and symptoms of an injectio n reaction usually develop shortly after drug injection 
and generally resolved completely within 24 hours of completion of the injection.  The 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -88-  presenting sign or symptom should be reported as TEAE term(s) . Acute injection 
reactions should not be classified a s anaphylaxis unless symptomatic bronchospasm and/or 
allergy -related edema/angioedema is/are the principal clinical manifestation(s). Refer to 
Appendix 7 for the clinical criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis.  
The time of onset of the injection reaction  or injection site reaction  and the time of outcome 
identification should be entered into the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose  
Overdoses should be reported, whether or not the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE, 
using an SAE form within 24 hours of the Investigator having knowledge of the error. Follow 
the SAE reporting instructions in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy in a female subject  or partner of a male subject  must be avoided.  
When a female study subject  reports a pregnancy : The subject must be advised by [CONTACT_898317]. The Investigator  is obligated to 
immediately report to the  Sponsor or designee any pregnancy occurring at any time after the 
subjec t signs the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) and within [ADDRESS_1259082]  reports a pregnancy of a female partner : The subject must be 
advised by [CONTACT_898318] s his partner became pregnant after the 
subject received  IP. The Investigator  is obligated to immed iately report to the Sponsor or 
designee any  pregnancy occurring at any time after the start of IP administration  and within 
[ADDRESS_1259083] reports a pregnancy (or a male study  subject reports a 
pregnancy of  a female partner), I P administration should be stopped immediately for the 
female subject and a pregnancy  test should be arranged for the female  subject/female partner 
by [CONTACT_898319]  (7) days of the pregnan cy being reported. In the case of 
pregnancy, the Investigator  must immediately notify the Sponsor of this event and report the 
pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. This includes a study subject as well as the 
partner of a study subject who becomes  pregnant while the subject was receiving IP. If a 
partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, voluntary written informed consent (a separate 
ICF will be provided) should be obtained from the partner before conducting necessary

Safety data will  be summarized and reported as required by [CONTACT_12721].  
8 DATA MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Source Documents (Source Data)  
Subjects’ data are obtained from source documents, where data are first recorded. These 
include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] (from which medical history and previous and 
concurrent medication may be summarized into the eCRF), clinical and office charts, 
laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence.  
All documents will be stored safely in confidential conditions. On all trial -specific documents, 
other than the signed consent, the subject will be referred to by [CONTACT_898320], not by [CONTACT_2300].  
8.[ADDRESS_1259084] (HIPAA), the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR), and  their implementing regulations. During the Sponsor’s 
monitoring and auditin g, the IRB/IEC’s review, and inspections by [CONTACT_898321], the Investigator  and the investigative site should allow them direct 
access to (and copying of, if required) all study -related records including source documents.  
8.3 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs)  
An electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for collecting data in this study. The 
EDC system allows each investigative site to enter data in the eCRF, check the input data, 
and respond to the Sponsor’s inquiries o n the input data, as well as to append electronic 
signatures. The entered data will be encrypted and transferred to the EDC server via the 
Internet. This EDC system is designed to meet requirements and guidelines of regulatory 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -90-  agencies ( Food and Drug Admin istration [FDA], Code of Federal Regulations [CFR], Title 
21, ICH GCP, European Medicines Agency [ EMA ] and Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare [ MHLW ]). 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_898273], after ascertaining that 
all data are accurate and complete, append his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_898346]. If an eCRF is filled out by a sub -Investigator or clinical research coordinator, the 
Princi pal Investigator  will check the accuracy and completeness of data prior to appending 
his/her electronic signature. The Guide for Changes or Corrections to an Electronic Case 
Report Form, which will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034], must be followed to fill out t he eCRF.  
In this study, the subject data stored in the EDC server will be regarded as the original eCRF. 
In this regard, however, once the eCRF data are relocated to a non -rewritable medium (e.g., 
DVD), or to the electronic document control system, the dat a in such medium/system will be 
handled as the original. Data should be migrated to the electronic document control system 
according to prespecified written procedures.  
The Sponsor will provide a copy of eCRFs and change or correction histories to each 
investigative site.  
By [CONTACT_12570], the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_898274], rules, 
and regulations. In addition for the investigativ e sites in the [LOCATION_002], compliance is 
required with all applicable provisions of the HIPAA and its implementing regulations.  
The Principal Investigator , sub -Investigator, or clinical research coordinator will change or 
correct entries in the eCRF acc ording to the Guide for Changes or Corrections to an 
Electronic Case Report Form  provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The change or correction history to 
the eCRF is automatically recorded on the EDC system.  
8.[ADDRESS_1259085] as source data, paper instruments will not be used and will 
not be available as source documents.  
The eCOA system consists of an eCOA device and an eCOA server.  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -91-  The eCOA device, which will be used by [CONTACT_898322] , provid es functions such 
as entering data, checking entered  data, and obtaining audit trails on entered data. Data that 
are entered are transferred to and saved on the eCOA server. In addition, the investigative 
sites and the Sponsor are allowed to access data th rough the eCOA system on the eCOA 
server.  
The eCOA device will be provided to each investigative site. The Investigator  will complete 
EASI, IGA, BSA and SCORAD (A and B)  data on the eCOA device at each visit . Subjects 
will complete pruritus NRS, sleep dist urbance NRS, SCORAD (C) , and DLQI data and 
record emollient  use on the eCOA device  at each visit. Written procedures provided by [CONTACT_898323]. Data cannot be changed or 
corrected by [CONTACT_898324].  
If any change or correction is required for data saved on the eCOA server, the Principal 
Investigator , sub -Investigator, or clinical research coordinator will change or correct the 
relevant data according to wr itten procedures provided by [CONTACT_1034]. Histories of changes 
or corrections on the eCOA system will be obtained by [CONTACT_1190].  
If the eCOA is filled out by a sub -Investigator, the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_898275].  
Since the eCOA system uses the device, data (including audit trails) saved on the eCOA 
device will be regarded as source data from data entry into the device until data transfer to the 
eCOA system, and data on the eCOA  server will be regarded as source data after data transfer 
to the eCOA system. If data (including audit trails) on the eCOA server are migrated to a 
non-rewritable medium (e.g., CD -R, DVD -R), data on the medium will be regarded as source 
data and provided  to the investigative site. The Sponsor will retain a copy of the source data.

presented along with TEAEs that occur after the start of administr ation of IP  in the whole 
study period.  
As for safety assessments other than TEAEs, they will be presented for each treatment group .  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -95-  [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
All TEAEs will be summarized for each treatment group. The incidence of TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_898329], by [CONTACT_88462] (PT). 
Multiple occurrences of TEAEs of the same term and classification in the same subject  will 
be counted only once. The latest version of MedDRA at the time of database lock will be 
used for coding TEAE s. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Values  
Laboratory test values will be listed. Descriptive statistics of continuous variables at each 
time point (scheduled visit  until Week 56) will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Categorical

The descriptive statistics of serum KHK4083 concentration s at each blood sampling point 
will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Plots of serum KHK4083 concentration -time profiles 
will be prepared.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Pharmacokinetics Parameters Calc ulated from Serum KHK4083 
Concentrations  
PK parameters (e.g., C max, Ctrough) will be calculated from serum KHK4083 concentrations for 
4 treatment groups (KHK4083 150 mg Q4W, 300 mg Q2W, 600 mg Q2W, or 600 mg Q4W)

CONFIDENTIAL  -96-  and will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. For the Q2W treatment groups (KHK4083 300 mg 
Q2W and 600 mg Q2W), t he C max will be calculated only after administration of KHK4083 
on Week  1 and Week  14. Following a single SC administration of KHK4083, the mean t max 
was approximately 1 week (5.2 day , 7.0 d ay: minimum , maximum) in Study 4083 -001 and 
Study 4083 -003 ( preliminary unaudited data) , thus the C max for Week  1 and Week  14 
administrations will be defined as observed KHK4083 concentration at Week 1 (Day 8) and 
Week 15 (Day  106) within the acceptable ranges  (±3 days), respectively. The C trough will be 
defined as the observed KHK4083 concentrations at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 
22, 24, 26, 28, 32 , and 36. Accumulation ratio based on C max and C trough will be calculate d 
using each PK parameters in Week  1 and Week  14 administrations . For the Q4W  treatment 
groups (KHK4083 150 mg Q4W and 600 mg Q4W), the C max for Week 1 and Week 14 
administrations will be defined as observed maximum KHK4083 concentration after 
administrat ion. The C trough will be defined as the observed KHK4083 co ncentrations at  Weeks 
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36.

Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -97-  9.2 Target Number of Subjects  
A total of approximately 250 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 
4 active treatment groups (50 subjects in each group) or one placebo group (50 subjects) in 
Treatment  A period . 
9.2.1  Rationale for Target Number of Subjects  
Given t hat the mean percent change in EASI score at Week 16 is −60% in the KHK4083 dose 
group and −35% in the placebo group and the common standard deviation is 40%, the 
number of subjects required to obtain a statistically significant difference with a significa nce 
level of 5% (two -sided) and a power of over 80% is calculated to be 42 per group. Taking 
into account  the possibility of fluctuation of allocation to each treatment group and subjects 
who excluded from the primary analysis set , the target number of subjects is determined to be 
50 per group as randomized (250 in total).  
The mean percent changes in EASI score at Week 16 in the KHK4083 group and the placebo 
group were assumed on the basis of the following study results : 
• Mean perce nt change in EASI score  
KHK4083 group : The mean percent change was assumed to be −60% as the mean 
percent change in EASI score at Week 18 in a Phase 1, open -label, multiple -dose study 
in subjects with AD (Study 4083 -004) was −62.1% ( last observation carrie r forward 
[LOCF] ) (as of 07 Feb 2018).  
Placebo group : The mean percent change was assumed to be −35% since the LS mean 
of the percent change in EASI score at Week 16 in a Phase 2b clinical study (Study 
R668 -AD-1021) and Phase 3 clinical studies (SOLO1 and SOLO2) of Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12460]® 
(dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]), which has been approved for the treatment of AD in the [LOCATION_002], 
Europe, and Japan, was −18.1%, −37.6%, and −30.9%, respectively.  
• Common standard deviation  
The common standard deviation was conservatively determined to  be 40% on the basis 
of the maximum standard deviation of the percent change in EASI score among those at 
each time point in Study [ADDRESS_1259092] deviation of it for placebo in a Phase 
2b clinical study (Study R668 -AD-1021) of Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12460]® (dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]) . 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -98-  9.3 Significance Level  
The significance level for the primary efficacy endpoint will be 5% (two -sided).  The 
statistical test for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted only at the first interim 
analysis as the final result . A closed test procedure will be used to maintain overall type I 
error rate.  
9.4 Early Termination Criteria  
No criteria for early termination of the study based on statistical evidence will be specified.  
9.5 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Abnormal Data  
Any efficacy data obtain ed after prohibited concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_898276].  
Any missing data of the primary endpoint and other continuous endpoints at Week 16 will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_147333]. For dropout subjects (including subjects who receiv e rescue 
treatment), data at the last assessment point will be defined as data obtained prior to dropout 
or receiving rescue treatment, while Week [ADDRESS_1259093] because of an event 
unexpected at study initiation, handling of such data to be used in the interim analysis  
(Section  9.8) should be decided before database is frozen  (The "Freeze" status in EDC will be 
used)  and the other data handling should be decided before database lock.  
9.6 Development of Statistical Analysis Plan and Procedure for Reporting 
Deviations from the Original Statistical Analysis Plan  
Details of the final analysis plan should be established in a statistical analysis plan that will 
be finalized before the database is frozen  for the primary analysis. M ajor changes to the 
analysis plan will be described in the clinical study report . 
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -99-  9.7 Selection of Subjects to be Included in Analyses  
The following populations are defined as analysis sets. Subjects included in the full analysis 
set (FAS) should be determined  before the primary analysis and those include in other 
analysis set s should be determined before database lock . 
9.7.1  Full Analysis Set ( FAS)  
The primary analysis set for the efficacy endpoints will be the FAS. The FAS is defined as a 
population of randomized subjects excluding those who meet either of the following 
conditions:  
• Subjects who are not exposed to IP  
• Subjects without any evaluable EASI score after the start of IP administration until 
Week 16  
9.7.2  Per Protocol Set (PPS)  
The per protocol set (PPS) will consist of all the FAS subjects excluding those who meet 
either of the following conditions. This analysis set has been selected to confirm t he 
robustness of the result in the primary analysis.  
• Subjects who failed to meet any major eligibility criteria  
• Subjects with a major deviation from the protocol that may affect the primary 
endpoint  
9.7.3  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set is defined as  a population of randomized subjects excluding those who 
meet the following condition. Analysis will be conducted according to the randomized  
treatment received by [CONTACT_1766].  
• Subjects who are not exposed to  IP 
9.7.4  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  
The PK analysis se t is defined as a population of subjects excluding those who meet either of 
the following conditions:  
• Subjects who are not exposed to KHK4083  
Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -100-  • Subjects who do not undergo PK blood sampling at all after the administration of 
KHK4083  
9.8 Interim Analysis  
Interim analyses will be conducted at two time points: when all subjects ( excluding early 
withdrawn subjects) have reached Week 16 and Week 36. All data for the interim analysis 1 
should be frozen  (The “Freeze” status in EDC will be used). However, only frozen efficacy 
data and SDVed safety data will be included in the interim analysis 2 (The “Verified” status 
in EDC will be used). The primary analysis will be performed in the FAS. The purpose of 
each interim analysis is as described below.  
• Interim analysis 1 , Week 16: To confirm a clinically significant difference in 
efficacy between KHK4083 and placebo and to obtain preliminary information for 
planning a future study.  
• Interim anal ysis 2 , Week 36: To obtain preliminary safety and efficacy information 
of KHK4083 for planning a future study.  
The interim analysis 1 will be conducted for efficacy endpoints with the FAS after the 
database is frozen. The interim analysis 2 will be conducted for efficacy and safety (als o 
including study withdrawal,  demography) . The cutoff date will be the date when the data is 
provided for the analysis after all subjects (excluding early withdrawn subjects) have reached 
Week  [ADDRESS_1259094] level until final database lock. This 
group will share with the Sponsor only the summarized results  (tables or figures) but not 
individual data listings. Further details of the interim an alyses will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan that will be finalized before the database is frozen for the primary 
analysis  conducted at the interim analysis 1 . In ad dition, these interim analyses will be 
conducted for pre-specified exploratory endpoints, serum IL -22, and exploratory biomarkers 
with existing data at the time of interim analysis . 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259095] agreed 
and which has been approved in writing by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC.  
If the IRB/IEC approves the collection, storage, and use of biological samples, a research 
protocol will be developed, and the research will be conducted in compliance with ethical 
principles based on the Declaration of Helsinki, any applicable laws and regulations in ea ch 
country and related notifications, the protocol for this study, and the research protocol.  
10.2 Institutional Review  
Before starting this study, the protocol (authorized by [CONTACT_1034]) will be submitted to the 
regulatory/local health authorities (in accorda nce with local regulations) in the countries 
involved in the study and to the IRB/IEC for evaluation. The protocol will also be signed by 
[CONTACT_079]  [INVESTIGATOR_622186]/IEC. The study will not start before 
the IRB/IEC gives written approval or a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_223472] E6 -GCP 
and all applicable regulatory/local health authorities give approval or a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_898277]. 
When the Sponsor amends the protocol, the Sponsor will fully inform each Investigator using 
the amended version of the protocol or a written description of the amendment to obtain 
his/her agreement. The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_898278]/IEC based on its prior 
review. Protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB/IEC without delay. Any 
significant deviation from the protocol when no approved amendment exist s will be regarded 
as a protocol violation, and will be addressed as such during the reporting of the study. 
However, this does not apply to amendments that only involve administrative issues (e.g., 
changes in affiliation, job title, address, or telephone number).  
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_1259096] submit a brief summary of the study

10.[ADDRESS_1259097] not deviate from or change the p rotocol without obtaining the 
Sponsor’s prior written agreement and the IRB/IEC’s written approval based on its prior 
review. In the event of a deviation from or change to the protocol, the Investigator  will make 
a record of all of the relevant actions reg ardless of the reason.  
For medical reasons such as the need to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects, the 
Investigator  may deviate from or change the protocol without the Sponsor’s prior written 
agreement or the IRB/IEC’s prior written approval. In such a case, a document describing the 
nature of and the reason for the deviation or change should be submitted to the Sponsor. The 
site will also submit the document to the IRB/IEC for its approval, and in addition, will 
obtain the written approval from th e Sponsor. For Japan sites only, written approval must also 
be obtained from the director of the investigative site.  
10.4 Investigator’s Responsibilities  
10.4.[ADDRESS_1259098]. For example, individuals who may be put at a disadvantage in 
case of refusal to participate (socially vulnerable people) should not be coerced into 
particip ating in the study.  
The Investigator  will determine whether each subject is eligible for enrollment according to 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure that the study will not include any subjects 
whose safety cannot be secured.  
Throughout the stud y, the Investigator  will keep track of the subject’s condition by [CONTACT_898330], and will collect and share information that may be 
relevant to the safety of IP. If a TEAE occurs, the Investigator  will ensure the safety of the 
subject by [CONTACT_898331], if necessary.

ICF as provided separately in a language understandable by [CONTACT_423]. The subject will be 
given sufficient time to decide whether or not to participate in the study, and the Investigator  
will obtain written consent (using the ICF provided separately) from the subject on a 
voluntary basis before the screening examinations.  
After the subject signs and dates the ICF, the Investigator who has conducted the informed 
consent discussion will al so sign and date it.  
The Investigator  will provide the subject with a copy of the signed ICF and the Information 
for Subjects. The Investigator  will retain the original for the investigative site’s record in 
accordance with the policy of each site.  
Inform ation for Subjects/ICF must contain the information specified by [CONTACT_898332].  
When any new information that may influence the subject’s willingness to continue 
participation in the study be comes available, the Investigator  will promptly provide the 
subject with the updated information, confirm his/her willingness to continue the study, and 
document the details of the explanation given, the date of explanation, the name [CONTACT_898347] d the subject’s decision, and the content of the subject’s decision in medical 
records.  
If the Information for Subjects/ICF needs revising in terms of the explanation given to the

Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006   
CONFIDENTIAL  -122-  Appendix 7 Diagnosis of Anaphylaxis  
Diagnosis of Anaphylaxis  
The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based on the following three clinical criteria, with 
anaphylaxis considered as highly likely when one of these criteria is fulfilled (Sampson  et al, 
2006):  
a) Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula), and at least one of the following : 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)  
• Reduc ed blood pressure or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction 
(e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
b) Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):  
• Involveme nt of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, 
swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229], hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g ., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)  
• Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
c) Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known  allergen for that patient  (minutes to 
several hours):  
• Infants and children: low sys tolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than 
30-percent decrease in systolic blood pressure  
• Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30 -percent 
decrease from that person’s baseline  
Although none of the clinical criteria provide 100 -percent sensitivity and specificity, it is 
believed that these criteria are likely to capture more than 95 -percent of cases of anaphylaxis 
(Sampson  et al, 2006).  
Laboratory tests for evaluating anaphylaxis:  
At present, there are no sensitive an d specific laboratory tests to confirm the clinical 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis.  Skin testing and in vitro diagnostic tests to determine the level of 
specific IgE antibodies directed against the therapeutic protein product, mediator release, or 
basophil acti vation may be useful for characterizing the underlying pathophysiology and may

However, the results of unvalidated tests should be interpreted with caution; and the clinical 
relevance of positive results from unvalidated tests may be uncertain during product 
development.

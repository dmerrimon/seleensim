1.0 BACKGROUND 
1.1 Current therapy for stage II/III rectal cancer  
Tri-modality therapy with chemotherapy, radiation and surgery leads to improved outcomes for 
stage II/III rectal cancer and neoadjuvant chemother apy is the current treatment paradigm to 
reduce toxicity and improve treatment delivery (1). Pre- operative chemotherapy has been shown 
to be less toxic than similar therapy given post- operatively and result in significantly higher 
degrees of treatment completion (2,3) and improved overall survival (4).   The optimal chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced tumors is not well- defined and differs 
for patients with intermediate risk, small tumor with clear circumferential radial margins (CRM), versus those with large, bulky tum ors (NCCN and ESMO guidelines) . Among patients with 
resectable tumors, short -course preoperative irradiation (25 Gy in five fractions of 5 Gy) is a 
standard option for stage II/III tumors and has been shown to be equivalent to chemoradiation (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy, bolus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin or continuous infusional fluorouracil 225 mg/m(2) per day) (5,6).  The Stockholm III study demonstrated that a delay in surgery after short-course radiation is safe and reduces operative morbidity c ompared to 
immediate surgery . (7) 
 
While current prospective trials are actively exploring novel treatments for different risk populations of rectal cancer, there are no trials of short -course radiation followed by [CONTACT_320730]. Myerson et al ( 8) previously reported a 70% rate of downstaging to stage ypT0-
2 among 76 patients with stage II- IV rectal cancer treated with short -course pelvic radiation 
followed by 4 cycles of FOLFOX prior to definitive surgery . In the NRG TNT study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) patient s with large (T4, N2) or low tumors and are treated with 8 cycles of 
intravenous (IV) FOLFOX followed by [CONTACT_7419]-course chemoradiation and are randomized to 
investigational systemic agents given in combination with long -course chemoradiation.   
  
1.2 Pot ential Role for Neoadjuvant combination TAS102 plus Oxaliplatin (TASOX) . 
Single agent TAS102. TAS -102 is a novel type of chemotherapeutic agent  being an orally 
available two-drug combination of a 1M Trifluoridine (FTD , a thymidine- based nucleoside 
analogue), and 0.5 M Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_320712]  (TPI). Following uptake into cells through 
nucleoside transporters, FTD is converted to its monophosphate F3dTMP by [CONTACT_19098]. After further phosphorylation steps, its triphosphate F3dTTP is incorporated into DNA as 
substitute for thymidine triphosphate.  In addition to its potent effects as an an ti-metabolite as an 
inhibitor of thymidine synthase , FTD has additional effects causing DNA breaks (9, 10) . TPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_320713] (TP)  (10).   
 
Two phase III studie s have demonstrated the benefit  of TAS 102 in  patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) refractory or not candidate s for standard therapy (11,12). Compared to 
placebo, TAS102 improved overall survival (OS) with a Hazard Ratio of 0.56 (CI 0.44-0.71) in 
 
 
   
 
6 
 
patients refractory to Fluorouracil, Oxali platin and  Irino tecan. Therapy was well tolerated and 
the predominant grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia ( 50%) and anemia ( 17%) (11). Similar 
benefits were seen in a more advanced population of patients refractory  to 5-Fluorouracil, 
Oxali platin , Irino tecan , Bev acizumab and epi[INVESTIGATOR_320714] (EGFRi ) 
therapy with an improvement in OS  [Hazard R atio 0.68 (0.58-0.81)] and similar, predominantly 
hematologic toxicities. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 4%  (12).  
 In a head -to- head trial against capecitabine, TAS102 was evaluated in TASCO1 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a multicentre, randomized, open- label, phase 2 trial 
(13). Patients with mCRC were randomized to TAS102 plus bevacizumab (TAS102 -B) or 
capecitabine plus bevacizumab  (C-B) as first -line therapy. The primary endpoint was 
progression- free survival (PFS), based on  investigator assessment of radiologic images, per 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_395929] ratio (HR) of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48, 1.06) for TAS102-B 
versus C -B. Preliminary median OS was 18 mo nths with TAS102-B and 16.2 months with C- B 
giving a HR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.32, 0.98) for TAS102-B versus C-B. In pre-planned sub-group 
analysis, an e nhanced effect of TAS102 -B over C -B was seen on PFS was seen in  tumors arisi ng 
in the left colon and rectum, HR 0.5 (95% CI 0.31-0.82).   
TASOX, Combination TAS102 and Oxaliplatin: Three phase I  studies  have established the 
safety of combination TAS102 and Oxaliplatin in mCRC (14 -16) with the recommended dose of 
TAS102 35 mg/m2 po BID days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV 85 mg/m2 on day 1 of a q2weekly cycle. In a dose escalation phase I, Hollebecque et al. (14) performed a two -part trial of 
trifluridine/tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (FTD/TPI) plus oxaliplatin in  patients with previously treated mCRC. A total 
of [ADDRESS_395930] chemotherapy and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 BID with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2. One  DLT was 
reported at the MTD  at which the patient experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia. This patient 
recovered and continued with a decreased FTD/TPI [CONTACT_119972] 30 mg/m2 BID. P atients received a 
mean of 7.65 treatment cycles  and s table disease was achieved in eight patients. One patient 
previously treated with mFOLFOX6 (folinic acid -fluorouracil- oxaliplatin) achieved a confirmed 
partial RECIST response.   
 Calvo et al. (15) reported results from the dose -expansion phase on which 12 patients were 
administered TAS102  in combination with oxali platin with either nivolumab or bevacizumab. 
TAS102  35 mg/m2 was given BID on Days 1‒5, followed q2weekly, in combination with 
oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and either nivolumab 3 mg/kg or bevacizumab 5 mg/kg, all administered on Day 1. The disease control rate was 83.3% i n the safety run -in period. Neutropenia was the 
most common grade 3- 4 treatment-related AE reported. Three (25%) patients had AE related 
treatment interruptions,  primarily due to neutropenia. Two patients reported oxaliplatin- related 
grade ≥ 2 neurotoxicit y; one patient discontinued oxaliplatin therapy. Treatment- related deaths 
were not observed. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that  FTD/TPI [INVESTIGATOR_320715]- administration of oxaliplatin.  
 
 
 
   
 
[ADDRESS_395931] study (16), TASOX was dose -escalat ed in a 3+3 fashion starting at  TAS102 25 
mg/m2 and escalating to 35 mg/m2  day 1 -5 using a fixed dose of  oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on day 1, 
q2weekly. Eligible patients previously received 5FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, appropriate biologics, had me asurable disease, usual laboratory parameters, and ECOG PS 0 -1. Among 12 
patients evaluable for dose limiting toxicity (DLT), no DLTs were observed. Treatment related grade ≥ 3 AEs were neutropenia (n = 4) and thrombocytopenia (n = 1). No AEs resulted in treatment discontinuation. Two patients (dose levels 2 and 3) required dose reductions for 
prolonged neutropenia. Median number of cycles for all treated patients was 6 ± 4. The disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks was 67%. Best response in all evaluable p atients was 1 PR (8%) 7 
(59%) SD and 4 (33%) PD.  
 The neoadjuvant benefit of TAS OX in rectal cancer is unknown. While the most commonly 
chosen pre -operative therapy for stage II/III rectal cancer in North America remains capecitabine 
or 5- fluorouracil in c ombination with 50.4 Gy radiation, there is a lack of novel systemic agents 
being evaluated in the curative, neoadjuvant setting.  The documented efficacy of TAS OX in 
both early and advanced line therapy for mCRC justifies its application in the neoadjuvant setting where the pathologic and clinical response rate offers an early  estimate of treatment 
benefit.  
  
1.3 Study Overview  
The study investigators hypothesize that TAS OX can be safely and efficaciously delivered after 
short course radiation , resulting  in significant pathologic downstaging, allowing for  an R0 pelvic 
resection , and  providing local control in appropriately selected  stage II/III rectal cancer patients  
treated  with contemporary TME- based surgery. It is expected that 3 months (6 cycles) of 
TAS OX at standard doses will allow total neoadjuvant therapy  introducing a new systemic agent , 
a shorter duration of pre -operative radiation and timely delivery of pre -operati ve systemic 
therapy. It is anticipated that if this study meets its primary endpoint, the strategy will be prospectively compared to long- course chemoradiation with capecitabine and that the reduced 
duration of radiation and the introduction of a new syste mic agent will improve outcomes for 
appropriately selected patients with stage II/III rectal cancer.   In this phase II study patients will be treated with short -course preoperative irradiation (25 Gy in 
five fractions of 5 Gy) followed by 6 (six) 2-week cycles of TAS OX followed  by [CONTACT_320731] (TME) for patients with resectable rectal cancer (clinical T3 c/dN0, T3c/d N1, 
T2N1). Eligible study subjects include adults who are candidates for curative intent sphincter -
sparing surgery and lack high risk features such as tumor encroaching upon the mesorectal -fascia 
or low  tumors  who need an Abdominal -Perineal Resection (APR) .   The primary measuremen t of 
efficacy will be the Neoadjuvant Rectal (NAR) score , a validated surrogate of local and systemic 
disease control in stage II/III rectal cancer ( 17).

2.0 OBJECTIVES   
2.1 Primary Objective  
The p rimary objective of this study is to determine whether pre -operative short -course radiation 
therapy (SRT) and 6 cycles of TAS OX offers condensed radiation and total neoadjuvant therapy 
for intermediate risk rectal cancer. The primary endpoint is to achieve  a reduction in 
Neoadjuvant Response (NAR) score compared to historic controls.

1. Recommendations  for timing of therapy :  
- Radiation must  commence within [ADDRESS_395940] assessment at the time of progressive disease, study withdrawal, or removal.  
2. Hematology includes hemoglobin, platelets and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). 3. Chemistry includes SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), total bilirubin, creatinine.  4. Urine or serum p regnancy test per institutional standard required for females of childbearing 
potential ≤ 7 days of registration.  
5. Rectal exam and proctoscopy are ideally to be performed by [CONTACT_96193]. Proctoscopy 
should be performed ≤ [ADDRESS_395941] per treating investigator/institutional standards,  is to 
be performed within 60 days prior to treatment start. Use same imaging modality throughout the study.  7. A PET/CT scan may be performed in lieu of a CT scan with contrast, but a CT scan is preferred.  
8. Scans do not have to be performed at the trial site; they can be performed at other locations as long as images are available for review. Scan is to be performed within </= [ADDRESS_395942] o f the abdomen.  
9. Recommendation: Surgery should be performed within 10 weeks AFTER  the 6th cycle  of 
neoadjuvant TAS OX, and restaging investigations should be obtained within 8 weeks (56 days) 
AFTER day #14, cycle 6.  10. Adverse Events form to be completed at the start of radiation therapy. 11. Pelvic MRI should be booked within 56 days of completion of cycle #6 of TAS OX, i.e. 
within 1 -56 days AFTER  day #14, cycle 6. 
12. Patients that achieve a complete or near complete Clinical Response (cCR or ncCR)  may 
choose to pursue a course of watch and wait with agreement of their treating surgeon. A thorough discussion is recommended with their surgeon concerning the risks and benefits of watch and wait  and both they and their physician agree with the intended approach. Patients that 
pursue a course of watch and wait remain evaluable on study and wi ll be classified as having a 
ypT0N0 response for the purposes of the NAR score if they do not proceed to TME surgery within [ADDRESS_395943] day of radiation therapy. It will be done by [CONTACT_320732] [EMAIL_6279]

6.0 PROTOCOL TREATMENT  
Therapy: Study schema is summarized  in Section 2.3. Patients are initially treated with 25 Gy in 
five fractions of 5 Gy conformal pelvic radiation . Radiation is to be started within 3 weeks of 
registration . TAS OX should be commenced w ithin 3 weeks of radiation completion. P atients are 
treated with 6 x 14 day cycles of TASOX . Within 4 weeks of the end of cycle #6 of TAS OX 
patients undergo re -staging . Surgery should be performed within 4 weeks AFTER  day 14, 
cycle#[ADDRESS_395944] Simulation Techniques  
Prone position with use of a bowel displacement device ‘belly board’ is recommended and may be particularly advantageous for patients with a larger body habitus to improve small bowel sparing ( Figure 2 ). At the time of simulation, placement of a radiopaque anal marker may be 
useful to determine the distance of the disease from the verge for contouring purposes. For males, it is important to pull the external genitalia center and downward. Oral contrast is recommended to be given approximately [ADDRESS_395945] may be useful in visualizing 
and contouring the elective nodal ves sels, particularly in patients who are thin; however, more 
commonly, fusion with the patient’s CT with contrast staging study is used. For additional small bowel sparing, 16- [ADDRESS_395946] images at 2- 3 mm intervals from the 
upper lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_320717] -femur should be obtained.

 Target Volumes  
According to the International Commission on Radiological Units [ADDRESS_395947] from the RTOG (18),  Australasian Gastrointestinal Trial Group (19) and the EORTC (20) 
that illustrate target definitions with representative case examples. RTOG also has a pelvic normal tissue contouring atlas (21). When c ontouring the GTV, one should use all available 
clinical and radiographic information (digital rectal exam, endoscopy, pelvic MRI, and other imaging as available) including anal verge markers at the time of simulation. Include all macroscopic tumor in the GTV (primary, nodal GTV adjacent to the rectal wall and extramural vascular invasion) on each CT slice and any adjacent normal rectal wall on the same slice. Contouring of the GTV may be aided by [CONTACT_320733] (and/or pelvic CT with co ntrast and/or PET if available) in the treatment planning system. Other large nodal (> 1 
cm) disease that either shows increased uptake on PET or has abnormal architecture on CT may also be included in the GTV.  
 Construction of the clinical target volume  (CTV) of the primary tumor (CTV_2500) is performed 
by [CONTACT_320734] 1.0 cm from the GTV. The CTV_2500 should include the entire GTV. This structure should be modified to account for the natural barriers of bone and muscle if the tumor does not involve these structures.  
 

 
 
   
 
15 
 
An elective nodal dose volume (CTV_2000) should be constructed that includes  the CTV_2500 
and all elective nodal CTVs. Elective nodal CTVs include the entire mesorectum, internal iliac, 
and presacral lymph node regions. The CTV_ [ADDRESS_395948] superior limit of GTV, or the L5/S1 interspace. This structure should be modified to account for the natural barriers of bone and muscle if tumor does not involve these structures. Common errors in contouring the elective nodal volume include failure to correctly contour the entire extent of the mesorectum. When contouring the CTV_2000 internal iliac lymph node region, a 7 mm isotropic expansion around the vessels should be performed.  
When contouring the CTV_2000 presacral lymph node region, a 10 mm expansion in front of the sacrum should be performed.  PTV_2500 and PTV_2000 are then constructed by [CONTACT_1299] a 5 mm isotropic expansion around the CTVs. If daily IGRT cannot be used (kV kV ma tch or CBCT) or if 3 -D planning is 
performed, PTVs should be developed using a 10 mm expansion around the CTVs. In contouring 
of the normal pelvic organs at risk (OARs), the small bowel, left femoral head, right femoral 
head, genitalia, bladder, pelvic bones, large bowel, and skin should all be outlined on each axial CT slice. The external contours of all pelvic bones, including iliacs, lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_320718], should be contoured together as a surrogate for pelvic bone marrow. Bowel should be drawn as individual loops without the intertwining mesentery from L3 down. The tissue within the skin surface and outside all other critical normal structures and PTVs is designated as unspecified tissue. Excellent definitions of normal pelvic organs may be found in the RTOG atlas (Gay 2012). A representative IMRT plan and radiation targets are shown in Figure 3 .    
 Although IMRT is preferred, if 3- D is performed, one can perform sequential plans (i.e. initial 
PTV_2000 over four days followed by a single boost fraction).

Conformal radiation with IMRT is preferred using 6MV photon energy and either static field or VMAT, but 3- dimensional 6- 18MV photon treatment will be allowed. Proton therapy is not 
allowed. When using VMAT, consider 270 degree arc fields to avoid a field directly entering the genitalia. IMRT is preferred as planning allows for differential doses to the gross disease, elective nodal regions and the OARs. The OARs used in optimization typi[INVESTIGATOR_320719], femoral heads, genitalia, bladder, pelvi c bones, and large bowel. In addition, when 
performing IMRT, all PTVs should spare non- target skin surfaces manually or automatically 
trimmed by 3 -5 mm (unless there is skin involvement). For bone marrow sparing, pelvic bones 
including the iliac crests, lu mbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and lower pelvic bones should be contoured

together as a surrogate for pelvic bone marrow. Representative target dose coverage and normal tissue constraints are outlined in Table 2 and Table 3 .  
 Treatment planning priorities should be con sidered in order of decreasing importance:  
1. PTV_2500  3. PTV_2000  4. Small bowel 5. Femoral heads 6. Bladder 7. Large bowel  Of note, pelvic bone marrow and genitalia should be kept as low as possible. However, we do not have standard five fraction constraints for these organs.

 For IMRT plans, patient specific quality assurance (QA) is highly recommended. QA is performed by [CONTACT_320735] a phantom or portal imager to measure the 2D/3D dose. Measured dose distribution will be compared to planned dose distribution using a Gamma criterion of 4% dose difference and [ADDRESS_395950] 90% measured for the entire plan.  
 
Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT): Patients should receive daily KV images for set up and 
treatment verification. Bone should be used as the surrogate. Corrections should be made for shifts of [ADDRESS_395951] images (CBCTs ), if available, may 
also be helpful and strongly recommended to evaluate the relationship of the CTV to the bladder/rectum and to verify male genitalia position.  
 For IMRT systems where the isocenter is not defined (e.g., tomotherapy), setup verification images may consist of a series of axial CT images (megavoltage or kilovoltage) obtained over at least [ADDRESS_395952] images. It is recommended that there be an option to display target structures on the simulation images. I t is also recommended that the 
setup verification images be obtained at levels where cephalocaudad positioning, as well as 
transverse positioning, can be verified. Appropriate levels would include either around the mid to 
upper sacrum or around the upper b order of the acetabulae.  
 
Daily doses:  PTV_2500 will receive 500 cGy daily x five fractions for a total of 2500 cGy to the 
gross cancer PTV over 5 -7 days. Fractions should be consecutive but may be spread out over two 
weeks (i.e. over the weekend). The CT V_2000 will simultaneously receive 400 cGy daily x five 
fractions for a total of 2000 cGy to the elective nodal disease. While IMRT is strongly preferred, 3-D planning with a sequential approach (PTV_2000 over four consecutive fractions followed by [CONTACT_320736] _2500 volume in one treatment as a boost of 500 cGy to the gross cancer PTV) is

6.2 Pre-Operative TAS OX 
6.2.1 TAS102  
Each treatment cycle will be 14 days in duration.  TAS -102 dosage is calculated according to 
body surface area.   
One treatment cycle consists of the following:  
Days 1 -5: TAS -102 (35 mg/m2/dose) orally BID  
Days 6 -14: Rest 
Repeat for a total of 6 cycles.  
Study medication should be taken on Days 1- 5.  If doses are missed or held on those days, the 
patient should not make up for missed doses.   
TAS -102 should be taken with a glass of water within 1 hour after completion of morning and 
evening meals.   
6.2.2 Number of Tablets per Dose  
Tablet calculation is presented in Table 2.  TAS -102 should only be given on Days 1 through 5 
of each cycle even if doses are missed or held for any reason during Days 1 through 5.

 Days 1- 14: see TAS102 schedule.  
 Repeat for a total of [ADDRESS_395955] surgical therapy with a total mesorectal excision (TME) is to be done within  10 weeks 
of completion of cycle # 6 of chemotherapy with T ASOX with staging to be done within 8 weeks 
after day 14 of cycle 6 .  
 Operative approach will be at the discretion of surgeon, and can include either laparoscopic (or robotic -assisted laparoscopic) or open anterior or low anterior resection with or without 
temporary fecal diversion. Preoperative antibiotics and bowel prepara tion are institution specific 
will be at the discretion of the operating surgeon. The mobilization of the proximal colon and splenic flexure may be performed by [CONTACT_320737], laparoscopic- assisted, robotic -assisted or 
hand- assisted at the discretion of the  surgeon to limit the incision to the lower abdomen. The 
pelvic dissection should include TME, division of inferior mesenteric vascular pedicle, transection of the specimen, and anastomosis. Anastomosis may be stapled or hand -sewn. 
Variation in technical approaches will be at the surgeon’s discretion as they are impacted by [CONTACT_102]’s body habitus, incisions, and tumor location.   Patients that achieve a complete or near complete Clinical Response (cCR or cCR), may choose to pursue a course of watch and wait with agreement of their treating surgeon. A thorough discussion is recommended with their surgeon concerning the risks and benefits of watch and wait and both they and their physician agree with the intended approach. Patients that pursue a course of watch and wait remain evaluable on study and will be classified as having a ypT0N0 response for the purposes of the NAR score if they do not proceed to TME surgery within 24 months of completing cycle 6, day 14.  Surgical Complications  Perioperative and p ostoperative complications will be collected and submitted; see Section 10.0.  
 Earl y complications (within 30 days)  
Morbidity and mortality will be closely monitored and recorded using the study data forms with the following definitions:  
1. Pulmonary, urinary tract, and intraabdominal infections will be defined by [CONTACT_320738]/or interventional ra diology drainage.  
2. Abdominal wound infections will be defined by [CONTACT_12509], extent and severity (i.e. superficial vs. deep space infection) and the need for wound opening and/or surgical intervention. Urinary retention will be defined as the condition of urinary dysfunction that occurs for greater than 5 days following surgery or that requires intervention, including replacement of Foley catheter, surgery, etc  
3. Perioperative hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion(s) or reoperation will be considered as a complication. Correction of preoperative anemia will not be included as a complication. The decision to transfuse will be made at the surgeon's discretion.  
 
 
   
 
22 
 
4. Any documented medical or anesthetic complications that result in patient disability or that requi res intervention will be recorded.  
5. Problems with healing, function or management of the ostomy that requires intervention or additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320720]. 
   
7.0 RADIOLOGIC IMAGING  
The primary interpretation of all imaging studies will occur a t each site, and each site will make 
the initial determination for each patient as to:  
1. Study eligibility  
2. Initial MRI study adequacy  
3. Baseline TNM status  
4. Post-treatment T and N status  
Estimated Radiographic T Stage (Using AJCC 8th Edition Definitions):  
This should be estimated as T1, T2, or T3c/d ( ie. T3c, >5 to 15 mm; T3d, >15 mm beyond muscularis propria). T4 tumors are ineligible.  See APPENDIX I.  
 Estimated Radiographic N Stage: For purposes of achieving consistent interpretation in this protocol:  
Node positivity determination: Entry criteria nodes will be measured in short -axis diameter and 
for the purposes of study entry will be considered positive if 8mm in short axis. Radiographic N2 status is estimated as: 4 or more nodes that measure 8mm or more in short- axis. 
Radiographic N1 status is estimated as: fewer than 4 lymph nodes that measure 8 mm or greater in short axis but 1 or more lymph nodes that measure 10 mm or greater . 
 Distance of the Tumor from the Mesorectal Fascia Reflection:  patients with tumors with a 
distance of 1mm or less, or adherent to the mesorectal fascia reflection have threatened radial margins and are ineligible.   
Presence of Distant Disease:  
Nodal stations considered suspi[INVESTIGATOR_320721] (M1) for rectal cancer are: common 
iliac, external iliac and inguinal nodes.

 Caution is required when using drugs that are human thymidine kinase substrates, e.g., zidovudine. Such drugs, if used concomitantly with TAS -102, may compete with the effector, 
triflurid ine, for activation via thymidine kinases. Therefore, when using antiviral drugs that are 
human thymidine kinase substrates, monitor for possible decreased efficacy of the antiviral agent, and consider switching to an alternative antiviral agent that is no t a human thymidine 
kinase substrate, such as lamivudine, zalcitabine, didanosine and abacavir.

DSUR  
 If requested by [CONTACT_16277], TAIHO shall provide the Institution with the final version of this DSUR report within [ADDRESS_395967] of care recommendations ( 22). Pelvic MRI should be booked within 
56 days of completion of cycle #6 of TASOX, ie within 1-56 days AFTER day #14, cycle 6. Radiographic tumor staging should be performed and reported per the initial, staging MRI. See APPENDIX I for guidance.   
 
 
   
 
[ADDRESS_395968] be submitted de- identified reports via email to tas-
[EMAIL_6281].  
 
11.3 Definition of Surgical Margin Status  
Margins to be considered are:   - Proximal Margins  
- Distal Margins  
- Radial Margins, synonymously termed circumferential margin.   Margin Positivity:  A surgical margin is POSITIVE if the pathologist notes  tumor within ≤  1mm 
of any edge of the primary tumor specimen.  
 A surgical margin is NEGATIVE if the pathologist notes that there is NO tumor within > 1mm  
of any edge of the primary tumor specimen.  
 
11.4 Definition of pathologic stage  
Derivation of the Neoadjuvant response (NAR) score requires pathologic staging information from the TME resection specimen staged according to the AJCC8th edition schema: 
 T describes how far the main (pri mary) tumor has grown into the wall of the intestine and 
whether it has grown into nearby [CONTACT_95557]. Because this infor mation will be ascertained from the 
surgical pathology report it is denoted with a prefix “p”. Because it is ascertained after 
neoadjuvant treatment, the prefix “y” is also added (e.g., ypT3). 
Tx  Primary tumor cannot be assessed  
T0  No evidence of primary tumor Tis  Carcinoma in situ: intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_320726]  
T1  Tumor invades submucosa T2  Tumor invades muscularis propria T3  Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues T4a  Tumor penetrates to the surface of the visceral peritoneum T4b  Tumor directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures N describes the extent of spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes based on the rectal resection specimen. The prefix “yp” is added as described for T status.  
Nx  Regional l ymph nodes cannot be assessed  
N0  No regional lymph node metastasis N1  Metastasis in 1 -3 regional lymph nodes 
N2  Metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes  
11.5 Definition of Pathological Complete Response (pCR):  
A pCR must include no gross or microsc opic tumor identified anywhere within the  surgical 
specimen. This must include no evidence of malignant cells in the primary tumor specimen  and 
no lymph nodes that contain tumor.

14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND METHODOLOGY  
14.1 Statistical justification  
The primary endpoint will be the Neoadjuvant Response (NAR) Score. This is an established 
efficacy endpoint for phase II/III rectal cancer trial, offering an early indicator of treatment effectiveness (1 7). In table I, inclusion criteria, pre -operative therapy and the corresponding pCR 
rate of published phase II and phase III trials of total neoadjuvant  chemotherapy are summarized. 
The wide range of reported pCR rates is a reflection of treatment efficacy and the pre- treatment 
tumor stage of eligible patients.

High Risk: stage II/III rectal cancer with radiographic high -risk features; 5x5 RT: 25 Gy in five 
fractions of 5 Gy; CRT: chemoradiation (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy plus fluorouracil based chemotherapy); Cetux: Cetuximab; Bev: Bevacizumab;   
14.2 Sa mple Size  
In table 2, the NAR scores of comparable patients enrolled in the phase III R04 study ( 27) and 
treated with long -course chemoradiation are presented (personal communications G Yothers). 
Patients with cT3N0 tumors and similar in stage to those to be enrolled in the proposed concept 
achieved a NAR score of 14.59 (SD 13.41). Prospective data suggests a 5.8 reduction in NAR score would be a clinically significant improvement in long terms outcomes. (15) For declared target 5.8 NAR reduction from 14.59 to 8.79 a sample size of 24 patients would be required, one -
sided alpha=0.1 and beta=0.2 (Power 80.2%). Assuming an ineligibility rate of 10 %, the final 
sample size is 27. 
 Patients who  pursue a course of watch and wait remain evaluable on study and will be classified 
as having a ypT0N0 response for the purposes of the NAR score if they do not proceed to TME surgery within 24 months of cycle 6 day 14.

15.0 Oversight and Quality Assurance  Plan  
Oversight of patient safety will include review of adverse events as well as study progress and outcomes.  Patient updates , outcomes, and recruitment and retention of patients will be reviewed 
on a regular basis by [CONTACT_978], research nurse, and data coordinator.  Deviations will be reviewed during oversight meetings and/or through internal reporting procedures.  Aggregate protocol deviations are monitored for trends to be reviewed by [CONTACT_320743].  In addition, a “first patient review” is conducted and documented 
for all clinical trials.   This review includes treatment administration, deviations, and SAEs to 
ensure any compliance and/or safety issues are addressed  prior to the enrollment of additional 
patients.  
 Study monitoring activities (Quality Control Reviews) are performed by [CONTACT_320744]’ protections.  Individuals who perform study monitoring activities do not report to 
principal investigators or research scientists and may not monitor studies for which they have direct responsibility.  Results of study monitoring activities will be reported to applica ble study 
personnel, Clinical Trials Manager and Quality Assurance.  Study monitoring activities are conducted regularly and include (but are not limited to) review and verification of the following:  
• Eligibility  
• Informed Consent process  
• Adherence to protocol treatment plan  
• Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
• Source Documentation  
• Adverse Events  
• Regulatory Reporting  
 
15.1  Quality Assurance  
 Quality Assurance (QA) personnel review study monitoring reports and if necessary, determine follow -up actions to resolve significant findings. QA has the authority to request immediate 
corrective action if significant patient safety issues are identified.   QA will track and trend results 
from study quality assurance reports as well as associated corrective and preventive actions. QA personnel do not have a direct reporting relationship to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_320728].  
 A review of 20% of the case report forms, per site, will undergo quality assurance review.  All quality assurance reviews wi ll include verification of the accuracy and integrity of data entered 
onto case report forms.  Incorrect data will be identified and corrected.  The existence of adequate source documents for data will be verified. Each site is responsible for their own implementation of internal monitoring and/or auditing plans for this trial as appropriate. These plans will be revised as necessary during the life of the trial  based  upon a variety of factors, 
including but not limited to: protocol amendments, staff turnover, enrollment metrics, and 
 
 
   
 
37 
 
compliance issues noted. All subsite quality reports will be submitted to the coordinating center quarterly.

APPENDIX I: Baseline staging and post-treatment MRI 
interpretation.  
 
The following instructions should aid in the consistent interpretation of images. It is recognized that assessment of clinical staging based on imaging is necessarily inexact and involves estimation. Clinical staging should be estimated using the AJCC 8th edition criteria. The criteria set forth below are to foster consistency of interpretation across sites.  
 T stage coding:  
T1 
T2 
T2/early T3 (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_235244]) is coded T3  
T3 
T3/possible T4 is coded T4 (not eligible)  
T4 (not eligible)  
 N stage coding:    
Estimated radiographic nodal stage will be derived from preoperative imaging procedures using the AJC C 8th edition staging criteria.  The total number of nodes to determine stage (N1 = 1- 3, 
N2 = 4 or more) will include mesorectal and superior rectal stations.  
 Final analysis criteria will be short axis measurement with nodes positive at any size N1=1- 3, 
N2=4 or more. Diminutive nodes (< 8mm) are not considered.  
 Radiographic N1 status is estimated as: fewer than 4 lymph nodes that measure 10 mm or greater in short axis but 1 or more lymph nodes that measure 8 mm or greater.  
 
Radiographic N2 status is estimated as: 4 or more nodes that measure 8mm or more in short- axis 
(not eligible).  
  Metastatic nodal disease: Nodal stations considered suspi[INVESTIGATOR_320716] (M1) (AJCC 8th edition) are for rectal cancer: common iliac, external iliac nodes and inguinal nodes. Also bone metastases and peritoneal tumor imp lants.  
 Circumferential Radial Margin: Distance of the tumor from the mesorectal fascia reflection (also known as  radial margin, also known as  CRM or circumferential resection margin).

tolerability and efficacy of DA-9805  at 45mg, 90mg  versus placebo in subjects diagnosed with early 
Parkinson’s disease.  
The study will include three  parts: a 2 -week Screening part, a 12 -week  Double -Blind Treatment part, 
and a 4 -week Follow -up part. The Schedule of Events is provided in Table 4-1. 
Screening part (Day -14 to Day -1), up to 14 days:  
Screening part is designed to determine subject’s eligibility to proceed to Randomization and the 
Treatment Phase of the study. During this part, a series of assessments will be  performed to determine 
subject eligibility as per inclusion and exclusion criteria  (Refer to Section 3.1.2  and Section 3.1.3 ). 
At the Screening Visit, prior to any study -related procedures, a written informed consent will be 
obtained from the subject by [CONTACT_695986] p ersonnel. Screening procedures will 
be conducted per the study schedule of events. All screening information will be documented in the 
case report forms.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria, but have some abnormal laboratory values, based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_345] a  
repeat laboratory sample may be collected . The repeat laboratory reports should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_695966].  
Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria during the Screening part will be considered screen 
failure s and will be exited from the study. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be scheduled 
for randomization visit.

Analysis Populations  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 
one dose of study treatment and undergone at least one post -randomization efficacy assessment.  
Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The Per Prot ocol (PP) population is defined as the set of subjects who meet the ITT population 
requirements, and were not associated with a major protocol violation. This population will be 
identified before the database lock, and before the treatment assignments are revealed.   
Safety Population  
The Safety population is defined as all subjects receiving at least one dose of the treatment after 
randomization.  
Analysis Methods:   
The primary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted using the PP 
population.  
Efficacy Analysis:   
For analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints the following will be considered:  
 For endpoints that are continuous in nature  
o Number of observations, mean, median, minimum and maximum, and standard deviation 
(SD) values will be presented as descriptive summary.  
o For inferential statistics:  
 If the Normality assumption is met, t -test or ANCOVA using the baseline value as a 
covariate will be used.  
 If the Normality assumption is not met, a rank –ANCOVA analysis i.e., an ANCOVA 
analysis on rank -transformed data or other non -parametric methods wi ll be used.  
 For endpoints that are categorical in nature:  
o Frequency counts and percentages will be presented as descriptive summary.  
o Chi-square test or Logit model will be used for inferential statistics.  
To assess the consistency of the Primary Analysis  results, a supportive analysis will be conducted 
using the ITT population. Statistical methodology for the supportive analyses will be the same as that 
of the primary analysis, with the exception of the analysis population.

Safety Analysis:  
The Safety p opulation will be used for the analysis of all safety parameters or measurements.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of MedDRA. Treatment -Emergent AEs 
(TEAE) are  defined as events with an onset on or after the first randomized treatment. TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570], System Organ Class, and preferred term.  
Summary statistics of raw data and change from baseline values for each laboratory parameter w ill be 
presented by [CONTACT_11571]. Data will be summarized as appropriate to the variable 
type (i.e. continuous or categorical variables) .  
Individual subject changes will be identified through shift tables. Shift tables will be presented for each 
laboratory parameter with counts and percentages of subjects, by [CONTACT_11571], for 
shift from baseline, using the normal ranges.  
In addition, all the data from physical examination, 12 Lead ECG and vital signs will also be 
descri ptively summarized.

1.2 BACKGROUND  
Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is recognized as one of the most common neurologic disorders, affecting 
approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years. There are 2 major neuropathologic findings:  
 the loss of pi[INVESTIGATOR_695968] (SNpc) and 
 the presence of Lewy bodies.  
 
Most cases of Parkinson ’s disease are hypothesized to be due to a combination of genetic and 
environmental factors. However, no environmental cause of Parkinson ’s disease has yet been proven. 
A known genetic cause can be identified in approximately 10% of cases, and these are more common 
in younger-onset patients.  
 
The classic motor features of Parkinson ’s disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_695969], with tremor being the most common initial symptom. The 3 cardinal signs of 
Parkinson ’s disease are resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Postural instability (balance 
impairment) is sometimes listed as the fourth cardinal feature. However, balance impairment in 
Parkinson ’s disease is a late phenomenon.  
 
Parkinson's disease affects an estimated 1.5 million persons in the [LOCATION_002], with over ten million 
affected worldwide, and these estimates are expected to increase substantially in the next few decades. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_695970], the approved agents for the early management of Parkinson's 
disease have changed little in the past decade; however, there have been advances in drug delivery, 
dosing, and the use of combination therapy in an attempt to reduce adverse events. The available 
treatments continue to focus on the dopaminergic system and include primarily carbidopa/levodopa, 
monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors, and dopamine agonists. Current research on the early 
management of Parkinson's disease focuses on improved and more consistent drug delivery systems, 
targeting alternate neurotransmitter systems and the identification of neuroprotective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_695971]'s disease. There has also been an increased interest in earlier intervention with various forms 
of exercise in addition to pharmacological treatments. 
 
The most important , unmet medical need in targeting Parkinson’s disease is developi[INVESTIGATOR_695972]. So far, no drug has been shown to reduce or slow down the progression of 
PD.

[MC], Bupleurum Root [BF] and Angelica dahurica root [ADR]. The main active ingredients are 
Paeo nol, Saikosaponin A and Imperatorin respectively. All the three herbal raw materials are listed in 
the Japanese, Korean and Chinese Pharmacopoeias. DA-9805 reduces neuronal loss by: 
1. Protection of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induced nigrostriatal 
dopa
mine neuron degeneration.  
2. Restoration of 6-OHDA (neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine) induced nigrostriatal dopamine 
neuron degeneration.  
3. Inhibition of Rotenone induced α-synuclein accumulation in substantial niagra (SN). 
4. Inhibition of LPS induced microglial/astrocyte activation in substantial niagra/striatum(ST).      
It is expected that DA-[ADDRESS_944199] and relief from Endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress.  
1.4 SUMMARY OF PRIOR PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES 
The botanical components of DA-9805 (Moutan Root Bark [MC], Bupleurum Root [BF] and Angelica 
dahurica root [ADR]) have a long history of human use and have been tested individually and in 
various combinations in animal models. Based on available published information, MC has been 
attributed anti-depression, prevention of dementia, improvement of cognitive functions, and anti-
inflammatory, neuroregenerative, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer and hypoglycemic effects. Similarly, BF is 
attributed therapeutic effects in brain damage and depression, and has also shown neuroprotective, 
neuroregenerative, anti-cancer, anti-allergy effects. Based on published literature, ADR is attributed 
anti-depression, prevention of dementia, improvement of cognitive function and anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant and anti-asthmatic effects. 
 
All three botanicals listed in KP, Chinese Pharmacopoeia (CP) and Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) as 
well as other pre-existing oriental medicine books as over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and approved 
drugs in Korea, China and Japan. However, none of these consist of individual components of DA-
[ADDRESS_944200] 
botanical mixture comprising of all three botanical ingredients.  
 
In addition to Korea, China and Japan, MC, BF and/or ADR containing products can also be found in 
US, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Europe and Southeast Asia. These products are not only available as 
prescription drugs, but also as herbal OTC medicinal products and dietary/food supplements. MC 
containing products have been used in central nervous system disorders, indigestion, cough, dental 
care, anemia, and constipation, among other indications. BF containing products have been used in 
headache, cold, insomnia, enterogastritis, constipation, neurosis and other indications. Finally, ADR 
containing products are used in fever, headache, antiemetic, cold, insect bites, rhinitis and other 
indications. 
 
The current market status on products that contain MC, BF and ADR, individually or in combination, 
in various countries is briefly summarized below.

Dong -A conducted a number of nonclinical studies with DA-9805 and its individual botanical 
components, as well as with proposed purified active ingredients. Dong-A DA-9805 nonclinical 
studies were conducted in compliance with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) 
(Notification No. 2013 -232 ‘The Standards of Pharmacology Study for Medicinal Products’ [Oct 30, 
2013] and  Notification No. 2014-67 ‘Good Laboratory Practice [GLP]’ [Feb 12, 2014]) and 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) GLP requirements and also 
comply with the current International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, including ICH 
guideline S7A ‘Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals’ (Nov 08, 2000). 
 
DA-9805 has not undergone any clinical testing in the US or anywhere else in the world; the study 
proposed under this IND is the first- in-human study. Non-clinical study data summarized below 
provides safety data for conducting the first DA-9805 in-human study. The NOAEL of DA-9805 in 
rats was determined at 2000 mg/kg in males and 1000 mg/kg in females with stomach being the 
affected organ. Based on the FDA guidance on Estimating the maximum safe starting dose in initial 
clinical trials for therapeutics in adult healthy volunteers (2005), the human equivalent dose (HED) can 
be estimated from animal NOAEL using conversion factors based on body surface area, in which the

maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) is then derived from by [CONTACT_2931] a safety factor. 1000 
mg/kg NOAEL rat dose is equivalent to HED 161 mg/kg, or [ADDRESS_944204] in human clinical trial are 45 mg/day and 90 mg/day; highest 
selected dose, 90 mg/day, is not expected to result in safety issues based on the animal data and the 
applied safety factor of 100. 
 
Primary Pharmacology studies  evaluated the effects of individual extracts of botanical components 
of DA-9805, various ratios of botanicals in the final drug substance mixture as well as the DA-[ADDRESS_944205], including increas ed 
dopamine availability , promoted dopaminergic neuron survival and recovery, and inhibition of 
mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis after MPTP and MPP+ - induced 
damage in cell culture and in mice. BF extract  effects, as well as effects of individual isolated BF 
components (saikosaponins B3, B4 and D) were studied in LPS-induced inflammatory dopaminergic 
neurodegeneration mouse model. BF extract and its individual saikosaponins components showed  the 
potential to inhibit the apoptosis of dopamine neurons in microglial cells through inhibiting the NF- кB-
mediated inflammatory pathway. ADR extract  effects were studied in multiple models. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_695973]  (LPS-activation of microglial cell culture) and in vivo , ADR decreased the levels 
of pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1b , IL-6, 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ROS and cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2), and subsequently 
alleviated oxidative stress.  In endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress model,  pre-treatment with ADR in 
human neuroblastoma cell line was found to partially protect cells from thapsigargin and tunicamycin 
cytotoxicity,  reduce intracellular ATP levels, and decrease mRNA levels of markers of ER stress 
suggesting potential to decrease neuronal damage by [CONTACT_695994]. In MPTP-induced PD mouse 
model, ADR alleviated behavioral impairments and protected against MPTP effect on tyrosine  
hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in brain catecholamine biosynthesis. Various MC, BF and 
ADR ratios were screened in vitro  (MPP+-induced mitochondrial dysfunction model in human 
neuroblastoma cells) and in vivo  (MPTP-induced mouse PD model). 1:1:[ADDRESS_944206] (paeonol, saikosaponin A and imperatorin) were shown to 
improve levels of TH in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of MPTP-induced mice at doses 
corresponding to 10 mg/kg DA-9805. Based on the results from the above studies, it was concluded 
that all three selected botanical components of DA-[ADDRESS_944207] of 
DA-9805 and the optimal ratio of the botanicals was 1:1:1.   
 
DA-[ADDRESS_944208] was investigated in multiple in vitr o and in vivo  models of PD as well 
as compared to effects of individual components in order to confirm synergistic effects. In in vitro  
studies, p re-treatment of DA -9805  was found to alleviate MPP+-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions, 
decrease endogenous indicators of ER stress induced by [CONTACT_695995]-kB activation induced by [CONTACT_162267]. DA-[ADDRESS_944209] in part be 
attributed to paeonol from MC; the inhibitory effects on MAO-B, PDE1, and DAT can at least in part 
be attributed to imperatorin from ADR.  
 Protocol # DA-9805 -PD-001 
Version 3.0  
Date: [ADDRESS_944210] of DA-9805 was further confirmed in 6 -OHDA-lesion mouse model of PD, in 
rotenone PD rat model , LPS-induced neuroinflammatory PD mouse model. Neuroprotective effects 
were shown to be stronger than those of rasagiline. Optimal DA-9805 dose from MPTP-induced PD 
mouse study was established to be 10 and 20 mg/kg.   
 
Safety Pharmacology studies  evaluated the effects of DA-[ADDRESS_944211] tested dose, 1000 mg/kg. A dog telemetry study showed 
that single oral administration of DA-9805 up to 250 mg/kg (highest tested dose) did not affect the 
blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram parameters in male beagle dogs. Additional safety 
pharmacology study, effects of DA-[ADDRESS_944212] of DA-9805 on metabolizing enzymes in liver 
microsomes and human hepatocyte culture showed that DA-9805 co-administration is not expected to 
result in clinically significant drug interactions with CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, UGT1A1, 
UGT1A4, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and SULT2A1 substrates. Higher doses of DA-9805 (5 and 10 µg/mL ) 
suggested possible interactions with CYP3A4 , CYP1A2  and CYP2B6 substrates in the in vitro  studies. 
Inhibitory activity was shown to be attributed to imperatorin and paeonol. Drug-drug interactions were 
further investigated in vivo and no significant inhibitory effects on the enzymatic activities of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A were observed in SD rats that were administered single or multiple 
oral doses of DA-9805 (60 mg/kg/day).  DA-[ADDRESS_944213] was further evaluated on uptake and influx hepatic transporters. DA-9805 inhibited the 
transport activity of OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 with IC 50 values of 74.8, 
70.1, 24.6, 9.5, 40.1, and 45.3 µg/mL, respectively. DA-9805 did not inhibit the efflux of digoxin via 
P-gp upto 200 µg/mL in LLC-PK1-MDR1 cells, but DA-9805 inhibited the transport activity of BCRP 
with IC 50 value of 20.6 µg/mL in LLC-PK1-BCRP cells. These results suggest that DA-9805 has a 
potential for drug interactions through inhibition of the transport activity of OAT1, OAT3, and BCRP.  
 
Toxicology studies  with DA-9805 showed an overall favorable profile. Acute oral toxicity  in rats at 
2000 mg/kg dose showed transient symptoms such as salivation, decrease in locomotor activity, 
incomplete eyelid opening, crouching position, panting and decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_695974]. Those symptoms were resolved within 3 hours of drug administration. The Approximate 
Lethal Dose of DA-9805 is considered to be higher than 2000 mg/kg for both sexes.  Repeat dose 
toxicity study for 13 weeks in rats concluded NOAEL of DA-9805 to be 2000 mg/kg/day in males and 
1000 mg/kg/day in females, with stomach being the target organ in females. The only toxicologically 
significant changes were erosion/ulceration in glandular and non-glandular stomach revealed in 
histopathological examination in female rats in the 2000 mg/kg/day group. Other histopathological 
changes were normalized after completion of dosing and were not considered toxicologically

significant. Repeat dose toxicity was further evaluated in a 4-week dog study to determine dosages for 
chronic toxicity studies and 750 mg/kg/day was selected.  
 
Chronic oral toxicity for 26 weeks in rats at doses ≥ 500 mg/kg/day showed salivation right after 
dosing. Transient microscopic changes that are related to DA-9805 but not considered adverse were 
observed in the liver and thyroids in both sexes at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day, stomach and duodenum in both 
sexes at 1000 and/or 2000 mg/kg/day, and bone marrow in both sexes at 2000 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL 
of this study was considered to be the highest dose at 2000 mg/kg/day in box sexes in rats. The 39-
week chronic oral toxicity study in dogs showed decrease in body weight and food consumption after 
dosing in both sexes at the highest dose of 720 mg/kg/day. These observations were considered 
adverse. Microscopic examination showed changes in the liver of females at 720 mg/kg/day with 
increased liver weight, which were considered not adverse and symptoms were reversed after recovery. 
The NOAEL of this study was considered to be 240 mg/kg/day for both sexes in dogs.

8.15 SCHWAB AND ENGLAND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING SCALE 
The Schwab & England Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale reflects the speed, ease, and 
independence with which an individual performs daily activities, or personal chores, such as eating, 
toileting, and dressing. This scale uses a rating scale from 0% to 100%, with 100% representing 
complete independence in performing daily activities and 0% representing a vegetative, bedridden 
state. 
8.16 COLUMBIA -SUICIDE SEVERITY RATING SCALE (C-SSRS) 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a widely used suicidal ideation /suicidal 
behavior assessment  tool (Posner, 2011). The C-SSRS assesses both suicidal ideation and suicidal 
behavior using questions in eleven (11) categories: five (5) for suicidal ideation, five (5) for suicidal 
behavior, and one (1) for self-injurious behavior without suicidal intent. There is a binary response 
(yes/no) for each question. For the purpose of this study, the “Lifetime/Recent” version of the C-SSRS, 
including questions spanning subjects’ lifetime as well as the one (1 ) month  prior to screening will be 
used as the baseline evaluation. On the following visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS 
will be used to assess the treatment-emergent suicidal ideation/behavior under study treatment. 
Suicidal ideation or behavior is defined as a “yes” answer to any one of the 10 suicidal ideation or 
behavior questions on the C-SSRS. All ratings will be done by a trained interviewer and ideally by [CONTACT_696001]. Examples for both versions of the C-SSRS to be used are depi[INVESTIGATOR_695975] 18-1 and text Figure 18-2. 
 
8.17 MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION  
The MMSE is a commonly used tool to evaluate cognition (Folstein et al., 1975). It comprises of 11 
items within different categories (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, language 
and complex commands). The total score can range between 0 and 30. The example scoring of the tool

Confidential Page 52 of 110  
power calculation; it is deemed adequate to provide clinically meaningful descriptive results consistent 
with the study objectives. 
9.4 RANDOMIZATION  
Treatment assignment will be based on randomization schedule. An individual, independent of the 
clinical trial team, will develop the randomization schedules. The actual randomization assignment will 
be made through an Interactive Web Based Response System (IWRS) called WebView®. Subjects who 
have provided written informed consent and have met all the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the treatment groups. 
The randomization in this multi-center study will be applied centrally across the sites and will use a 
mixed block size of 3 and 6 with a 1:1 :1 ratio of DA-9805  (45mg/day), DA-9805 (90mg/day) and 
Placebo Treatment groups.  
9.5 BLINDING AND PREVENTION OF BIAS 
The subjects, Investigators and their staff, and all Sponsor/CRO personnel involved in the 
management, and data collection in this study will be blinded to the treatment assignments.  
 
Treatment un-blinding for the study will occur after all clinical data have been received, data 
inconsistencies have been resolved, and the database is locked, except for safety reasons on a case- by-
case basis (i.e., emergency unblinding).

10 ADVERSE EVENTS (DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING) 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and 
definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when there is a safety 
evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
AEs and SAEs as detailed in this section of the protocol.

10.1 ADVERSE EVENT 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that 
occurs or is reported by [CONTACT_26487], or a worsening of a pre-existing condition. An 
AE may or may not be related to the study treatment.  
 
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and subject reports. Any abnormalities in visit 
evaluations, physical examination findings or laboratory results that the Investigator believes are 
clinically significant to the research subject and that occurred after initiation of the first study treatment 
will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded 
as an AE. 
10.[ADDRESS_944254]’s medical records and on the CRF. AEs will be reported using 
customary medical terminology along with the following information: the onset and end dates, whether 
the event is considered to be an  SAE (see Section 10.4), the impact the event had on study treatment 
(see Section 10.2.1 ), the CTCAE grade (intensity) of the event (see Section 10.2.2 ), the causality of the 
event (see Section 10.2.3 ), whether treatment was given as a result of the event (see Section 10.2.4 ), 
and the outcome of the event (see Section 10.2.5 ). 
10.2.[ADDRESS_944255] the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: none, study treatment 
interrupted, study treatment discontinued, or not applicable. The “not applicable” assessment will be 
used only when the subject is no longer in the treatment phase of the protocol, or if the outcome of the 
event was “death”. 
10.2.2  CTCAE  GRADE (INTENSITY ) ASSESSMENT  
The guidelines outlined in CTCAE v4.03 will be used for assessing the intensity of the event. The 
general guidelines for assessing the AE grade appear below. Full guidelines may be obtained at 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE . 
Table 10-1: CTCAE v4.03 General Guidelines 
Grade Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self care ADL†.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
†Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridd en.

10.2.3 CA[LOCATION_003]LITY ASSESSMENT  
Adverse events will be assigned a relationship (causality) to the study treatment. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_695977]. Relationship of AEs to study treatment will be classified as follows: 
 
1. Definitely related : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are 
incontrovertibly related to the study treatment. An AE may be assigned an attribution of 
definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment; (2) it could not be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject; (3) it follows a known response 
pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
2. Probably related:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related 
to the study treatment. An AE may be considered probable if or when (must have three): (1) it 
follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment. (2) It could 
not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455]. (3) Disappears or is decreased upon discontinuation 
of the study treatment. (4) It follows a known response pattern to treatment with the study 
treatment.  
3. Possibly related : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration 
at the time they are evaluated, are judged unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty to the 
study treatment. An AE may be considered possible if or when (must have two): (1) it follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study treatment. (2) It could not 
readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455]. (3) Disappears or is decreased upon discontinuation of the 
study treatment. (4) It follows a known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
4. Remotely related : In general this category can be considered applicable to those AEs which, 
after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged likely to be 
unrelated to the study treatment. An AE may be considered unlikely if or when (must have 
two): (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455]. (3) Disappears or is decreased 
upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It does not follow a known response pattern to 
treatment with the study treatment.  
5. Unrelated : This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc.) and determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study treatment.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_944256] in terms of treatment provided will be as either: none, medication administered, non-
medication therapy administered, surgery, or other (with a specification). 
10.2.5 OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or 
death. Only one AE per subject is allowed to have an outcome assessment as “death.” If there are 
 Protocol # DA-9805 -PD-001

Date: [ADDRESS_944257] an outcome of 
death.   
10.3 EXPECTED / ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS 
There are no expected AEs associated with participation in this study. 
10.4 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
A SAE is defined as any AE that: 
 
 Results in death 
 Is life threatening (the subject is at immediate risk of dying from the AE) 
 Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695978], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition. 
10.5   REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
The Investigator is required to report all SAEs that occur during the time period specified in 
Section 10.2. Once the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE, he/she must report the SAE to Amarex

13 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
13.1 MONITORING REQUIREMENTS  
In an effort to fulfill the obligations outlined in 21 CFR Part 312 and ICH guidelines which require the 
Sponsor to maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of a study, the Sponsor's designated 
monitor will visit the center(s) during the study as well as maintain frequent telephone and written 
communication. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is 
deemed necessary and provide access to medical records to ensure that data are being recorded 
adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
 
The Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor and/or designated CRO to inspect all CRFs 
and corresponding study subject original medical records (source documents) at regular intervals 
throughout the study. Subject original medical records and other relevant data must be available to 
support all data recorded in the CRF. In addition to the original medical records, these data may 
include but are not limited to, study, laboratory and diagnostic reports, wound images and tracings, etc.  
 
Site inspections serve to verify strict adherence to the protocol and the accuracy of the data being 
entered on the CRFs, in accordance with federal regulations. A Monitoring Log will be maintained at 
each study site that the monitor will sign, date, and state the type of visit.  
 
The Investigator should be aware that the study site and subject records may be inspected by [CONTACT_616534], FDA, or other regional regulatory authority. 
 
The final statistical analysis of data will be performed after all clinical monitoring has been completed, 
all data queries have been resolved, and all data have been verified (Quality Control checked) prior to 
formal database lock. The Sponsor will authorize the final database lock.

that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice to future treatment. The written ICF is to be in compliance with CFR 21 Part 50.27, 45 Part 
46 and GCP guidelines. The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will approve the ICF and all amendments 
to the ICF prior to submission to the IRB/IEC. A copy of the ICF to be used will be submitted by [CONTACT_24657]/IEC for review and approval prior to the start of the study. Each study site must 
provide the Sponsor with an unsigned copy of IRB/IEC-approved ICF along with applicable 
documentation to support this approval. The original signed ICF is retained in the subject's study 
records, and a copy is provided to the subject. A second copy may be filed in the subject’s medical 
record, if allowed by [CONTACT_10569].

MDS-UPDRS 
The Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-sponsored new version of the UPDRS is founded on the critique 
that was formulated by [CONTACT_454082] 's disease (Mov Disord 2003 ;18 738-750) . 
Thereafter , the MOS recruited a Chairperson to organize a program to provide the Movement Disorder 
community with a new version of the UPDRS that would maintain the overall format of the original UPDRS , but 
address issues identified in the critique as weaknesses and ambiguities . The Chairperson identified 
subcommittees with chairs and members . Each part was written by [CONTACT_696007] . These members are listed below . 
The MDS-UPDRS has four parts : Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living ), Part II (motor 
experiences of daily living , Part Ill (moto r examination) and Part IV (motor complications) . Part I has two 
components : IA concerns a number of behaviors that are assessed by [CONTACT_696008] , and IB is completed by [CONTACT_454085] , but independently of the investigator. These sections can, howeve r, be revie wed by [CONTACT_696009] . Part II 
is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire like Part IB, but can be reviewed by [CONTACT_454087] . Of note, the official versions of Part IA, Part IB and Part II of 
the MDS-UPDRS do not have separate on or off ratings . However , for individual programs or protocols the same 
questions can be used separately for on and off. Part Ill has instructions for the rater to give or demonstrate 
to the patient ; it is completed by [CONTACT_29975]. Part IV has instructions for the rater and also instructions to be read 
to the patient. This part integrates patient-derived information with the rater's clinical observations and judgments 
and is completed by [CONTACT_696010]:

Part I: Non-Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living (nM-EDL) 
Overview : This portion of the scale assesses the non-motor impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on patients' 
experiences of daily living. There are 13 questions. Part 1A is administered by [CONTACT_29975] (six questions) and focuses 
on comple x behaviors . Part 1 Bis a component of the self-administered Patient Questionnaire that covers seven 
questions on non-motor experiences of daily living. 
Part 1 A: 
In administering Part IA, the examiner should use the following guidelines : 
1. Mark at the top of the form the primary data source as patient, caregiver, or patient and caregiver in equal 
proportion . 
2. The response to each item should refer to a period encompassing the prior week including the day on which the 
information is collected . 
3. All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing scores). In the event that an item does not 
apply or cannot be rated (e.g., amputee who cannot walk), the item is marked UR for Unable to Rate. 
4. The answers should reflect the usual level of function and words such as "usually", "generally" , "most of the time" 
can be used with patients . 
5. Each question has a text for you to read (Instructions to patients/caregiver). After that statement, you can 
elaborate and probe based on the target symptoms outlined in the Instructions to examiner. You should NOT 
READ the RATING OPTIONS to the patient/caregiver , because these are written in medical terminology. From 
the interview and probing, you will use your medical judgment to arrive at the best response . 
6. Patients may have co-morbidities and other medical conditions that can affect their function . You and the patient 
must rate the problem as it exists and do not attempt to separate elements due to Parkinson's disease from other 
conditions . 
EXAMPLE OF NAVIGATING THROUGH THE RESPONSE OPTIONS FOR PART 1A 
Suggested strategies for obtaining the most accurate answer: 
After reading the instructions to the patient, you will need to probe the entire domain under discussion to determine 
Normal vs. problematic: If your questions do not identify any problem in this domain, record O and move on to the 
next question. 
If your questions identify a problem in this domain, you should work next with a reference anchor at the mid-range 
(option 2 or Mild) to find out if the patient functions at this level, better or worse. You will not be reading the choices of 
resr2onses to the r2atient as the resr2onses use clinical terminology: . You will be asking enough r2robing questions to 
determine the resr2onse that should be coded . 
Work up and down the options with the patient to identify the most accurate response, giving a final check by 
[CONTACT_454088] . 
I I 'Yes'. I Mark (0) Normal . I Is this item normal for you? I ·1 
'No, I have problems.i 
I Consider mild (2) as a reference point I 'Yes, slight is closest'. I Confirm and mark (1) Slight. I and then compare with slight (1). I ·1

This completes the questionnaire . We may have asked about problems you do not even have , 
and may have mentioned problems that you may never develop at all. Not all patients develop all 
these problems , but because they can occur , it is important to ask all the questions to every 
patient. Thank you for your time and attention in completing this questionnaire .

Part Ill: Motor Examination 
Overview : This portion of the scale assesses the motor signs of PD. In administering Part Ill of the MDS-UPDRS 
the examiner should comply with the following guidelines : 
At the top of the form , mark whether the patient is on medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease 
and, if on levodopa , the time since the last dose . 
Also, if the patient is receiving medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease , mark the patient 's 
clinical state using the following definitions 
ON is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_695982] a good response . 
OFF is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_156190] a poor response in spi[INVESTIGATOR_156191] . 
The investigator should "rate what you see". Admittedly , concurrent medical problems such as stroke , paralysis , 
arthritis , contracture , and orthopedic problems such as hip or knee replacement and scoliosis may interfere with 
individual items in the motor examination . In situations where it is absolutely impossible to test (e.g., amputations , 
plegia , limb in a cast) , use the notation "UR" for Unable to Rate . Otherwise , rate the performance of each task as the 
patient performs in the context of co-morbidities . 
All items must have an integer rating (no half points , no missing ratings ). 
Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item. These should be followed in all instances . The 
investigator demonstrates while describing tasks the patient is to perform and rates function immediately thereafter . 
For Global Spontaneous Movement and Rest Tremor items (3.14 and 3.17), these items have been placed 
purposefully at the end of the scale because clinical information pertinent to the score will be obtained throughout the 
entire examination . 
At the end of the rating , indicate if dyskinesia (chorea or dystonia) was present at the time of the examination , and if 
so, whether these movements interfered with the motor examination . 
3a Is the patient on medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease? D No DYes 
3b If the patient is recei ving medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson 's Disease , 
mark the patient 's clinical state using the following definitions : 
D ON: On is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_695982] a good response. 
D OFF : Off is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_156190] a poor response in spi[INVESTIGATOR_156191] .

3.9 ARISING FROM CHAIR 
Instructions to examiner : Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms , with both feet on the 
floor and sitting back 1n the chair (if the patient is not too short) . Ask the patient to cross his/her arms 
across the chest and then to stand up. If the patient is not successful , repeat this attempt a maximum 
up to two more times . If still unsuccessful , allow the patient to move forward in the chair to arise with 
arms folded across the chest. Allow only one attempt in this situation. If unsuccessful , allow the patient 
to push off using his/her hands on the arms of the chair. Allow a maximum of three trials of pushing off. 
If still not successful , assist the patient to arise . After the patient stands up, observe the posture for item

Instructions to examiner : The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produced by a 
quick, forceful pull on the shoulders while the patient is standing erect with eyes open and feet 
comfortably apart and parallel to each other. Test retropulsion . Stand behind the patient and instruct 
the patient on what is about to happen . Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid 
falling . There should be a solid wall behind the examiner . at least 1-[ADDRESS_944320] so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects the patient 's limitations 
rather than misunderstanding or lack of preparedness . Observe standing posture for item 3.13

Part IV: Motor Complications 
Overview and Instructions : In this section, the rater uses historical and objective information to assess two motor 
complications , dyskinesias and motor fluctuations that include OFF-state dystonia . Use all information from patient , 
caregiver , and the examination to answer the six questions that summarize function over the past week including 
today. As in the other sections , rate using only integers (no half points allowed) and leave no missing ratings . If the 
item cannot be rated , place UR for Unable to Rate . You will need to choose some answers based on percentages, 
and therefore you will need to establish how many hours generally are awake hours and use this figure as the 
denominator for "OFF " time and Dyskinesias . For "OFF dystonia ", the total "Off' time will be the denominator . 
Operational definitions for examiner 's use. 
Dyskinesias : Involuntary random movements 
Words that patients often recognize for dyskinesias include "irregular jerking ", "wiggling ", "twitching " It is essential to 
stress to the patient the difference between dyskinesias and tremor a common error when patients are assessing 
dyskinesias. 
Dystonia : contorted posture , often with a twisting component : 
Words that patients often recognize for dystonia include "spasms ", "cramps ", "posture ". 
Motor fluctuation : Variable response to medication : 
Words that patients often recognize for motor fluctuation include "wearing out', "wearing off', "roller-coaster effect ", 
"on-off ", "uneven medication effects ". 
OFF : Typi[INVESTIGATOR_156190] a poor response in spi[INVESTIGATOR_695984]. Words that patients often recognize include "low 
time ", "bad time ", "shaking time ", "slow time ", "time when my medications don't work. " 
ON: Typi[INVESTIGATOR_156189] a good response 
Words that patients often recognize include "good time ", "walking time ", "time when my medications work." 
A . DYSKINESIAS [exclusive of OFF-state dystonia] 
4.1 TIME SPENT WITH DYSKINESIAS 
Instructions to examiner : Determine the hours in the usual waking day and then the hours of 
dyskinesias . Calculate the percentage . If the patient has dyskinesias in the office , you can point them 
out as a reference to ensure that patients and caregivers understand what they are rating . You may also 
use your own acting skills to enact the dyskinetic movements you have seen in the patient before or 
show them dyskinetic movements typi[INVESTIGATOR_156202] . Exclude from this question early morning 
and nighttime painful dystonia . 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]. Over the past week , how many hours do you usually sleep on a 
daily basis, including nighttime sleep and daytime nappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]? Alright , if you sleep_ hrs, you are awake 
__ hrs. Out of those awake hours , how many hours in total do you have wiggling , twitching or Jerking 
movements? Do not count the times when you have tremor , which is a regular back and forth shaking 
or times when you have painful foot cramps or spasms in the early morning or at nighttime . I will ask 
about those later. Concentrate only on these types of w1gglmg , 1erkmg and irregular movements . Add

B. MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS 
4.3 TIME SPENT IN THE OFF STATE 
Instructions to examiner : Use the number of waki ng hours derived from 4.1 and determine the hours 
spent in the "OFF " state . Calculate the percentage . If the patient has an OFF period in the office , you 
can point to this state as a reference . You may also use your knowledge of the patient to describe a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_156201] . Additiona lly you may use your own acting skills to enact an OFF period you have 
seen in the patient before or show them OFF function typi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l of other patients . Mark down the typi[INVESTIGATOR_156203] , because you will need this number for comp leting 4.6 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]: Some patients with Parkinson's disease have a good effect 
rom their medications throughout their awake hours and we call that "ON" time. Other patients take 
their medications but still have some hours of low time, bad time, slow time or shaking time. Docto rs 
call these low periods "OFF " time. Over the past week , you told me before that you are generally awake

Date: [ADDRESS_944329] OF FLUCTUATIONS 
Instructions to examiner : Determine the degree to which motor fluctuations impact on the patient's daily 
function in terms of activities and social interactions . This question concentrates on the difference 
between the ON state and the OFF state . If the patient has no OFF time, the rating must be 0, but if 
patients have very mild fluctuations , it is still possible to be rated O on this item if no impact on activities 
occurs . Use the patient's and caregiver 's response to your question and your own observations during 
the office visit to arrive at the best answer . 
Instru ctions to patient {and caregiver /: Think about when those low or "OFF " periods have occurred over 
the past week . Do you usually have more problems doing things or being with people than compared to 
the rest of the day when you feel your medications working? Are there some things you usually do 
during a good period that you have trouble with or stop doing during a low period? 
O: Normal : 
1: Slight: 
2: Mild: 
3: Moderate : 
4: Severe : No fluctuations or No impact by [CONTACT_156285] . 
Fluctuations impact on a few activities , but during OFF , the patient usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interactions that typi[INVESTIGATOR_156204] . 
Fluctuations impact many activities , but during OFF , the patient still usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social intera ctions that typi[INVESTIGATOR_156204] . 
Fluctuations impact on the performance of activities during OFF to the point that 
the patient usually does not perform some activities or participate in some 
social interactions that are performed during ON periods . 
Fluctuations impact on function to the point that, during OFF , the patient usually 
does not perform most activities or participate in most social interactions that 
are performed during ON periods . 
4.5 COMPLEXITY OF MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS 
Instructions to examiner : Determine the usual predictability of OFF function whether due to dose , time 
of day, food intake or other factors. Use the information provided by [CONTACT_156286] . You will ask if the patient can count on them always coming at 
a special time, mostly coming at a special time (in which case you will probe further to separate slight 
from mild) , only sometimes coming at a special time or are they totally unpredictable? Narrowing down 
the percentage will allow you to find the correct answer . 
Instru ctions to patient {and caregiver/: For some patients , the low or "OFF " periods happen at certain 
times during day or when they do activities like eating or exercising . Over the past week , do you usually 
know when your low periods will occur? In other words , do your low periods always come at a certain 
time? Do they mostly come at a certain time? Do they only sometimes come at a certain time? Are 
your low periods totally unpredictable? " 
O: Normal : No motor fluctuations . 
1: Slight: OFF times are predictable all or almost all of the time(> 75%) . 
2: Mild: OFF times are predictable most of the time (51-75%) . 
3: Moderate : OFF times are predictable some of the time (26-50%) .

Instru ctions to exam iner: For patients who have motor fluctuations , determine what proportion of the 
OFF epi[INVESTIGATOR_454013]? You have already determined the number of hours of 
"OFF " time (4.3). Of these hours , determine how many are associated with dystonia and calculate the 
percentage . If there is no OFF time, mark 0. 
Instru ctions to patient [and caregiver/: In one of the questions I asked earlier , you said you generally 
have_ hours of low or "OFF " time when your Parkinson's disease is under poor control. During these 
low or "OFF " periods , do you usually have painful cramps or spasms? Out of the total __ hrs of this 
low time, if you add up all the time in a day when these painful cramps come , how many hours would 
this make? 
O: Normal : No dystonia OR NO OFF TIME .

Summary statement to patient: READ TO PATIENT D 
This completes my rating of your Parkinson 's disease . I know the questions and tasks have taken several minutes , but 
I wanted to be complete and cover all possibilities . In doing so, I may have asked about problems you do not even 
have , and I may have mentioned problems that you may never develop at all. Not all patients develop all these 
problems , but because they can occur , it is important to ask all the questions to every patient. Thank you for your time 
and attention in completing this scale with me.

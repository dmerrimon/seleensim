Version date 11/ 26/[ADDRESS_522791] conservation therapy (BCT), 
consisting of partial mastectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy, offers equivalent disease control 
in women with Stage I and II breast cancer as compared to mastectomy , and it offers significantly 
superior disease control when compared to partial mastectomy alone [1-3]. BCT offers patients 
better cosmetic outcomes with less emotional trauma than mastectomy [4]. In the setting of ductal 
carcinom a in situ , adjuvant radiation therapy has been shown to increase local control when 
delivered as a part of breast conservation surgery [5-7].  
 The standard method for administering brea st irradiation as a part of BCT is whole breast irradiation 
(WBI) , where the entire breast is treated with external beam radiation delivered in five daily 
fractions per week for several weeks, often followed by a boost to the partial mastectomy site. 
Typic al whole breast doses range from 40-[ADDRESS_522792] to forgo the radiation therapy component resulting in suboptimal care [8-10].  
 Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques were  developed in part to improve breast 
conserv ing surgery rates  and compliance with adjuvant radiation therapy. APBI challenges the 
paradigm that the entire breast should be subjected to adjuvant radiation therapy by [CONTACT_125908] a 
volume of breast tissue around the partial mastectomy site.  APBI is based on both pathologic [ 11] 
and empi[INVESTIGATOR_29121] [12] data that demonstrates that the greatest site for an ipsilateral breast tumor 
recurrence (IBTR) is near the partial mastectomy surgical bed  in patients who are at an overall low 
risk for multicentric foci of disease .  As most commonly practice d, APBI deli vers a total dose of 
34 Gy in 10 BID fractions over five treatment days via high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy.  APBI 
began by [CONTACT_414610] a number of others, 
including the Oschner Clinic, [13] William Beaumont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [14], and the Radiati on Therapy 
Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 95-17[15] trial which all describ ed excell ent outcomes .   Unfortunately, 
multicatheter interstitial implants proved technically challenging and never achieved widespread 
popularity.  This led  a number of companies to develop intracavity brachytherapy applicators such 
as the Mammosite (Holologic, B edford, MA ), Contura  (Bard Biopsy Systems, Tempe, AZ ), and 
SAVI (Cianna  Medical, Aliso Viejo, CA ).   Although there are a number of technical  differences 
between these devices, they are all inserted  into the partial mastectomy cavity and serve as 
applicators for HDR brachytherapy.  The largest series of intracavitary APBI is the Mammosite registry trial that reports a less than 4% five- year IBTR [16].   
 To avoid the attendant risks of pain, bleeding , and infection that are associated with intracavity 
APBI  applicator placement, investigators have developed external beam methods of treating a 
limited breast volume.  Exter nal beam APBI uses three dimensional treatment planning (3D- CRT) 
to develop a complex, patient -specific beam  arrangement  to treat the target volume  to a dose of 
38.5 Gy in 10 BID fractions over five treatment days.  Typi [INVESTIGATOR_897] , three to six beams are used  and 
there is the occasional need for intensity modulated beams.  3D-CRT has been studied by [CONTACT_111557] 
0319 trial [17] and by [CONTACT_414611][INVESTIGATOR_307] [ 18], with low IBTR in 
both publications .  In general 3D -CRT avoids the applicator placement issues of intracavitary APBI 
Version date 11/ 26/[ADDRESS_522793] completed a phase I/II trial of multicatheter 
APBI  that was designed  to quantify five year IBTR with a narrow 95% confidence interval  (HRPO# 
03-1205).  We have demonstrated low IBTR [19] while maintaining excellent cosmetic results[ 20] 
with low toxicity [21].  Since then , we have initiated both intracavitary and external beam APBI 
programs.  We have completed a dose escalation study utilizing 3D -CRT APBI  (HRPO# 05-1053).  
At present  we offer APBI or WBI therapy as treatment options for early- stage breast cancer in 
appropriately selected patients.  An exhaustive list of APBI studies using a variety of techniques is reported in Smith et al [22]. 
 
1.2 Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy (TARGIT)  
 
APBI minimizes the irradiated volume  and shortens the treatment time for adjuvant radiation 
therapy all while maintaining low IBTR.  The ultimate extrapolation of APBI is to reduce the fractionation to one and the treatment time to several minutes after partial mastectomy.  TARGIT 
is such a method.  Although TARGIT will be  described for the necessary context, it is important to 
note from the outset  that this proposed clinical trial involves replicating  the TARGIT radiation dose 
distribution but does not use the TARGIT device or involve delivering radiation dose 
intraoperatively.   Adjuvant radiation in the TARGIT method is generated from the Intrabeam 
device (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, [LOCATION_013]).  This FDA-approved device provides a point source of 
low energy x -rays (50 kV maximum) at the tip of a 3.2 mm diameter tube that is placed at the center 
of a spherical applicator (Figure 1).  After a standard partial mastectomy an appropriate applicator 
is selected and placed in the tumor bed.  The Intrabeam device is swi tched on for 20- [ADDRESS_522794] wall and/or the skin can be protected by [CONTACT_414612] -filled 
polyurethane caps.

patients[ 23] where it was used to replace the boost component of whole breast radia tion therapy.  
There were no major complication s and no IBTR at [ADDRESS_522796] 
radiation therapy [24].  The five year IBTR was 2.6% and complications remained acceptable.   The 
finding that the TARGIT method was feasible along with the separate, coincident development of 
APBI methods led to the design of a prospective, randomized, non- inferiority phase III trial that 
compared standard whole breast radiation therapy with TARGIT-alone APBI (Figure 2).    
Eligible patients included women at least [ADDRESS_522797] of 10- 16 Gy.  This study has completed 
planned accrual and is in follow -up [ 25].  Median age was 63 y ears, 86% of tumors were ≤ 2 cm, 
83% of patients had node negative disease, and 90% of patients had estrogen receptor -positive 
disease.  Early results showed a 4 -year IBTR of 1.2% in the control arm and 0.95% in the TARGIT 
arm. In the TARGIT arm  the infection rate was 1.8% and 3.3% had skin breakdown or delayed 
wound healing.  Further publications from this study are planned when the median follow -up is 
greater.  
 
Figure 2. TARGIT -A Trial Schema  
 
The major shortcoming of the TARGIT approach is the need to administer radiation therapy before 
the true pathologic extent of disease is known .  In the TARGIT -A study , 15% of patients  in the 
TARGIT arm  had unexpected pathologic findings that resulted in them requiring an additional 25 

Version date 11/ 26/[ADDRESS_522798] tissue after some healing has occurred negating some of the benefits of a single treatment.   Finally TARGIT 
involves considerable expense as it  requires purchase of dedicated equipment that has few other 
uses.  
 
1.3 Single Fraction High Gradient APBI (HG -PBI)  
 The proposed clinical trial arose from discussion regarding the numerous merits of TARGIT treatment along with its significant limitations.  Clearly a single treatment that is well tolerated and 
effective has enormous appeal.  It has the potential to minimize the impact of local breast cancer 
treatment on the lives of thousands of women each year.  And yet the fa ct that TARGIT is 
insufficient treatment due to a margin issue, lymph node metastasis, or some other pathologic finding in at least 15% of patients (and the frequency is likely to be greater in clinical practice than 
it was in a clinical trial) is clearly unsatisfying.  A review of the radiation dose distributions 
generated in TARGIT demonstrates that they are very similar to those achieved by [CONTACT_414613] (SBRT).  SBRT is a relative recent method of delivering highly conformal 
radiation dose distributions via external beam radiation therapy ; it is commonly used in the 
radiotherapeutic management of small tumors in the lung, liver, and vertebral bodies [26]. In SBRT , 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_414597].  SBRT utilizes special patient 
immobilization devices and requires image guided radiation therapy , but it has become  well 
estab lished in most large radiation oncology clinics. 
 
As a preliminary work , we examined  the radiation therapy CT data sets of several patients who 
were treated with 3D -CRT APBI .  We sought  to determine the feasibility of generating 
dosimetrically acceptable plans with external beam. Our main dosimetric goal was to deliver [ADDRESS_522799], lung, and 
heart.  These plans which included IMRT plans using the flattening filter free mode on TrueBeam  
(Varian Medical Systems Inc. , Palo Alto, CA)  as well as Smart Arc (Philips, Amersterdam, NL)  
plans, showed good conformality and coverage with minimal exposure to normal tissue.  An 
example of a 5 field IMRT plan is shown in F igure  3a and 3b below
. 
 
 
Figure 3a (Left) : Isodose distribution for a 5 
field IMRT plan using the 10 MV flattening 
filter free mode from TrueBeam.  The dark 
blue target is the surgical bed with a prescription Dose of 20 Gy (Magenta line). The cyan target is a 1cm  expansion of the 
surgical bed which is expected to be covered 
by 7 Gy (shown in blue). Dose to the lungs 
should be less than 5Gy (green line).   The 
yellow line represents the 3 Gy isodose.  
 Figure 3b (below): Isodose distribution for a SmartArc Plan on a different patient.  Again 
the dark blue target is the surgical bed while 
the cyan is a 1 cm expansion.  
Version date 11/ 26/[ADDRESS_522800] demonstrated that it is feasible to generate these plans in several patients who received 
conventional APBI  (Table 1).  This dose distribution has been shown to be well tolerated and 
effective in the TARGIT studies.  We believe that this will also be the case when external beam radiation therapy is used.  Our proposed approach allows us to avoid administering radiation before the pathologic extent of disease is known and without the purchase of specialized intraoperative 
radiation equipment.  If successful this has the potential to revolutionize partial breast irradiation 
by [CONTACT_414614].  Our first step is this proposed single 
institution phase I/II study designed primarily to evaluate the tolerance of this approach which we are choosing to call Single Fraction High Gradient APBI  (HG -PBI) .

Max 8.[ADDRESS_522801] method for cosmetic evaluation.  Harris described a four category qualitative scoring system whereby 
[CONTACT_414615], good, fair, or poor.[ 27] Although this method provided for 
easy patient assessment of their own cosmesis, Pezner demonstrated that consensus between 
observers could only be attained if the four categories were reduced to excellent/good versus 
fair/poor. [28] Aaronson expanded the Harris scale to include global cosmetic result, appearance of 
the surgical scar, breast size, breast shape, nipple position, shape of the areola, and skin color as 
categories to be evaluated by [CONTACT_414616]. [29] (See Appendix I) Whelan et al recently 
reported the cosmetic results in BCT using Aaronson’s scale in the setting of a large phase III National Cancer Institute of C anada trial testing two radiotherapy fractionation schedules. [30] At 
five years , 76- 77% of patients had an excellent or good cosmetic outcome.  A more quantitative 
cosmetic assessment is the Breast Retraction Assessment (BRA) originally proposed by [CONTACT_414617] [31] 
(See Appendix  III).  This tool attempts to quantify the retraction in the treated breast versus the 
contralateral , untreated breast.  The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) has published a validation study of the Aaronson scale and the B RA using [ADDRESS_522802] cancer involved in a much larger trial. [32, 33] The investigators describe 
moderate intraobserver agreement for the qualitative scoring system with a simple Kappa of 0.42 
and a fair interobserver agreement with a multiple Kappa of 0.27.  The BRA had a mean value of 
30 mm with an intraobserver deviation from average of 2.3 mm (7.7%) and an interobserver 
deviation from the mean of 2.6 mm (8.7%).  The BRA and the qualitative score were significantly 
correlated; however, some treatment sequelae such as scars or skin changes were best measured 
Version date 11/ 26/[ADDRESS_522803] Cancer 
 Quality of Life (QoL) has emerged as an important endpoint in therapeutic clinical trials.  This has 
been particularly true in the study of diseases that have excellent overall survival and/or equivalent alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Measures of QoL have evolved from qualitative descriptions such as 
performance status assigned by [CONTACT_414618].  The EORTC Study Group on QoL has developed and 
validated a general cancer QoL questionnaire with several site- specific modules.  The general 
cancer QoL questionnaire (QLQ -C30 shown in Appendix VI) contains thirty questions that assess 
the impact of disease and treatment on the daily life o f cancer patients and is optimally used in 
conjunction with the appropriate disease site module. [34] The QLQ- C30 is scored using algorithms 
developed by [CONTACT_51222].[ 35] Groenvold reported high agreement between the QLQ -C30 and 
observer rating of patients response to open- ended responses to the same questions. [36] McLahlan 
showed that the QLQ -C30 questionnaire showed expected divergent validity for breast cancer 
patients who were expected to have different QoL based on such differences as performance status 
or treatment with chemotherapy.[ 37] The same study also demonstrated convergent validity 
between the QLQ -C30 and several widely used QoL scales such as the Psychosocial Adjustment 
to Illness Scale (PAIS) and the Profile of Mood Status (POMS).  Spangers has described the development and vali dity analysis of a breast cancer specific module, the QLQ -BR23, that 
measures QoL issues more specific to breast cancer than the general QoL issues assessed by [CONTACT_204811] -C30.[ 38] The QLQ -BR23 (See Appendix I V) is a twenty -three- item questionnaire that takes 
an average of 9.2 minutes (SD, 4.7 min) to complete.  It has been found to be reliable and clinically 
valid in American women with breast cancer. [38] This study will use the QLQ -C30 and the QLQ-
BR23 to assess QoL before, during, and after brachytherapy.  Permission to use these copyrig hted 
instruments for this study has been obtained.  A standard Visual Analog Scale for Pain will be used 
for general pain assessment.

the breast, treated with partial mastectomy.  Axillary sampling is required only for cases of 
invasive cancers.  Tumor size is determined by [CONTACT_10063] (Section 6.2). Clinical size may 
be used if the pathologic size is indeterminate.   Patients with invasive cancer must have no 
positive axillary ly mph nodes with at least [ADDRESS_522805] from the inked edge.[ 41] 
 
3. Invasive ductal, lobular, medullary, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], colloid (mucinous), tubular histologies, or mixed histologies (lesions ≤ 2 cm) that are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive and do not 
exhibit HER2/neu gene amplification  OR ductal carcinoma in situ (lesions ≤ 2 cm). 
 
4. Systemic therapy, if planned, must be adjuvant in nature and not be scheduled to begin for at least 4 weeks after completion of HG- PBI. 
 5. Good candidate for treatment per protocol in the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or treating physician 
following simulation.  
 
6. Postmenopausal status .

5.2.3 Technical Factors  
Version date 11/ 26/19   page 17 of 41   
The guidelines for IMRT in this trial will conform to the policies set by [CONTACT_414623] (ATC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which may be 
found at:  http://atc.wustl.edu/home/NCI/NCI_IMRT_Guidelines.html .  Each of the target 
volumes and normal structure s listed below must be delineated on each slice from the 3D 
planning CT in which that structure exists.   Megavoltage photon beams with energies ≥ [ADDRESS_522812] scan in the treatment position will be required to define the 
clinical  target volumes (CTV) and planning target volumes (PTV).  The CT required for 
generation of a virtual plan with 3DCRT or IMRT must be post -lumpectomy .  Radio -
opaque markers must be placed on external landmarks at the acquisition of the CT scan to facilitate contouring segmentation of the CT data -set. These markers should  identify:  
1. The lumpectomy incision 
2. The outline of the palpable breast tissue circumferentially at least from 2 o’clock 
to 10 o’clock 
3. The superior border of the breast tissue at 12 o’clock based on palpation 
 
The CT should extend cephalad to start at or above the mandible and extend sufficiently  
caudally (or inferiorly) to the inframammary fold to encompass the entire lung volume. A 
CT scan image thickness of ≤ 0.5 cm should be employed.  External skin localizing marks, 
which may include permanent tattoos, are allowed . 
 
5.2.5 Treatment Plan ning/Target Volumes  
 
The definitions for the CTV, PTV and normal structures used in this protocol generally conform to the 1993 ICRU report #[ADDRESS_522813] cancer found at:

muscles are excluded  from the PTV Cavity . 
 
PTV Cavity + 1 cm : PTV Cavity  + [ADDRESS_522814] 5 mm of tissue under the skin (in order to remove most of the build up region for the DVH analysis) and excluding beyond the posterior extent of breast tissue (chest wall , pectoralis 
muscles and lung) when pertinent. The PTV Cavity + 1 cm should not cross midline. This PTV Cavity + [ADDRESS_522815] CTV: Includes the palpable breast tissue demarcated with radio -opaque 
markers at CT simulation (see Section 5.2.3), the apparent CT glandular breast 
tissue visualized by  [CONTACT_4654], consensus definitions of anatomical borders, and the 
Lumpectomy CTV from the  breast cancer atlas ( see Partial Mastectomy 
Volumes above ). The breast CTV is limited anteriorly within [ADDRESS_522816] wall, boney thorax and lung. In general, the pectoralis 
and/or serratous anterior muscles are excluded from the breast CTV unless 
clinically warranted  by [CONTACT_102]’s pathology. The breast CTV should 
generally follow consensus guidelines found at:  
http://www.rtog.or g/CoreLab/ContouringAtlases/BreastCancerAtlas.aspx  
 
Contralateral Breast  
Includes the apparent CT glandular breast tissue visualized by [CONTACT_414624]. In 
general the borders are:  
Posterior bor der: At the anterior surface of the pectoralis, serratous anterior 
muscles excluding chest  wall, ribs, boney thorax and lung/heart; 
Medial border: The sternal -costal junction,  
Lateral border : Varies based on the size of the breast but typi[INVESTIGATOR_414601]-axillary line  and excludes the ipsilateral lattismus dorsi muscle. 
Cephald border : Should be similar to that of the ipsilateral breast CTV  
Caudal:border : Inframammry fold and should be similar to that of the 
ipsilateral breast CTV.  
Anterior border: Skin minus [ADDRESS_522817] contouring atlas  found at:

Ipsilateral Lung 
This may be contoured with auto-segmentation with manual verification. 
 
Contralateral Lung 
This may be contoured with auto-segmentation with manual verification 
 
 
Heart  
This is to be contoured on all cases , not just the left sided cases. The heart 
Version date 11/ 26/[ADDRESS_522818] inferior to the level in which the pulmonary 
trunk branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries (PA). Above the PA, 
none of the heart’s [ADDRESS_522819] extent near the diaphragm. 
The following structures , if identifiable , should be excluded from the heart 
contour: esophagus, great vessels (ascending and descending aorta, inferior  
vena cava). One need not include pericardial fat, if present. Contouring along the pericardium itself, when visible, is appropriate. 
 
Thyroid 
The thyroid is easily visible on a non- contrast CT due to its preferential 
absorption of iodine, rendering it “brighter” or denser than the surrounding 
neck soft tissues. The left and right  lobes of the thyroid are somewhat 
triangular in shape and often do not converge anteriorly at  mid-line. All 
“bright” thyroid tissue should be contoured.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Planning  
 
CT-based planning with tissue inhomogeneity correction is required. 
 
IMRT or 3D -CRT are permitted; arc based delivery is allowed ; Co -[ADDRESS_522820] a minimum dose of 15 Gy and maximum of 22 Gy .  
PTV Cavity + [ADDRESS_522821] a minimum dose of 5 Gy.  With these goals a 
high dose gradient is achieved.  
 
Normal tissue constraints: Skin structure is from skin to skin -3 in the region of 
the target Dmax ≤ 22 Gy, V20 ≤ 10mL, V10 ≤ 15mL, V3 ≤ 20 mL.  
Contralateral Lung Dmax ≤ 3 Gy, V5 ≤ 5%; Ipsilateral Lung Dmax ≤ 7 Gy, 
V5 ≤ 5%; Heart V5 ≤ 2%; Thyroid V5 ≤ 10%.

5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time  the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health 
and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the  case report forms.  
 Treatment will consist of a partial mastectomy and single fraction of HG -PBI which will take place 
no more than 8 weeks after final definitive surgical procedure.  Treatment will be discontinued if  
one of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression  
• Death  
Version date 11/ 26/19   page 20 of 41  • Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or permanent 
harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non compliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study 
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
5.[ADDRESS_522823] tumor recurrence (IBTR).   
Recurrence in a regional lymph node is a regional failure.  The regional lymph nodes are defined 
as the axillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular and internal mammary lymph nodes.  The definition 
of recurrence of breast cancer is: histologic evidence of recurrent carcinoma, either invasive or non -
invasive (except LCIS) in the ipsilateral breast.  
 
Clinical evidence of recurrent carcinoma by [CONTACT_26853]/or mammogram will not be 
construed as evidence of treatment failure without biopsy proof, but will be considered as 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_414602].  Ipsilateral breast recurrences will be categorized as local (infield) if they 
occur within the prescription isodose volume, peripheral if between the prescription isodose volume 
and a volume [ADDRESS_522824] before treatment, 
6-10 weeks after HG-PBI, at 4 -8 month follow -up, at 10-14 month follow -up, and at yearly 
intervals thereafter for a total of 5 years following HG -PBI.  Cosm esis will be graded on qualitative 
and quantitative scales. 
 
 
 
6.3.1 Qualitative Evaluation 
Version date 11/ 26/19   page 21 of 41   
The Aaronson modification of the Harris scale will be used to qualitatively evaluate 
cosmesis.  The patient and physician forms are included in Appendix I and II.  The 
following general descriptors will be used:  
• Excellent - when compared to the untreated breast, there is minimal or no 
difference in the size, shape or texture of the treated breast. There may be mild 
thickening or scar tissue within the breast or skin, but  not enough to change the 
appearance.  
• Good - there is mild asymmetry in the size or shape of the treated breast as 
compared to the normal breast. The thickening or scar tissue within the breast causes only a mild change in the shape.  
• Fair - there is obvi ous difference in the size and shape of the treated breast. This 
change involves 1/[ADDRESS_522825].  
• Poor  - marked change in the appearance of the treated breast involving more than 
1/[ADDRESS_522826] or NP at each follow up assessment.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Specific Aims  
 
11.1.1 Specific Aim 1  
 
We will quantify the tolerance of HG -PBI by [CONTACT_414619] -
related grade 3 or higher toxicity (per CTCAE, v.4.0) or any other grade [ADDRESS_522829].  
Version date 11/ 26/19   page 27 of 41  Rare toxicities include radiation pneumonitis and pericarditis.  Hypothesis:  Morbidity 
occurs in approximately 5 -8% of patients with a maximum  allowable proportion with grade 
3-5 toxicities of 12%.  A sequential probability ratio stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_414605].  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_522830] tumor recurrence rate at 5 years after HG -PBI as the 
sole radiation therapy technique following partial mastectomy.   Hypothesis: The IBTR 
will be less than 15.9% with 95% confidence resulting in a treatment strategy worthy of 
further investigation in a larger clinical trial.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_522831] cosmesis over time using the validated, qua ntitative 
parameter pBRA.  Hypothesis:  The pBRA will not significantly change over time.  We 
have previously demonstrated this in the setting of multicatheter APBI.[ 20] 
 
11.[ADDRESS_522832]  (IBTR) .  Secondary endpoints are the proportion of patients who are free of breast cancer in 
the regional lymph nodes  (ipsilateral axilla, infraclavicular, supraclavicular, and internal mammary 
groups) , free from distant disease, and proportion surviving.  Additional secondary endpoints are 
quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_20368] -C3 and QLQ -BR23, cosmesis as measured 
quantitatively by [CONTACT_414625], cosmesis as measured qualitatively by [CONTACT_414626], the presence or absence of complications, the occurrence of mastectomy after 
completion of initial breast- conserving treatment and the frequency of any CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 -4 
toxicities.  
 
11.3 Study Design and Analysis Plan 
 
This is a singl e arm, non- randomized phase I/II study of 50 patients with stage 0  (tumor size ≤ 2cm)  
or I breast cancer.  The primary study goal is to quantify  the tolerance of HG -PBI by [CONTACT_414627] -related grade 3 or higher toxicity (per CTCAE, v.4.0) or any other 
grade [ADDRESS_522833].  Rare toxicities include radiation pneumonitis and pericarditis.  These are expected to occur in approximately 5 -8% of patients with a maximum allowable proportion with grade 3- 5 toxicities 
of 12%.  A sequential probability ratio stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_414606]. For example, the study will be suspended for review of toxicity if [ADDRESS_522834] 26 patients.  The full criteria for 
monitoring are given in the table below.  All toxicities and other serious adverse events will be 
reported to the Clinical Trials Office and to QASM as described.  
  
 
The study wil l be suspended for review  if:   
this number of patients are before this number of patients 
Version date 11/ 26/19   page 28 of 41  observed with grade 3 -
5 toxicity:  have completed the

Patients will be followed for 5 years.  The primary goals of the study involve tolerance to treatment ; 
the proportion of patients who are breast cancer free 5 years after treatment will be calculated with a 95% confidence interval.  Cosmetic outcome will be assessed qualitatively by [CONTACT_414628].  The two sets of scores will be plotted using histograms showing the proportion rating the outcome excellent, good, fair and poor.  Kappa statistics with 
95% confidence intervals will be calculated to assess the agreement between patient and physician 
scores before treatment, at [ADDRESS_522835] and other anatomical features.  
pBRA scores will be plotted at the assessment points and presented graphically.  Quality of life 
will be assessed using the 30 items of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and 23 items of the QL Q-B23 and the 
Visual Analog Scale for Pain.  The QLQ -C30 includes 6 general questions and 24 questions in 9 
subscales measuring physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social function, as well as global health status, nausea/ vomiting, pain and fatigue.  The QLQ -B23 provides [ADDRESS_522836] 
cancer specific subscales, 4 measuring symptoms and 4 measuring function.  Each of the subscales will be tabulated and presented graphically over the assessment times.  Mixed repeated measures models will be ge nerated to describe the nature of change in quality of life over time.  
Complications will be tabulated and frequencies presented graphically.  The rate of mastectomy within five years of treatment will be calculated with a 95% confidence interval.  
11.[ADDRESS_522837] cancer 
recurrence (IBTR) 5 years after treatment  which  will be compared with the current expected value 
in the medical literature .  Fyles reported that the five -year IBTR in a large population of women ≥ 
[ADDRESS_522838] cancers treated with partial mastectomy and tamox ifen but no radiation therapy was 5.9%[ 39].  HG -PBI will be considered worthy of further 
investigation if 1) the treatment -related toxicity rate as described above is less than 12%  and 2) the 
five-year IBTR is not significantly greater than 10% higher  than that observed in the Fyles study .  
Binomial proportion power analysis, assuming an alpha -level of 0.05, determined that we will 
obtain approximately 70% power to detect a proportion significantly larger than 15.9% given the true five -year IBTR is the same as that observed in the Fyles study.  If [ADDRESS_522839] tumor recurrences (IBTR) do not cause a diminished overall 
survival.  Nonetheless , they do represent a failure of breast conservation.  We will assess the 
Version date 11/ 26/19   page 29 of 41  possibility of an unexpected rise in IBTR by [CONTACT_414629] t hat expected 
from an exponential distribution with an event rate of 5% over [ADDRESS_522840] the p -values for multiple looks. 
 
11.6 Accrual  
 
It is estimated that less than 10% of the patients treated in this study will be lost to follow up.  
Therefore, because the accrual goal is 50 evaluable patients (at [ADDRESS_522841]- treatment), target 
accrual is 55 patients to account for the 10% anticipated drop- out.  It is estimated that patient accrual 
will take two to three years. 
 
The investigators are well aware that several prior clinical trials that involved breast cancer at the 
Washington University Medical Center and the Siteman Cancer Center suffered from poor accrual.  
We believe that this trial will have excellent patient ac crual.  The primary source of patients who 
may be eligible for this study is via the breast surgeons of the Section of Endocrine and Oncologic Surgery here at Washington University.  The chief breast surgeon is a collaborator in this study and 
is very supportive.  The fact that a large fraction of patients with a common cancer disease are eligible for this study should lend further reassurance that this study ought to enjoy excellent patient 
accrual.  The following series of conservative estimates provide an approximation of patient 
accrual: in [ADDRESS_522842] cancer were seen by [CONTACT_414630].  A conservative estimate is that 20% of these patients had an 
early stage breast cancer that would be eligible for this study.  A further conservative estimate is that a third of these patients will consent to participate in this study.  This yields an estimated 
accrual of just over 25 patients per year.

APPENDIX I : Patient Evaluation of the Treated Breast  
 
You have been treated  with breast -conserving therapy for breast cancer. As you know, a reason for choosing 
this treatment is the potential for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a breast that looks and feels as close to normal as possible. Your 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_414607] e to us.  
  
I. Please circle the word below which best describes your judgment of the cosmetic results of therapy at 
this time:  
EXCELLENT  when compared to the untreated breast, there is minimal or no difference in the size or shape of the treated breast. T he way the breast feels (its texture) is the same 
or slightly different. There may be mild thickening or scar tissue within the breast or skin, but not enough to change the appearance.  
GOOD   there is mild asymmetry between the breasts, which means that th ere is a slight 
difference in the size or shape of the treated breast as compared to the opposite 
breast. There may be some mild reddening or darkening of the breast. The 
thickening or scar tissue within the breast causes only a mild change in the shape.  
FAIR  moderate deformity of the breast, with an obvious difference in the size and shape 
of the treated breast. This change involves 1/[ADDRESS_522848] involving more than 1/[ADDRESS_522849] conservation therapy, your overall feeling is: 
A) completely satisfied with the treatment and results.  
B) not totally satisfied, but would choose breast conservation therapy again. 
C) dissatisfied with breast conservation therapy.  
 III. If you had it all over to do again, would you prefer to have your breast cancer treated:  
A) just the way you were treated.  
B) with a mastectomy, not requiring radiation therapy. 
 
IV. It is sometimes very difficult to tell if the changes in your treated breast are due to the surgery, the 
radiation therapy, or both. Try to remember what the breast looked like after the surgery, but before the radiation treatments began. Now compare that  memory to the appearance of the breast now. The changes 
within your breast at this time are in your opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]: A) caused mostly by [CONTACT_414632]. 
B) caused by [CONTACT_414633], but mostly by [CONTACT_414632]. 
C) caused by [CONTACT_414633], but mostly by [CONTACT_414634].  
D) caused mostly by [CONTACT_414634].  
E) can't judge which treatment caused the change.  
F) there are no changes.  
 
PLEASE PRINT YOUR NAME:                                                     [CONTACT_81619]: _________________________

The physician should never share his evaluation with the patient, as it may influence subsequent patient 
evaluations. Also, do not glance at previous evaluations...it is the evolution of cosmetic changes we are 
studying.

I. Please assess the cosmetic results of breast conservation therapy at this time  (Circle one):  
EXCELLENT  when compared to the untreated breast, there is minimal or no difference in the 
size or shape of the treated breast. The way the breast feels (its texture) is the same 
or slightly different. There may be mild thickening or scar tissue within the breast 
or skin, but not enough to change the appearance.  
GOOD  there is mild asymmetry between the breasts, which means that there is a slight difference in the size or shape of the treated breast as compared to the opposite 
breast. There may be some mild reddening or darkening of the breast. The 
thickening or scar tissue within the breast causes only a mild change in the shape.  
FAIR  moderate deformity of the breast, with an obvious difference in the size and shape 
of the treated breast. This change involves 1/[ADDRESS_522850] involving more than 1/[ADDRESS_522851] been better treated by 
a mastectomy.  
 
II. In the physician's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the changes within the treated breast are: 
A) caused mostly by [CONTACT_414632]. 
B) caused by [CONTACT_414633], but mostly by [CONTACT_414632].

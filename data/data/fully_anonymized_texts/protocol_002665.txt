1.0 Background  
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract 
which includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis  (UC).  1 A recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_847996] 4 million people worldwide are affected and  approximately 
1.4 million of these cases occur in the [LOCATION_002]. 2  IBD can lead to debilitating symptoms, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], decreased quality of life , frequent  procedures and/or surgery. Treatment options 
consist of immunosuppressive therapy, such as systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators 
(thiopurines and methotrexate) and/or biologics, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) 
agents or an integrin inhibitor, vedolizumab.  They can achieve clinical remission and decrease 
the risk of complications, but also increase the risk for infection s, including influenza. [ADDRESS_1178926] shown lower influenza vaccine responses in patients with IBD compared 
to healthy individuals; IBD patients treated with TNF agents or combination therapy (TNF 
inhibitors and immunomodulators) are very likely to mount a poor immune response. 
8-10  
Influenza s erum antibody concentration correlates with protection from infection following 
vaccination . 11 Therefore, increasing influenza antibody responses in patients with IBD would 
appear to be critical to improving protection from influenza. A high dose ( HD) influenza vaccine 
containing four times more hemagglutinin was licensed based on its ability to induce higher antibody concentrations compared to standard dose (SD) in adults 65 years or older. 
12 Based  on 
this information , we propose the following two specific aims:  
 
Specific Aim #1:   Determine whether HD influenza vaccine induces higher antibody 
concentrations and sustained response in immunosuppressed IBD patients  compared to 
SD.   We hypothesize that IBD patients who receive HD influenza vaccine will mount higher 
antibody concentrations to at least two of the influenza vaccine viruses.  
 
Specific Aim #2:   Evaluate the influenza vaccine response in IBD patients treated with  
vedolizumab, a new gut selective immunosuppressant.    We hypothesize that patients on 
vedolizumab will mount a normal immune response since vedolizumab affects  only gut 
lymphocyte trafficking  and does not induce systemic immunosuppression. [ADDRESS_1178927] effective influenza vaccine for immunosuppressed

Bowel Disease Patients  
 
 
IBD patients  and determine if patients on vedolizumab mount a normal response. Th is study 
could provide influenza vaccination protocols for other immunosuppressed populations.   
2. Objectives  
 
2.1 Primary Objective 
 
To evaluate if vaccination with HD influenza vaccine induces higher antibody concentration in IBD patients on TNF inhibitors.   
2.11 Primary objective aim #1:  Antibody response  
We will evaluate if the HDIV induces higher antibody concentrations in IBD pa tients compared 
to SDIV by [CONTACT_847998] 3 antibody concentrations between the two groups 
 
Specific aim #2  
To evaluate the influenza vaccine response in IBD patients treated with vedolizumab, a new gut 
selective immunosuppressant 
 2.12 Primary Objective aim #2:   Antibody Response  We will compare influenza antibody 
concentrations after vaccination in patients with IBD treated with vedolizumab to healthy individuals using the [ADDRESS_1178929] immunization time point.   
2.2  Secondary Objectives  
 
2.21 Secondary outcomes #1 aim #1: Sustained response  
A subsequent titer will be done in [ADDRESS_1178930] vaccination 
time point in each group.  
2.22 Secondary outcomes # 2 aim # 1: Vaccine response rates   
We will compare seroprotection and seroconversion rates between the HDIV and SDIV groups. 
 
2.23 Secondary outcomes #3 aim # 1: Vaccine safety   
Study participants will be given a diary card to record  symptoms following influenza vaccine 
administration .  We anticipate that the HDIV  will cause more injection site reactions
12 than the 
SDIV but will otherwise be well -tolerated .  
 
 
2.31 Secondary outcomes # 1 Specific aim # 2: Sustained response  
A subsequent titer will be done in 6 months to assess sustainability of antibody concentration 
through the season.

7.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  An AE is considered serious if, in the view of the investigator results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• A life threatening AE (an AE is considered “life threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
• Death  
 
7.3  Reporting of Adverse Events  Adverse events will be reported to the HSC IRB as required and to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).  https://vaers.hhs.gov/index

27,28 Each individual in the trial will be also categorized as either “Yes” or 
“No” in terms of seroconversion.29,30 All three measures (mean fold increase (MFI)  in antibody 
concentration pre to post- immunization , seroconversion, and seroprot ection) for all of each 
year’s  three antigens, will be assessed  and statistically analyzed individually.  
 
8.2  Influenza antibody concentration analysis 
Hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) will be used to measure influenza antibodies .  HIA will 
be performed in duplicate using standard microtiter techniques and serial dilutions.  Titrated 
influenza antigen is incubated with the serum dilutions for 30 minutes.  Guinea pig red blood 
cells (50 µl of 0.5% in phosphate buffered saline) are added and incubated for 45 minutes. The 
dilution of serum that no longer inhibits hemagglutination is the influenza antibody titer. These

ratio.  This strategy yields 89% power to detect an A/H3N2 antibody concentration of [ADDRESS_1178948] differences in A/H1N1 
influenza antibody concentrations is greater than 90%.  However, this sample size yields only a 60% power to detect the similar difference between groups. The likely reason for this low power is that the study upon which we are basing our sample size calculations showed a GMT of [ADDRESS_1178949] performed the tests we plan to perform for this study, we will keep any leftover blood and use it in future re search projects. Data created from the subjects’  participation in this 
study will also be stored. This will be stored and locked in the GI Research Office. Although the specific research using your specimens is not known, the research will be related to th e study of 
IBD and/or vaccine- related research . Banking of these samples is required for participation, and 
not optional. [CONTACT_848001] and the GI Research Office staff will have access to the codes links. If 
subjects no longer wish for their sample to be st ored they can contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Caldera or the research 
office and the specimens will be disposed of according to standard medical research procedures. If subjects do not make such a request, the specimen will be stored indefinitely.  Specimens will be labeled w ith the subjects study ID number and date of collection so that data 
collected for this protocol can be linked to the sample. Samples will be stored in Rennebohm Hall at the University of Wisconsin. Only investigators and key personnel assigned to the laboratory have access to the lab. Samples will be coded (labeled with subject ID and date of collection) 
before they arrive to the lab. All computers used for data storage and analysis are password 
protected and used exclusively by [CONTACT_69289].  Any future studies that will use these specimens will be don e by [CONTACT_240159] a separate IRB approval. Only coded samples and data will be released for future 
research. The information linking the samples and data to individual subjects wi ll not be released.

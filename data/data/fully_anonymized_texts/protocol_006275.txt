Specific A ims: 
Transcranial di rect current stimulation (tDCS)  is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique 1-4 that can 
modulate cortical excitability of tar geted brain regions . One can measure tDCS induced changes in excitability 
using a different noninvasive brain stimulation method - transcranial magnetic stimul ation (TMS) . Various 
studies have  investigated tDCS use in stroke patients with motor impairment s (cumulatively about 200 cases ) 
5-11. Although these studies  are mostly  “proof  of concept”  with small sample size , they do suggest  that tDCS 
may improve motor function. Before a Phase II single- center clinical trial ( a R01 application) to assess the 
efficacy of tDCS for stroke motor recovery  is launched by [CONTACT_517315], two critical scientific questions need to 
be answered  FIRST  in order to increase the likelihood of success o f clinical trial in planning.  
What is the optimal  current  for stroke patients ? No systematic investigation has been done  to determine 
the most  efficacious  current that is both safe and tolerable for stroke patient s. There is empi[INVESTIGATOR_517301] [ADDRESS_670444] established a much higher safety limit (>50X) than the human 
protocol s, but safety concerns have limited  tDCS current to 2 mA for human subjects.  This is a critical issue to 
explore because it is likely that a higher current  is more efficacious in increasing cortical excitability  and hence 
motor reco very in stroke patients.  
Aim 1: To determine the optimal tDCS current in stroke subjects  
The optimal current balances cortical excitability and tolerability/safety in stroke patients.  We will invesitigate  
the optimal curent  in range of [ADDRESS_670445] 3+3 
experimental design that is commonly used to find the maximal tolerable dose in drug  trials. Tolerability/safety 
will be investigated by [CONTACT_517316] a quesionnaire before and after stimulation, additionally by [CONTACT_517317] (1) Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Diffusion Weighted Imaging (MRI/DWI) to detect any focal ischemia; 
and 2) Molecular biomarkers: S100b and neuron -specific enolase (NSE) to detect neuronal injury. Cortical 
excitability is measured by [CONTACT_517318] (MEPs) induced by [CONTACT_517319].  
What is the optimal tDCS electrode montage for stimulation?  According to t he theoretical model 
underlying the use of tDCS for stroke motor recovery , stroke c auses an “interhemispheric  imbalance 
15-17” with 
decreased motor excitability  in the ipsilesional hemisphere and excessive excitability  in the contralesional 
hemis phere. This has led to studies testing the effects of  anodal (excitatory) stimulation to the lesion al 
hemisphere  8,18, cathodal stimulation ( inhibitory) to the non- lesion al hemisphere 6,11 or combined bi-
hemispheric stimul ation  19,20.  However, it has not been established which montage can induce the maximal 
cortical excita bility, and eventually  the maximal m otor recovery.    
Aim 2: To determine t he optimal tDCS electrode montage in stroke subjects  
We hypothesize that the bi -hemispheric stimulation with anodal stimulation on the lesional  hemisphere and 
simultaneous cathodal s timulation  on the non-lesion al hemisphere induces more cortical excitability in the 
lesional hemisphere than either anodal stimulation on the affected hemisphere or cathodal stimulation on non-
lesional hemisphere alone. We will use a randomized,  complete block design in which all stroke subjects 
undergo each of the three electrode montages (on different day s) at the current  determined in Aim1. As in Aim 
1, MEPs from the affected APB muscle will  recorded pre-  and post - stimulation  to determine the optimal 
montage  for the maximal cortical excitability from  the lesional hemisphere.

 This proposal  lays the scientific foundation for systema tic application of tDCS in stroke recovery  research.  It 
also serve s as an important bridging step  between the applicant’s prio r training and his next mi lestone - a 
Phase II single -center clinical trial ( a R01 application) to assess the efficacy of tDCS for stroke motor recovery  
with the optimal current  and stimulation montage  determined by [CONTACT_418323].   
 
 
A: Significance:  
A1. Motor Deficit s Associated with S troke:  There are 795,[ADDRESS_670446] common deficit after stroke 23. Stroke 
recovery strategies, such as, innovative equipment (robo tic24), cellular therapy25, and brain stimulation 
(invasively26 or noninvasively27) seek to enhance neural plasticity thereby [CONTACT_517320]. tDCS is a 
portable, non- invasive brain stim ulation technique 1-4 that can be applied simultaneously with rehabilitation 
therapy with potential to improve motor function in stroke survivors.  
A2. tDCS to Augment Motor I mprovement : tDCS  can modulate the excitability of targeted brain regions by 
[CONTACT_517321]- voltage,  direct current that is transmit ted through the 
skull via  surface electrodes 4. Behavioral effects after a single 10- [ADDRESS_670447] likely due t o the 
modulation of cellular NMDA -receptors 4,28 and through augmentation of synaptic plasticity that 
requir es the presence of BDNF  30. To date, tDCS has been tested across the world in thousands of  healthy 
subjects  and patients with vari ous disease conditions 12. In 12 published studies  (summaried in applicant’s 
review31), mostly “proof of concept”  studies with small sampl e size, subjects have included about 200 stroke 
patient s with motor deficit s with current ≤ 2 mA . This technique shows promise of emerging as a n adjunctive  
therapeutic tool  to promote motor recovery ; however, two  scientific questions must be answered before it can 
be further tested in large phase II/III clinic al trial. For  example, the optimal current (dose) is not clear , nor is the 
electrode montage for stroke patients.   
A3. Safety and Current (Dose)  Issues: Theoretical knowledge regarding the safety and tolerability of 
electrical stimulation is based on phys ical aspect of this technique and data  from both animal and healthy 
human studies . These data support the safety of the present tDCS protocols  1,3,4,13,14,32. Heatlhy subjects are 
exposed to “ no significant r isk” at currents ranging of  0.5 to 2 mA for up to 40 minutes either over a single 
session or mul tiple sessions . However, safety implication s are not clear  in stroke patients (i.e., subjects  with a  
brain lesion ) and there may be potential for increased risk. So far there has been no single,  dedicated study to 
systematically evaluate the safey and tolerability of tDCS at various current s in the stroke population. 
Commonly  reported side effects occured at t he site where the electrodes are placed and are a minor issue  3,33: 
local scalp itching, tingling or  burning sensations , transient headaches  or stimulation -induced skin lesions 34,[ADDRESS_670448] dermatitis 36. The size of the eletrode pad also matters in term s of safety and tolerability . Electrode 
size determines current density. It is defined as current/electrode contact [CONTACT_37264].  Depending on the size of the 
electrode ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3 × 5 cm², 5 × 5 cm2 or 5 × 7  cm²), current density  even  at 4 mA – the highest current  
available for clinical research (Chattanooga Dual -Channel Iontophoresis Device) , is approximately 0.11 
mA/cm2 to 0.27  mA/cm2. This current density is  considerably below the safety threshold determined by  
[CONTACT_517322] 32 or the safety limit (~2%) established in an  animal study14. While underdosing 
is possible,  safety concerns have led researchers to avoid higher tDCS  current in stroke patients . Two studies 
Version 03/02/[ADDRESS_670449] s in healthy subjects 37 and working 
memory in patients with Parkinson disease38. It is not clear whether there is a linear current (dose) response 
relationship associated with current and cortical excitability, especially when the current exceeds [ADDRESS_670450] balance safety and current ( dose) . For research with tDCS, it is critically 
important maximal current levels not be “frozen” at an arbitrary limit of 2 mA , especially if a higher dose is 
tolerated and produces more excitability changes and are thus likely more effective. Without performing an 
initial current (dose) finding and safety study, t he field risks performing clinical trials that might be ineffective or 
less effective, but solely because of underdosing. Rather than wasting the time and money on potentially 
under -dosed studies, it is important to establish this knowledge of dose effects  now.  
A4. Electrode Montage for Stimulation In Stroke Patients:  The second scientific gap concerns  the optimal  
electrode montage that is most favorable for cortical stimulation in stroke patients. The theoretical model  15-[ADDRESS_670451]-stroke motor recovery  is that of  “interhemispheric  imbalance (Figure 
1A)”. After a stroke , there is decreased motor activity in the ipsi-lesional hemi sphere  and excessive activity in 
the contra -lesional hemisphere, and they are associated with poor motor recovery.  In efforts to correct such 
imbalance,  tDCS was applied either by  
• Anodal stimulation (Figure 1B ) on the affected hemisphere 8,18 to up -regulate the cortical excitability , or  
• Cathodal stimulation (Figure 1C ) on the non-lesional hemisphere  to down- regulate the cortical 
excitability  6,11, or 
• Bi-hemispheric stimulation (Figure 1D ) with anodal stimulation on affected hemisphere and 
simultaneous cathodal stimulation on non -lesional hemisphere 19,[ADDRESS_670452] defines the funda mental work needed before systematically investigating the 
application of the technique in promoting motor recovery in stroke patients, thereby [CONTACT_517323].

B.  Innovation:  
• Innovative trial design . We innov atively adapt a 3+3 trial design (Figure 4) that is commonly used in 
drug trials to assess safety and tolerability of tDCS current for Aim 1. Current associated with tDCS 
technique is like dosage to a drug that can be adjustable. Evaluating safety /tolerabi lity of tDCS 
technique is similar to assessing drug safety  and dosing finding. While innovative, the design is  simple 
and easy to understand as well as to implement.  
• Use of MR imaging and biomarkers to test for subclinical neuronal injury. We will test for  
subclinical injuries with a combination of imaging and biomarker measurements to best ensure 
thesafety in stroke subjects, as opposed to only assessing safety and tolerability with clinically 
detectable symptoms as done in most of the previous tDCS safety  studies. MRI Diffusion Weight 
Imaging, dependent on the motion of water molecules, provides information regarding tissue integrity. It 
is a gold standard for early detection of brain ischemia 42 with a high sensitivity as well as high 
specificity 43. An Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) value decrease represents diffusion restriction 
while an ADC value increase indicates an increase in water mobility in the stimulated cortex. Neuron -
speci fic enolase (NSE) and S -100b protein (S -100b) are two widely investigated molecular markers for 
brain injury 44-46. NSE originates from the cytoplasm  of neurons and neuroendocrine cells. S -100 protein 
is a dimeric acidic calcium -binding protein found in the brain with high concentrations in astrocytes and 
Schwann cells. The serum levels of these proteins are elevated after different types of brain injury including focal and global ischemia 
46-48, traumatic brain injury 49 and hypoxic brain injury 50. 
C:  Preliminary data:   
In the applicant’s lab, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  “Bihemiespheric 
Stimulation and Constraint ed-Induced ovement 
Therapy  (CIMT) to Promote Post -Stroke Motor 
Recovery ” is currently ongoing with [ADDRESS_670453] demonstrated that  
bihemispheric stimulation with 2  mA and electrode size 
of 15 cm ² (current density is 0.133mA/ cm²) for [ADDRESS_670454]  experienced 
transient scalp redness under the anodal stimulation 
Version 03/02/2017

electrode.  Vital signs  for all four patients  were stable and no one discontinued the study  due to side effects  
(Table 1 ). No new focal ischemic  lesions were observed on  MRI DWI sequence and no changes in Apparent 
Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)  map was observed in any  of 3 subjects  (Figure 2) .  
We also observed an increased cortical excitability  on the a ffected motor cortex in all three stroke subjects  
(Figure 3) . The increased cortical excitability from lesional motor cortex is associated with postive changes 
with behavioral assessment using FM -UE scal a nd Wolf Motor Functional Test (data not shown).  
In summary,  consisent with prior studies and consensus from experts in the field, [ADDRESS_670455]  established the feasibility of recruiting stroke subjects and using 
tDCS as proposed and using TMS for cortica l excitability  assessment .  
D: Approach:  
This grant proposal  is divided into two independent, but well -connected experiments  – Aim 1 to determine the 
optimal  current  and Aim 2 to address  the optimal stimulation montage.  
 
 
D1.1 Design:   
This aim is a phase I type  study to determine t he most efficacious current  for tDCS, recognizing that this 
current level  must be  tolerable and safe . The trial 
design is adapted from the classical, gold- standard 3+3 
drug trial design 51,52, which  is commonly used to find 
the maximal tolerable dose for  a chemical drug . The 
main justification for this design is that the maximal 
tolerable current  (dose)  is usually and arbitrarily 
defined as the dose at which one- third of the patient s 
experience current ( dose )-limiting major side 
effects/response . The algorithm  for current ( dose ) 
escalation is detailed in ( Figure 4 ). The study  starts 
with 1 mA :  (a) if no major  response occurs in any of 
the three subjects , a next current at 2 mA will be used 
next; (b) if major response occurs  in 2-3 study subjects , 
then the trial will stop at this current level; (c) if majo r 
response occur s in one subject , then [ADDRESS_670456] the safety of 
same current  dose;  if no major response  occurs,  then 
the current will be escalated next current  level; if further  major response occurs,  then the trial will terminate . 
The previous current  level will be  defined as the maximal tolerable current (dose) . The curren t tDCS device  
avaiable on the market  (Chattanooga Dual -Channel Iontophoresis Device ) for research use has a max imal 
current of 4.0  mA. The sequence for current  escalation will be  1.0 mA  >> 2.0 mA  >> 2.5 mA >> 3.0 mA >> 3.5 
mA >> 4.0 mA. 
While we vary current in this protocol, other features of the stimulation will be controlled:   
• Duration of stimulation  will be 30 minutes: Data show the increased excitability  of tDCS  can last as 
long as 90 minutes.  Our rehabilitation intervention will take one hour. Thus, by [CONTACT_2329] 30 minutes  of Aim 1: To determine the optimal current  in stroke patients  
Version 03/02/2017 
7 
 stimulation , as has  been commonly used in stroke studi es, we should ensure that the potentially 
beneficial effects of the stimulation will not wear off during the course of rehabilitation.   
• Size of electrode  will be 3 × 5 cm² : The commonly used 3  × 5 cm ² size pad is chosen because it is 
adequate to cover the  the primary motor cortex  – our area of interest for brain stimulation  in strok e 
subjects  to facilitate upper extremity motor function recovery .  
• Electrode montage will be  bi-hemispheric stimulation : the bi -hemispheric stimulation montage is 
used for Aim [ADDRESS_670457].  
 
Definition of Major Response and “ Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]”:  
A major response is defined by [CONTACT_517324].  
It serves as the “ stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37595]” as detailed in the Figure 4 above.  
• Second degree scalp burn at the site of electrode pad;  or 
• Seizure; or 
• New lesion(s) on DWI sequence of MRI scan and the lesion(s) is not explained by [CONTACT_364820](s) 
or decreased ADC under the electrode stimulating motor cortex area ; or 
• Patient discontinues from the study due to any reasons above.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
Each subject must meet  all of the following criteria to participate in this study.

increase in MEP s amplitude compared with other current  levels.  
 
 
 
D2.1. Design:  
This is a repeated measures design in which a group of stroke subjects will each receive one of three 
stimulation montages (anodal stimulation, cathodal stimulation and bihemispheric stimulation) on three 
different days (separated by [CONTACT_517326]). The order in which they receive the three montages 
will be randomized to account for order effects.  The primary purpose here is to deter mine the stimulation 
montage that induces the largest cortical excitability on the lesional hemisphere.  The rationale of the design is 
that each subject serves as his/her own control, thus eliminating between- subject variation and makes it easier 
to determine changes in cortical excitability between conditions. We will require at least two days between each stimulation session so that there is little risk of carry over as the after -effect from tDCS have been shown 
to last over one hour
29.

laboratory. Subjects of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test  prior to 
each stimulation session.  
9. The BSTIM core  will perform cortical excitability assessment using TMS in the

laboratory). Estimated time is [ADDRESS_670473] for 2 days , then  come back to repeat the procedure 
7-11 twice to received other two stimulation sessions.  
 
D2.3 Statistical Analysis:  
The primary outcome measure will be the quotient of post/pre MEPs amplitude recorded from  the affected APB 
muscle  to represent the cortical excitability in the lesional motor cortex. Assuming power of 85% and type I 
error of 0.05, (Bonferroni adjusted for 3 comparisons), [ADDRESS_670474]/pre MEP quotient 
and include covariates in the secondary analyses to glean more information about the variability in the 
outcome. The statistical analyses will be performed with SAS V9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC).  
D2.4 Anticipated Results:    
We anticipate that the bihemispheric stimulation  ( anodal on the lesional hemisphere and cathodal stimulation 
on the non- lesional  hemisphere) will induce the largest increase in the cortical excitability in the lesional 
hemisphere compared with the other two stimulation montages  – anodal stimulation on the lesional 
hemisphere only or cathodal stimulation  on non -lesional  hemisphere  only.   
D3.1 Limitation, Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_517302]:  
Version 03/02/2017 
12 
 • Why not perform these studies in heal thy subjec ts first? We are pursuing a similar study  in healthy 
subjects through other funding mechanisms. However, the information from healthy subjects can not be 
applied to stroke patients because they are completely different populations. In general, there is a 
concern for potential increased risk for stroke patients for tDCS stimulation.   
• We are testing for effects and safety with a single session, but the treatment s tudies would likely involve 
multiple  tDCS sessions? Feasibility, unlikely to see cumula tive safety issues over multiple sessions.   
• If the  difference of induced cortical excitability between different electrode stimulation montage is 
smaller than expected, the alternative approach is to increase sample size or consider multiple sessions rather than single session.

will b e visually inspected for signal changes by a blinded board certified neuro- radiologist or neurologist. 
Furthermore, pi[INVESTIGATOR_517304] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_517305] -stimulation ADC parametric images from the baseline ADC 
parametric images will be performed by [CONTACT_517330]. Statistical difference between the 
ADC values before and after stimulation will be calculated and analyzed.  
Laboratory P rotocol:   
The laboratory test will be processed and analyzed at  [CONTACT_517345]’s lan in the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_517306], before stimulation, after stimulation and one week after stimulation. The samples will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and stored at − 20 °C prior to the analyses. 
The NSE assays will be performed using a radioimmunoassay technique (Cobas Core NSE EIA, Hoffmann- La 
[COMPANY_002], Switzerland). The S -100b concentrations will be measured by [CONTACT_517331] (LIAmat® Sangtec®100, Sangtec Medical, Sweden). The sensitivity of the S -100b 
assay will be b0.02 μg/l.  
TMS protocol:   
The TMS evaluation will be conducted at the Brain Stimulation Laboratory ( BSTIM  Core) and performed by 
[CONTACT_517332]. Subjects will be seated comfortably in a chair 
specifically designed with a chin rest, head rest and molded armrest in which they could keep their arms in a 
constant relaxed pos ition. Subjects have 9mm Ag/AgCl surface electrodes placed over the abductor pollicis 
brevis (APB) muscle.  The TMS coil will be positioned using a neuronavigational guidance system (Brainsight  
™, Rogue Research Inc., Montreal Quebec) along with the partici pant’s MRI.   Given that neuroanatomy is 
often shifted post stroke, this system will allow us to maximize precision of the coil placement.  The stereotactic 
guidance system consisted of trackers attached to the TMS coil and to the subject’s head which could be 
detected by [CONTACT_517333]. Following a calibration procedure, these trackers are monitored by [CONTACT_244454] 03/02/[ADDRESS_670477] 's anatomical MRI scan.  This 
technique facilitates repeated positioning of the TMS coil over the subject’s brain.  The location of the motor 
area governing the thumb is isolated for each individual by [CONTACT_517334] 0.5 cm steps to find the site 
at which the maximum twitch could be elicited. EMG signals are recorded using a closed- loop system, in which 
feedback from the EMG is used to control the output of the TMS machine via specially written scripts (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]2 
software, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]). The raw EMG signal is amplified and bandpass 
filtered (low -pass = 0.5 Hz, high- pass = 1 kHz) using the CED 1902 Quad- System (Cambridge Electronic 
Design Limited, Cambridge, U.K.). It is digitized (sampling rate = 5 kHz) and recorded onto a PC using Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]2 
software and a Micro 1401 data acquisition uni t  (Cambridge Electronic Design Limited, Cambridge, U.K.). The 
resting motor threshold (rMT) is determined using a procedure known as the maximum -likelihood strategy in 
which the parameter estimation by [CONTACT_79738] (PEST) algorithm is used 53,54. The PEST method uses 
the EMG response to the TMS pulse to determine if TMS intensity needs to be increased o r decreased. In our 
closed- loop system, the TMS machine is automatically adjusted according to PEST output, resulting in an MEP 
of 50 µV in 50% of trials. Thus, the rMT is determined in a matter of minutes, is much less labor intensive compared with the Mi lls-Nithi IFCN method and less prone to human error. Cortical excitability was tested by 
[CONTACT_26129] 10 TMS pulses to M1 of each hemisphere (TMS intensity of 20% above the individual rMT to induce MEPs of at least 1 mV, if MEPs size is smaller than 1mV, then TMS intensity will go up to 100% and kept at 100%). The same intensity was kept constant pre and post -stimulation.  Ten MEPs will be recorded for each 
hemisphere, and their peak -to-peak amplitude will be averaged to determine MEPs amplitude.    
tDCS Protoc ol:  
Direct current stimulation will be delivered to the study subjects through 2 saline- soaked EasyPad (3cm * 
5cm=15cm²) using a Chattanooga Dual -Channel Iontophoresis Device (Chattanooga Medical. Inc). For this 
protocol, the bihemispheric stimulation montage will be used because a safety profile can be evaluated for both anodal stimulation and cathodal stimuation on the same subject. The anodal stimulation will be placed over the 
ipsi-lesional and the cathodal over the contra- lesional motor cortex (C3 and C4 areas by [CONTACT_517335] 
10 –20 EEG electrode systems). Electrode pads will be disposed after each stimulation session. During the 
middle of stimulation, an inspection of electrode pads will be conducted to make sure they have not dried out, and  the scalp temperature will be measured using a touchless thermometer. Stimulation will last for [ADDRESS_670478] will be blinded to  dosage and montage of stimulation by [CONTACT_517336]. The 
experiment will be conducted in the Upper Extremity Funciton Laboratory of the Center for Rehabilitional 
Research in Neurologic al Conditons ( QBAR core ).  
Customized Task -Oriented Training Pr otocol:    
Subjects will engage in one hour of concentrated task -practice directed at the paretic arm and hand. Task -
practice sessions will be structured and supervised by a trained and licensed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Selection of functional motor tasks for a given subject will be derived from their basel ine FM -UE score 
55. Based upon as sessment 
information obtained from  the baseline FM -UE score, motor tasks will be selected t hat are optimally 
challenging and customized to personal abilities and goals.   This method also allows for systematic 
progression of task types and difficulty to maintain a “just -right” match between the subject’s abilities and task -
difficulty.   Tasks prac tices will address specific gross- motor, fine- motor, proximal, and/or distal movement 
components within the context of functional tasks. Repetition and feedback schedules and methods will follow 
the theoretical framework of the Task -Oriented Approach.  
D5. 1. Timeline:  
Version 03/02/2017

About 600 patients per year with a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke were  admitted to MUSC Stroke 
Center. About 12- 15% patients (6 -  8 patients per month) can meet the inclusion criteria. In addition, Center of 
rehabilitation Science in Neurological Conditions mains a database with 50 stroke subjects who were agreed to 
be contact[CONTACT_94092] , this study will also recruit from the Registry for Stroke Recovery 
(RESTORE -Pro# 00037803), which is a registry with subjects consented for future contact. (please refer to 
details in D5.5) . Thus, we should have no problem obtaining the required number of subjects from the CTTR 
Core . The protocol will be  submitted to the MUSC IRB with expect ation of final approval by [CONTACT_11713] , 2013. 
Subject  enrollment will begin immediately if the proposal is funded.  We expect to complete the Aim1 in year 1 
and aim  2 in year 2 ( Table 1).  
D5. 2. Integration with COBRE :  
This proposal is well integrated into the COBRE application. It utilize s all of three scientific cores in the COBRE 
(Figure ), and most importantly, the applicant has a clear plan for a next project to continuously utilize all of 
cores . Further, the proposed study  will advance the BSTIM Core  as it potentially leads to a new treatment for 
post-stroke motor recovery.  Specifically, much of the study will be performed in the  QBAR Core  laboratories  
and a QBAR therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517307] 1 and Aim 2. The 
BSTIM  Core will provide the tDCS device , TMS  and necessary training. The research assistant  from Brain 
stimulation laboratory, along with the applicant; will conduct TMS assessment of cortical excitability on stroke 
subjects.  The MR scan will be conducted at the Center of Advance Imaging Center (CAIR) where  NI Core is 
located. The NI Core  will also provide necessary training and 
staff for imaging process and analysis.  
The applicant  already had multidisciplinary  collaboration with 
other junior investigators in the COBRE application. For example, [CONTACT_239377] has an established collaborativ e relationship with [CONTACT_517346] whose expertise is neuro- imaging with functional MRI 
and cortical excitability assessment with TMS . They have 
collaborated on the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  “Bihemiespheric 
Stimulation and Constrainted- Induced Movement Therapy to 
Promote Post -Stroke Motor Recovery ”. Part of data from this Table 1  Pre-year Year 1  Year 2

project also provide a neurobiological  basis for stroke recovery . The result from her project  could be helpful for 
[CONTACT_239377] t o design the R01 project in planning to uncover t he recovery mechanism associated with  tDCS. [CONTACT_517347] also has collaborated with [CONTACT_517348] whose expertise is investigating rTMS as an adjunct tool for 
stroke rec overy while [CONTACT_239377]’s  is studying how tDCS promote stroke recovery. tDCS and rTMS are two 
similar but different non -invasive brain stimulation techniques , they both have the capabilitlity to modulate 
cortical excitability and induce subsequent brain plasticity , currently they  both hold promise for stroke motor 
recovery . They have been meeting regularly  to trouble shoot technical aspects of the two techniques , and  
working together testing the new magstim® rTMS  with brainsight.  
D5.3. Mentoring Plan:  
[CONTACT_517349] is  the Primary Mentor .  He  is a Professor,  endowed chair and director of MUSC  Stroke 
Center . His clinical research has involved selection of imaging methods, such as Transcranial Doppler (TCD)  
and MRI, to assess the intracranial arteries and help predict prognosis in patients with sickle c ell vascu lopathy.  
He is an expert in stroke trial design and execution of  multicenter studies. He has  continuous NIH funding 
since 1988, and his current portfolio includes a R01, one of three formal “Multiple PI’s” in a lar ge U01 clinical 
trial, and he is  the head of a stroke project funded by [CONTACT_517337].  [CONTACT_103834]  has substantial 
experience i n nurturing junior faculty throughout his  career, including one who has become Chair of Neurology 
in an academic institution.  Since he  has been at MUS C in 2007, he has trained two stroke fellows and 
mentored two junior faculty members who have K award in good standing. Thus, he is the ideal mentor for me 
as I aim to become a successful academic faculty member.  Specifically he will supervise me on clinic al trial 
design and execution and DSMB.  
[CONTACT_101231] is a Co-mentor . [CONTACT_95052] is  professor of Department of Behavioral Science and 
Psychiatry, director of brain stimulation laboratory,  an internat ionally -recognized expert in Non -invasive brain 
stimula tion techniques , including TMS and tDCS.  He is one of the founders of therapeutic rTMS techniques, 
and Editor -in-Chief of the journal Brain Stimulation.  He has extensive research experience with development 
and application tDCS in various disease conditions. He  will specifically provide mentorship relating to tDCS  
application and trouble shoot during the experiments.  
In addition, I will also receive mentorship from the scientific cores through participation in all of their mentoring 
activities. By [CONTACT_517338], my specific goals are to gain knowledge and be expert in training 
in trial design, Neuroimaging, and brain stimulation, in addition, I would like to transition into  an independent , 
successful federally funded research scientist in s troke recovery and rehabilitation.  
D5.4. Applicant’s Future Project  (Including R01) :  
This proposal  serve s as a critic  bridging step between the applicant’s prior training and his next mi lestone - an 
R01 application.  The R01 is planned to sub mit in the end of year two  when the proposed experiments are 
close to completion. The proposed R01 project is a Phase II single -center clinical trial to assess the efficacy of 
tDCS for post -stroke motor recovery  with the current and stimulation montage determined from this proposal . If 
R01 project show promising result, [CONTACT_239377] hope to launch a U01 project to further test the tDCS in post -
stroke motor recovery in a multi -center phase III clinical trial.  
D5.5 Additional information about recruiting patients from resear ch database:  
Subjects with stroke will be recruited from the recruitment database maintained at the MUSC Center for 
Rehabilitation Research in Neurological Conditions (CRRND) which is housed in the CHP Department of 
Health Sciences and Research (secondary appointment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_517308]). The research database (approved MUSC IRB #[ZIP_CODE]) currently contains ~[ADDRESS_670480] signed informed consent and agreed to be contact[CONTACT_107800]. The research 
Version 03/02/2017 
16 
 database is managed by a designated coordinator. This coordinator will be provided with the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the current study. This study will also recruit from the Registry for Stroke Recovery (RESTORE -Pro# 00037803), which is a registry with subjects consented for future contact. 
RESTORE staff will query the registry for potential subjects and provide the Principal Investigator (PI) with the contact [CONTACT_247345].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_517309]. When a potential participant is identified that meet inclusion criteria the PI, project coordinator or research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517310]. If they wish to participate they will be scheduled for a time for the PI, project 
coordinator or research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517311]. Consent will be obtained 
after reviewing the protocol and consen t form with each potential subject. If a potential subject is deemed 
unable to participate in informed consent, consent will be obtained from a relative with the patient present. For 
patients consenting themselves, every attempt will be made to have a relative present during the informed 
consent. The MUSC IRB will approve the informed consent form.  
 
D5.6 Sharing Data :  
If the subject agrees, the data collected and generated from this study will be shared to the Registry for Stroke 
Recovery (RESTORE -Pro# 00037803) by [CONTACT_423]’s registry ID. Sharing data from this study with the 
registry will allow for more targeted recruitment efforts in the future and allow researchers at MUSC to have a more complete registry with key stroke recovery elements including com mon data and physical function 
characteristics that are applicable to multiple studies. MUSC researchers and collaborating facilities will be able to query data sets to learn more about recovery of subjects after their stroke through institutionally 
managed secure servers that will assure HIPAA privacy and security compliance.

2) Protection to Human Subjects:  
Potential Risk to Human Subjects  
tDCS:  Extensive a nimal and human evidence and theoretical knowledge indicate that t he presently  used tDCS 
protocols up to 2mA are safe1,3,4. It involves minimal risk to human subjects. Commonly reported side effects 
are as followed: skin irritation with  itching, tingling, burning sensation,  transient headache  or naus ea. For part 
one of the study where the level of current is being tested higher than 2mA, there maybe potential  side effects.  
They include burns under the pads, seizure, changes on MRI, and change s in blood test results. If patient 
experience any of serious adverse event  which meet the ‘stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]”, the trial will be evaluted by [CONTACT_517339]. The risks associated with pregnancy and tDC S are unknown. Pregnant women are 
excluded. All female subjects that are of childbearing age that have not had a hysterectomy will be ask their 
method of birth control and will be questioned prior to each session if there is a possibility that they might be 
pregnant. Acceptable forms of include birth control  condom use or hormonal contraceptives.  
 
MRI:   The test will be done using equipment similar to that used for clinical MRI. The current revision of the US 
Food and Drug Administration guidelines (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug 
Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Guidance for the submission of premarket 
Version 03/02/2017 
18 
 notifications for magnetic resonance diagnostic devices, Washington, DC. November 14, 1998) applies to this 
study. These guidelines state that magnetic resonance imaging systems with main static magnetic field strengths  of 4.0T (a measure of magnetic strength) and less, such as the ones used for this study, can qualify 
as non- significant risk devices.   
Because the MRI machine acts like a large magnet, it could move iron -containing objects in the MRI room 
during your exam ination, which could in the process possibly harm you. Precautions have been taken to 
prevent such an event from happening; loose metal objects, like  key chains, are not allowed in the MRI room. If 
you have a pi[INVESTIGATOR_517312], such as a fragment  in your eye, aneurysm clips, ear implants, spi[INVESTIGATOR_517313], or a pacemaker, you will not be allowed into the MRI room and cannot have a MRI. Having a 
MRI may mean some added discomfort to you. In particular, you may be bothered by [CONTACT_517340]. Temporary hearing loss has been reported 
from the loud noise. This is why you will be asked to wear earplugs. At times during the test, you may be asked not to swallow for a while, which can be uncomfortable.  
 
Venipuncture:  The risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising and 
infection. Fainting could occur.  There will be a total of 30 ml’s collected for the 3 blood draws (10 ml’s per 
draw).  
 
TMS: The TMS coil  makes noise, much like a loud pop when it produces its magnetic energy.  You may or 
may not feel your thumb twitch depending on the strength of the TMS pulse, but you might also feel your facial 
muscles twitch slightly just around your eye.  This twitch i s just as brief as the thumb twitch and is a result of 
the TMS directly stimulating the facial nerves and muscles that run directly under your scalp. It is not painful.  
TMS can cause heating or movement of metallic objects in or near the head.  In addition, the inactivation of pacemakers, medication pumps, cochlear prostheses and other implantable hardware may occur.  Magnetic 
media such as credit cards, etc. and watches near the coil may also be damaged.  To minimize this risk the 
researchers will have ask ed you about any metal implants which would exclude you from the study. There is a 
known risk of inducing a seizure during rTMS  
56,57, however, it is not used in grant proposal.  
 
Motor assessments:   Motor assessments may occasionally cause fatigue; however you have the option to 
adjust your pace as needed to complete the test.  
 
Protection to Human Subjects : 
 tDCS:  
1) Strictly follow the inclusion and exclusion criterias 
2) Study part 1 is a tolerabilty study. Adverse events are recorded  carefully  on every visit on every patients, if 
major response occurs, DSMB will be notified immediately.  
 MRI:  
1)  MRI scr eening  form will be done at the time of recruitment, and patient will be excluded from  study if he/she  
has contraindicati on for MRI or can not tolerate the MRI scanner  
2)  Headphone or earplug is provided to the study patient  to minimize the noise from magnetic field . 
 TMS:  
Version 03/02/2017 
19 
 1) strictly follows the published guideline about TMS application. TMS is only applied by [CONTACT_517341].  
2) rTMS will not be used in our grant application which has a risk of seizure.  
3) Conduct  a daily assessment  after each study session to collect more information about side effect  
 
Potential Benefit of the study:  
There will be no other direct benefit to you from participating in this study except the one hour rehabilitation therapy ; however, i t is hoped that the information gained from the study will help in the treatment of future 
stroke patients with conditions like yours, and help the researchers to develop new rehabilitation treatment for 
stroke survivors in the future.  
 Data Safety Monitor  Board and Data safety monitoring plan:  
 
The DSMB will be composed of three of external members  who are not involved with the study design or 
experiments : [CONTACT_517350](Chair of DSMB, MD, board certified neurologist, ex -IRB committee member), 
Christine  Holmsted (DSMB member, DO and board certified Neurologist) and Andrea Boan (DSMB member, 
PhD biostatistician).   
 The DSMB member will meet every 6 months.  If 2 or more major respons es that occurs in the study part  1 at 
specfic current level, the study need to be stopped early. The DSMB will meet earlier than 6 months interval.  
 
The chair will lead the meeting with two members , Specifically they will 
1) protect the safety of the study participants;  
2) review the research protocol, informed consent documen ts, amendments, and plans for data safety and 
monitoring;  
3) evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, recruitment, 
accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of the trial si tes, and other factors that may 
potentially affect study outcome;  
4) review study performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_1268];  
5) report to IRB on the safety and progress of the trial;  
6) ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring  
7) advise the IRB and the study investigators as to whether the protocol should continue as scheduled or 
undergo a modification due to a finding from the monitoring process

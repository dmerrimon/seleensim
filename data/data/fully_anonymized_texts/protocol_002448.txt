3 Background /Rationale  & Purpose  
3.1 Background Information  
Adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM), ages 14 -17, are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_738163] 
(US) .1 Racial and ethnic minority ASMM are particularly affected .2 The disproportionate i ncidence among ASMM is 
largely attributed to engagement in sexual risk behaviors, including condomless anal intercourse (CAI).3,4  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_738128], few HIV prevention interventions target ASMM < 18 years old.5,6 For ASMM, adolescence 
(ages 14 -17) is a developmental period when significant biopsychosocial changes are coupled with negotiation of a 
same -sex attraction.4,7–[ADDRESS_1008619] behavior.9–11,[ADDRESS_1008620] both 
immediate and long -term health benefits.4,15,17,18  
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, 24 October  2019

 The CDC has highlighted the importance of addressing online media influences on HIV risk among adolescents.19 One 
Internet s ource that contributes to ASMMs’ HIV risk is their use of sexually explicit online media (SEOM; i.e., online 
pornography).20–26 With limited access to relevant sexual education in school27–29 or from parents ,24 ASMM use SEOM20–
26,30 and adopt the behaviors they see.23,26  
The amount of male -male specific SEOM portraying CAI has increased substantially in recent years,31,32 raising 
concerns about the encouragement of risky sexual behaviors among consumers.33,34 105 These concerns are supported by 
[CONTACT_738164] -scale studies showing positive associations between exposure to CAI in sexually explicit media and 
engagement in CAI among adult MSM35–39 and one among ASMM.26 Further, ASMM report modeling their sexual 
experiences after what they view in SEOM, including engaging in CAI.23,26  
As SEOM triggers and maintains sexual risk -taking among ASMM,  20–26,30 it is critical for HIV prevention interventions 
to address the influence of this “super p eer.”12,13,[ADDRESS_1008621] positively impacted many health 
behaviors,41 including sexual health behaviors,42–44 and may be an effective means of addressing the influence of SEOM 
on the sexual risk of adolescent ASMM. As such, using information from an online survey of ASMM from across the 
US24,26,45,45 –[ADDRESS_1008622], we developed an online sexual health media literacy 
intervention called the Young Men & Media (YM &M) intervention .  
The procedures involved in this research (i.e., online assessments, online intervention) are considered low -risk. Thus, 
participants will incur minimal risks due to their participation in this study. This study will be conducted in compliance 
with the prot ocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and BMC/BU Medical Campus Human Research Protection 
policies and procedures.  
3.2 Rationale  and Purpose  
Given ASMMs’ increased risk for HIV1 in comb ination with their decreased access to relevant sexual health 
education from traditional sources24,27 –29 and reliance on SEOM for sexual health information,20–26,30 development of 
sexual health interventions for ASMM that address male -male sexual practices and SEOM are critical. To our knowledge, 
YM& M is the first intervention to specifically address SEOM use among ASMM. To ensure that this approach is both 
feasible and acceptable to ASMM we are proposing to pi[INVESTIGATOR_528423].  
[ADDRESS_1008623] the online media literacy intervention for 
feasibility , acceptability , and preliminary efficacy .  
4.2 Study Outcome Measures  
An overview of outcome measure 
timing is provided in Table 1.  
4.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure s 
The primary outcomes  will be 
feasibility and acceptability of the 
intervention.  
Feasibility measures.  To assess study 
feasibility, banner ad click -through 
rate, number of individuals recruited 
per week, and the percentage of 
individuals who were eligible; 
assented; dropped o ut and lost to 
follow -up will be calculated. To assess

 intervention we will calculate intervention metrics (i.e., time spent on each pi[INVESTIGATOR_738129], percentage 
who complete all intervention content).  
Acceptability measures.  To assess acceptability, media literacy intervention participants will be asked to complete 
content ratings on each pi[INVESTIGATOR_738130] a [ADDRESS_1008624] -intervention follow -up.48 Participants will be asked to report on study procedure 
acceptability (e.g., acceptability of recruitment, consent, assessment procedures). Intervention participants will be asked 
to report how informative, interesting, and helpful the intervention was; h ow likely they would be to recommend it to 
friends; and if they have suggestions for how it could be improved. Participants in the control group will be asked which 
website they went to, if any, and to report how informative, interesting, and helpful the w ebsite was; as well as how 
likely they would be to recommend it to friends. The satisfaction survey will include a combination of likert scale and 
open -ended responses.   
4.2.2 Secondary Outco me Measur es 
The secondary outcomes  will measure preliminary efficacy ( i.e., changes in sexual risk behaviors, media literacy skills , 
and sexual health knowledge ). 
Sexual risk. Sexual risk behaviors and antecedents to sexual risk behaviors will be assessed. P articipants will be asked 
about the number of sex partners, gender o f partners, HIV -status of partners, romantic/primary partner status, sexual 
activities and condom use, and substance use with sex in the prior 3 months. Participants will be asked to report only on 
voluntary sexual behavior (i.e., not forced). To optimize the accuracy of these reports, counts of behaviors will be asked 
in an open response format.49–[ADDRESS_1008625] sex and for sexual 
communication (e.g., communication about HIV/STI status, condom use)44,53 as well as condom attitudes.54  
Media literacy skills  will be assessed using questions adapted from the two previous sexual health media literacy 
interventions, including awareness of SEOM myths, awareness of SEOM influence, and SEOM skepticism.42–44  
Sexual health knowledge  will be determined by [CONTACT_738165]55 and STI56 transmission knowledge; HIV/STI prevention 
method knowledge;57 and the levels of HIV/STI transmission risk (low, medium, high) assoc iated with sexual behaviors 
(e.g., oral sex, anal sex).53 
5 Study Design  
The study design is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] ( RCT) with two conditions (i.e., YM&M intervention  vs. control) 
and three online assessments (i.e., baseline, post -intervention, 3 month follow -up). Prior to randomization all 
participants (N = 150)  will complete a baseline assessment.  Participants will  then  be randomly assigned (1:1 
randomization) to the intervention or to the control group . The randomization schedule will be generated using a 
permuted block randomization procedure with small, random -sized blocks.  Following receipt of the intervention or 
contro l, participants will be asked to complete a post -intervention assessment and a 3 -month follow -up. Data will 
include self -report and usage data. See Appendix 1 for a schematic of the study design  and participant flow  and 
Appendix 2 for a schedule of events .  
6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
6.1 Risks  
The procedures involved in this research  (i.e., online assessments, online intervention) are considered low -risk. Thus, 
participants will incur minimal risks due to their participation in this study. Potential untoward  events that may occur 
include:  
 Emotional discomfort.  
 Breach of confidentiality.  
The level of risk for each of these events is minimal.   
Emotional discomfort . Some of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_738131] (e .g., SEOM use, sexual behaviors ) 
may cause discomfort or anxiety. There is also the potential for anxiety related to acknowledging behavior with potential 
legal implications (alcohol/drug use, condomless sex which placed someone at risk of contracting an infectious disease). 
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, [ADDRESS_1008626] of similar questions among 
LGBT adolescents found that 90% of the participants reported feeling “very comfortable” or “comfortable” with the 
questions they were asked and only 3% re ported feeling “very uncomfortable,” which is similar to what has been found 
in other research assessing reactions to questions about sexuality and substance use.58,[ADDRESS_1008627] measures that limit data access to authorized personnel. Online data will be collected and 
managed using the REDCap60 electronic data capture tools managed by [CONTACT_738166] . REDCap is 
a secure, web -based application designed by [CONTACT_738167] k engineering and approved by [CONTACT_738168]. REDCap se rvers are 
backed up daily and monitored for hardware failures. Self -report and usage data will be collected from respondents, and 
likewise retrieved by [CONTACT_978], over an SSL encrypted connection.  
The intervention website is designed and implemented by [CONTACT_738169], Inc., a technology provider with extensive 
experience creating secure, encrypted websites for research projects.   All data  (e.g., email addresses,  content ratings, 
time spent on intervention  content , number of log -ins) will be housed, monitored, and do wnloaded by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_738132]. The intervention website data is protected with SSL in transit via TLS 1.2 using 
256 bit RSA encryption.  Certain fields within the intervention database (including participant and admin istration user's 
emails and passwords) are encrypted at rest using hashed and salted SHA256 bit encryption. Participant data can only be 
accessed by [CONTACT_738170] a username [CONTACT_738192].   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_738133] a logically separated data table and dedicated login page that allows PI [INVESTIGATOR_738134] a real -time view of 
aggregate data regarding time spent on intervention pages and number of log -ins. The log -in page will not indicate the 
content, purpose,  or target population.   Website servers are housed in a highly secure environment, backed up daily 
(nightly backup of database and file system retained for at least 7 days), and monitored for hardware failures (99.9% 
uptime).  
Participants will be encourag ed to go to a private location at the beginning of the survey, assessments, and when 
they log into the intervention. To mitigate the chance of another person seeing that the participant is in this study, a 
time limit will be set on the intervention such that if no movements have occurred on the participant’s screen within 20 
minutes the screen will be redirected to  the lo g-in page. Lastly, all correspondence with participants will be devoid of 
any indication of the content, purpose, or target population o f the study and participants will be encouraged to delete 
correspondence (e.g., emails) as soon as the participant decides they no longer need the contained information.  
In addition, because of the potentially sensitive nature of the data that are being co llected, we have received  a 
Certificate of Confidentiality to ensure that participants’ data cannot be subpoenaed with a court order. No individual 
identities will be used in any reports or publications.  
Other considerations: Mental health and substance u se. As mental health and substance use issues are prevalent 
among ASMM , we will provide all participants with links and phone numbers for LGBT -specific services (e.g., the 
National Alliance on Mental Health LGBTQ website, PRIDE Institute Substance Use Trea tment website, GLBT National 
Youth Talkline phone number, Trevor Helpline Crisis Intervention for LGBTQ Youth phone number). Although none of 
the proposed measures specifically ask about reportable issues, the satisfaction survey for the intervention will include 
open -ended responses. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_738135] -ended responses daily in the unlikely event that a participant 
reports any indication of current, ongoing abuse or neglect of children or elders and/or of imminent danger to self or a 
specified ind ividual as these indications will have to be considered for clinical intervention and mandated reporting to 
the appropriate authorities. Daily checks will be documented via PI [INVESTIGATOR_738136] a study calendar.  
Other considerations: Website developer training.  To ensure the website developer is informed of research 
ethics and participant confidentiality they have completed on -line CITI Human Subjects Protection training and signed an 
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, 24 October  2019  
 
7 
 agreement to keep all participant information confi dential . The developer has a background in designing/programming 
websites for research purposes, thus have completed these trainings and signed research confidentiality agreements 
before.  
6.[ADDRESS_1008628] anticipated benefit is from participating in the YM&M  interventi on. We expect that individuals who 
complete the YM&M  intervention will gain insight into their sexual health and SEOM consumption that could lead to 
sustained sexual behavior and attitude change.  
By [CONTACT_173150], participants will also be nefit from knowing they may ultimately be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_738137]. Possible risks are likely to be outweighed by [CONTACT_738171] -being o f ASM M. The risks of participating in 
the research will be minimized through our extensive efforts to maintain confidentiality and to reduce discomfort or 
distress.  
6.[ADDRESS_1008629] on their health behaviors, was a helpful experience; 
based on previous research, it is likely that the act of filling out detailed health behavior assessments can result in 
positive health behavior changes.   
[ADDRESS_1008630] Selection  
A convenience sample of ASMM  (N = 150) from across the US will be recruited online  through social media.  
7.[ADDRESS_1008631] meet all of the following criteria:  
 Be age 14 to 17.  
 Report having been assigned male sex at birth and self -identify as male  (i.e., be cisgender male) . 
 Self-identify as gay/bisexual, report being sexually attracted to males, or report having voluntary sexual contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a male partner in the  past year.  
 Have intentionally accessed SEOM in their lifetime.  
 Have a valid personal email address.  
 Be a US resident.  
 Be new to the study.  
 All inclusion criteria will be determined via self -report except for having a valid email address. Having a valid email 
address will be determined by [CONTACT_738172] a unique link  sent to their personal email address to access 
the assessments .  
7.[ADDRESS_1008632] Exclusion Criteria  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
 Are unwilling or unable to provide informed assent , which would preclude meaningful participation in the 
research.  
 Are unable to understand  and read  English. Participants who are unable to understand and read English will not 
be included because they would not be able to complete the assessments nor would they benefit from the 
intervention.  
 Do not have the appropriate dev ice and necessary software to allow them to experience all the intervention 
content. Because (a) 94% of sexual minority adolescents reporting at least daily Internet use61 and (b) 
participants will be recruited from websites tha t are likely to have similar device and software requirements, this 
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, 24 October  2019

 criterion should not limit our sample. A recent online sexual health education pi[INVESTIGATOR_738138] (ages 16 -20) had a similar requirement and found that only 4% o f the 1,734 potential participants 
who completed their eligibility screener were ineligible due to the technology requirements.53  
8 Study Intervention  
Four m ain topi[INVESTIGATOR_738139]24,26,45,45 –[ADDRESS_1008633]  as 
important foci for the intervention: (1) male anatomy, including information about how anal sex can be pleasurable and 
about anal health; (2) HIV/STI prevention information (e.g., transmission risks, accessing testing, condom use); (3) 
general sexual h ealth information (e.g., types of male -male sex, consent, dating safety, partner communication); and (4) 
SEOM  literacy (e.g., differences between porn and reality, what’s behind the scenes on a pornography set, normalization 
of porn use among male youth). Youth felt that intervention content should be interactive (e.g., games, videos, 
animations) and the website should have an interface that would be familiar to ASMM (e.g., similar to Netflix). Youth 
preferred a website with a responsive design (i.e., will work on a mobile device, tablet, or computer) as opposed to a 
downloadable phone application. Please see Appendix 3 for screen shots from the intervention website and a more 
detailed description of the content.  
9 Study Procedures  
Overview  
 Recruitment, screen ing, and assent (described in more detail below):  Participants will be recruited via online 
advertisements. Once they click on an advertisement they will be presented with information about the study and a 
brief online screener  to establish eligibility. If they are eligible they will be presented with assent materials and 
complete capacity to assent questions. If they agree to participate they will then be emailed a unique link to the 
baseline assessment.   
 Baseline assessment:  Participants will be sent an email with a link to a self -report online survey ( N = 150; Approx. 
25-35 minutes); compensation for time ($[ADDRESS_1008634] via email ). If participants do not complete the 
baseline assessment within three days of assentin g, we will sen d them up to 3 reminder emails  in a 10 -day period.  
 Randomization:  immediately following the final question in the baseline assessment, REDCap60 will be programmed 
to randomly assign participants (1:1 randomization) to the YM&M  intervention or to a control group. The 
randomization schedule will be generated using a permuted block randomization pro cedure with small, random -
sized blocks.  
o Participants randomized to the YM&M  (n = 75) intervention will be sent an email with username (their email) 
and a temporary password  and asked to complete all of the website content within three weeks of receiving 
the email.  Participants will be asked at first log -in to set up their own password.  If a participant has not logged 
into the website within one week of receiving the original email, they will be sent up to 3 reminder emails in a 
10-day period.  
o Participants  in the control condition ( n = 75) will be sent an email with links to various HIV prevention websites 
(e.g., the CDC HIV Prevention site, the National HIV and STD Testing Resource site) and encouraged to visit at 
least one site in the next three weeks.  
 YM&M  intervention exposure:  Intervention content, language, and length was informed by a youth advisory board 
and a previously completed online survey.24,26,45,45 –47 Although the intervention is designed to be completed in one 
sitting (i.e., <  90 minutes in length), participants will be given the option of logging out and logging in again to 
continue where they left off, should they need to. Intervention content is described in more detail above and in 
Appendix 3. 
 Post -intervention assessment:  Three weeks after the baseline survey par ticipants will be sent an email  to complete 
a second online survey ( N = 150; Approx. 15 -25 minutes); compensation for time ($[ADDRESS_1008635] via email ). 
If participants do not complete the post -intervention assessment within three days of receiving the email, we will 
send them up to 3 reminder emails in a 10 -day period.  
 Follow -up assessment:  Fifteen weeks after the baseline survey participants will be sent an email to complete a final 
online survey ( N = 150; Approx. 20 -30 minutes); compensation for time ($[ADDRESS_1008636] via email ). If 
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, 24 October  2019  
 
9 
 participants do not complete the follow -up assessment within three days of receiving the email, we will send them 
up to 3 reminder emails in a 10 -day period.  
 All partici pants:  Participants will be offered a bonus if they complete all assessments ($[ADDRESS_1008637] via 
email ). All participants will receive a list of youth -oriented resources at the end of the survey or if they are inelegible 
(Appendix 4).  
Detailed description of recruitment, screening, assent, and retention procedures.  
Recruitment Processes.  Participants will be recruited using advertisements and posts on social networking websites 
(e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). Potential participa nts recruited via advertisements will be directed to the 
screening website which will assent them for screening and then ask potential participants to continue on for eligibility 
questions.  
Screening Procedure s. Study eligibility will be determined via inclusion criteria questions (nested among foil 
questions so that these criteria are not obvious) and cross verified using additional questions throughout the survey. 
Eligibility screening will occur on the screening website, which will be hosted and creat ed using REDCap,[ADDRESS_1008638]: date  of birth, age, race/ethnicity, and geographic location.62,63 
Online advertisements and the eligibility screener will not indicate the necessary requirements for eligi bility in order to 
minimize the potential for faking eligibility.64 To ensure ethnic and racial diversity, eligibility criteria and advertisements 
will be adjusted to oversample racial/ethnic minority participants, as needed.65 Screening data will be retained for 
eligible and ineligible individuals as described in the assent for screening .     
Assent Procedures.  In line with ethical recommendations66–[ADDRESS_1008639] practice5,6,15,24,26,45,53,59,71 –75 for sexual 
health research with LGBT adolescents, a waiver of  parental consent is being requested to decrease risk to participants 
and ensure validity of the results. Parental consent would decrease participation rates because some youth will fear that 
they may be “outed” (i.e., involuntary disclosure of their sexua l minority status) as a result of participation. Specifically, 
disclosure of sexual preferences may place some participating youth at risk for parental disapproval leading, in some 
instances, to harassment, abuse, or even expulsion from the home.45,58,76 –79 Recent research by [CONTACT_738173], HIV stigma, silence about 
homosexuality, and forced housing displacement due to t heir sexual orientation, which, in turn, leads to increased risk 
for HIV seroconversion. This is especially true for racial/ethnic minority ASMM .80 It is crucial that the proposed research 
reach these high -risk ASMM .   
The nature and scope of the proposed research does not pose more than “minimal risk” to participants (45 CFR Part 
46.102) (i.e., “ that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in 
and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during t he performance of routine physical or 
psychological examinations or tests ”). Study measures and exposure to sexual health topi[INVESTIGATOR_738140], as are waivers of parental permission.5,6,15,24,26,45,53,59,71 –[ADDRESS_1008640] 
likely not be a participant’s first exposure to formal sexual health education and instead will be an ASMM -specific 
supplement to the sexual health education they have alr eady received.  Additionally, only participants who self -report 
have voluntarily been exposed to SEOM will be included. Participants will not be exposed to SEOM as a part of this 
study. Further, all [ADDRESS_1008641] minors  14 years old or older to consent to STI 
services without parental permission.82 Similarly, youths of any age can buy condoms without parental consent.   
To com pensate for waiver of parental consent , participants will receive a formal assessment of capacity to assent 
(described below) to ensure their understanding of study goals, procedures, and risks from disclosure of sensitive 
information. Further assent mater ial will include a table clearly outlining the pros and cons of participation. Consistent 
with national policy recommendations from the Society for Adolescent Medicine and the American Psychological 
Association,83,[ADDRESS_1008642] a number of poss ible negative effects, 
including: (1) reducing the validity of the findings by [CONTACT_738174]/guardians; (2) increasing risk to youth whose parents would have a negative  
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, [ADDRESS_1008643] their child has a minority sexual 
preference; and (3) adding little in the way of actual subject protection, given the minimal risk of study 
participation.45,58,76 –79 The procedures for the waiver of parental consent are consistent with the guidelines provided by 
[CONTACT_9092] (45 CFR Part 46, Subpart D).  
There will be two assent procedures as a part o f the study: (1) assent for screening and (2) assent for the full study. 
Both of those assent procedures will occur online and affirmation of desire to take part in either the screening or full 
study  will be shown by [CONTACT_738175].  
When a potential participant clicks on a study advertisement they will be portalled to the assent for screening 
materials. Those materials will describe screening procedures, confidentiality, and subject rights. At the end, potential 
participants will be asked to indicate whether they would like to move on to eligibility questions or not, which is the 
documentation of their decision to proceed with the screening.   
Assent procedures  for the full study  will describe th e study, its risk and benefits, confidentiality, no deception, and 
how to contact [CONTACT_473]. The assent process will highlight that potential participants have the option of refusing 
to participate in the study, withdrawing their participation at a ny time, and/or refusing to answer any questions that 
they feel uncomfortable responding to. Further, potential participants will be informed that their decision to participate 
or not participate in the study will not affect their relationship with any web sites, LGBT youth -oriented CBOs, clinics, or 
[LOCATION_011] University . Capacity to assent will be further confirmed by [CONTACT_738176]’ ability to: (1) name [CONTACT_112539], (2) explain how they will 
be assigned to their group, (3) ex plain what they would do if they experienced distress during the study, and (4) identify 
potential risks for participating in the study.85,86 Participants who are unable to accurately answer the multiple choice 
questions will be redirected to the relevant portions of the assent materials and asked the questions again. Capacity to 
assent questions and answers will be automatically re -ordered each tim e they are presented to reduce the chance of 
participants blindly choosing answers until they get the right ones. Participants will be given three chances to correctly 
answer capacity to assent materials. If after three chances they continue to answer ques tions incorrectly they will be 
considered ineligible. Potential participants will be given the option of contact[CONTACT_20238] (via e -mail, telephone 
number, and mailing address) to ask questions before enrolling. After potential participants have been de termine to 
have capacity to assent they will be asked whether they would like to participate in the study or not, which is the 
documentation of their decision to enroll in the study.  Once eligible participants have assented they will be sent an 
email conta ining a unique link to the baseline survey. To proceed to the main body of the survey, eligible participants 
will be required to click on that link. Participants will be reminded about assent parameters at the start of each follow -
up assessment.  
Retention Plan.  Retention strategies include participant reminders, repeated contact, and compensation.  Eligible 
participants who provide assent will be asked to provide an email address  and phone number(s) for 
recontact[CONTACT_30697]/tracking. REDCap will maintain an electron ic system that will notify participants via email when they are 
due for an assessment and remind them up to [ADDRESS_1008644] ing study staff. Participants who wish to 
drop out of the study will be queried as to their reasons and attempts will be made to address their concerns. 
Participants will be compensated at the completion of the baseline survey ($15) and after each of the f ollow -up surveys 
($[ADDRESS_1008645] -intervention, $35 for follow -up). Participants will be offered a bonus for the completion of all surveys 
($20). Participants will be compensated via electronic gift cards.  
See the Appendix  2 for the schedule of events.  
10 Assessment of Safety  and Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
10.1 Definitions  
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
Adverse Event s (AEs) include any abnormal or harmful behaviors, increasing risk behaviors (e.g., sexual risk behaviors), 
suicidal behaviors, breach in the protection of participant data or breach of confidentiality whether or not consider 
related to the subjects participation in the research.   
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, 24 October  2019  
 
11 
 Serious Adver se Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
(5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
(6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition (examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse).  
Life-threatening  means that the event place s the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the following criteria:  
 is unexpected ; AND  
 is related or possibly 
related  to participation  
in the research; AND  
 suggests that the 
research places subjects 
or others at a greater risk  
of harm (including 
physical, psychological, 
economic, or social 
harm) than was 
previously known or 
recognized.  
Possibly related  means there is a reasonable possib ility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_738177], severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with either:  
 the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the research that are 
described in (a) the protocol –related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document, and (b) other relevant sources 
of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
 the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing 
the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing r isk factor profile for the adverse event.  
10.2 Safety Review  
Both the risks listed in Section 4.1 and unknown risks will be monitored as follows:   
Study safety and progress will be monitored according to the schedule outlined in Table 2 (and more frequently, if 
needed).  The PI ([CONTACT_92790]),  will closely supervise all study activities on a day -to-day basis. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_738141], accrual and retention, and data integrity daily in order to take the necessary measures 
in a timely fashion. Participants will be ins tructed to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_738142]. All AEs will be documented daily by [CONTACT_978]. AEs will be labeled 
according to severity, as ‘mild’ if the event does not ha ve a major impact on the participant, ‘moderate’ if it causes the 
participant some minor inconvenience and ‘severe’ if it causes a substantial disruption to the participant’s well -being. All 
AEs and SAEs will be labeled as definitely, probably, possibly or  unrelated to the study intervention.   Table 2. Study Safety and Progress Monitoring

 10.3 Reporting Plans  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51398]/BU Medical Campus will report Unanticipated Problems, safety monitors’ reports, and 
Adverse Events to the BMC/BU Medical Center IRB in accordance with IRB policies:  
 Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus will be reported to the IRB within 7 days of the 
investigator learning of the event.  
 Reports from safety monitors with recommended changes will be reported to the IRB within 7 days of the 
investigator  receiving the report.  
 Adverse Events (including Serious Adverse Events) will be reported in summary at the time of continuing review, 
along with a statement that the pattern of adverse events, in total, does not suggest that the research places 
subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known.  
 Reports from safety monitors with no recommended changes will be reported to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_738143].  She will additionally notify the NIH promptly  of any unanticipated problems or any actions 
taken by [CONTACT_738178] t he ongoing protocol which 
would only occur with IRB approval.  Such changes would include but are not limited to: amendments to the protocol, 
temporary suspension of participant accrual, or of the protocol, any changes in informed consent or IRB approval s tatus, 
termination of participant accrual or of the protocol, or other problems or issues that could affect the human subjects in 
the study.  
10.[ADDRESS_1008646] meetings will be 
held in private conference rooms.  
Data will be obtained from electronic assessments  completed by [CONTACT_738179]. Personally identifiable information (PII) , assessment  responses , and usage data will be kept in separate 
datasets. They will be linked only with a randomly generated ID variable that is included in all data . Although the 
datasets will be housed on the same server  (e.g., REDCap for assessment and self -report data, the intervention website 
for usage data and content review data) , they will otherwise be completely separate.  The PII dataset will be deleted 
upon completion of data collection  and cleaning . AE reports and annual summaries will not include subject -identifiable 
material. Multiple levels of password protection will be utilized and access will be denied to non -study personnel. No 
identifiable informatio n will be stored on laptops or transportable devices in this study. Further, REDCap and website 
servers will be physically stored in high security areas and study desktops will be located within a secured building.  
 If it is discovered that despi[INVESTIGATOR_738144] y precautions electronic data has been hacked, or if someone has illegally 
gained access to any data, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_738145]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_738146]  (e.g., BU, the IRB, NIH project officer, and, if appropriate, 
the police department). The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_738147], if any, is 
appropriate. In the unlikely event that hacking occurs, an attempt will be made  to contact [CONTACT_738180]. Legal recourse will also be sought to 
Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, [ADDRESS_1008647] received a Certificate of Confidentiality  for 
this study to ensure that participants’ data cannot be subpoenaed with a court order . 
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all documents and records 
required to be  maintained by [CONTACT_093]. The study will permit access to such records.  
11.2 Source Documents  
There are two sources of data: (a) 
participant self -report and (b) usage data:  
 Self-report data:  will be collected via 
content ratings for each pi[INVESTIGATOR_738148]. Assessments  for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_738149] b aseline, 
post -intervention (3 week after 
baseline), and follow -up (15 weeks 
after baseline). Assessment data will be 
collected using a secure online survey 
software system, namely, REDCap.60 
Content ratings will be collected 
through the intervention website.  
 Usage data:  will include banner ad 
click -through rate, time spent on 
intervention content, and number of 
intervention website log -ins. Banner ad 
click -through rate will be acquired from 
the advertising websites. Time spent 
on each pi[INVESTIGATOR_738150]-ins will be collected via the 
intervention website.  
Only authorized study personnel will have 
access to the data.  
Self-report measures. An overview of the

 will be assessed using the PHQ -4. Sexual abuse histor y will be assessed using the sexual abuse subscale of the Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Sexual education exposure.  Sources of sexual education (e.g., parents, school, online) and 
coverage male -male sexual health -related topi[INVESTIGATOR_738151].15  
Feasibility measures.  To assess study feasibility, banner ad click -throug h rate, number of individuals recruited per week, 
and the percentage of individuals who were eligible; assented; dropped out and lost to follow -up will be calculated. To 
assess the feasibility of the media literacy intervention we will calculate interventi on metrics (i.e., time spent on each 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_738129], percentage who complete all intervention content).  
Acceptability measures.  To assess acceptability, media literacy intervention participants will be asked to complete 
content ratings on e ach pi[INVESTIGATOR_738130] a [ADDRESS_1008649] -intervention follow -up.48 Participants will be asked to report on study 
procedure acceptability (e.g., acceptability of recruitment, consent, assessment procedures). Intervention participants 
will be asked to report how informative, interesting, and helpful the intervention was; h ow likely they would be to 
recommend it to friends; and if they have suggestions for how it could be improved. Participants in the control group 
will be asked which website they went to, if any, and to report how informative, interesting, and helpful the w ebsite 
was; as well as how likely they would be to recommend it to friends. The satisfaction survey will include a combination 
of Likert  scale and open -ended responses.   
Exposure measure and mediators.  Sexually explicit online media (SEOM) use will be est ablished through a measure 
developed in a previous study of SEOM use among adult MSM37 and adapted for use with ASMM.26 This measure cover 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_20733]: frequency and timing of usage; prevalence of viewing portrayed behaviors in SEOM; preferences for 
condoms use in SEOM; arousal during use; identification with SEOM actors; perceived norms of SEOM behaviors; 
expectancies about portrayed behaviors; perceived consequences of portrayed behaviors; and beliefs about the 
influence of SEOM on behaviors within the participant and  on other MSM (i.e., perceived norms).   
Preliminary Efficacy measures.  To conduct exploratory assessments of intervention efficacy, we will measure three 
primary outcomes: sexual risk, media literacy, and sexual health knowledge. Sexual risk. Sexual risk behaviors and 
antecedents to sexual risk behaviors will be assessed. P articipants will be asked aggregate information about the 
number of sex partners, gender of partners, HIV -status of partners, romantic/primary partner status, sexual ac tivities 
and condom use, and substance use with sex in the prior 3 months. Participants will be asked to report only on voluntary 
sexual behavior (i.e., not forced). To optimize the accuracy of these reports, counts of behaviors will be asked in an open 
response format.49–[ADDRESS_1008650] sex and for sexual communication 
(e.g., communication about HIV/STI status, condom use)44,53 as well as condom attitudes.54 Media literacy skills will be 
assessed using questions adapted from the two previous sexual health media literacy interventions, including awareness 
of SEOM myths, awareness of SEOM influence, and SEOM skepticism.42–44 Sexual health knowledge  will be determined 
by [CONTACT_738181]55 and STI56 transmission knowledge; HIV/STI p revention method knowledge;57 and the levels of HIV/STI 
transmission risk (low, medium, high) associated with sexual behaviors (e.g., oral sex, anal sex).53

12 Statistical Plan 
12.1 Study Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that the YM&M intervention will be feasible and acceptable. We further hypothesize that sexual risk 
behaviors will decrease and media literacy skills and sexual health knowledge will increase by [CONTACT_738182] -intervention and [ADDRESS_1008652] size of 0.21 - 0.38 on antecedents to sexual risk 
behaviors.42–44 For this exploratory study, we conservatively anticipate a Cohen’s d = 0.20 between 2 groups. With the 
current sample size ( N = 150) and a two-sided α = 0.05, we have 52% power to determine an effect size 0.20. With a 
two-sided α = 0.05 and 80% power (β = 0.20)  we would require retention of a total sample size of 192. Considering the 
scope of the award, recruitment and retention of this sampl e size is not feasible. T he proposed sample size is adequate 
to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and gauge whether the intervention effects are encouraging.  
12.[ADDRESS_1008653], we will calculate the percentage of individuals who were: 
eligible; assented; were randomized; and completed the post -interventi on and [ADDRESS_1008654] open -ended responses. As a 
secondary goal and to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of the online media literacy intervention, we will exami ne 
the within - and between -group differences at each follow -up for all three efficacy measures (i.e., sexual risk, media 
literacy, sexual health knowledge) using a series of longitudinal mixed effects models, controlling for baseline values, as 
well as any  group differences.  
13 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects

f. HIV/STI Jeopardy  
i. Descript ion: This game is based on traditional jeopardy (5 columns with 5 
questions in each column). The five columns are: (1) HIV 101, (2) HIV Testing, (3) 
STI 101, (4) STI Testing & Symptoms, and (5) Final Review. Each question is given 
a dollar value and there is a “Daily Double” after all questions have been 
answered. The questions cover the basics of HIV/STI transmission, how to 
prevent HIV/STIs, and how to access services. Example questions include: “What 
does HIV stand for?” “What are ways you can protect yo urself from getting HIV 
and other sexually transmitted infections?”

penetration) and are in accord with what youth would be able to see in 
standard magazine and TV advertisements.

Young Me n and Media Study   Version 1.1, 24 October  2019

 they are given a desc ription of the item and why it is there. The goal of this 
game is to help participants to understand that what they see on the screen 
when they are viewing pornography is not representative of what is actually 
happening on the set and to illustrate the rol es and motives of the people who 
are involved in making the porn.

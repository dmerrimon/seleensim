2 Protocol Summary  
Title:  Glaucoma Drop Aid Study  
Population:  Male and Female patients of [LOCATION_011] University Eye Associates , 18 
or older , having  been receiving the same topi[INVESTIGATOR_51396] a minimum of two months  
Intervention:  Control:  
 No Glaucoma Drop Aid Device  
Drop Aid  Devices : 
 Simply Touch Eye Drop Applicator  
 Fabrication Autodrop Eye Drop Guide  
 Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqu eeze  
Objectives : To determine the efficacy of drop aid devices for improving 
medication compliance, visual function, and decreasing medication 
waste for patients at BMC  
Design /Methodology : Arm A: No intervention - Control  
Arm B: Active Comparator - Eye Dr op Aids  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned into one of the study arms . If 
placed into Arm A, no drop aid device will be assigned.  If placed 
into Arm B, participants will be assigned one of the three drop aid 
devices ( Simply Touch Eye Drop Applicator,  Fabrication Autodrop 
Eye Drop Guide,  or the Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze).

population at BMC.  
 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and 
BMC/BU Medical Campus Human Research Protection policies and procedures.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_54288] glaucoma patients are on 2  to 3 
different medicati on drops and Medicare Part D sponsors permit refills at only 70% of predicated days of 
use, accounting for about half of glaucoma patient population.1 Self-reported studies also showed that 
approximately 25% of patients reported problems with early exhaust ion of eye drop bottles.[ADDRESS_54289] them at an increased risk of infection and loss of vision, while still 
requiring postoperative management with ophthalmic drops, in addition to being closely monitored by 
[CONTACT_51402].1  
 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/[ADDRESS_54290] amount of drops with each use , there are many drop 
aid assistive devices available for purchase on the market; however, these drop aids are not routinely 
offer ed to our patients because of their unproven cost benefit ratio, and the poorly studied efficacy of the 
devices.[ADDRESS_54291] of the drop aid devices would more than 
pay themselves through the improvement in medication compliance and visual function of our patients. 
The “Glaucoma Drop Aid Study” aims to determine if using drop aids dur ing the administration of eye 
drop medication leads to better results for patients with glaucoma at [LOCATION_011] Medical Center. The 
implications of this study may show an improved delivery system of ophthalmic medications thus 
improving medication compliance, v isual function, and even decreasing medication waste.  
 
[ADDRESS_54292]’s glaucoma progression at the 
end of the study. On the day of enrollment, the subject’s IOP and visual acuity will be measured as part of 
their standard of care exam. This information is recorded as the baseline exam, and will be compared to 
measu re the patient’s glaucoma progression at the end of the study. Subjects will be  required to record the 
date on which they beg an each of their glaucoma eye drop bottles, and the date each bottle was finished  in 
a study diary provided by [CONTACT_5051]. Subject’s satisfaction will be measured through a brief 
satisfaction survey approximately [ADDRESS_54293] reflects their response.

 Primary Outcome Measure s 
 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 7 of 31 The objective of this study is to compare efficiency of various drop aids for glaucoma medications 
objectively via changes i n intraocular pressure.  
 
 Secondary Outcome Measur es 
 
The following secondary outcomes will also be measured:  
1. Number of times a patient missed their eye when instilling eye drops  
2. Patient satisfaction responses with treatment arms  
3. Intention to use a drop ai d long term  
 
5 Study Design  
 
This interventional clinical trial is a prospective, single center, randomized controlled study. Patients 
being treated for their glaucoma at BMC's Yawkey Eye Clinic will be selected.  Patients will be randomly 
placed, without man ipulations by [CONTACT_51403], on one of 
the drop aid devices (including Fabrication Autodrop Eye Drop Guide, Simply Touch Eye Drop 
Applicator, Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze), in addition to a no drop aid co ntrol, for a total of [ADDRESS_54294] an equal chance of being randomized to one of the following study arms:  
 Arm A: No intervention – Control  
 Arm B: Active Comparator - Eye Drop Aids  Including:  
o Simply Touch Eye Drop Applicator  
o Fabrication Autodrop  Eye Drop Guide  
o Owen Mumford OP [ADDRESS_54295] of care clinic visits and 
completion of study diary and satisfaction sur vey by [CONTACT_51404], if 
needed.  
 
See the Appendix  section 15.1  for a schematic of the study design  and section 15.3 for drop aid labels and 
instructions .  
 
6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
6.1 Risks  
 
Risks and possible discomforts involved with study participation are associated with eye dropper use and 
the possibility of a breach of confidentiality. The use of the assigned drop aid does not pose any 
additional risk to subjects from only using an eye drop bottle for administration. Both methods of eye 
drop administration pose the same risk of corneal abrasion or infection from poking the eye with the 
device/bottle, or using a dirty device/bottle. Subjects will be advised by [CONTACT_51405].  
 
There is the unlikely possibility of breach of confidentiality. Confidentiality will be protected as stated in 
Section 11.1 of this protocol.  
6.2 Unknown Risks  
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/[ADDRESS_54296] allows for potential improvement  in patient s’ medication compliance. These drop aids are 
designed to help deliver only the necessary amount of medication and target the eye to allow for easier  
delivery of medications.  The drop aids involved in this study are targeted toward improving patient 
experience  when using glaucoma medications. This may reduce patient frustration and increase adherence 
to medication allowing for better  glaucoma  treatment outcomes . The risks of this study include a minimal 
risk of loss of confidentially. The risk is minimal in comparison to the potential benefits of: improved 
medication compliance, monetary benefits of decreased number of refills, increased patie nt satisfaction  
with eye drop medications, and community benefit of understanding the effectiveness of drop aids.

10 Assessment of Safety  and Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
 
10.1 Definitions  
 
The following definitions will be used in the assessment of safety:  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related t o 
the subject’s participation in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any adverse event that  
(1) results in death;  
(2) is life -threatening;  
(3) results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
(4) results in a persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity;  
(5) results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
(6) based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject's health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this  definition 
(examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or dru g abuse).  
 
Life-threatening  means that the event places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred.  
 
Unanticipated Problem  is defined as an event, experience or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
 is unexpec ted; AND  
 is related or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk  of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recogniz ed.  
 
Possibly related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_51408], severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent wit h either:  
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 12 of 31  the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, an d the current IRB -approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; or  
 the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
exper iencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse 
event.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_54304]. Desai  will review 
all AEs/SAEs within 2 weeks and all UPs within 5 days. After this review, any recommended changes 
will be  made to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5773] -investigators in addition to the BUMC IRB as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1600].

10.3 Reporting Plans  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_51398]/BU Medical C ampus will report Unanticipated Problems, safety 
monitors’ reports, and Adverse Events to the BMC/BU Medical Center IRB in accordance with IRB 
policies:  
 Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus involving a fatal or life -
threatening event w ill be reported to the IRB within 2 days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 Unanticipated Problems occurring at BMC/BU Medical Campus not involving a fatal or life -
threatening event will be reported to the IRB within 7 days of the investigator lear ning of the event.  
 Reports from safety monitors with recommended changes will be reported to the IRB within 7 days 
of the investigator receiving the report.  
 Adverse Events (including Serious Adverse Events) will be reported in summary at the time of 
conti nuing review, along with a statement that the pattern of adverse events, in total, does not 
suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously 
known.  
 Reports from safety monitors with no recommended changes wi ll be reported to the IRB at the time 
of continuing review.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_54305] will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons but are not limited to:  
 Change to eye drop regimen as determined by [CONTACT_51409] 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 13 of 31  Failure to com ply with drop aid instructions  
 SAE or UP resulting from the administered study device

12 Statistical Plan 
 
12.1 Study Hypotheses  
 
12.1.1. Primary Objective: Intraocular Pressure  
 
Formal hypothesis: Drop aids will be cost -effective in delivery of ophthalmic medications by [CONTACT_51414] .  
 
Testable h ypothesis: Patient baseline IOP measures will  be a statistically significantly  improve ment  in 
accord ance to the usage of a drop aid device.   
 
Null h ypothesis: The patient s, who are assigned to a drop aid device baseline IOP measures will not have 
a statistically  significant change with the usage of a drop aid device when compared to patients not 
assigne d to a drop aid device.  
 
Alternate hypothesis: Patients not assigned to a drop aid device will result in larger significant change 
when compared to patients who are assigned to a drop aid device.  
    H0: µ0  <  µd – δ 
    HA: µ0  ≥  µ d – δ 
 
Where µ0, is the true mean IOP change from baseline to the six week visit without the drop aid device, µ d 
is the true mean IOP change from baseline to the six week visit with the drop aid device.  
 
12.1.2. Secondary Objective: Drop s Missed  
 
Formal hypothesis:  Drop aids will be effective in delivering the proper amount of drops , thereby  [CONTACT_51415].  
 
Testable hypothesis: Differences in drops missed with drop aid device compared to without  drop aid 
device will show efficacy in drop aid device.  
 
Null hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop aid device will not result in less drops missed when compared 
to patients who are not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/2017  
 
Page 15 of 31 Alternate hypothesis: Patients assigned  to a drop aid device will result in minimal missed drops when 
compared to patients who are not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
12.1.3. Secondary Objective: Patient Satisfaction  
 
Formal hypothesis:  Drop aid devices will prove greater patient satisfaction than administrations without a 
drop aid device.  
 
Testable hypothesis: Mean patient satisfaction to those assigned to a drop aid device compared to mean 
patient satisfaction scores to those not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
Null hypothesis: Patients ass igned to a drop aid device will not show greater patient satisfaction than 
patients not assigned to a drop aid device.  
 
Alternate hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop aid device will show greater patient satisfaction than 
patients not assigned to a dro p aid device.  
H0: µ s  <  µsd – δ 
    HA: µ s  ≥  µsd – δ 
 
Where µs, is the mean patient satisfaction without the drop aid device, µ sd is the mean patient satisfaction 
with the drop aid device.  
 
12.1.4. Secondary Objective:  Intention of  Long term use  
 
Formal hypothesis:  Patients assi gned to a drop aid device will claim greater interest in long term use of 
the drop aid device, than declining long term use of the drop aid device . 
 
Testable hypothesis: Mean patient s claiming interest in long term use of the drop aid device compared to 
mean patient declining interest in long term use of the drop aid device.  
 
Null hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop aid device will not show greater mean interest in long term 
use of the drop aid device.  
 
Alternate hypothesis: Patients assigned to a drop  aid device will show greater mean interest in long term 
use of the drop aid device.  
H0: µ y  <  µ n – δ 
    HA: µ y  ≥  µ n – δ 
 
Where µy, is the mean patients who claimed interest in long term use of the device, µ n is the mean patient 
who denied interest in  long term use of the device.  
 
12.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
The sample size was determined by [CONTACT_51416]. It was determined that a total of ten patients per g roup was 
financially feasible, thus a total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this study in approximately 1 year.  
 
Enrolling the projected 40 subjects in 1 year is feasible , as the ophthalmology department sees 
approximately 275 glaucoma patients weekly. Due to the high volume of the  glaucoma  clinic, the study 
team should be able to easily recruit their target. Additionally, the study team is comprised of multiple 
Glaucoma Drop Aid Study   Version 1.5, 16/November/[ADDRESS_54309] 
and will also likely include ANOVA, chi -squared, p -value, linear regression, among others.   Other 
outcomes such as length of t ime until completion of drops will also be measured and compared to no drop 
aid controls. Significant differences will be measured with similar statistical analysis as stated previously. 
Satisfaction of use will be measured with a survey and results will b e averaged among those in the same 
cohort. Any significant differences will also be measured with similar statistical analysis stated 
previously.

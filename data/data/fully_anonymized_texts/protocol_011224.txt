   1. Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  The purpose of the proposed project is to develop and test an integrated cognitive-behavioral intervention for smoking and alcohol (CBT for SA) among heavy drinking smokers presenting for smoking cessation treatment. The project involves three phases. In Phase 1, focus group interviews will be conducted with [ADDRESS_1125528] smoking counseling (SC) and standard alcohol counseling (AC). The specific aims are as follows: Primary Aim 1.1: In an iterative process based on detailed review of audiotaped focus group and treatment sessions, develop and refine CBT for SA manual, participant materials, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_779901], and treatment fidelity documents.  Primary Aim 1.2: Conduct pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812779] (N=10) with heavy drinking smokers to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.  Primary Aim 2.1: Conduct RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_812780] (N=40) with heavy drinking smokers to obtain effect size estimate data for the two primary outcomes of: 1. Point prevalence smoking abstinence over the last [ADDRESS_1125529] treatment completion.  2. Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  Co-occurring Heavy Alcohol Use and Cigarette Smoking: An Important Co-Morbidity. More than 50% of heavy drinkers (defined as >14 drinks per week/5 per day for men and >7 drinks per week/4 per day for women) smoke cigarettes compared with 23-39% of individuals who either abstain from alcohol or drink only moderately(1, 2). This figure increases to nearly 80% in clinical samples of alcohol dependent individuals. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the [LOCATION_002](3) and when combined with heavy alcohol has a synergistic effect on health including increased risk of liver, head, and neck cancers, liver cirrhosis, and pancreatitis(4-7), and greater abnormalities in brain structure and function(8). Combined heavy alcohol use and cigarette smoking is also associated with poor treatment outcomes. Heavy drinking smokers are less likely to initiate a smoking quit attempt(9, 10), achieve and maintain smoking abstinence (1, 11-25), and successfully moderate or abstain from alcohol use(26, 27). Thus, more effective treatments for concurrently reducing smoking and heavy drinking are warranted.  Why Integrate Treatment for Heavy Alcohol Use and Cigarette Smoking? Several factors may limit treatment response in heavy drinking smokers. Through conditioning processes, heavy alcohol use may enhance smoking motivation and smoking may promote SECTION V: RESEARCH PLAN 
10 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 motivation to drink(28-33). Heavy drinking may disinhibit individuals to smoke(33) or potentiate the rewarding effects of nicotine(34). Similarly, cigarette smoking may enhance alcohol reinforcement by [CONTACT_812833](33). Thus, treating one behavior in isolation of the other may render heavy drinking smokers’ efforts to change either behavior less successful. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_241608], heavy alcohol use and smoking are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_812781](35) and misperceptions that smoking is less harmful. On the contrary, more heavy drinkers will die from smoking-related causes than alcohol-related causes(33, 36), quitting smoking does not jeopardize and may even promote drinking changes(37), and many heavy drinkers are motivated to quit smoking(35).  Current Combination Treatments for Heavy Drinking and Smoking of Limited Efficacy. Prior research has primarily focused on smoking interventions provided during or shortly following outpatient or inpatient alcohol treatment (37, 38). Most interventions were brief (i.e., a few sessions), not integrated into alcohol treatment, and associated with low smoking quit rates (37, 38). Adding smoking pharmacotherapy to these interventions yields higher smoking quit rates, but these effects are not sustained beyond treatment (37, 38). Only 1 study examined a brief alcohol intervention integrated into smoking cessation treatment for heavy drinkers seeking to quit smoking(39). Heavy drinkers, not currently alcohol dependent, received [ADDRESS_1125530]; smoking changes also did not persist beyond treatment and were greatest among only moderately heavy drinkers. Moreover, through personal communication with [CONTACT_459353], many participants were unmotivated to discuss drinking after the first session. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_141859], this protocol is a promising model for integrating smoking and alcohol treatment and highlights how smoking treatment can provide an opportunity to identify and intervene with heavy drinkers. Providing more health information to motivate them to also reduce their drinking before and after quitting smoking and incorporating skill development relevant for changing alcohol use might promote sustained smoking abstinence and greater drinking reductions in this population.  Proposed Integrated CBT Intervention for Heavy Drinking Smokers: CBT for SA. We will develop a manual that integrates smoking and alcohol treatment and incorporates empi[INVESTIGATOR_812782]. Treatment will address obstacles and teach skills relevant for both issues and will be organized around two major areas of development: (1) stimulus control and (2) mood/stress management strategies. Treatment will be focused so that participants acquire high competence in two major skills in rather than poor to moderate competence in many skills. This content was selected based on data analyses and focus group interviews conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito on the factors that predict poor smoking cessation outcomes among heavy drinkers. Stimulus control involves setting up environmental constraints to avoid exposure to cues that trigger problematic behaviors and feelings(73, 74). For smoking and drinking, stimulus control emphasizes avoiding people, places, and things that trigger urges to use (73, 74). Relative to moderate and non-drinkers, the smoking behavior of heavy drinkers appears to be more environmentally and socially cued. For these reasons, skill development will focus on recognizing and responding to cues without smoking/drinking and either changing social networks 
11 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 or managing social situations without using. Mood/stress management strategies will emphasize behavioral activation - engaging in pleasant activities that do not involve smoking and drinking to reduce negative mood (i.e. stress, anxiety, boredom), specific relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation), and anger management techniques. Behavioral activation is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported intervention for the treatment of mood problems. Counseling will information about moderate drinking guidelines for men and women and will include specific strategies to reduce drinking (e.g., slowing the pace of drinking, substituting a non-alcoholic drink in between alcoholic drinks, counting drinks).  In initial sessions and reinforced throughout treatment, participants will be taught how problematic behaviors and feelings are the result of a learning process. By [CONTACT_14664] a functional analysis in session (a core component of CBT), participants will understand the factors that maintain the problematic behavior or feeling and what they can do to break the cycle(79). Discussions will focus on situations, thoughts, and feelings that maintain smoking and drinking and other problems that could affect efforts to change them (i.e., mood, social networks). They will learn general stimulus control skills (i.e., how to create an environment that supports adaptive behaviors) and how to apply them to these specific problems as well as how to identify and implement pleasant activities that do not involve smoking and drinking.  In addition to CBT skills, the intervention will incorporate motivational components to encourage participants to make changes to both behaviors. This will be provided through personalized health feedback and general feedback about smoking and drinking behaviors that will be provided at the first session and then monitored during treatment. We will first provide a number of different types of health profile information in the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812783]. The highest rated health profile components among these will then be provided in the final RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The final components will include: (1) liver function tests using blood samples, (2) inflammation markers using blood samples, (3) blood pressure, (4) metabolic function (i.e., glucose, lipid profile) from blood samples, (6) lung function based on spi[INVESTIGATOR_75037], which involve having participants exhale into a tube for [ADDRESS_1125531] as they can, and (7) breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and (8) hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV. We will also provide personalized feedback to participants about the money they are spending on cigarettes and alcohol, the extra calories they are consuming from alcohol use, typi[INVESTIGATOR_812784]. Consistent with [CONTACT_459353]’s intervention for heavy drinking smokers, sessions will also involve open-ended, personalized discussions of current drinking and smoking patterns, pros and cons of smoking and drinking, how drinking and smoking are associated, history of prior quit attempts for both, the role of alcohol in smoking relapse, normative feedback on current drinking, and preliminary drinking goal setting.  We will recruit heavy drinkers interested in quitting smoking or interested in changing drinking; we will not require an interest in changing both. Unlike [CONTACT_459353]’s study(39), participants with current alcohol dependence will be eligible to participate since the aim is to evaluate smoking treatments that could be applicable to a broader heavy drinking population, though severe alcohol dependent participants who require additional alcohol treatment will be excluded (see exclusion criteria). The intention is to improve smoking and drinking outcomes among heavy- drinking smokers. Thus, participants’ motivation to change their behaviors will vary. In addition to the CBT skills above, motivational strategies will be utilized to support participants who are interested in 
12 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 changing and encourage those who may be more ambivalent. These strategies include eliciting and reinforcing participants’ self-motivational drinking statements, using reflective listening, and expressing acceptance and affirmation(80).  Participants will be advised to consider abstaining from drinking for the first [ADDRESS_1125532] pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], instead of the nicotine patch as initially planned, for several reasons. Varenicline is a highly efficacious smoking cessation pharmacotherapy that yields higher smoking quit rates than bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136295] (127, 128).  Among smokers who also drink heavily, varenicline is safe and well-tolerated (129, 130). Recent evidence also suggests that varenicline reduces alcohol craving and consumption among smokers (129, 130, 131) and nonsmokers (131). The results of focus group interviews with heavy drinking smokers recently completed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito suggest additional benefits of varenicline. In interviews, participants expressed greater ambivalence about changing their drinking than smoking. Varenicline can reduce alcohol use in the absence of specific advice to change drinking among smokers not actively seeking alcohol treatment (129, 130). Participants also expressed greater dissatisfaction with using nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812785]. In contrast, the nicotine patch yields lower smoking quit rates than varenicline among all smokers (132) and in at least one study was associated with greater alcohol use among smokers compared to varenicline (133). Taken together, providing a pharmacotherapy intervention that is efficacious for both problems along with an integrated behavioral treatment makes sense for the purposes of this study. The two studies will allow for an investigation of whether CBT for SA can improve varenicline’s efficacy for smoking cessation and drinking reductions in this population.  We will also recruit heavy drinkers who are smokers as defined by [CONTACT_6750]: report smoking [ADDRESS_1125533] a urinary cotinine level of ≥30ng/mL by [CONTACT_31576]-quantitative urinalysis, and/or ≥2 on NicAlert dipstick. We propose this flexible definition of smoking for several reasons:  (1) This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688]. We do not want to miss the opportunity to learn which heavy drinking smokers are interested in an integrated treatment, perceive it to be helpful, and actually benefit from it, due to making the smoking eligibility too narrow. (2) Heavy drinking smokers are a diverse population. A sizeable portion of heavy drinkers smoke on a non-daily basis, only during drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. In 2010, the CDC reported that 21.8% of smokers were nondaily smokers. Nondaily smokers also have the highest rates of alcohol dependence (135). (3) and seek smoking cessation treatment (136). (4) Nondaily smokers have similar treatment needs as daily smokers. There is evidence that they extract similar levels of nicotine as daily smokers at a given number of cigarettes 
13 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 smoked per day, suggesting that this subgroup could also benefit from pharmacotherapy treatment (137). (5) Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to report light or non-daily smoking (138, 139) so we do not want to limit our ability to recruit these populations of smokers. (6) The results of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_812786] (138). Likewise, a retrospective evaluation of 36,594 French smokers offered smoking cessation services demonstrated that varenicline doubled quit rates among light smokers compared to nicotine replacement therapy (140).  3. Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths.  This project involves three phases: (1) focus group interviews with heavy drinking smokers, (2) an open-label pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 10 heavy drinking smokers and (3) a randomized, controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 40 heavy drinking smokers.  Phase 1: Focus Group Interviews: We will recruit up to 30 heavy drinking smokers to participate in 1 of 4 focus group interview sessions (approximately 7-8 smokers per group). Prior to each focus group, smokers will provide informed consent and complete self-report assessments (approximately one hour) as part of an intake visit. The assessments will be used to determine participant eligibility and to obtain baseline information on participants’ smoking and drinking behavior. Participants will not complete all of the assessments that are listed for the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_287578]. Instead, they will complete an abbreviated intake to confirm they meet study eligibility and smoking and alcohol assessments.  The focus group interview (approximately 90 minutes in length) will evaluate heavy drinking smokers’ perceptions about smoking and heavy drinking and their associated consequences, strategies they find helpful for managing these problems, and their preferences for components they would prefer in an integrated intervention to address both. We will use the results of the focus groups to create the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812787] [ADDRESS_1125534]. Fucito and [CONTACT_812863] will provide discussion prompts, moderate discussion, and maintain an open, supportive environment. They will utilize structured group discussion with standardized procedures (including audio-tapi[INVESTIGATOR_812788]). A research staff member will also be present to hand transcribe smokers’ responses as a back-up for the audio-recorders. The focus groups will be audiotaped and later transcribed.  Participants will be compensated $15 for completing the intake and $45 for completing the focus group interview.  At the end of the focus groups, transcripts will be reviewed and analyzed according to standardized coding procedures such as noting consistent themes, their frequency, and listing representative 
14 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 quotations from transcripts. We will analyze detailed field notes from interviews with a content analysis approach that incorporates data display matrices to identify themes across participants. Questionnaire data will be analyzed descriptively, focusing on severity and frequency of smoking behavior and alcohol use. Common themes among smokers’ suggestions will guide the intervention components for the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812789] 2 and 3.  We will not directly advertise the focus groups. Instead, we will rely on referrals from the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit clinic and from an ongoing study of varenicline for heavy drinking smokers, entitled “Multi-Site Study: Varenicline Treatment of Alcohol Dependent Smokers” (HIC#[PHONE_16952]). The latter study is recruiting heavy drinking smokers for a clinical trial. A high percentage of potential participants who are screened are ineligible for the trial. Individuals who are not eligible for the varenicline trial will be provided with an opportunity to screen for this focus group study upon completion of their intake for the clinical trial (HIC#[PHONE_16952]).  Phase 2: Open-label Pre-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]: Heavy drinkers interested in quitting smoking (N=10) assigned to 8 sessions over 12 weeks of CBT for SA + [ADDRESS_1125535]. Fucito will develop and refine an integrated cognitive- behavioral psychotherapy intervention for smoking and heavy drinking (CBT for SA) and related therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812790]. An initial manual will be tested in an iterative fashion with a small sample of heavy drinkers interested in quitting smoking (N=10). [CONTACT_450110] will be the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812791]. The same sample selection criteria, recruitment methods, study procedures, and assessments described for the RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_812792]. [CONTACT_450110] will then review the results of the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812793], therapi[INVESTIGATOR_779901], and adherence/competence process rating system for the RCT.  Several strategies will be utilized to evaluate the feasibility, utility, and acceptability of the manualized interventions. All sessions will be audiotaped. Participants will complete therapy satisfaction questionnaires after each session to rate positive and negative session aspects, their comprehension of the session content, perceived utility of the material, and their intentions to follow through with session assignments and recommendations. Participants’ reported utilization of previously taught strategies/techniques at the beginning of sessions will also provide an index of the utility of specific intervention components. [CONTACT_450110] will record her experience implementing the interventions after each session. A trained RA will conduct taped individual structured exit interviews with participants to further assess participants’ satisfaction with the interventions. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze all of these process outcomes. After conducting psychotherapy sessions, [CONTACT_450110] will review session tapes, participant feedback and progress, and her experience conducting the sessions with consultants at regular meetings. The sessions will continue to be modified until they are deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_812834].  Phase 3: 
15 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/[ADDRESS_1125536] Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]: Heavy-drinking smokers interested in either quitting smoking or reducing their drinking (N=40) will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions. At intake, participants will be asked which behavior they would like to change using scores on the Contemplation Ladder (see measures section). If participants have the same score for both, we will ask them to choose which one they would like to change. For participants who state that they would prefer to quit smoking, we will randomly assign them to: (1) up to 12 sessions over 12 weeks of CBT for SA + 12 weeks of varenicline or (2) up to [ADDRESS_1125537] smoking counseling (SC) + 12 weeks of varenicline For participants who state that they would prefer to reduce their drinking, we will randomly assign them to: (1) up to 12 sessions over 12 weeks of CBT for SA + 12 weeks of varenicline or (2) up to [ADDRESS_1125538] alcohol counseling (AC)+ 12 weeks of varenicline .  A detailed flow-chart of study procedures for Phase 3 is provided in the tables below based on participant condition assignment for either phase (i.e., CBT for SA, SC, or AC).

Recruitment: Participants will be recruited through advertisements, press releases, posters/flyers, scratch pads, mailings to physicians, fax referral forms from physicians, and through websites (e.g., www.quitnet.com, www.google.com, www.craigslist.com, www.facebook.com). Participants will also be recruited through the Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812796]. Patients who enroll in the Service and meet study eligibility criteria, will be given the option to participate. Prospective participants will be screened by [CONTACT_812835] a web-based screener on initial eligibility criteria.  Screening (Week -1): Those who appear eligible on the basis of a phone screen or webscreener will be invited to attend an intake appointment with a study investigator or a research assistant at the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit (SATU), Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812796], or the Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC), where informed consent will be obtained prior to any other procedures. Following this, the participant will meet with a research assistant for an intake session. Participants will be asked to provide a photo ID (i.e., driver’s license, passport, state ID) to verify their identity and contact [CONTACT_3031]. Complete medical and tobacco use histories, breath CO levels, breath alcohol levels will be obtained from all participants as well as urine samples for laboratory screening tests, including urine drug screening. Participants who screen positive for drugs, other than marijuana, will not be eligible for the study. Urine drug screens are performed using dip sticks which provide immediate results. The dip sticks are disposed of after obtaining drug screening results and no urine samples are further retained for this purpose. The results of urine drug screening are not included in the participant’s research record.  If participants meet initial eligibility criteria, they will then be evaluated for final medical eligibility by a study advanced practice nurse or study physician. The research assistant and nurse/physician will review the risks, benefits and procedures involved in study participation and help eligible participants select a potential quit date which they will then finalize with their smoking counselor. Before starting varenicline, pregnancy tests will be performed on all females of child bearing potential. If a participant is found to be pregnant, she will be excluded from the study and referred for other smoking cessation treatment. Those participants who meet inclusion criteria following the intake appointment will be assigned to 1 of 3 study groups (CBT for SA, SC, or AC) depending on the study phase. In the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], all participants will be assigned to CBT for SA and varenicline. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], participants will be randomly assigned to either CBT for SA, SC, or AC plus varenicline. Participants will be blind to participant counseling assignment. Research and clinical staff will not be informed of the study hypotheses. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_547] (male, female) in order to balance treatment groups with respect to the proportion of women and men.

  Treatment Phase - CBT for SA (Weeks 0 to 11): Participants will begin varenicline on the first day of counseling. Pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: In the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], [CONTACT_450110] will work with participants to identify the ideal smoking quit date. It is anticipated that participants will quit smoking within the first [ADDRESS_1125539] session (Week 0), clients will receive their personalized smoking, drinking, and health feedback report which they will review with their study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. The personalized feedback information will be repeated 3 more times during treatment to monitor participants’ progress (i.e., Weeks 5, 8 or 9, and 11 – end of treatment). Participants will attend appointments to complete research assessments with a research assistant and receive individual counseling with a study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Sessions will be weekly for the first 4 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3), then bi-weekly (weeks 5, 7, and 9). They will then return the two weeks later (Week 11) for termination. Counseling will focus on teaching skills to manage smoking cues and create environmental conditions that promote behavior change as well as behavioral activation and anger management techniques to promote positive mood. Participants will learn these skills generally and how to specifically apply them to quitting smoking and reducing their drinking. Sessions will utilize a motivational style to minimize participant resistance and emphasize personal responsibility for change. Smoking and alcohol use will be discussed at every session and participants will monitor both behaviors outside of session. Sessions will involve open-ended discussions of smoking and drinking patterns, pros and cons of smoking and drinking, how drinking and smoking are associated, history of prior quit attempts for both, the role of alcohol in smoking relapse, normative feedback on drinking, and preliminary drinking goal setting. Participants will be advised to consider abstaining from drinking for the first 2 weeks of quitting smoking and ideally for the duration of smoking cessation treatment, regardless of their long-term drinking goals. They will also be provided with specific strategies for moderating their alcohol use. Counseling will also include a review of participants’ reactions to varenicline and medication compliance. We will reduce the varenicline dose for any participants who report difficulty tolerating higher doses.

Participants will attend appointments to complete research assessments with a research assistant and receive individual counseling with a study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Sessions will be weekly for the first 4 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3), then the option to have bi-weekly thereafter (weeks 5, 7, and 9) or to continue weekly sessions until termination. They will then return for a final visit for termination (Week 11). Regardless of their decision, we will inform them that in order to get a final feedback report they will need to come in at Week 9 or 10 for a blood draw. In the AC control condition, counseling will focus on teaching skills to manage drinking cues and create environmental conditions that promote behavior change as well as behavioral activation, relaxation skills, and anger management techniques to promote positive mood. Participants will learn these skills generally and how to specifically apply them to reducing their drinking. Sessions will utilize a motivational style to minimize participant resistance and emphasize personal responsibility for change. Drinking will be discussed at every session and participants will monitor their behavior outside of session. Sessions will involve open-ended discussions of drinking patterns, pros and cons of drinking, history of prior attempts at changing drinking, and preliminary drinking goal setting. Participants will also receive brief advice to consider reducing their smoking to support long-term improvements in drinking. They will be provided with specific strategies for reducing their drinking. Counseling will also include a review of participants’ reactions to varenicline and medication compliance. We will reduce the varenicline dose for any participants who report difficulty tolerating higher doses.  A total of [ADDRESS_1125544].  Varenicline Titration Schedule: Tablets contain either 0.5 mg or 1mg active varenicline. Whenever participants start the study medication their dose will be slowly increased as follows: Days 1-3: one 0.5mg tablet once per day Days 4-7: one 0.5mg tablet twice per day Day 8 – Week 11: one 1mg tablets twice per day  If participants experience any unpleasant side effects their medication dosage can be decreased. The study physician or nurse will check in with you by [CONTACT_812836].  3-Day Call Back Phone Call: In both conditions, within [ADDRESS_1125545] to assess their experience quitting/reducing.  Research Follow-up (Phase 3 only: Weeks 15 and 27): Participants will return 4 weeks and 16 weeks after completing treatment to complete an exit interview and follow-up assessments. 
20 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 Participants will complete a SAFTEE (Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events) at each research appointment. Medication will be dispensed at the counseling appointments, and any unused medication will be returned. Breath CO levels, breath alcohol levels, blood pressure, weight, and self-reports of tobacco and alcohol use will be obtained at each appointment, and questionnaires will be administered. Urine cotinine and ethyl glucuronide levels will be measured at intake and Weeks 0, 11, 15, and 27 to provide indices of smoking and alcohol exposure. Blood samples for health feedback will be obtained at intake, Weeks 2-3 (pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103]), 5-7, and 9- 10. A urine pregnancy test will be done for all menstruating before beginning the study and monthly during treatment. A positive pregnancy test will result in the participant being excluded from the study. Four weeks and 16 weeks after the treatment phase of the study is completed (i.e., Weeks 15 and 27), participants in Phase 3 only will return to the clinic to assess cigarette and alcohol use, breath CO, urine cotinine ethyl glucuronide, weight gain, and adverse events.  Retention of Participants: To enhance retention, participants will be paid $10 for attending the intake and research appointments, and $20 each for the research follow-up appointments. The pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812798] 8 research appointments for a total of $[ADDRESS_1125546] study involves an intake session, up to 12 research appointments, and two follow up sessions for a total of up to $170 per participant. Several procedures used to enhance adherence and retention include: (1) obtaining participant contact [CONTACT_32431] ≥2 collateral informants at enrollment; (2) thoroughly explaining study procedures; (3) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_812799]; (4) uniformly implementing procedures for non-adherence across study conditions; (5) providing appointment cards and reminder calls for all appointments; (6) contact[CONTACT_812837]; (7) closely monitoring side effects, symptoms, clinical status, and participant concerns; (8) ensuring availability of staff for addressing concerns; and (9) reimbursing participants for time and effort(82). Participants who drop out of treatment or are lost to follow-up will be compared to study completers to inform the interpretation of study results and improve retention rates in the next phase of intervention testing. Scheduled research data will continue to be obtained for participants who need to withdraw from treatment or who discontinue treatment.  For participants who discontinue the study during the treatment phase and are unreachable by [CONTACT_812838], we will mail a letter with a follow-up questionnaire and self- addressed stamped envelope. Some participants may indicate that they are unable to come to the clinic for an interview. If these participants are willing to meet a member of the research team at a public place, we will meet with them to collect follow-up data, including a breath carbon monoxide test, urine cotinine and ethyl glucuronide, weight, and, questionnaire data.  Study Counselors: [CONTACT_450110] will be the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812800]. Four to six study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812801]. [CONTACT_450110] is available to serve as one of the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812802]. Fucito; [CONTACT_450110] will serve as the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812803]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812804] (i.e., all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812805]). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812806]. The crossed design has the advantage of reducing potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812807](83). Although a contamination across conditions is a potential disadvantage of this crossed design(83), the design has the advantage of 
21 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/[ADDRESS_1125547] effects which are large and could be problematic given the small sample size (84). To reduce contamination, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812808], provided with close supervision, and only informed of treatment assignment on the day of the session, therapy will be delivered using treatment manuals, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812809] a random factor in analyses(84).  Counselor Training Seminars and Guided Feedback: Counselors will receive careful training and close supervision by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito. Prior to treating participants, counselors will attend a training seminar over the span of 1 week (approximately 1 hour per day for each counselor for the CBT for SA, SC, and AC conditions). Counselor training will largely focus on learning how to deliver personalized health feedback about smoking- and drinking-related risks and cognitive-behavioral techniques to promote changes in smoking and drinking for heavy drinking smokers. Treatment manuals will be developed for all counseling conditions.  Counselor Certification: Following this training, counselors will be assigned a training case that will be audiotaped. Specialist performance on the training cases will be evaluated on the basis of ratings by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito on an adapted version of the Yale Adherence and Competence Scale (YACS) (85) created specifically for this study by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito. [CONTACT_450110] will listen to counseling sessions from each counselor, rate sessions using the YACS, and give guided feedback to counselors in both conditions to help them develop their skills and meet certification standards that would permit them to receive Pi[INVESTIGATOR_812810]. [CONTACT_450110] will certify counselors who use sufficient counseling strategies (an average of 4 on a 7-point scale across all adherence items) with a minimum of adequate skill (an average of 4 on a 7-point scale across all competence items). [CONTACT_450110] will continue to coach counselors until they become certified. During this training phase, there will be some leeway to alter the counseling protocols based on feedback from counselors and participants.  Counselor Supervision: The CBT for SA and SC alone counseling procedures will be overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito, with input from study consultants on an ongoing basis, and they will respond to problems and issues as they arise. Beginning with all training cases and continuing throughout the Phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], all counselors will receive regular supervision and re-training on an individual and group basis. Supervision sessions will include review of study procedures, updates of case materials, review of digital recordings, and opportunities to discuss supervisor ratings. Continual review and supervision will help ensure that counselors’ skills remain at a high level and prevent the use of counseling techniques or strategies that are inconsistent with the counseling protocol. Supervision will ensure that counselors are primarily providing integrated cognitive-behavioral techniques for smoking and heavy drinking in the CBT for SA condition and primarily providing standard smoking counseling for the SC alone condition and standard alcohol counseling in the AC alone condition.  Adherence and Competence Ratings: Establishing discrimination between the three conditions (CBT for SA versus SC or AC) is a priority. After completion of intervention delivery, tape ratings for fidelity analyses will be 
22 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 conducted by 5 experienced raters blind to counselors’ intervention condition. All therapy sessions will be digitally tape recorded and saved for supervision and training of study counselors and fidelity analysis. Consistent with other psychotherapy studies (e.g., Project MATCH)(79), a percentage of tapes collected post-intervention will be rated and assessed [i.e., approximately 20% (88/440)] which will consist of an equal number of tapes for each rater broken down as 44/44 for CBT for SA versus SC. Prior to tape rating, raters will receive training in fidelity analysis. Following training, intrarater reliability will be established by [CONTACT_812839] 5 raters rate an initial sample of approximately 10 tapes. A second calibration sample of 5 tapes will then be conducted to focus additional training efforts on items where reliability is not adequate (i.e., 5 raters x 5 tapes). A third calibration sample of [ADDRESS_1125548] through the study tape rating phase to ensure raters maintain high levels of reliability (i.e., 5 raters x 5 tapes). All session recordings will be accessed via a secure server. Recordings will be loaded onto this server and accessed as links after logging in with a password. All recordings will be available to play but not to download, ensuring that confidential session data is not saved anywhere but on the secure server. This method has been used successfully by [CONTACT_812840]. Thus, the requisite knowledge, programming, and infrastructure is in place to implement this system for the current study.  Assessments  We plan to assess a range of pretreatment participant characteristics, process measures, measures of treatment safety, and treatment outcomes. Intake assessments are designed to ensure that patients meet eligibility criteria and assess important predictor variables. After the narrative description of all assessments provided below, a schedule of the assessments is presented in Table 2.  Screening Measures  Medical History and Demographic Questionnaires: These questionnaires will obtain: (1) basic demographic information including age, gender, marital status, employment status, occupation and (2) alcohol/drug history. Medical history will also be obtained prior to randomization. The medical history and demographic measures will be administered for screening.  Diagnostic and Substance Use History: Sections of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) will be used to provide current and lifetime diagnoses of substance use and other Axis I psychiatric disorders at the recruitment session for all study phases. Specifically, participants will be characterized on their history of alcohol, drug, eating, panic disorder, psychosis, and mood disorders. The alcohol and nicotine sections of the SCID will be repeated at the end of treatment (EOT) and at follow up appointments.  Vitals – Two blood pressure readings will be obtained at each visit; the first by a research assistant and the second by [CONTACT_363316].  Body Weight: will be measured at baseline, during treatment, and at follow-up in order to evaluate the effects of treatment and smoking cessation on weight gain. 
23 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 Menstrual Cycle Assessment: All women will be assessed for their menstrual/gynecological status by [CONTACT_6270]-report. Additionally, retrospective assessments of premenstrual symptoms will be obtained.  The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (Revised) (CIWA-AR): will be used to assess alcohol withdrawal symptoms for all study phases. The CIWA is a reliable 10-item instrument designed to assess severity of current withdrawal syndrome(86).  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale: This questionnaire assesses past and current suicidal ideation, intent, and attempts (97). It will be used to monitor the possible suicidality of all study participants for all study phases, as well any potential contraindications. This will be assessed at all timepoints.  Urine pregnancy – A urine pregnancy test will be performed at baseline and monthly during treatment. Tests will be administered at the next assessment point for all menstruating female participants who miss the pregnancy test at their prior appointment. In addition, a menstrual cycle timeline is completed at each appointment during treatment, and if their menses is late, a urine pregnancy test will be obtained. Pregnant women will be referred for other treatment.  Biological Markers of Tobacco and Alcohol Use  Carbon monoxide levels and urine cotinine levels will be monitored at intake to determine participant eligibility and to verify smoking abstinence during treatment. Although CO levels are typi[INVESTIGATOR_812811], measurement of urine cotinine levels should cover a wider time window than exhaled carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide levels will be measured using a Vitalograph Breath CO, from Vitalograph Inc. (Lenexa, Kansas), which is a precision instrument for detecting carbon monoxide in exhaled breath. Carbon monoxide is known to have a half-life of 2 hours in an active human (87). This instrument measures CO in the range of 0-[ADDRESS_1125549]. Peter Jatlow will measure Cotinine levels in urine. Urine samples for cotinine will be obtained at intake and Weeks 0, 11, 15, and 27. Comparison of CO and cotinine during treatment with intake values will provide a within participant quantitative measure of changes in nicotine exposure and thus allow characterization of partial responders. Only a breath CO will be obtained for Phase 1 screening.  Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) provides a sensitive and reliable biomarker of recent alcohol consumption and is detectable in urine for up to three days after drinking depending upon the amount consumed[117-120]. A urine sample will be obtained at intake, Weeks 0, 11, [ADDRESS_1125550] self-reports abstinence or no heavy drinking and will be used in secondary analyses of composite outcomes based on self-report confirmed by [CONTACT_812841] (see statistical section). Heavy exposure to non-beverage sources of ethanol such as some mouthwashes and hand washes, particularly the latter, can confound interpretation of urinary EtG assays and will be monitored. Normalization to urine creatinine concentration will correct for extremes in urinary dilution. 
24 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 The EtG assays will be performed at Yale. Yale researchers are currently characterizing the relationship between EtG concentration over time and their inter-individual and within individual variation over a range of ethanol doses (RO1AA018664) to develop more definitive cut-offs that can be used to confirm no heavy drinking. However, current knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of EtG allows the following conclusions. A concentration <100 ng/mL indicates that any alcohol consumption during the past 24 hrs is unlikely[120]. A concentration >500 ng/mL refutes a self report of "no heavy drinking" in the past 1-3 days[121] with several unavoidable limitations intrinsic to the pharmacokinetics of EtG. A low EtG concentration could be either consistent with light drinking during the prior 24 hours or with heavy drinking several days previously. Even light drinking on the day of the clinic visit, a short time prior to sample collection, could exceed 500ng/mL. Thus, final interpretations regarding heavy drinking for biochemical confirmation of self-report require integration with information from self-reports about the recency and quantity of alcohol consumed. [CONTACT_615179] and a second reviewer will make these determinations without knowledge of the participant’s clinical course or treatment condition. EtG Assay: Aliquots of spot urine samples will be stored at -20degrees within one hour of collection and subsequently transferred to a -70 degree freezer for longer-term storage. EtG will be measured using LC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in the negative ion mode with deuterium labeled EtG as internal standard. This procedure, modified from published assays [119, 122] is validated and running.  Breath alcohol tests (BAC) will be conducted at each appointment to assess recent alcohol consumption. Participants will be asked to blow into a small tube for five seconds. The purpose of this test is to determine if participants can give consent and/or complete assessments and to assess potential risk of harm (e.g., driving above the legal limit). Potential participants will not be able to provide consent unless they have a blood alcohol level of .00. Research assessments may be administered to participants who have blood alcohol levels of less than or equal to .04. Participants who have blood alcohol levels higher than .[ADDRESS_1125551] blood alcohol levels higher than .00 will not be permitted to participate in the focus group interview. They will be rescheduled to attend another session.  Health Profile Measures - General Health Biomarkers (these will all be measured at intake and then weeks 2 or 3 (pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103]), between 5 and 7 (treatment midpoint), and 9 or 10 (treatment completion))  Blood Chemistry Profiles: This comprehensive metabolic evaluation is used to assess general health and any potential adverse effects of the medication. The profile includes an evaluation of kidney and liver functions, renal function, glucose, cholesterol levels and blood count.  C-reactive protein test (CRP) and other makers of inflammation will be conducted at intake, then weeks 2 or 3,treatment midpoint (i.e., between Weeks 5 and 7), and treatment completion (i.e., 9 or 10). A CRP test is a blood test that measures the amount of a protein called c-reactive protein in the blood, C-reactive protein measures levels of inflammation in the body. Heavy alcohol consumption and smoking can cause such inflammation, thus inflammatory markers could act as 
25 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 a measure of physical damage done to the body as a result of both. By [CONTACT_812842], we will be able to observe whether decreases in heavy drinking and/or smoking are associated with decreases inflammatory markers.  Plasma carotenoids: Carotenoids are an important component of the antioxidant defense system in humans. Blood samples will be obtained at intake, at Weeks 3, treatment midpoint (i.e, between Weeks 5 and 7), and treatment completion (i.e., 9 to measure levels of plasma carotenoids. Participants will be informed of their carotenoid levels as part of their health feedback. This is assessed for the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103].  Lung Function will be measured using a portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]. At intake and Weeks 3 (pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103]), between [ADDRESS_1125552] results (i.e., normal functioning, mild/moderate/severe impairment, normal or reduced airflow, lung age, etc.).  Health Profile Measures - Cancer Risk Lung cancer and oral cancer risks: Self-report data provided at intake pi[INVESTIGATOR_812812]. Cancer risks will be calculated at intake. Participants will be presented with a brief description of the cancer risks and a qualitative interpretation of the calculated results in their Week [ADDRESS_1125553] on this calculation in the short term. This is assessed for the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103].  The oral cancer risk calculator models the excess odds ratio to assess risk by [CONTACT_368070] (pack- years) and its modification by [CONTACT_812843] (cigarettes/day) (124-126).  The CLEAR lung cancer risk prediction tool (123) will be used to quantify a smoker’s risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_812813], 10, or 15 years. This tool is based on the participant’s age, sex, smoking history, medical history, family history of cancer, and past exposures to asbestos or wood dust.  Nicotine and Alcohol Use Measures  Smoking and Alcohol Use History Questionnaire: At intake for all study phases, this questionnaire will assess basic smoking status and history such as number of years smoked, type of cigarettes smoked, number and length of quit attempts, amount of money spent on smoking, concomitant smoking related health symptoms and syndromes. Similar questions will be asked about drinking history: age of first use, number and length of quit attempts, amount of money spent on drinking, concomitant drinking related health symptoms and syndromes.  Timeline Followback Interview (TLFB): This standardized, validated, and reliable experimenter- administered rating scale will be used to obtain quantity and frequency estimates of nicotine, alcohol and other drug consumption for a 90-day period prior to study enrollment for all study phases (88). It uses a calendar prompt and a number of other memory aids (e.g., holiday, payday, 
26 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 and other personally relevant dates) to facilitate accurate recall of drug use during the targeted period, and it has demonstrated adequate levels of reliability and validity when administered as an in-person interview. We will use the calendar to record alcohol and tobacco use on a daily basis throughout the study.  Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence: This six item scale (89) will be used to measure severity of dependence on nicotine at intake for all study phases. It has an internal consistency of .61, and its total score is closely related to biochemical measures of intensity of smoking. An additional dichotomous item will be added to assess whether the participant wakes in the middle of the night to smoke.  Nicotine Withdrawal Checklist: This questionnaire (90) measures the severity of eight withdrawal symptoms on five point Likert scales. This will allow an examination of the relationship between self-reported levels of nicotine withdrawal, biochemical measures of nicotine use, cigarette craving, cigarette consumption, and sleep disturbance. This will be assessed at all timepoints.  Tiffany Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief (QSU-Brief): The QSU-Brief is a ten-item questionnaire that assesses the structure and function of smoking urges (91). Participants will be asked to indicate how strongly they agree or disagree with each statement on a Likert-type scale of 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). The Tiffany scale characterizes urges to smoke in response to two separate factors. The first factor is characterized by [CONTACT_812844], and the second is related to relief from nicotine withdrawal or negative affect. This will be assessed at all timepoints.  Contemplation Ladders for Smoking and Drinking: The Contemplation Ladders are 1-item measure of readiness to change rated on an 11-point scale (e.g., 0 = no thought of quitting to 10 = taking action to quit). The Smoking and Alcohol ladders will be administered at intake.  Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS): This 25-item questionnaire assesses the severity of alcohol dependence including withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, impaired control over drinking, compulsion to drink, and drink-seeking behavior (93). This will be assessed at intake.  Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS): This 14-item questionnaire assesses thoughts about drinking, urges to drink, and the ability to resist these thoughts and urges (94). This will be assessed at all timepoints.  Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT): This ten-item questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_812845] (134). Participants' AUDIT score will be provided to them on their personalized feedback report to given them an indication of their potential risk of harm from drinking.  Short Inventory of Problems (SIP-2R): This fifteen-item questionnaire measures physical, social, intrapersonal, impulsive, and interpersonal consequences of alcohol consumption and will be included in participant’s personalized feedback reports (135).  Psychological Related Measures 
27 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/[ADDRESS_1125554] Schedule (PANAS): The PANAS is a self-report scale that contains two subscales to assess positive and negative mood. Both subscales contain 10 items that are measured on a Likert-type scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) (96). This will be assessed at all timepoints.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_812814]: A questionnaire will be designed for this study to assess the participants’ use of cognitive and behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_812815]. This will be assessed at all timepoints.  Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ II) (114): This 7-item questionnaire will measure the construct of psychological flexibility using a 7-point Likert type scale. It will be assessed at intake, week 11, and week 27.  Avoidance and Inflexibility Scale (AIS) (115): This 13-item scale will measure distress intolerance or inflexibility in response to smoking-related thoughts, feelings, and body sensations. This scale uses a 5-point Likert-type scale and will be assessed at intake, week 11, and week 27.  Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21(DAAS-21) (116) : This 21-item self-report contains 3 subscales to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. All subscales contain 7 items using a 4-point Likert type scale. It will be assessed at all timepoints.  Social Network Information: Participants will be asked to list up to [ADDRESS_1125555] a romantic partner. Network sizes, therefore, can range from 0 to 10. Participants will also indicate how many of these individuals smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol.  Cognitive Measures  Stroop Task (67): This task will be used to evaluate the effect of counseling on changes in self- control strength in response to smoking cues. Participants will be shown smoking-related, drinking-related words and neutral words matched for frequency and length in the English language that are displayed in 1 of 4 different ink colors. They will be asked to identify the color that they see (i.e., the color the word is printed in) and ignore what the word says (i.e., inhibit response to read word). Words will be presented in blocks with neutral words presented before smoking- and drinking-related words. Practice sessions will be administered for both tasks before the first test trials. This task will be administered at intake and Weeks 0, 5, and 11.  Medication Related Measures Adverse Events Checklist (SAFTEE)(100): A checklist format will be used to obtain information about adverse events. This checklist will include the most commonly reported adverse events for varenicline with severity rated on a scale from 0 (minimal) to 3 (severe). In addition, participants will be asked to report any other concerns, which will be recorded individually. This information will be collected at all study time points. 
28 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_15833]: The number of returned varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_812816].  Other Psychological Measures Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)(101): The PSQI will be used to evaluate habitual sleep quality, self-reports of quantitative aspects of sleep (e.g., duration, latency) and insomnia symptoms (perceived). It has a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing “good” vs. “poor” sleepers. This will be assessed at all timepoints (pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103]) and intake and end of treatment for the RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Version 11 (BIS-11) (105): This 30-item questionnaire will assess general impulsiveness and specific impulsiveness along 3 domains (attentional impulsiveness [attention and cognitive instability], motor impulsiveness [motor and perseverance], nonplanning impulsiveness [self-control and cognitive complexity]).Items are scored on a 4-point scale. This will be assessed at intake.  Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) (106). The ERQ is a 10-item self-report measure designed to assess individual differences in the use of two regulation processes: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression on 7-point scale. This will be assessed at intake..  Brief Self-Control Scale (B-SCS) (107). This 13-item measure of self-control is correlated with better adjustment, lower scores on measures of binge eating and alcohol abuse, lower ratings of psychopathology and anger, higher self-esteem, and a number of other measures of adjustment. This will be assessed at intake..  Treatment Evaluation  Client Session Report: Participants will complete a questionnaire at the end of each counseling session that is based on selected items from the Therapy Session Report (TSR)(108). The items will include: (1) an overall evaluation of the session from perfect to very poor; 2) a rating of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812817]-at-all; (3) a rating of how well the participant felt understood by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541]; (4) a rating of the extent to which the participant is looking forward to the next session; and (5) a rating of overall satisfaction with the session. During the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], participants will be asked to evaluate specific treatment components that were discussed in each session (e.g., presentation of health feedback, discussion of social networks).  Client Treatment Evaluation Form: Participants will be asked at termination to rate components of the study treatment and provide reasons for termination (where relevant).  Table 1.

 calculate sample size) for a later, full-scale RCT of CBT for SA. Prior to assessing primary analyses, [CONTACT_450110] will conduct: (1) univariate analyses to verify normality assumptions and (2) bivariate analyses to evaluate baseline equivalence between groups and significant covariates. If normality is an issue, [CONTACT_450110] will perform non-parametric analyses.   If this section (or one of its parts, A or B) is not applicable, state N/A and delete the rest of the section.  A. DRUGS and BIOLOGICS  1. Identification of Drug or Biologic: What is (are) the name(s) of the drug(s) or biologic(s) being used? Identify whether FDA approval has been granted and for what indication(s).  We will be using varenicline (Chantix) 0.5 and 1 mg. The FDA has approved varenicline for smoking cessation and will be used at the approved dose of 2 mg/day for this study.  All protocols which utilize a drug or biologic not approved by, but regulated by, the FDA must provide the following information:  Not applicable to this project.  a. What is the Investigational New Drug (IND) number assigned by [CONTACT_1622]?  b. Who holds the IND?  Alternatively, an exemption from IND filing requirements may be sought for a clinical investigation of a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002]. If there is no IND and an exemption is being sought, review the following categories and complete the category that applies (and delete the inapplicable categories):  Exempt Category [ADDRESS_1125557] that is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002] can be exempt from IND regulations if all of the following are yes:  i. The intention of the investigation is NOT to report to the FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication for use or to be used to support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug. Yes No ii. The drug that is undergoing investigation is lawfully marketed as a prescription drug product, and the intention of the investigation is NOT to support a significant change in the advertising for the product. Yes No iii. The investigation does NOT involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in populations or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product. Yes No iv. The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional (HIC) SECTION VI: RESEARCH INVOLVING DRUGS, BIOLOGICS, PLACEBOS AND DEVICES

 review and with the requirements for informed consent of the FDA regulations (21 CFR Part 50 and 21 CFR Part 56). Yes No v. The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements regarding promotion and charging for investigational drugs. Yes No  Exempt Category 2 (all items i, ii, and iii must be checked to grant a category 2 exemption)  i. The clinical investigation is for an in vitro diagnostic biological product that involves one or more of the following (check all that apply): Blood groupi[INVESTIGATOR_812818]-human globulin  ii. The diagnostic test is intended to be used in a diagnostic procedure that confirms the diagnosis made by [CONTACT_20904], medically established, diagnostic product or procedure; and  iii. The diagnostic test is shipped in compliance with 21 CFR §312.160.  Exempt Category 3  The drug is intended solely for tests in vitro or in laboratory research animals if shipped in accordance with 21 CFR 312.60  Exempt Category 4  A clinical investigation involving use of a placebo if the investigation does not otherwise require submission of an IND.  2. Background Information: Provide a description of previous human use, known risks, and data addressing dosage(s), interval(s), route(s) of administration, and any other factors that might influence risks. If this is the first time this drug is being administered to humans, include relevant data on animal models.  Varenicline has been used extensively in humans. It is an approved treatment for smoking cessation, and will be used at the approved dosage of [ADDRESS_1125558] common side effects include nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, constipation, flatulence, and/or vomiting. Less frequent side effects may include dry mouth, dyspepsia, sleep disorder, anxiety, headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nightmare, dysgeusia, somnolence, lethargy, rhinorrhea, dyspnoea, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_812819], rash, pruritis, increased/decreased appetite, diarrhea, gingivitis, chest pain, influenza like illness, edema (swelling), thirst, abnormal liver function tests, increased weight, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia (muscle pain), disturbance in attention, dizziness, sensory disturbance, anxiety, depression, emotional disorder, irritability, restlessness, polyuria (increased urination), menstrual disorder, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (nosebleed), respi[INVESTIGATOR_17744], hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hot flush, hypertension (high blood pressure). The safety of varenicline during pregnancy has not been established. 
33 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/[ADDRESS_1125559] been reports of agitation, hostility, depressed mood, changes in behavior and thinking, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior related to varenicline (Chantix). We will monitor patients for these symptoms, and ask them to contact [CONTACT_812846] (Chantix) if they experience any of them.  There have been reports of angioedema [swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, gums), extremities, and neck] and infrequent reports of life-threatening angioedema requiring emergency medical care due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_812820] (Chantix). There have been reports of rare but serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme (symptoms include a blistering rash and peeling skin). Patients will be advised to discontinue varenicline (Chantix) and immediately seek medical care if they experience either of these reactions.  There have also been reports of traffic accidents, near-miss accidents in traffic, or accidental injuries in patients taking varenicline (Chantix). In some cases patients reported somnolence, loss of consciousness or difficulty concentrating that resulted in impairment or concern about impairment in driving or operating machinery. We will advise patients to use caution driving or operating machinery or engaging in other potentially hazardous activities until they know how varenicline (Chantix) affects them.  In a review of a study of 700 patients with documented stable cardiovascular disease (other than or in addition to hypertension) diagnosed at least 2 months prior to the screening visit (120), the FDA noted that varenicline was associated with more cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, nonfatal heart attack, need for coronary revascularization, new or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812821]) than placebo (121). The differences were small. A recent meta-analysis of studies of patients without known cardiovascular disease(122) also found that the rate of serious cardiovascular events was higher among the patients who received varenicline (1.06% compared to the clients who received placebo (0.82) although the rate was low in both groups. Varenicline more than doubled the smoking quit rate in these studies compared to placebo. The FDA concludes that the absolute risk of cardiovascular adverse events with Chantix, in relation to its efficacy, is small 123). All participants will receive a physical examination and, if clinically warranted, an EKG, will be required to be medically stable, and will be advised of this risk in the consent form.  As the safety of varenicline has not been established in pregnant and nursing women, they will be excluded from participation. A urine pregnancy test will be performed at baseline and monthly during treatment. Tests will be administered at the next assessment point for all menstruating female participants who miss the pregnancy test at their prior appointment. In addition, a menstrual cycle timeline is completed at each appointment during treatment, and if their menses is late, a urine pregnancy test will be obtained. Pregnant women will be referred for other treatment.  The use of this medication with heavy drinking smokers is experimental with regard to alcohol consumption. Varenicline is approved for smoking cessation and many smokers are heavy drinkers. Alcohol use while taking varenicline is not contraindicated according to the product information for the drug.  On March 9, 2015, the FDA updated the label for varenicline to include potential alcohol interaction, rare risk of seizures, and studies of side effects on mood, behavior, or thinking. This update includes evidence of patients who drank alcohol during treatment with varenicline experiencing decreased tolerance to alcohol, including increased drunkenness, unusual or

  b) Is the device provided free of charge to subjects? Yes No  5. What is the PI’s assessment of risk level (significant or non-significant) associated with the use of the device?  Significant Risk (SR) Device Study: A study of a device that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a participant and 1) is intended as an implant; 2) is used in supporting or sustaining human life; or otherwise prevents impairment of human health; 3) is of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, or otherwise prevents impairment of human health; or 4) otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a participant.  Significant Risk Devices require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) issued by [CONTACT_1622]. What is the IDE number assigned by [CONTACT_1622]? Did the FDA approve this IDE as Category A (experimental/investigational) or as Category B (non-experimental/investigational)? Who holds the IDE? Non-Significant Risk (NSR) Device Study: A study of a device that does not meet the definition for a significant risk device and does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of participants. Note that if the HIC concurs with this determination, an IDE is not required.  6. Abbreviated IDE or Exempt IDE: There are abbreviated requirements for an IDE and there also are exemptions to the requirement for an IDE. See the criteria in the HIC Application Instructions, Section VI.B.4 at  http://ycci.yale.edu/comply/Images/[ZIP_CODE]-FM.A_NewStudyRequest_tcm426-[ZIP_CODE].pdf to determine if these pertain to this study.  Abbreviated IDE or Exempt IDE – If criteria set forth in the HIC Application Instructions are met, copy and paste the completed relevant section from the Instructions into this application.  7. Investigational device accountability: a. State how the PI, or named designee, ensures that an investigational device is used only in accordance with the research protocol approved by [CONTACT_20907], and maintains control of the investigational device as follows: Maintains appropriate records, including receipt of shipment, inventory at the site, dispensation or use by [CONTACT_20908], and final disposition and/or the return of the investigational device (or other disposal if applicable): Documents pertinent information assigned to the investigational device (e.g., date, quantity, batch or serial number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_22429], and unique code number):

In our experience, very few individuals present in person to inquire about the study and complete the pre-screening process. During the phone screening process, individuals provide verbal consent. The collection of PHI is limited to information that is necessary to confirm basic eligibility such as age. If an individual is not eligible, no other PHI or contact [CONTACT_100587]. If an individual meets pre-screening eligibility and would like to schedule an in-person screening appointment, his/her name [CONTACT_812862]. This information is obtained in order to identify the individual on the day of screening (i.e., potential participants need to provide valid identification at intake) and to provide the individual with a reminder call the day before the appointment. It would not be practical to have potential participants provide signed authorization at the time of recruitment over the phone. It presents an extra hurdle and potential waste of time for potential individuals when inquiring about the study. This system provides a more efficient method for pre-screening individuals and ensuring that the majority of individuals who are scheduled for an in-person intake appointment are likely to be eligible.  Potential participants may first contact [CONTACT_812850]. During the webscreening process, participants are not permitted to advance to the screening survey until they select the “yes” option agreeing that they have read and understood the disclaimer. The collection of PHI is limited to information that is necessary to confirm basic eligibility such as age, information to contact [CONTACT_812851] (the latter is optional, the former is not), and IP address. Once the participant’s eligibility has been reviewed and they have been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], their webscreener entry will be deleted.

42 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 1. Consent Personnel: List the names of all members of the research team who will be obtaining consent/assent.  Initial consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_812852], however, one of the study investigators will meet with the participant to review the consent document prior to final determination of eligibility, and at the beginning of any study procedures beyond those needed for determining eligibility. Obtaining consent will be: Lisa Fucito, Susan Neveu, Denise Romano, Christine Nogueira, Tess Hanrahan, and Abedalrazaq Alkukhun.  2. Process of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will be obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure subjects’ independent decision-making.  The entire consent form will be reviewed in detail with the participant in a private, one-on-one setting at the first intake appointment. All risks and potential benefits will be described. Any questions the participant may have will be addressed. If the participant wishes, they may take the consent form home and consider it further before signing. They may also request to speak to anyone on the research team about questions they have or to consult others, including their physician and family members. Once the participant has signed the consent, they may withdraw consent at any time. Informed consent must be obtained prior to performance of any protocol specific procedures. For all participants, the advanced practice nurse or study physician will review the risks of the study medication at intake.  2. Evaluation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the personnel obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the research being proposed.  We will not be enrolling participants with limited decision-making capacity. We plan to exclude individuals with current serious psychiatric or medical illnesses. During the consenting process, the research assistant will read and review the consent form with the prospective participant. The research assistant will then ask the potential participant various questions about the consent form and study protocol to ensure the prospective participant sufficiently understands the study and the nature of their consent to participate.  3. Documentation of Consent/Assent: Specify the documents that will be used during the consent/assent process. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_25156], in the same format that they will be given to subjects.  The adult compound consent/HIPAA form will be used and is appended for your review.  4. Non-English Speaking Subjects: Explain provisions in place to ensure comprehension for research involving non-English speaking subjects. Translated copi[INVESTIGATOR_22431].  This project will not enroll non-English speaking participants.

We will monitor patients for these symptoms, and ask them to contact [CONTACT_812846] (Chantix) if they experience any of them. A recent review of neuropsychiatric events across 17 placebo-controlled trials of varenicline for smoking cessation demonstrated that varenicline increased risk of nausea but did not increase the risk for suicidal events, depression, or aggression/agitation (141). The study concluded that varenicline has substantial benefit for smoking cessation without evidence of risk of serious psychiatric events among individuals with and without a recent psychiatric history.  There have been reports of angioedema [swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, gums), extremities, and neck] and infrequent reports of life-threatening angioedema requiring emergency medical care due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_812820] (Chantix). There have been reports of rare but serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Erythema Multiforme (symptoms include a blistering rash and peeling skin). Patients will be advised to discontinue varenicline (Chantix) and immediately seek medical care if they experience either of these reactions.  There have also been reports of traffic accidents, near-miss accidents in traffic, or accidental injuries in patients taking varenicline (Chantix). In some cases patients reported somnolence, loss of consciousness or difficulty concentrating that resulted in impairment or concern about impairment in driving or operating machinery. We will advise patients to use caution driving or operating machinery or engaging in other potentially hazardous activities until they know how varenicline (Chantix) affects them.  There have been reports of seizures in patients taking varenicline (Chantix) with and without a prior seizure history. We will warn patients about these risks. We currently exclude individuals who have ever experienced a seizure. Patients will be advised to discontinue varenicline and immediately seek medical care if they experience this reaction.  There have been reports of reduced tolerance to alcohol in patients taking varenicline (Chantix). In some cases, patients reported increased intoxication, unusual or aggressive behavior, or an inability to remember things that had happened. We will warn patients about these risks and encourage participants to be careful about their alcohol intake until they know how varenicline affects them.  In post-marketing, the FDA identified 48 cases of adverse events involving decreased tolerance to alcohol (n=11) or aggressive behavior (n=37) in patients taking Chantix and who also consumed alcohol that occurred since Chantix (varenicline) was approved in 2006. The Chantix label has been updated with the warning that some people have reported increased drunkenness, unusual or sometimes aggressive behavior, or memory loss of events while consuming alcohol during treatment with varenicline. As a result, we will advise participants of this potential and instruct them to decrease their drinking and contact [CONTACT_812853].  There may be a small increase in cardiovascular events associated with varenicline (Chantix) compared to placebo. In a review of a study of 700 patients with documented stable cardiovascular disease (other than or in addition to hypertension) diagnosed at least 2 months prior to the screening visit (120) the FDA noted that varenicline was associated with more cardiovascular events (e.g., chest pain, nonfatal heart attack, need for coronary

 revascularization, new or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812821]) than placebo (121). The differences were small. A recent meta-analysis of studies of patients without known cardiovascular disease (122) also found that the rate of serious cardiovascular events was higher among the patients who received varenicline (1.06% compared to the clients who received placebo (0.82) although the rate was low in both groups. Varenicline more than doubled the smoking quit rate in these studies compared to placebo. The FDA concludes that the absolute risk of cardiovascular adverse events with Chantix, in relation to its efficacy, is small (123). All participants will receive a physical examination and, if over the age of 40 or if clinically warranted, an EKG to determine eligibility. Individuals with clinically significant, unstable cardiovascular disease/uncontrolled hypertension will be excluded. Consistent with guidance from the FDA, we will advise individuals of this risk and to discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical attention if they experience any of the following symptoms: Shortness of breath, Chest pain or New or worse pain in legs when walking.  Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from this study since this medication may have harmful consequences to the baby. We also ask that you use a reliable form of birth control during the study. Acceptable methods of birth control include  abstinence,  the  birth  control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], intrauterine device, injection of Depo-Provera, Norplant, tubal ligation, and barrier methods such as condoms or the diaphragm in combination with a spermicide. Female participants of childbearing potential will be informed to alert study staff in the event that they change from their birth control plans, or if despi[INVESTIGATOR_812823], think they may be pregnant. A urine pregnancy test will be done at baseline and then monthly during treatment. A positive pregnancy test will result in the participant being excluded from the study. In this case, we will provide the participant with a referral for other treatment.  Research assessments are all noninvasive, and should add no risk. The major disadvantages are the time taken to complete them and possible breach of confidentiality. Our past experience with these measures indicates that they are acceptable to subjects. Careful efforts aimed at maintaining confidentiality will be made. This is described in detail below.  Breath tests and urine collections should add no risks other than those normally associated with these procedures. We will draw approximately 4 ounces of blood over the entire course of the study; 3 ounces each at intake and Weeks 2 or 3 (pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103]), between [ADDRESS_1125564] common risks to providing blood samples are the potential for bruising at the site, brief pain, and, rarely, infection. A rare risk is also fainting.  2. Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized. Effective screening will exclude all subjects who would be at greater risk for complications because of unstable medical or psychiatric illnesses. Subjects will be seen regularly and will be monitored for any adverse reactions. Participants will be advised that there have been reports of agitation, hostility, depressed mood, changes in behavior and thinking, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior related to varenicline (Chantix). We will monitor them for these symptoms and ask that they contact [CONTACT_812846] (Chantix) if they experience any of them. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale will continue to be administered weekly to assess suicidal ideation and behavior. Subjects will be advised to discontinue varenicline (Chantix) and immediately seek medical care if they experience either angioedema or serious skin reactions. We will advise participants to use caution driving or operating machinery or engaging in other potentially hazardous activities until they know how varenicline (Chantix) affects them.

Given the uncertain effects of nicotine patch during pregnancy, the following precautions will be taken for women: 1) urine pregnancy tests will be performed at intake and pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from participation and referred to other smoking cessation programs; 2) women must agree to use a reliable method of birth control while they are in the study and to alert the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_341266], in spi[INVESTIGATOR_136305], she thinks she might be pregnant; 3) a urine pregnancy test will be performed again at Week 0 (before starting varenicline) and Weeks 4; if a woman becomes pregnant, she will be withdrawn from the study and referred to alternative treatments; 4) a menstrual cycle timeline will be completed at each appointment during treatment, and if the woman’s menses is late, a urine pregnancy test will be obtained.  All efforts will be made to protect subjects’ confidentiality. This is described in detail below.  3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, page 24.  a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this study?  We view the use of varenicline and counseling for smoking among heavy drinking smokers to represent moderate risk to subjects.  b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the children participating in this study?  Not applicable  c. Copy, paste, and then tailor an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan from http://www.yale.edu/hrpp/forms-templates/biomedical.html for i. Minimal risk ii.

The pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_812824]-label studies of an FDA-approved smoking cessation medication that is not contraindicated for this population/./As it it not a Phase III trial, the safety of the patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_812854], Dr. O’Malley, the study nurse practitioner Denise Romano, APRN, and the Study Physician Srinivas Muvvala, MD, during Dr. O’Malley’s weekly Clinical Trials meeting in which study participants are reviewed and monitored.  Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first- hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:  Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study procedures / design by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fucito according to the following categories: a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational agent/participation. b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational agent/participation. c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational agent/participation. d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational agent/participation. e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational agent/participation.  The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study: 1 Mild adverse event 2 Moderate adverse event 3 Severe unanticipated adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; [ADDRESS_1125567]. Fucito will determine whether the adverse event meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).

Subjects will be closely monitored for treatment response and safety through regular assessment sessions; these will include breath alcohol screens and assessment of psychiatric status. Although in our experience this is a very rare event in behavioral trials and trials of the nicotine transdermal patch, subjects who show significant deterioration (e.g., increased substance use or psychiatric symptoms that cannot be managed within the protocol, including significant suicidal or homicidal ideation) will be regarded as symptomatic failures, withdrawn from the treatment arm of the study, and referred for appropriate treatment (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a more intensive level of care). The independent evaluator (study physician) will make the final determination as to whether a subject should be withdrawn from the treatment arm of the study. At the time of withdrawal, endpoint ratings will be made which include the full termination assessment battery. Subjects in all conditions are also able to call the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit (i.e., the clinic location for the trial) on-call clinician at any time should questions or concerns arise; emergency services are available through SATU and the Connecticut Mental Health Center.  Subjects who experience a significant psychiatric or medical problem requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25155]. In general, most SAEs will result in inpatient care and thus a transfer from our outpatient research clinic at SATU. [CONTACT_450110] is experienced with these procedures as a clinician at SATU and has worked out similar procedures to be followed for this trial.  The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_450110], will report the following types of adverse events to the Yale University Human Investigation Committee (HIC) and the NIAAA Project Office (Joanne Fertig, Ph.D.): a) serious AND unanticipated AND possibly, probably or definitely related events; b) anticipated adverse events occurring with a greater frequency than expected; and c) other unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others.  These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported to the both the Yale HIC and NIAAA within [ADDRESS_1125569]. Fucito. The procedures for SAE reporting include written documentation using the clinical notes related to the adverse event and specific forms detailing the event with a sign-off by [CONTACT_370552]. Communication of recommendations and decisions from all parties (Yale Human Investigation Committee) will be made back to [CONTACT_450110] in a timely manner.  The DSM plan must indicate that an annual report will be submitted to the NIAAA Project Officer summarizing all adverse events. The Yale Human Investigation Committee requires yearly reporting of all SAEs (including those that are anticipated and unrelated). This annual report will also be submitted to the NIAAA Project Officer (Joanne Fertig, Ph.D.).  The DSM plan must specify that female subjects who are pregnant, nursing, or not using effective methods of birth control will be excluded from studies involving the administration of alcohol and/or drugs.

  Given the uncertain effects of varenicline use during pregnancy, the following precautions will be taken for female subjects: 1) urine pregnancy tests will be performed at intake and pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from participation and referred to other smoking cessation and alcohol treatment programs; 2) women must agree to use a reliable method of birth control while they are in the study and to alert [CONTACT_450110] and/or study staff if she departs from her birth control plans or if, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_136305], she thinks she might be pregnant; 3) a urine pregnancy test will be performed again at the visit before starting varenicline; if a woman becomes pregnant, she will be withdrawn from the study and referred to alternative treatments; 4) a menstrual cycle timeline will be completed at each appointment during treatment, and if the woman’s menses is late, a urine pregnancy test will be obtained.  If the study has a follow-up phase, there must be a specific plan for referral to treatment during follow-up of any respondent requiring additional intervention due to significantly increased alcohol consumption or serious psychiatric/medical symptoms.  The same procedures for monitoring subjects for potential serious adverse events and/or the need for additional treatment will be used during the research follow-up phase including the regular use of breath alcohol screens and assessment of psychiatric status.  Subjects who show significant deterioration (e.g., increased substance use or psychiatric symptoms including significant suicidal or homicidal ideation) will be referred for appropriate treatment (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a more intensive level of care) in consultation with the study physician.

52 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 A Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism/Department of Health and Human Services has been obtained. This certificate protects the confidentiality of all research records generated by [CONTACT_15365]. Individually identifiable health information will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. All research personnel will be trained on HIC and HIPAA procedures.  h. Are any of the study procedures likely to yield information subject to mandatory reporting requirements? (e.g. HIV testing – reporting of communicable diseases; parent interview -incidents of child abuse, elderly abuse, etc.). Please verify to whom such instances will need to be reported.  All information collected will remain confidential except when we are legally required to disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a child or elderly person, threats of harm to self or others, and threats of harm to property. Subjects will be informed of this limit to confidentiality as it is stated in the informed consent document.   Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk benefit assessment.)  There is a need to improve smoking cessation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The purpose of this study is to determine the overall effectiveness of a combined psychotherapy intervention for smoking and alcohol for improving smoking quit rates and drinking outcomes in heavy-drinking smokers. By [CONTACT_812855] (i.e., alcohol use), this study may help to engage more smokers into treatment and reduce the enormous health care costs and loss of lives associated with cigarette smoking.   1. Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?  Alternatives to treatment in this study are current approved over the counter smoking cessation treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy. Participants may get prescriptions from their physicians for bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the nicotine nasal spray, or the nicotine inhaler; however they may not use these devices while participating in this research study. Study drugs will not be available once participants complete this study. Alternative alcohol treatments include other pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_812825].  2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation. SECTION X: POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
SECTION XI: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS 
53 Version 12 APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 7/10/2018 VALID THROUGH 7/16/2019  
 For Phase 1 focus groups, participants will be paid $10 for attending the intake appointment and $50 for completing the focus group session.  For Phase 2 (pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]), participants will be paid $10 for attending the intake and research appointments (8 total) for a total of $90.  For Phase 3 (RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]) participants will be paid $10 for attending an intake session, $10 for each research appointment (up to 12 total), and $20 for each research follow-up sessions (2 total) for a total of up to $170 per participant.  3. Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost to subjects.  Participants will not be charged for experimental aspects of the treatment. Participants who are treated outside of the Tobacco Treatment Service will receive free counseling and free varenicline. Their insurance will not be billed for their treatment. For participants treated through the Tobacco Treatment Service, standard counseling and varenicline costs will be billed to their insurance. Depending upon insurance coverage, there may be a co-pay for these visits. Assistance by [CONTACT_812856]/or co-pay if requested. The nicotine replacement products will be provided free of charge.  If subjects chose to continue counseling and/ or varenicline beyond the treatment portion of the study, these costs will not be covered by [CONTACT_812857].  4. In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk. a. Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? c. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? d. Who will pay for this treatment? e. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]?  If a participant is injured as a direct result of participation in this study, treatment will be provided. The participant and/or his or her insurance carrier will be expected to pay the costs of this treatment. No additional financial compensation for injury or lost wages is available. Participants will not waive their legal rights by [CONTACT_4907].  If immediate information is needed about the study, participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_812858]. Fucito.

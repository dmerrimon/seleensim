Study Title
Phase 1/2 Study to Determine the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Single Agent 
CC-122 and the Combinations of CC-122 and Ibrutinib and CC-122 and Obinutuzumab in 
Subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Objectives
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into  Phase 1 has been discontinued. Subjects 
already enrolled who are receiving clinical bene fit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_380598] a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122.
Primary Objectives
!Determine the safety of single agent CC-122 in subjects with relapsed/refractory 
(R/R) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)
!Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of CC-122 and 
ibrutinib and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination in 
ibrutinib naïve CLL/SLL subjects
!Determine the safety and tolerabilit y of the combination of CC-122 and 
obinutuzumab and determine the RP2D of the combination in subjects with R/R
CLL/SLL
Secondary Objectives
!Characterize CC-122 pharmacokinetics (PK) in subjects with CLL and assess 
potential drug-drug interactions when CC-122 is given in combination with ibrutinib  
or obinutuzumab
!Determine ibrutinib plasma concentrations when given alone or in combination with CC-122
!Determine the preliminary efficacy of single agent CC-122, the combination of 
CC-122 and ibrutinib, and the combination of CC-122 and obinutuzumab

Study Design
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into 
Phase 1 has been discontinued. Phase 2 will 
not proceed.  
CC-122-CLL-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose finding study to determine the 
safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 administered orally to subjects with CLL/SLL.
The following will be evaluated:
!Arm A:  CC-122 single agent
!Arm B:  CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib
!Arm C:   CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab
The Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1) will be comprised of an intrasub ject dose escalation cohort 
for single agent CC-122 (Arm A) in paralle l with ascending fixed-dose cohorts of the 
combinations of CC-122 and ibrutinib (Arm B) and CC-122 and obinutuzumab (Arm C) 
evaluated using a 3 + 3 design to determine the not tolerated dose (NTD) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
Up to approximately [ADDRESS_476584] dose escalation cohort in 
Arm A and three to six subjects will be evaluated in each fixed-dose cohort in Arms B and C; 
therefore, approximately 68 (46-92) subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in Phase 1.  The final 
number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels tested and the number of dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) obs erved within each cohort. 
For Arm A, subjects will receive a starting dos e of 1.[ADDRESS_476585] tolerability at the discretion of the investigator.  For Arms B and C, a safety review committee (SRC) whose members include the sponsor’s medical monitor, drug safety physician, and a subset of investigators, will determine a preliminary RP2D 
for each combination treatment arm based on an integrated assessment of the safety, available 
PK and pharmacodynamic data, and preliminary efficacy information.  For the fixed-dose cohorts, the SRC will make the recommendation of whether to open the next dose cohort and the 
incremental increase in dose (ie, 0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review of the safety data of the current dose 
cohort (after full enrollment and completion of the DLT evaluation period).  The 1.[ADDRESS_476586] dose escalation cohort per each

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: [ADDRESS_476587] 
dose escalation up to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg.
If in the event higher doses of CC-122 are shown to be safe in other hematologic malignancies in ongoing CC-122 studies, the maximum dose of 4.0 mg may be increased after approval by [CONTACT_12217].
Once the RP2D is established for Arms B and C, an expansion cohort per arm may be opened in 
the Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 2) to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib and/or CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab:
Arm B (CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib) (N = 50):
!Expansion Cohort 1:  Subjects who are ibrutinib-naïve and have high-risk CLL
(see Section 7.2)
oTreatment-naïve (TN) CLL (N = 10) 
oR/R CLL (N = 40)
Arm C (CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab) (N = 40):
!Expansion Cohort 2:  CLL subjects who are B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor 
(BCR PI) or venetoclax failures (see Section 7.2)
In total, approximately 90 subjects are anticipated to enroll in the Dose Expansion Phase.
All active subjects who are receiving clinical bene fit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_380599] a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122, or un til 
disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, 
whichever is earlier.  Subjects who achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (in both 
peripheral blood and bone marrow) lasting for a minimum of [ADDRESS_476588] the 
option to discontinue study treatment; study treatment in these subjects may be resumed at the 
time of MRD positivity (Section 4.1for additional details).
Study Population
The study population consists of Dose Escalatio n Phase (Phase 1) subjects who were enrolled 
under previous amendments and were ongoing during Amendment 6, dated 06 Jun 2017. As of 
05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued and Phase 2 will not 
proceed.  
Eligible subjects include those with CLL/SLL requiring treatment as defined by [CONTACT_380622] (IWCLL) Guidelines for the 
Diagnosis and Treatment of CLL  
For Arms A and C, subjects must have received at least one prior treatment which must include 
chemoimmunotherapy or an approved Bruton’s tyro sine kinase (BTK) inhibitor unless co-
morbidity or contraindication precludes such a therapy.  
For Arm B, subjects must not have received prior i brutinib treatment (ie, ibrutinib naïve) or any 
BTK inhibitor.  During the Expansion Phase, s ubjects must also possess high-risk features.  
Please refer to Section 7.2for additional details regarding st udy population for each treatment
arm.

Treatment, and Follow-up.  
During the Screening Phase, lasting up to [ADDRESS_476590](s) [IP(s)] at a predetermined dose and schedule until 
the underlying CLL/SLL has progressed or the subject has discontinued IP treatment for 
unacceptable toxicity or other reasons.  
Subjects enrolled as of [ADDRESS_476591] dose of IP.  All subjects discontinued for any reason other than progressive disease, 
withdrawal of consent, or death, will be contact[CONTACT_457] 90 days following the date of the 28-day follow-up visit for information regarding the status of their disease and for the type and start date 
for any subsequent anticancer therapy.  Effica cy assessments (including clinical, laboratory tests, 
and CT scans as indicated in the Tables of Events, Table 3 through Table 5 ) will continue until 
documented PD or initiation of subsequent anti-CLL therapy.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary, and/or exploratory analysis, as  pre-specified in the protocol and/or the

4.1. Study Design
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued.  Phase 2 will 
not proceed.  
CC-122-CLL-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose finding study to determine the 
safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 administered orally to subjects with CLL/SLL.  The following will be evaluated:
!Arm A:  CC-122 single agent
!Arm B:  CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib
!Arm C:   CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab  
The Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1) will be comprised of an intrasub ject dose escalation cohort 
for single agent CC-122 (Arm A) in parallel with ascending fixed-dose cohorts of the 
combinations of CC-122 and ibrutinib (Arm B) and CC-122 and obinutuzumab (Arm C) 
evaluated using a 3 + [ADDRESS_476606] dose escalation cohort in 
Arm A and three to six subjects will be evaluated in each fixed-dose cohort in Arms B and C; 
therefore, approximately 68 (46-92) subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in Phase 1.  The final number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels tested and the number of DLTs
observed within each cohort. 
For Arm A, subjects will receive a starting dos e of 1.[ADDRESS_476607] tolerability at the discretion of the investigator.  For Arms 
B and C, an SRC whose members include the sponsor’s medical monitor, drug safety physician, 
and a subset of investigators, will determine a preliminary RP2D for each combination treatment arm based on an integrated assessment of the safety, available PK and pharmacodynamic data, 
and preliminary efficacy information. For the fixed-dose cohorts, the SRC will make the 
recommendation of whether to open the next dose cohort and the incremental increase in dose(ie, 0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review of the safety data of the current dose cohort (after full enrollment 
and completion of the DLT evaluation period).  The 1.[ADDRESS_476608] 
dose escalation up to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg.
If in the event higher doses of CC-122 are shown to be safe in other hematologic malignancies in 
ongoing CC-122 studies, the maximum dose of 4.0 mg may be increased after approval by [CONTACT_12217].
Once the RP2D is established for Arms B and C, an  expansion cohort per arm may be opened in 
the Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 2) to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-122 in 
combination with ibrutinib and/or CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab:

Dose Escalation Phase:
As of [ADDRESS_476612] dose escalation cohort for single 
agent CC-122 (Arm A) in parallel with ascending fixed-dose cohorts of the combinations of 
CC-122 and ibrutinib (Arm B), and CC-122 and obinutuzumab (Arm C), evaluated using a 3 + 3 design:
Arm A (CC-122 single agent):
An intrasubject dose escalation cohort of CC-[ADDRESS_476613] ’s tolerability (ie, escalation to the next dose 
level requires no DLT or dose reduction at the c urrent dose level in a ddition to meeting the 
criteria outlined in Section 8.2.8 ).  
However, dose escalation per cycle is not mandatory  if the subject is be nefiting (ie, objective 
evidence of disease response based on absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] reduction or shrinkage 
in measurable lesions required) from their current dose in the absence of significant toxicities.
Subjects who are enrolled to fixed dose cohorts (0.25 mg or 0.5 mg) in Arm A under earlier protocol amendments (ie, protocol amendment 3 or 4) will be allowed to undertake intrasubject 
dose escalations as described above.

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 40 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: [ADDRESS_476614] agents has been demonstrated to be 
safe in the context of this trial.  These subjects will receive a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122
(including prior CC-122 monotherapy). The dose of CC-122 may need  to be decreased to the 
level that has been shown to be safe in Arms B or C per the SRC (ie, < 2 DLTs/6 subjects).  Subsequent intrasubject escalation is allowed if higher doses of CC-[ADDRESS_476615] enrolled in Arm A 
prior to IRB/EC approval of Amendment 5 after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.
CC-122 will be administered starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 on a 5/7-day schedule (5 continuous days 
out of 7 days per week) up to a maximum of 24 cycles, or until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever is earlier. Each cycle 
consists of 28 days.
Subjects will be observed for early DLTs in Cycle 1 (DLT evaluation peri od). Monit oring for 
late toxicities necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations will be conducted during
Cycles 2 through 6. 
Arm B (CC-122 + ibrutinib):
The following arm will be evaluated in parallel to Arm A:Ascending fixed-dose cohorts of CC-[ADDRESS_476616], in comb ination with ibrutinib  will be evaluated.  After completion of the 
0.5 and 1.0 mg fixed-dose cohorts, subsequent c ohorts will be allowed to escalate in either 0.5 
mg or 1.0 mg increments.  Escalation to the next dose level requires 0/3 or ≤1/6 DLTs at the 
current dose level. Further, an escalation increment of 1.0 mg requires the absence of any Grade 
3 drug related non-hematologic AEs, any Grade 4 hematological event, and TLS or TFR of any 
grade at the current dose level.  The SRC will make the recommendation of whether to open the next dose cohort and the incremental increase in dose (0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review of the safety 
data of the current dose cohort (after full enrollment and completion of the DLT evaluation
period).  
CC-122 will be initiated on Cycle 2 Day 1 and admin istered on a 5/7-day schedule.  Ibrutinib 
will be administered QD starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 (see Section 8.2for Treatment Description, 
Administration and Schedule).  CC-[ADDRESS_476617] surpassed the 24 
cycles of CC-122, Celgene will continue to provi de an additional 3 cycles of ibrutinib from the 
investigational supply to allow time for patients to be switched to commercially available ibrutinib and/or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_380602].  Subjects will be observed for early DLTs for 28 days following the initiation of CC-122 combination therapy 
(Cycle 2 Days 1 through 28) (DLT evaluation period).  Monitoring for late toxicities 
necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations will be conducted during the first 6 cycles of combination treatment.

Confidential and Propri etary 41 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Arm C (CC-122 + obinutuzumab):
The following arm will be evaluated in parallel to Arms A and B:
Ascending fixed-doses cohorts of CC-[ADDRESS_476618], in combination with obinutuzumab will be evaluated.  After completion of the 0.5 and 1.0 mg fixed-dose cohorts, subsequent cohorts will be allowed to 
escalate in either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg increments.  Es calation to the next dose level requires 0/3 or 
≤1/6 DLTs at the current dose level. Further, an escalation in crement of 1.0 mg requires the 
absence of any Grade 3 drug related non-hematologic AEs, any Grade 4 hematological event, and TLS or TFR of any grade at the current dose level.  The SRC will make the recommendation 
of whether to open the next dose cohort and th e incremental increase (0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review 
of the safety data of the current dose cohort (after full enrollment and completion of the DLT 
evaluation period).
CC-122 will be initiated on Cycle 1 Day 9 and adminis tered on a 5/7-day schedule.  For subjects 
on Arm C, Cycle [ADDRESS_476619] of 29 days to accommodate the 5/7-day schedule;  
subsequent cycles will consist of 28 days.  Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously on 
Cycle 1 Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 (see Section 8.2for Treatment Description, Administration and 
Schedule).  The dose of obinutuzumab on Day [ADDRESS_476620] 
surpassed the 24 cycles of CC-122, Celgene will continue to provide an additional 3 cycles of 
CC-122 to allow t ime for patients to be switched to commercially available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_380603].  
Subjects will be observed for early DLTs for 28 days following initiation of CC-122 combination 
therapy (Cycle 1 Day 9 through Cycle 2 Day 8) (DLT evaluation period).  Monitoring for late toxicities necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations will be conducted during Cycles [ADDRESS_476621] Dose Escalation Cohort in Arm A:
Up to approximately [ADDRESS_476622] dose 
escalation schedule for CC-122.  
If > 20% (eg, > 4 of 20) of subjects meet the criteria for DLT within [ADDRESS_476623] dose escalation to that dose level will be permitted.
Early DLT Evaluation for Fixed-Dose Cohorts in Arms B and C:
An initial 3 subjects will be enrolled to each of the fixed-dose escalation cohorts in Arms B and
C.  A dose level will be considered tolerable if 0 of 3 treated subjects experiences a DLT during 
the DLT evaluation period of each respective group.  If 1 of 3 subjects experiences a DLT, 3 
additional subjects will be enro lled to that dose level.  A dose w ill be considered the NTD when 
≥2 out of 6 evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT.  If DLTs are observed in ≥2 out of

review of safety data by [CONTACT_12217] (see Section 8.2.1 ).
After full enrollment and completion of the D LT evaluation period of each dose level, the 
number and type of DLTs and AEs occurring during the DLT evaluation period will be evaluated.  A dose level will be considered tolerated after discussion of these data by [CONTACT_12217].  
Subsequent dose cohorts will only be authorized to open for enrollment following a consensus by 
[CONTACT_12217].  Subjects enrolled in lower CC-[ADDRESS_476625] been enrolled and < [ADDRESS_476626] experienced a DLT at that dose level.
An intermediate dose (ie, one between the NTD and the last dose level before the NTD) or 
additional subjects within any dose cohort may be  added to determine the MTD and RP2D more 
precisely.
Monitoring for Late Toxicities During the Dose Escalation Phase:
Continuous safety monitoring will continue for all cohorts for late toxicities necessitating dose 
reduction or discontinuation.  If at any time during the first 6 cycles of CC-122 treatment > 20% 
of subjects experience a late toxicity necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation that is clearly not related to disease progressi on, medical proce dure, or interc urrent illness, the dose 
level will have been considered to exceed the MTD and the RP2D will be selected at a lower dose level.  The SRC will be responsible for moni toring these late toxicities and will make the 
determination that the limit of 20% has been exceeded.
Determination of RP2D:
The SRC will identify a preliminary RP2D for Arms B and C based on an integrated assessment 
of the safety, available PK and pharmacodynamic data, and preliminary efficacy 
information.CC-122 data available from other clinical studies will also be considered by [CONTACT_163257].  
The RP2D selected will not exceed the MTD from the dose escalation cohorts.  
Expansion Phase:
As of 05 Jul 2018, Phase 2 will not proceed.
An expansion cohort may be e nrolled at each RP 2D for Arms B and C for a total of up to 2
expansion cohorts.  
During the Expansion Phase of the study, the SRC will continue to review safety data regularly 
and make recommendations about the study con tinuation as appropriate.  The SRC will monitor 
for early DLTs (first cycle of CC-122 dosing during CC-122 combination therapy) and will 
monitor for late toxicities necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations that are clearly not 
related to disease progre ssion, med ical procedure, or intercurrent illness th rough completion of
the first 6 cycles of CC-122 treatmen t in the expansion cohorts.  If at any time the early DLT rate 
exceeds 20% or the late toxicity rate exceeds 33%, enrollment to that expansion cohort will be

that cohort at a lower dose level that has been shown to be tolerated during the dose escalation 
portion of the study.
The expansion cohorts will be conducted with  a futility inter im analysis for each cohort as 
outlined in Section 10.3.1.
Follow-up Phase:
The Follow-up Phase will begin at study treatment discontinuation.  Subjects will have a visit at 
the end of treatment as soon as possible once IP has been discontinued and at [ADDRESS_476627] experiences disease progression,

Confidential and Propri etary 60 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul [ZIP_CODE]. PROCEDURES
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued, and Phase 2 
will not proceed. Subjects already enrolled who are receiving clinical benefit in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_380604] e study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles 
of CC-122.
The screening period begins on the date the Informed Consent Document (ICD) is signed and 
will last for up to [ADDRESS_476649] of care assessments performed prior to signing the ICD(as described in the protocol) may be used for this study, assuming they meet the protocol 
requirements and following discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  Recording of 
AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin once the sub ject has signed the ICD.  All prior 
anticancer treatments (eg, chemotherapy, surgeries) and medical history, including approximate 
dates of treatment or diagnosis, must be recorded during screening. 
All study-required procedures should be performed as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_476650] is assigned:
Table Arm
Table 3 Arm A:  CC-[ADDRESS_476651] dose escalation
Table 4 Arm B:  CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib
Table 5 Arm C:  CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab
As of Protocol Amendment 7, some clinic visits and assessments may be omitted as noted in
Table 3 through Table 5 , and in Section 6.6 below.
Excursions from the timing of assessments will be considered protocol deviations and should be recorded in the source document along with the reason for the excursion. 
All scheduled laboratory assessments are to be performed at the designated central laboratory.
However, local laboratories may be used for the biweekly assessments (Days 8 and 22) during 
the third cycle of CC-[ADDRESS_476652] cycle of CC-122 (ie, Cycle 1 in Arms A and C) and (Cycle 2 in Arm B)  and unscheduled 
assessments performed as needed.
6.1. Safety Assessments
Study safety evaluations will occur in accordance with Table 3 through Table 5 , and should be 
performed in accordance with this section of the protocol.  The safety of CC-122 single agent 

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 61 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018and CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib a nd in combination with obinutuzumab will be 
assessed using AEs, physical examinations (PEs), concomitant medications and procedures, 
clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electro cardiograms (ECGs), and an echocardiogram/multi-
gated acquisition scan (MUGA).
Detailed procedures for obtaining each assessment are provided below.  
6.1.1. Demographics / Medical History / Baseline Stage and Prognostic Classification
Demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and date of birth), medical history, and the Cumulative 
Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) Score ( Appendix G ) will be documented by a qualified clinician at 
the time of the Screening visit.  The medical history will be general enough to document common comorbid conditions as well as specif ic enough to reveal any conditions listed as 
participation exclusion criteria, and will documen t whether the identified conditions are active or 
inactive at the time of enrollment.  The CIRS score will be collected to assess the performance status and fitness of subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prognostic Classification
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia-specific internati onal prognostic classificat ion reflecting the 
subject’s status at the time of enrollment will be documented 
 
 
 
 
 
6.1.2. Adverse EventsAll subjects will be evaluated for AEs during all scheduled visits starting at the signing of the 
ICD until [ADDRESS_476653] dose of study treatment. 

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 62 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: [ADDRESS_476654] 12 cycles of CC-122, in the absence of Grade ≥ 2 adverse events related to
CC-122, and as clinically indicated, some clinic visits and assessments may become less frequent 
as detailed in Section 6.6.
6.1.4. Physical Examination
Complete PEs, including evaluation of lymph nodes, spleen and liver will be performed during 
Screening, on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will continue to be performed on Day 1 of each subsequent 
treatment cycle under Protocol Amendment 7 as part of the assessment for response (in the 
absence of imaging), at the EOT visit and at [ADDRESS_476655] IP discontinuation.  
Measurements of lymph nodes and documentation of any enlargement of the spleen and/or liver 
should be recorded in the source document and eCRF.
Symptom driven limited PEs will be performed as clinically indicated at any study visit.
6.1.5. Cardiac Laboratory Testing
Subjects will undergo laboratory monitoring of plasma troponin-T and B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP) to evaluate for potential early evidence of cardiac toxicity.  Testing will be performed at 
Screening, weekly during the first cycle of CC-[ADDRESS_476656] cycle of each dose 
escalation (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), Day 1 of each s ubsequent cycle, and at the EOT visit.  A 
significant elevation of troponin-T is defined as a value greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the assay with associated elevation of BNP or other significant cardiac symptoms or findings.  A significant elevation of BNP is defined as a ≥20% increase over baseline with an 
absolute value > 100 pg/mL.  Subjects who are found at Screening to have baseline troponin-T > ULN or BNP > 100 pg/mL must have a baseline evaluation by a cardiologist during screening to optimize cardioprotective therapy.
After the first 12 cycles of CC-122, in the absence of Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_476657] 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at the visits listed in Table 3 through 
Table 5 .  The 12-lead ECGs (12-lead at 25 mm/sec reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, 
PR-interval, QRS complex, QT interval, and QTc interval) will be performed after the subject 
has been in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes.

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 63 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Triplicate ECGs (3 recordings within 2±1 minute intervals) will be performed at Screening for 
all subjects.  In additi on, triplicate ECGs will be collected as follows:
Arm A: Cycle 1 Day 1:  0 and 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after CC-122 dosing
Arm B: Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 and 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after ibrutinib dosing
Cycle 2 Day 1:  0 and 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after CC-122 dosing
Cycle 2 Day 15: 0 and 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after CC-122 dosing
Arm C: Cycle 1 Day 1:  0 and 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after obinutuzumab dosing
Cycle 1 Day 9 and Cycle 1 Day 23:  0 and 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after CC-122
dosing
A single ECG will be performed on all other visits where an ECG is indicated per Table 3
through Table 5 approximately 1.5 hours (±15 minutes) after dosing.
After the first 12 cycles of CC-122, in the absence of Grade ≥ 2 adverse events related to
CC-122, and as clinically indicated, some clinic visits and assessments may become less frequent 
as detailed in Section 6.6.
6.1.7. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) MUGA, or echocardiogram (ECHO) will be conducted 
at Screening, after the first cycle of CC-122, and e very 3 cycles thereafter (± 7 days), and at the 
EOT if not performed within the previous [ADDRESS_476658] 12 cycles of CC-122, in the absence of Grade ≥ 2 adverse events related to
CC-122, and as clinically indicated, some clinic visits and assessments may become less frequent 
as detailed in Section 6.6.
6.1.8. Clinical Laboratory Tests
The following laboratory assessments w ill be pe rformed at the Screening visit and during the 
study at the time points as described in Table 3 through Table 5 .  All samples will be analyzed at 
a central laboratory unless otherwise specified.  All samples should be drawn predose unless 
otherwise specified.  Laboratory assessments will be recorded in the source document and eCRF: 
!Amylase, lipase, fasting lipid profile, creatine kinase, thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), free T4 (FT4), immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA only), T-cell subsets

vitreous 
Subsequent ophthalmologic examinations will be pe rformed as clinically indicated.  If there are 
any clinically significant findings, a full ophthalmologic exam will be conducted by a qualified ophthalmologist. 
6.1.13. Contraceptive and Risk Counseling
Subjects will be counseled about appropriate contraception during Screening.  Complete 
abstinence or double contraceptive methods (one of which must be a barrier method) for females 
(eg, oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; intra-uterine device; barrier 
contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) must be used from the time ICF is signed, throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_476661] dose of CC-122.  A single 
contraceptive method for males (complete abstin ence or a condom) must be used from the time 
the ICF is signed, throughout the study, and for [ADDRESS_476662] dose of CC-122.  Counseling should be documented in source documents.
The CC-122 Pregnancy Risk Minimization Plan for Celgene Clinical Trials ( Appendix F ) applies 
to all subjects receiving CC-122 therapy and will be given to sites as a separate document. 
CC-122 will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare professional (including but not limited 
to nurses, pharmacists and physicians). These healthcare professionals will be trained by 
[CONTACT_27718], or designee, in requirements  specific to counseling of subjects.  
Once trained, these healthcare staff will counsel subjects prior to the administration of CC-[ADDRESS_476663], should not handle or 
administer CC-122 unless they are wearing gloves. 
Arm C:  Females of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during 
obinutuzumab treatment and for 18 months following obinutuzumab therapy ( GAZYVA , 
GAZYVARO ).
Arm B:  Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking 
ibrutinib because ibrutinib can cause fetal harm ( IMBRUVICA ).
6.1.14. Pregnancy Test
A female of child bearing potential (FCBP) is defined as a sexually mature woman who has: 
1. Not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, and 
2. Not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule 
out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any 
time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: [ADDRESS_476664] be recorded in the eCRF and 
the source document.  Pregnancy testing will be conducted by [CONTACT_12082].
For a FCBP, pregnancy testing will be conducted at the visits listed in Table 3 through Table 5 :
!A serum pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL is to be obtained at 
Screening.  
!A serum or urine pregnancy test (based on investigator’s discretion and minimum test 
sensitivity [25 mIU/mL]) s hould be done weekly for the first cycle, within 72 hours 
prior to Day 1 of every cycle (with the ex ception of the first day of CC-[ADDRESS_476665] dose), EOT visit and [ADDRESS_476666] IP discontinuation.  
!The subject may not receive IP until the investigator has verified the Screening pregnancy tests to be negative.
!A FCBP must avoid activities that could lead to conception for [ADDRESS_476667] dose of CC-122.
!Please refer to the ibrutinib and the obinutuzumab  PI(s) or SmPC(s) for additional recommendations.
Note: FCBP receiving CC-122 will undergo pregnancy testing according to the schedule 
described in the CC-122 Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan (PPRMP) and CC-[ADDRESS_476668] scan is mandatory at Screening (neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis), and after the first 6 cycles of CC-122 dosing [the 2ndscan is mandatory only for the 
affected regions with abnormal findings at baseline; Week 25 (for subjects on Arms A and C) or 
Week 29 (for subjects on Arm B), +4 weeks/-1 week], and is recommended if the subject 
discontinues study treatment due to an advers e event (if the subject shows signs of preliminary 
efficacy).  Additional CT scan(s) is allowed if clinically indicated until documented disease 
progression or initiation of subsequent CLL therapy.  The unscheduled CT scan(s) should be 
documented in the CRF.  A CT scan with contrast is the recommended imaging modality.  MRI may be used only if CT with contrast is medically contraindicated or if the frequency of CT 
scans exceeds local standards.  Standard of care CT scans or MRI performed up to 56 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be acceptable for Screening, even if performed prior to signing the ICD.  All imaging assessments will be evaluated by a reader at the local institution.

pleted according to the updated IWCLL guidelines for 
the diagnosis and treatment of CLL as described in Appendix A with modifications.  Subjects 
with SLL will be assessed according to the lymphoma guidelines as described in Appendix B .  
Lymph node responses will be assessed separately and independently of increases in blood 
lymphocyte counts.  
Efficacy response according to the respective criteria for CLL/SLL will be formally assessed at 
the same schedule as CT scans and at the End of Treatment visit.  In addition, efficacy 
assessment should also be performed every 3 cycles (+4 weeks/-1 week) during the first two 
years and every 6 cycles (+4 weeks/-1 week) thereafter at the time of physical examinations until documented progression or initiation of subsequent  CLL therapy.  CR/CRi confirmation by [CONTACT_380625] [ADDRESS_476674] been met.

8.1. Description of Investigational Products
8.1.1. CC-122
Celgene Corporation will supply CC-122 in appropr iate strengths.  The active pharmaceutical 
ingredient in capsules (AIC) was employed from the beginning of the current study 
(non-formulated, white opaque gelatin capsules). There are no other excipi[INVESTIGATOR_380610]. 
During the course of the current study, a new formulation, Formulation 6 [F6] of CC-122 is 
being developed at various strengths (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 3.5 mg, 4.0 mg) to be made available over the course of the study. The F6 formulations have different 
CC-[ADDRESS_476691] single-dose crossover study in healthy adult sub jects to evaluate the PK of CC-122 
after administration of formulated (test formulations: Formulation 4 [F4] and F6) and AIC 
CC-122 capsules.
Following a single oral administration of CC-122 at the dose level of 3 mg from reference AIC 
formulation and formulated capsule F-6 formu lation in healthy adult subjects (N=18), the total 
plasma exposures (AUC
inf) is 16.29% higher and the peak plasma exposure (C max) is 35.58% 
higher from the F-6 formulation as compared to  that from the reference AIC formulation. The 
CC-122 F-6 formulation has been selected for further development ( Data on File, 2015 ).
For subjects on Arm A, subjects who start with AIC will continue to receive AIC; subjects who 
start with F6 will continue to receive F6 for all dose levels.
For subjects on Arms B and C, F6 will be introduced in the 1.0 mg cohorts after the 0.5 mg AIC 
fixed-dose cohort has been completed, and will continue to receive F6 thereafter. The 0.5 mg 
fixed dose cohorts will use AIC.  Any subjects requiring doses of 0.25 mg or lower due to dose 
reductions will use AIC.
The formulated capsules will be provided in reddish brown gelatin capsules and contain the 
following excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: Avicel PH 102, spray dried ma nnitol, crospovidone, areosil, and stearic 
acid.
Celgene will continue to provide up to 24 cycles of CC-122 for ongoing patients experiencing 
clinical benefit.

8.2.9. Dose Interruptions/Modifications
Dose modifications are permitted in any cycle, including Cycle 1 and the DLT evaluation period:
!Dose reductions that occur during the D LT evaluation period will constitute a DLT, 
but subjects will be allowed to continue on IP at a reduced dose.  
!Dose reductions are allowed for CC-122 and ibrutinib.  No dose reduction is allowed 
for obinutuzumab, but treatment may be discontinued at the discretion of the 
investigator for severe in fusion or allergic reactions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. General Dose Modification Guidelines
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity, with the exception of tumor flare (NCI CTCAE version 3.0), 
 and laboratory abnormalities  as reco mmended by [CONTACT_380632]:

other IP will require discussion and agreement between the sponsor’s st udy medical monitor and 
the investigator.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Modification Guidelines 
Any IP-related toxicity meeting the definition of DLT will require dose reduction or interruption.  
The criteria for dose reduction are listed in Table 14, should be used for dose modifications.  
Chronic Grade 2 toxicity (other than specified b elow) may warrant dose reduction or interruption
of one or both IP.  Such cases should be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor before 
changes are made.  
Dose modification decisions for patients with cytopenia (below the lower limit of the normal 
range) at baseline will be based on the IWCLL guideline ( Table 13). For patients with a normal
neutrophil count, platelet count and/or hemoglobin value at baseline, the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) w ill be used.
Any dose modifications must be recorded on the respective Study Drug Record eCRF.

Cardiac Laboratory Abnormalities
In addition to routine ECG monitoring in all treatment arms, additional monitoring for potential 
cardiac toxicity is included for subjects treated with CC-122.  This in cludes routine monitoring 
of troponin-T and BNP as well as more intensive monitoring of ECGs and LVEF as described in 
Section 6.  Elevations of troponin-T or BNP warrant further investigation including assessment 
of the subject for signs and symptoms of cardiac injury, consideration of a cardiology 
consultation, other cardiac evaluations (such as an exercise stress test, additional evaluation of 
LVEF, or other cardiac tests recommended by a cardiologist), and the addition of cardioprotective therapy (eg, beta blockers) as appropriate.  Laboratory evaluation to assess for 
assay interference may also be warranted.  Isolated asymptomatic elevations of troponin-T or 
BNP without associated ECG or LVEF changes or other cardiac findings do not require that

elevation of BNP (20% increase from baseline with an absolute value > 100 pg/mL) or 
associated cardiac symptoms or findings, CC-122 dosing should be held and the sponsor should 
be notified.  Additional cardiac monitori ng should be performed as described in Table 14 and as 
medically indicated. CC-122 may be restarted at th e same dose or a reduced dose, in consultation 
with the sponsor, based on troponin-T/BNP guidelines in Table 14 and general guidelines 
provided in Section 6. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Pneumonitis
Pneumonitis has been observed in patients taking CC-122. The diagnosis should be considered in 
subjects presenting with non-specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_036], pleural 
effusion, cough, dy spnea, or interstitial pulmonary infiltr ates, and in whom infectious, neoplastic 
and other causes are excluded by [CONTACT_287465]. Subjects should be specificallyadvised to report promptly any new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_380617].

(Grade 1) symptoms may continue CC-[ADDRESS_476716] AEs While Receiving Obinutuzumab
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)
Two-thirds of patients experienced IRRs with the first infusion of obinutuzumab; reactions can 
also occur with subsequent infusions, but the frequency is lower ( GAZYVA , GAZYVARO ).
Infusion reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_380618] 24 hours of receiving obinutuzumab. Symptoms may 
include anaphylaxis, acute life-threatening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], hypotension, tachycardia, 
dyspnea, bronchospasms, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, and laryngeal edema. Additional 
potential symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, flushing, skin rash, 
urticaria, headache, pyrexia, and chills.
To minimize the potential for these reactions, premedication is administered as described in 
Section 9.3.3 . Full emergency resuscitatio n facilities should be immediately available in the 
event of a severe and life-threatening infus ion reaction and subjects should be under close 
supervision of the investigator or appropriately trained staff during the infusions. Medical

using glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], oxygen, intravenous fluids and other medications as 
medically indicated.  Subsequent infusions  should be administered with appropriate 
premedications as in Section 9.3.3 .
Subjects with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary c onditions should be monitored more frequently 
throughout the infusion and after the infusion. Hypotension may occur and investigators should 
consider withholding antihypertensive agents (for subjects not at risk for hypertensive crisis) for 12 hours prior to, during the infusion, and for 1 hour after the infusion until blood pressure is 
stable. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
John Cunningham (JC) virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML), which can be fatal, has been observed in patients treated with obinutuzumab. Subjects 
with new onset or changes to pre-existing neur ologic manifestations shoul d be evaluated for 
PML. The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary depending on the affected region of 
the brain. Motor symptoms with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_380619] (eg, mu scular weakness, paralysis, 
and sensory disturbances), sensory abnormalities, cer ebellar symptoms, and visual field defects 
are common. Some signs/symptoms regarded as “cortical” (eg, aphasia or visual-spatial disorientation) may occur. Evaluation  of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a 
neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture  
Obinutuzumab and CC-[ADDRESS_476718] for the evaluation and treatment of PML.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia, and Anemia
 
  
 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia,  including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring 
within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab. Fatal 
hemorrhagic events have also been reported in Cycle 1 in patients treated with obinutuzumab(GAZYVA , GAZYVARO ). A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic 
events has not been established. Subjects should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle. Regular laborat ory tests should be performed until the event 
resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening 
thrombocytopenia. Transfusion of blood products (ie, platelet transfusion) according to 
institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician. Use of all concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events such as platelet 
inhibitors and anticoagulants, s hould also be taken into consideration, especially during the first 
cycle. 
Hematopoietic growth fact ors or other hematologic support, such  as erythropoiet in, darbepoetin, 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF), RBC- or platelet- transfusions are allowed in the study with therapeutic intent.

Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in patients receiving obinutuzumab 
(GAZYVA , GAZYVARO ) mainly in NHL. Monitor patients with GI involvement for GI 
perforation.
8.2.11. Management of Select AEs While Receiving Ibrutinib
Fatal bleeding events have occurred in  patients treated with ibrutinib ( IMBRUVICA ). Grade 3 or 
higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and post 
procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, 
including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA .  The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.  IMBRUVICA
may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least [ADDRESS_476719]-
surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.
Inform subjects of the possibility of bleeding, and re port any signs or symptoms (bl ood in stools 
or urine, prolonged or uncontrolled bleeding). Inform the subject that IMBRUVICA may need to 
be interrupted for medical or dental procedures. Subjects should be closely monit ored for hemorrhagic events. Regular laboratory tests should be 
performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in the event of ≥Grade 
2 hemorrhage ( Table 14). Transfusion of blood products (ie, RBC- or pl atelet- transfusions) 
according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician.
For any subjects receiving ibrutinib (Arm B), major hemorrhages as defined in Section 11.[ADDRESS_476720] be reported on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form using the “Important Medical Event” as the seriousness criteria and sent via email 
or fax to Celgene and/or designee, within 24 hours of awareness (see Section 11.5.1 ).

8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued.
Assignment of subjects to Arms A, B, or C will be based on current open dose levels, investigator choice, and available slots.
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to track subject assignments to the 
treatment arms and dose levels.
8.4. Packaging and Labeling
The label(s) for IP will include sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695] (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or re gulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local 
regulations.
8.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal
The investigator(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP received and comparing it with the accompanying IP shippi[INVESTIGATOR_27582].  The investigator(s) will verify the 
accuracy of the information on the form to register the IP received at the site and retain a copy of the form in the study f ile.
At the study site, all investigational IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent 
unauthorized access.  The IP should be stored as directed on the package label.
Celgene (or designee) will review with the inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process 
for Investigational Product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the 
site versus Celgene (or designee).
8.6. Investigational Product Compliance
Subjects will return all IP at the Day [ADDRESS_476724] miss no more th an 5 scheduled doses of IP during the DLT 
evaluation period (eg, forget to take or lose their IP; or if discontinued early due to progressive 
disease) to be considered evaluable for DLT, unless the missed doses were due to IP-related AE(s), in which case they remain evaluable for DLT.  During subsequent cycles, a subject will 
be considered compliant with each IP and overall if the IPs taken are ≥80% to ≤120% of the 
assigned dosage.  IP accountability will be evaluated on Day 1 of each cycle; full and/or partial 
bottles may be re-dispensed once IP accountability has been performed.

10.1. Overview
The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent 
CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination 
with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subj ects with CLL/SLL.  The secondary 
objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122  in combination with 
ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab , to determine ibrutinib concentrations when 
given alone and in combination with CC-122, and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 
at selected dose levels/regimens.

single agent CC-[ADDRESS_476728] populations at the preliminary RP2D in the Expansion Phase.  
10.3.1. Expansion Cohorts
As of 05 Jul 2018, Phase 2 will not proceed.The sample size of 50 subjects/cohort for Expansion Cohort 1 and 40 subjects/cohort for 
Expansion Cohort [ADDRESS_476729] adequate power for 
hypothesis testing.  Rather it is to provide additi onal efficacy and safety  information beyond the 
limited number of subjects in th e Dose Escalation Phase. To re duce the risk that subjects 
exposure to less efficient IP, a fu tility interim analysis w ill be conducted for each expansion 
cohort.
Estimates of expected response rate were calculated for each patient population to be evaluated 
in the expansion cohorts based on currently available published data, when available:
!Arm B, Expansion Cohort 1, will evaluate  subjects with high risk CLL (n=10 for TN 
CLL, n=40 for R/R CLL). A design with fu tility interim will be app lied to both TN 
(n=10) and R/R CLL cohorts (n=40).  An estimated ORR of 97% (including both PR and PRL) and CR of 12% is projected for single agent ibrutinib in TN CLL with 17p-
/TP53 mutation ( Farooqui, 2015).  An estimated ORR of 60% is projected based on
single agent ibrutinib data in R/R high risk CLL.  Four studies with ibrutinib in 17p-
/TP53 mutation positive R/R CLL reported response rates ranging from 40% to 71% 
(Pollyea, 2014; IMBRUVICA ; Preetesh, 2015; Farooqui, 2015 ).  The total number of 
responders was divided by [CONTACT_380634] 60%  for this cohort.
!Arm C, Expansion Cohort 2, will evaluate patients who are resistant to or intolerant 
of prior ibrutinib/idelalisib/venetoclax or alternate BTK or PI3K inhibitors.  Limited 
data is available on the response of patients post-treatment failure with ibrutinib and 
idelalisib. One st udy reported 25% to 76% response rates with kinase inhibitors 
(idelalisib or ibrutinib if not previously experienced) or non-kinase inhibitors (anti-CD20 antibody, chemotherapy, BCL-2 inhibitor, etc) in patients who were resistant or 
intolerant of idelalisib or ibrutinib ( Mato, 2015), therefore an ORR of 50% is 
projected for this cohort.
Based on the above assumptions, a design with a futility interim analysis w ill be applied in the 
expansion cohorts:

as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive

of any or all of the following parameter s:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_380640] i nformed consent 
until [ADDRESS_476737] dose of IP and those SAEs made known to the investigator at any time 
thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.  Adverse Events and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All
SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropri ate met hod, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.  
Additionally, for any subject receiving obinutuzumab, the site will simultaneously send the SAE 
Report Form to Celgene and Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] within the same timeframe and method.
11.1.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of safety 
monitoring activities by [CONTACT_1034].

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 116 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 201811.1.1.1. Major Hemorrhage (Arm B)
For any subjects receiving ibrutinib (Arm B), major hemorrhages as defined below are 
considered adverse events of special interest and must be reported on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form using the “Important Medical Even t” as the seriousness criteria and sent via email 
or fax to Celgene and/or designee, within 24 hours of awareness (see Section 11.5.1 ).
Major hemorrhage is defined as any of the following: 
!Any treatment-emergent hemorrhagic adverse events of Grade 3 or higher* 
!Any treatment-emergent serious adverse events of bleeding of any grade
!Any treatment-emergent central nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of red blood cells should be reported as a Grade 3 
or higher AE per CTCAE.
 
 
 
 
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24600] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 117 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72612] a complicatio n of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not asso ciated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/d isease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27590] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication re mains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition unrelated to the studied indication. 
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide infor mation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severity / intensity of the event. The severity / intensity of AEs will be gra ded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the CTCAE Version 4.03 with the exception of TFR (NCI 
CTCAE version 3.0),  and laboratory abnormaliti es as recommended by [CONTACT_380641] / intensity according to 
the following scale:

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 118 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_244502]
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IPadministration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP 
and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassesse d and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_27765].
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 119 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 201811.2.5. Action Taken
The investigator will report the action taken with IP  as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
The investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the 
SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE and reported if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study; or
!requires treatment, modification/ interrup tion of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_20603], regardless of the severity. 
Grade 3/4 laboratory  abnormalities will be reported as adverse events independent of associated 
signs or symptoms, if it requires treatment, modification or interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention, or results in discont inuation from the study. The associated signs and 
symptoms will be considered as additional event terms and graded according to their own 
criteria.
Regardless of severity grade, la boratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to 
be documented as a serious adverse event.  
Note: If a laboratory abnormality is one component  of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the 
abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be 
recorded as the AE. If possible, the laboratory abnorm ality s hould be recorded as a medical term 
and not simply as an abnormal laboratory result  (eg, record thrombocytopenia rather than 
decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events.
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
The following are considered immediately reportable events:
!Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is 
on study drugs, or within at least [ADDRESS_476738]’s last dose of CC-122.

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 120 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018!Pregnancies of female subjects occurring wh ile the subject is on study drug, or within 
at least [ADDRESS_476739]’s last dose of obinutuzumab.  
IP is to be discontinued immedia tely and the sub ject instructed to return any unused portion of 
the IP to the investigator as applicable.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celg ene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other 
appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The exposure of any pregnant female (eg, caregiver or pharmacist) to CC-[ADDRESS_476740] 
notify Celgene Drug Safety imme diately about the ou tcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg,  spontaneous abortion), the investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If  the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_476741] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
[CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
Additionally, for any subject receiving obinutuzumab, the site will simultaneously send the SAE 
Report Form to Celgene and Hoffmann-La Roc he within the same timeframe and method.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP 
should notify the investigator, and the pregnant  female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately.  
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow-up reports.
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs in formed consent until [ADDRESS_476742] dose of IP) or any 
SAE made known to the investigator at any time thereaf ter that are suspected of being related to 
IP.  Serious AEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.

investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, 
and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions. 
The investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has de legated significant study-related duties.
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The investigator, or a designated member of th e investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data 
verification.  The investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries.

including the date.  The original informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_380643]’s entry into the
study, must be maintained in the investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  
In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the informed consent document must be revised.  St udy subjects participating in the study when the 
amended protocol is implemented must be re-conse nted with the revised version of the informed 
consent document.  The revised informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_380644]’s 
study files and a copy given to the study subject.  
14.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protecti on against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy an y medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain 
such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_380645]/medical monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.

operating procedures.
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Document Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an investigator meeting.  Prior to e nrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_27738].
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_1755]/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their  proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of th is unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The investigator is required to permit direct acce ss to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs, regulatory au thorities (eg, FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The invest igator should make every effort to be available 
for the audits and/or inspections.  If the investigator is contact[CONTACT_137832], he/she should contact [CONTACT_27740].

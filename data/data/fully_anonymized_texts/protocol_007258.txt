CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis 
Title:   A Randomized Withdrawal Double-b lind Study of Etanercept Monotherapy Compared to 
Methotrexate Monotherapy for Maintenance of Remission in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis   
Study Phase:   Phase 3 
Indication:  Rheumatoid Arthritis  (RA) 
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the eff icacy  of etanercept monotherapy compared to 
methotrexate monotherapy on maintenance of remission in subjects with RA who were on 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy .  
Secondary Objective(s):   
• To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept plus methotrexate therapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy on maintenance of remission 
• To evaluate the eff icacy  of 1) etanercept monotherapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy and 2) etanercept plus methotrexate therapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy on:  
o disease activity  
o disease worsening and time to disease worsening  
o remission and time to recapture remission after rescue treatment  
Hypothes is:  Etanercept  monotherapy  is superior to methotrexate monotherapy for maintaining 
remission in subjects with RA who were on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy .  
Primary Endpoint:  S implified Disease Activity Index (SDAI ) remission (≤ 3.3) at week 48 
Secondary Endpoints:   
• SDAI  score and change from baseline at all measured timepoint s 
• Disease activity score (28 joint) calculated using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate formula (DAS- 28-ESR) and change from baseline at all measured timepoints  
• Disease activity score (28 joint) using the C -reactive protein formula ( DAS-28-CRP ) and 
change from baseline at all measured timepoints  
• Clinical Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) and change from baseline at all measured timepoints  
• SDAI remission (≤ 3.3)  at all measured timepoints  
• Boolean remission at all measured timepoints  
• Disease worsening defined as an SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ [ADDRESS_207381] 
2 weeks apart or SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more separate visits or S DAI > 11 after 
randomization 
• Time to disease worsening defined as an SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ [ADDRESS_207382] 2 weeks apart or SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more separate visits or 
SDAI  >  11 after randomization  
In subjects that receive rescue treatment : 
• Time to recapture SDAI remission after starting rescue treatment  
• SDAI remission at week 48 
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized withdrawal , double- blind controlled study in 
subjects with RA on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy who are in very good disease control 
for [ADDRESS_207383] of a 30- day screening period, a 24- week 
open- label run-in period, a 48- week double- blind treatment period and a 3 0-day safety follow -up 
period.  
Approximately  358 subjects will be enrolled and approximately  250 subjects will be randomly 
assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups:   etanercept 50 mg weekly by 
[CONTACT_177139] (n = 100), oral methotrexate

[CONTACT_177140] 10 to 25 mg weekly  (n = 50). 
Sample Size:   Approximately [ADDRESS_207384] Eligibility Criteria:  Subjects must be adults with a history of moderate to 
severe RA.  Subjects must be in very good RA disease control for ≥ 6 months and be in remission 
as defined by [CONTACT_177141] ≤  3.[ADDRESS_207385] be

methotrexate dose of 10 mg to 25 mg weekly and remain on a stable oral dose ≥  [ADDRESS_207389] Dosage and Administration:  Etanercept dosing in the 
planned study follows the recommended label dosing for subjects with RA.   During the run- in 
period open- label etanercept will be provided as a 50- mg pre- filled syringe for injection once 
weekly  for [ADDRESS_207390] Dosage and Administration:  Methotrexate dosing will 
be [ADDRESS_207391] Dosage and Administration:  Folic acid dosing will 
be [ADDRESS_207392] of care.  
See Section  6.3. 
Procedures:   Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any screening 
procedures are performed.  The following procedures will occur per the schedule of assessments:  
medical and medication history, physical examination, physical measures, vital  signs, adverse 
event and concomitant medication assessment, tuberculosis testing, pregnancy testing, urinalysis, and blood draw for serum chemistry, hematology, hepatitis B and C testing, CRP and biomarkers , tender and swollen joint assessment and count a nd patient reported outcomes .  For 
a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section  
7 
and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ). 
Statistical Considerations:  The primary endpoint for this study is SDAI remission (SDAI ≤ 3.3) 
at week 48.  The proportion of subjects achieving this endpoint will be compared across  treatment 
arms  using the chi -square test .  The etanercept monotherapy  treatment arm will be compared to 
the methotrexate monotherapy arm .  Both subjects who drop out and subjects receiving rescue 
therapy due to disease worsening during the double- blind period will be considered 
non-responders.  Furthermore, the randomized subjects who did not receive any dose of any of 
the investigational products will be considered non- responders in th e primary analysis.  As a 
sensitivity analysis, subjects who receive rescue therapy or drop out will have their post -rescue 
SDAI responses set to missing and a multiple imputation technique to impute these values will be 
employed . 
Summary statistics will be provided for endpoints listed in this protocol.  For categorical 
endpoints, the summary statistics contain the frequency and percentage.  For continuous 
endpoints, the summary statistics contain number of observations , mean, standard deviation, 
standard error, median, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval.  For a full description 
of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

on RA and/or subject response to etanercept .  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
RA is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that 
primarily affects the joints.  Symptoms include joint stiffness, pain, and swelling that can 
progress to deformities and loss of function of both small and large joints.  RA occurs in approximately 1% of adults worldwide in all races.  Disease onset occurs most often between the ages of 20 and 60 years, with peak occurrence at 40 to 45 years.  The prevalence of RA increases with age in both sexes, and prevalence is higher in women than men, with a ratio of approximately 2.5 to 1.0 ( Alamanos et al, 2006 ).  
2.2 Etanercept (Enbrel) Background 
Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory and immune responses.  It plays a role in the inflammatory process of 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  [ADDRESS_207412] receptors for TNF, a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein 
(p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms.  
Biological activity  of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNF receptor.  
Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind 
TNF molecules.   Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF- α and TNF -β (lymphotoxin alpha 
[LT-α]) to cell surface TNF Rs, rendering TNF biologically inactive.  
In many countries, etanercept  is indicated for the treatment of :  (1) moderately to 
severely active RA; (2)  moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis in patients aged 2 and older; (3) psoriatic arthritis; (4) active ankylosing 
spondylitis; and (5) adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis .  
Refer to the specific section of the investigational brochure or product label for additional 
information related to the phys ical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and 
formulation(s).  
2.[ADDRESS_207413] Background :  Methotrexate  
Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase and interferes with DNA synthesis, 
repair, and cellular replication.  I ts efficacy  in RA is well- established and is traditionally 
used as a first line agent for RA treatment.   Although methotrexate is effective, many 
patients continue to have active disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_177129].  Methotrexate 
can also be used in combination with other Disease M odifying Antirheumatic Drug 
(DMARD ) including etanercept.  The combination of methotrexate and etanercept for 
treatment of RA is well -established.  
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert for additional information.

(Klareskog et al , 2004 ). 
Recent studies including PRIZE ( Emery et al , 2012), PRESERVE ( Smolen et al , 2013 ), 
and DOSERA ( van Vollenhoven et al, 2013a), have characterized the role of etanercept 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  [ADDRESS_207415] patients whose disease activity worsens after drug withdrawal 
are able to return to low disease activity  (van Vollenhoven et al, 2013b). 
Other studies provide insights regarding the role of etanercept as monotherapy in the maintenance of low disease states.  In the COMET study ( Emery et al , 2010) subjects  
who achieved DAS-28 remission on combination etanercept plus methotrexate were 
randomized to continue the combination therapy or to discontinue methotrexate and be treated with etanercept alone for one year.  There was a numerically greater decrease in the percentage of subjects who maintained remission in the etanercept arm compared to 
the combination arm but the differences were relatively minor.  In the CAMEO study, 
subjects with active RA were treated for 6 months with combination etanercept plus  
methotrexate ( Pope et al , 2013 ).  After 6 months the patients were randomized to 
continue on the combination or to be treated with etanercept monotherapy for the next 18 months.  In patients who achieved low disease activity (DAS -28-ESR < 3.2) at 
month  6, the disease activity at 24 months w as similar whether they discontinued 
methotrexate or remained on combination therapy.  Combination treatment led to lower 
disease activity scores compared to etanercept monotherapy, however, in subjects with 
moderate to high disease activity at randomization (DAS -28-ESR > 3.2).  
Collectively, these studies have shown that etanercept may be required to maintain disease control and that  etanercept may be sufficient as monotherapy in maintaining 
good disease control .  Sustained disease remission with etanercept alone could 
potentially lead to a reduction in polypharmacy  and undesired side effects . 
There are some caveats to these study results that merit consideration.  In the clinical practice setting, drug reduction, whether etanercept or methotrexate , would most likely 
be considered in those patients who have been in good disease control for at least one year in duration.  The clinical trials described above, with the exception of DOSERA which was limited by [CONTACT_177142], were  designed to reduce or withdraw etanercept 
and/or methotrexate soon or just after inducing the target low disease state.  Duration of 
good disease control may be a factor that contributes to the proportion of subjects who 
maintain low disease after drug reduction.  Also, there were differences in the trials on the key low disease activity target for maintenance including DAS -[ADDRESS_207416]:  Etanercept

document for developi[INVESTIGATOR_177130] (Guidance for Industry 
Rheumatoid Arthritis:  Developi[INVESTIGATOR_177131] 2013) which 
suggested the use of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against 
Rheumatism criteria for remission.  The criteria include Simplified Disease Activity Index 
(SDAI ) remission (SDAI < 3.3) which is a more stringent measurement of remission 
compared to DAS -[ADDRESS_207417] of a 30- day screening period, a

For subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses , DNA may be extracted.  
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ens ure 
confidentiality.    
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can  do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
inflammatory conditions , the dose response and/or prediction of response to etanercept 
or methotrexate, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_207520]:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  [ADDRESS_207521]’s m edical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties , except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_21947] .  Following the request from the subject, the i nvestigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.   
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.   
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the i nvestigator , at the end o f the storage period , or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See Section 11.[ADDRESS_207522] s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their  future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subjects can decline to continue receiving investigational product and/or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33204] .  If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the 
appropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177136] t he options for 
continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) and collection of data, including 
endpoints and adverse events .  The investigator  must document the change to the 
Schedule of A ssessments  (Table 1 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_1560] ( eg, in person, by [CONTACT_21955]/mail, through family/friends, in

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.[ADDRESS_207527]’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease)  during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on- study , 
is no t considered an adverse event.  
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  [ADDRESS_207528] is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative request s to withdraw from protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33206] , refer to  Section 8.[ADDRESS_207529] 1 of the following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug -induced liver injury 
(DILI) (see Appendix  A for drug -induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that 
necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product (s).  
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198] (s)? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without c linical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequ elae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported a dverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event 
Summary CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL    After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of  the event.  Serious a dverse events reported outside of 
the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event , the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an eSAE 
Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.

Contingency Report Form .  For EDC studies  where the first notification of a Serious 
Adverse Event  is reported to [COMPANY_010] v ia the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency 
Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again 
available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization

CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2  Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analysis Set  
The primary analysis set will include all randomized subjects.  The analysis will be 
conducted according to the original randomization regardless of the actual treatment 
received during the study (as per intent -to-treat principle).  All the primary, secondary , 
and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be evaluated on the primary analysis set . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Set  
This subset will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of any investigational product during the study.   For all safety endpoints, subjects will be 
analyzed based on the actual treatment received.  
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
The following baseline covariates will be considered to assess their influence on the 
primary and secondary endpoints:  
• age (years)  (continuous)  
• sex (male/female)  
• race  
• ethni city (Hispanic or Latino vs Non- Hispanic or Latino)  
• disease duration (years)  
• baseline methotrexate dose 
• other covariates may be evaluated as necessary  
Subgroup analyses, which would be considered exploratory, may be performed if an 
examination of the above covariates suggests that any treatment difference for the 
primary and secondary endpoints  depends on any baseline covariates.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size was determined from a hypothesis of superiority of etanercept monotherapy over methotrexate monotherapy.  The proportion of subjects achieving 
SDAI remission after 52 weeks of double- blind treatment in the PRESERVE and 
COMET studies  was used to estimate the treatment effects.  PRESERVE was a 
two-period study conducted in subjects with RA who had moderate disease activity 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a stable dose of oral methotrexate for a minimum of 8 weeks at the time of 
screening.   Among all su bjects who were in SDAI remission at both week 28 and 
week  36 (the last two visits of the open -label  run-in period) , the proportion of subjects 
who were still in remission after the 52- week double- blind period was 86.1% and 38.1%

Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  [ADDRESS_207537] visit of Period 1, the proportion of subjects who were in still in remission after the 52 -week double- blind Period 2 was 
78.3% and 72.4%, respectively, for the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy treatment groups.  Given key differences noted in this study, 
including the sustained period of remission prior to withdrawal , the response rate in the 
methotrexate monotherapy arm is approximated to be higher at 50%, with the response 
rate in the etanercept monotherapy arm at approximately  72%.  It is expected that 
compared to PRESERVE, subjects in the current study will have more stable disease at the time of randomization.  Namely, s ubjects must be in very good disease control for 
[ADDRESS_207538] with 90% power, 10 0 subjects per arm are required at 
randomization.  
Using an assumed attrition rate of 3 0% in the open- label run- in period, due to exclusion 
of subjects with disease worsening during the run -in period, or other reasons , 
approximately [ADDRESS_207539] approximately 250 subjects 
randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups:  etanercept monotherapy 
(n = 100), methotrexate monotherapy (n =  100), and etanercept plus methotrexate 
combination therapy (n  = 50).  [COMPANY_010] may choose to alter the sample size of subjects 
enrolled in order to ensure that approximately [ADDRESS_207540] access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not  be 
distributed to the study team, investigators , or subjects prior to the study being formally 
unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during 
the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Sect ion 5.2 and Section 9.2.2 , and

baseline will be also summarized at all study timepoints by [CONTACT_1570].  
Proportion of subjects achieving Boolean remission will be tabulated at all study timepoints by [CONTACT_1570].   Proportion of subjects with disease worsening 
(defined as an SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ [ADDRESS_207545] 
2-weeks apart or SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more separate visits or 
SDAI > 11 after randomization) as well as  time to disease worsening will be 
evaluated.  
• In subjects that receive rescue treatment during the double- blind treatment 
period time to recaptur e of SDAI  remission after starting rescue treatment will be 
analy zed.  Additionally, the proportion of subjects  who recapture SDAI remission 
at week 48 will be summarized.

12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] may facilitate the formation 
of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate [COMPANY_010] staff,  the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to be met for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  (ICMJE ) Recommendations for 
the Conduct of Reporting, Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals , which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; (4) a greement to be accountable for all aspects o f the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions 
1, 2, 3 and 4. 
• When a large, multi center  group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institut ion, investigator , and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.

The Common Toxicity Criteria Version  4.0 is available at the following link:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications \ctc.htm  
General [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration Guidance on Hepatotoxicity 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_177138] 6.4, a Food and Drug Administr ation Guidance exists for 
drug-induced liver injury  (DILI).  This guidance is general for all investigational and 
marketed products, and is synopsized here as a reference.  It provides criteria for 
reporting, monitoring, and withholding investigational product in the event that a subject 
develops signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during a clinical trial.  
Criteria for Permanent Withholding of Investigational Product due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
Investigational product should be discontinued permanently and the subject should be 
followed for possible dru g-induced liver injury, if ALL of the criteria below are met:  
• TBL > [ADDRESS_207558] or international normalized ratio > 1.5  
• AND increased AST or ALT from the relevant baseline value as specified below:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
≤ 1.[ADDRESS_207559]  > [ADDRESS_207560]  
• AND no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is immediately 
apparent; important potential causes for abnormal AST/ALT or total bilirubin values 
include, but are not limited to the following:  
• obstructive gall bladder or bile duct disease  
• viral or alcoholic hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus, 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella)  
• progression of malignancy involving the liver (note that metastatic disease to the 
liver, by [CONTACT_5071], should not be used  as an explanation for significant AST/ALT 
elevations)  
• hypoxic or ischemic hepatopathy or congestive hepatopathy in association with significant right -sided heart failure  
• concomitant administration of other hepatotoxins, including drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, atazanavir, irinotecan) or herbal or dietary 
supplements  
• heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s syndrome); 
alpha- one antitrypsin deficiency  
• autoimmune hepatitis  
• nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or other “fatty liver disease” 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  [ADDRESS_207561] should be evaluated for drug- induced liver injury:   
• Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
Any > [ADDRESS_207562] at any time 
Any > [ADDRESS_207563] but <  [ADDRESS_207564] for ≥  2 weeks  
Any > [ADDRESS_207565] but <  [ADDRESS_207566] and unable to adhere to enhanced 
monitoring schedule  
• OR:  clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], consistent 
with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, 
vomiting, jaundice, rash or eosinophilia >  5%).  If such signs or symptoms are 
coupled with ALT  or AST elevations >  [ADDRESS_207567] should be 
withheld.  
• OR:  total bilirubin >  [ADDRESS_207568] at any time  
• OR:  alkaline phosphatase >  [ADDRESS_207569]:  Etanercept

CONFIDENTIAL    Drug -induced Liver Injur y Rep orting & Additional Assessments 
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL according to the criteria specified in Section 6.4 ([ADDRESS_207570]/ALT and 
[ADDRESS_207571] for TBL)  require the following:  
• The event is to  be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional  etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary 
to facilitate the evaluation of treatment- emergent liver abnormalities is to be 
completed and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of  hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_207572](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified above or 
who experience AST or ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_207573] are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  
Assessments that are to  be performed during this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every [ADDRESS_207574](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody (ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 (LKM1) to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:  
o Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
o Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents

hypers ensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
o Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
o Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medicines and  
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear 
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not 
already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to  
continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_207575](s) and protocol- required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concom itant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

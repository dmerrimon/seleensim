7905001 
Study Phase:   
Not Applicable  
Primary Objective (s):  
The primary efficacy objective of this study is to demonstrate that the Theranova 400 dialyzer has 
performance superiority to the Elisio -17H dialyzer in removing lambda immun oglobulin free light chains 
(λ FLCs).  
The primary safety objective of this study is to demonstrate that pe rformance of the Theranova 400 d ialyzer 
compared to the Elisio -17H dialyzer is non-inferior, in regards to maintaining pre -dialysis serum albumin.  
Secondary Objective (s): 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the pe rformance of the Theranova [ADDRESS_95513] erize monthly trends in pre -dialysis serum albumin levels.  
Study Design : 
This is a multi -center, prospective, randomized, controlled, open -label, parallel study to evaluate medically 
stable end  stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis treatm ent with either the Theranova 400 
dialyzer or the Elisio -17H dialyzer for 3 sessions weekly, over 24 weeks.  
Study Population :  
The study population consists of subject s with ESRD who have been stable and receiving hemodialysis 
(HD) therapy at least 3 time s a week for 3 months prior to enrollment. A sufficient number of patients will 
be enrolled in the study in order to randomize one hundred and sixty-six (166) patients in a 1:1 manner to 
either Theranova 400 dialyzer or the Elisio -17H dialyze r. The study will be conducted in up to thirty (30) 
study centers in the [LOCATION_003].

Theranova 400 d ialyzer, a medium cut -off dialyzer.  
Duration of Treatment:   
Up to 24 weeks.  
Efficacy Assessments : 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the Reduction Ratio (RR) of λ FLC after 24 weeks of treatment.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
• Reduction ratio of λ FLC measured on the first day of treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment.  

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 8 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment 5  2018 FEB 09  
  
 
   
  • Reduction ratio of complement factor D (CFD; MW = 27 kDa) , κ FLC (MW = 23 kDa), 
interleukin 6 (IL -6; MW = 25 kDa), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α; MW = 51 kDa), and β2-
microglobulin (MW = 11.6 kDa) measured after 4 weeks and after 24 weeks of treatment.  
• Change in pre -dialysis β2-microglobulin measured on the first day of treatment and after 24 weeks 
of treatment.  
• Kt/Vurea measured after every 4 weeks of treatment.  
Safety Assessments : 
The primary safety endpoint is the pre -dialysis serum level of albumin after 24 weeks of treatment.  
Secondary safety endpoints include:  
• Pre-dialysis serum  albumin measured on the first day of treatment and after every 4 weeks of 
treatment.  
• Pre-dialysis Factor VII (MW = 50 kDa) , Protein C (MW = 53 -62 kDa) and Factor II (MW = 72 
kDa) measured on the first day of treatment, after 4 weeks and after 24 weeks of treatment.  
• Pre-dialysis Vitamin A measured on the first day of treatment, after 4 weeks and after 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
• nPNA(nPCR)  [normalized Protein equ ivalent of Nitrogen Appearance ( normalized Protein 
Catabolic Rate)]  calculated after every 4 weeks of  treatment.  
• Change from baseline to final measure in chemistry and hematology laboratory tests.  
• Monitoring of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and Product Complaints (PCs) 
for Baxter related devices.  
Statistical Methods:   
Determination of Sample Size : 
The sample size for this study is driven by [CONTACT_87677]. The sample size calculation was 
performed using PASS procedure Non -inferiority Tests for the Difference Between Two Means. The power 
is based on a t -test with one-sided alpha level of 0.02 5 where the true difference in  means is assumed to be 
zero (0) and the non -inferiority margin is 5% . 
Pre-dialysis serum albumin was not evaluated in the previous Theranova 400 dialyzer HD study, only the 
mass (G) of albumin in the dial ysate was assessed. However, a study published in PLoS ONE did use a 
prototype of the Theranova dialyzer (MCO -CI) where in pre -dialysis albumin levels were collected after a 
month of therapy  and, based on these data, a mean and standard deviation (SD) of [ADDRESS_95514] 80% power to 
demonstrate non -inferiority of the Theranova 400 dialyzer compared to the Elisio -17H dialyzer as assessed 
by [CONTACT_094]-dialysis serum albumin with a non -inferiority margin of 5%. To allow for 15% of patients to drop 
out, a total of 166 patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with t he Theranova 400 dialyzer or 
treatment with the Elisio -17H dialyzer (i.e. 83 patients per group).  
The 5% non -inferiority margin is based on results from 2 observational studies. These studies looked at the 
association between serum albumin levels and mor tality in large US cohorts of HD and PD patients, 
respectively. In both, variations in serum albumin of +/ - 1 g/L over 6 months (corresponds to +/ - 0.1 g/dL) 
have been defined as “stable serum albumin levels”. A variation of +/ - 1 g/dL is a range with a wi dth of 2 
g/L, which is larger than 5% if applied to the reported mean baseline serum albumin levels. Therefore, a 
5% variation in serum albumin can be justified as having no clinical significance.  
 A previously conducted Theranova [ADDRESS_95515] deviation (SD) of 37.8 and 8.26. With a total sample size of 140 evaluable subjects 
as determined based on the primary safety endpoint (70 in the Theranova 400 dialyzer treatment g roup and 
70 in the Elisio -17H dialyzer treatment group), a difference of 4.56 in the λ FLC reduction ratio in favor of 
the Theranova 400 dialyzer can be detected with 90% power at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_95516] assuming equal variances. Analysis Populations:  
The Per-protocol (PP) set will include all randomized patients who have received at least three months 

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 9 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment [ADDRESS_95517] the 
primary analysis. 
The intent -to-treat full analysis (FA) set will include all randomized.  
The primary analys es will be performed on the FA set and supported by [CONTACT_87678]. All 
other analyses will be performed on the FA set unless otherwise noted.  
Primary Safety Endpoint:  
For the primary safety endpoint of pre -dialysis serum albumin after 24 weeks of treatment, let µ T denote the 
Theranova dialyzer pre -dialysis serum albumin mean and let µ R denote the Elisio -17H dialyzer pre -dialysis 
serum albumin m ean. Then the null hypothesis to demonstrate non -inferiority using a 5% margin can be 
expressed as  
Ho: µT- µR ≤ -1.765. The alternative hypothesis is expressed as Ha µT- µR > -1.765. 
An ANCOVA model with fixed effects of treatment and site and the continuous fixed covariate of bas eline 
pre-dialysis serum albumin  will be used to generate a two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
difference in treatment means (µ T- µR). If the lower bound is > -1.765 then non-inferiority will be 
demonstrated.   
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
For the primary efficacy endpoint of RR of λ FLC after [ADDRESS_95518]. If the primary safety analysis demonstrates non -
inferiority, a n ANCOVA model wi th fixed effects of treatment and site  will be used to generate a two -sided 
95% CI for the difference in treatment means (µ T- µR). If the lower bound is > 0 then superiority will be 
demonstrated.   The statistical testing of the primary efficacy endpoint of the reduction ratio (RR) of λ FLC 
after 24 weeks of treatment is contingent upon the outcome of the analysis of the primary safety endpoint 
and will only be conducted once non -inferiority could be established for the primary safety endpoint. This 
hierarchical testing approach guarantees th at the overall type 1 error is controlled at a two -sided 0.05 
significance level.  
Secondary Safety Endpoint(s):  
Pre-dialysis serum albumin:  
A Mixed-effect Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) model will be used to evaluate differences 
between treatment groups  in the change from baseline in pre -dialysis serum albumin after each four weeks 
of treatment. The model will include the fixed effect of treatment, visit ; the continuous, fixed covariate of 
baseline measur ement; and the random effect of patient.   
Pre-dialysis serum albumin will be further categorized at baseline and final measurement into 4 categories : 
<3.5, ≥3.5 -3.9, ≥4.0-4.4, ≥4.5. Shift tables will be generated to cross tabulate the number of patients within 
each category by [CONTACT_3148].  
Pre-dialysis Factor VII, Protein  C, Vitamin A , and Factor II : 
An MMRM model will be used to evaluate the difference s between treatment groups in the change from 
baseline in pre-dialysis Factor VII, Protein C , Vitamin A , and Factor II  after [ADDRESS_95519] of treatment, visit  the continuous, fixed covariate of 
baseline measurement ; and the random effect of patient.   
nPNA (nPCR): 
An MMRM model will be used to evaluate differences between treatment groups in nPNA (nPCR) 
collected after each [ADDRESS_95520] Complaints:  
The summary of A Es will include AEs that occur on the day of or after th e first study treatment. Adverse 
events will be mapped to a Primary System Organ Class ( SOC) and Preferred Term ( PT) according to 
MedDRA and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_2946], PT and treatment group. Treatment group comparability 
in the incidence rates of ad verse events will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact test.  

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 10 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment 5  2018 FEB 09  
  
 
   
  An overview (overall) summary table of all AEs will be generated that includes the total number of AEs, 
number and percentage of patient with at least one AE, number and percentage of patients with at least one 
SAE, number and percentage of patients with at least one severe AE, number and percentage of patients 
with at least one AE probably associated with study treatment, number and percentage of patients with an 
AE leading to study discontinuation and, number and percentage of patients with an AE leading to death. 
This summary table will be presented by [CONTACT_87679] (Total).  
Furthermore, separate AE summary tables will be provided by [CONTACT_87680] t o 
study withdrawal. Separate AE summary tables will be provided to show a breakdown of AEs by [CONTACT_2946], PT 
and 
a. Severity (mil d, moderate or severe)  
b. Relationship to study treatment (probably related, possibly related, unable to determine, unlikely 
related or not related). 
Study dialyzer related product complaints will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_87681].  
Chemistry and hematology:  
Mean differences between treatment groups in th e change from baseline to final measure in chemistry and 
hematology laboratory tests will be analyzed using an ANCOVA with a fixed effect of treatment and a 
fixed continuous covariate of baseline laboratory value . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  
In order to account for multiplicity, secondary efficacy analyses will be held to a hierarch ical assessment 
and performed in the order outlined below. If the first analysis results in a p -value <0.05, then formal 
testing will continue to the second analysis. If the second analysis also results in a p -value of <0.05, then 
formal testing will conti nue to the third analysis, and so on. This method of hierarchical assessment will 
continue until an analysis results in a p -value >0.05, i.e., is considered statistically insignificant. This 
hierarchical approach guarantees that the overall alpha will not exceed 0.05.

Appropriate models will be used to evaluate differences between treatmen t groups in the utilization for 
medications (i.e., Erythropoiesis -stimulating agent ( ESA), anti-hypertensives, iron).  
Interim Analysis:  
 An interim analysis will be conducted  when 60% of enrollment is compl eted. The purpose of the interim 
analysis is a blinded sample size reassessment using the approach by [CONTACT_87682] -sample standard deviation calculated from the 
pooled data across treatment groups. This blinded sample size reassessment will be carried out by [CONTACT_76691] (who otherwise is not involved in the study conduct) using the [ADDRESS_95524] been enrolled 
(assuming 15% drop out, this corresponds to 84 evaluable patients). In case the observed pooled standard 
deviation at [ADDRESS_95525] deviation of 3.7, the method will require an 
increase in overall sample siz e in order to maintain an overall power of 80%. If the observed standard 
deviation is smaller than the assumed standard deviation of 3.7, the overall sample size will be kept at 166.

  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
The incidence and preva lence of chronic kidney disease  are increasing worldwide, as is 
the number of patients pro gressing to end  stage renal disease (ESRD).  The number of 
patients with ESRD has been increasing by 5% to 8% per annum in higher -income 
countries, and by [CONTACT_87683] -income countries.1-[ADDRESS_95531] in the [LOCATION_002] of America ( [LOCATION_003]) was 370 per million 
population/year for 2014, and the prevalence of treated ESRD patients  was 2076 per 
million population for 2014. In the US A alone, there was a 1.1% increase in new ESRD 
cases and 3.8% increas e of patients treated for ESRD from [ADDRESS_95532] on 
public health.  
Without renal replacement therapy (RRT), either in the form of maintenance dialysis or 
transplantation, ESRD is fatal.  Given the limited supply of donor kidneys, dialysis 
remains the mainstay treatment  for patients with ESRD.  Although dialysis is more 
commonly used in ESRD patients requiring chronic RRT (>  30 days), it can also be used 
in clinical setti ngs of acute kidney injury . Dialysis  may be prescribed when less than 10% 
of kidney function remains a vailable. Dialysis may be started even earlier in patients with 
serious complications, such as volume overload (usually secondary to acute heart failure), 
hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or if renal failure cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_12617].  
Patients un dergoing hemodialysis ( HD) therapy receive treatments intermittently for a 
specific number of hours per session and a specific number of sessions per week. All 
extracorporeal dialytic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87655]’s 
circulatory sy stem and the circulation of this blood through a circuit . This circuit  contains 
a semi-permeable membrane within a dialyzer device to remove nitrogenous end -
products of catabolism and begin the correction of the salt, water and acid -base 
derangements assoc iated with renal failure. As dialysis treatment requires access to the 
blood circulation, a vascular access is required, which can be in the form of a fistula, 
graft or a HD catheter.  
The molecular weight (MW) range of uremic toxins, including β2-microglob ulin, free 
light chains ( FLCs), cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, is about 10 to 50 kDa. 
There is a growing body of evidence that large uremic solutes in the range of 2 0 to 50 
kDa play a significant r ole in clinical complications in dialysis pati ents.7-10 Recent 
reviews on uremic toxicity indicate that an abundance of middle molecules accumulate in  
serum leading to  uremia; many uremic toxins  are in a size above 15  kDa.11 Other 

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 15 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment [ADDRESS_95533]-translational modifications induced by [CONTACT_87684], qualify as uremic 
toxins. Emerging  evidence based on new methodology suggests that some of the 
morbidity associated with uremia is the result of the collective retention of many such 
modified proteins, suggesting a role for dialytic strategies aimed at their collective 
removal. 
While conve ntional high -flux membranes are designed to remove β2-microglobulin 
effectively, the removal of larger middle molecules is substantially less effective when 
such membranes are used in HD12 due to the rapid fall -off in diffusive clearance with 
increasing molecular size.13 Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a therapy designed to increase 
convective solute removal when conventional high -flux membranes are used, with a 
special focus on middle molecule uremic solutes .14 Hemodiafiltration  is increasingly 
practiced in Europe , and many other parts of the world outside [LOCATION_003], recently estimated 
to account for approximately 27% of hemodialysis treatments  in Europe.15 Although a n 
HDF system has been approved for use in [LOCATION_003] (K112314 , April 2012 ), its use in [LOCATION_003] is 
negligible.  
Hemodiafiltration  has shown to offer outcome benefits in large randomized controlled  
trials (RCTs). However, special equipment and large volumes of replacement fluid are 
needed to deliver HDF at a treatment dose for which outcome benefits have been 
demonstrated in RCTs. With the Theranova dialyzer , a middle molecule clearance 
equivalent to HDF therapy can be obtained without the need to use the more complex 
equipment and high volumes of replacement fluid . Replacement fluid is used in  HDF 
therapy as it addresses middle sized uremic solutes, while sparing larger sized molecules 
such as albumin . 
1.2 Benefits and Risks for the Study Population  
The risks and benefits of hemodialysis are well characterized. The same risks and 
benefits will apply to patients under going dialysis with Theranova dialyzers. During 
dialysis, toxins and beneficial molecules can be removed. Theranova dialyzers can 
remove a larger size range of molecules, therefore patients may see greater removal of 
“middle molecules”, including coagulati on factors. Studying these molecules in vivo is 
expected to complement previous in vitro investigations on single (simulated) treatment 
removal of coagulation factors by [CONTACT_87685].  
Studies of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87656], and indicate that there may be benefits to removal of the uremic

  toxins. The recent progress in dialysis treatment may improve the removal of these toxins 
and though there is insufficient evidence on reducing mortality there may be benefit s on 
patient outcomes.12 
Although t he Theranova dialyzer is known to remove more albumin per treatment than 
high-flux dialyzers, the  albumin sieving of the membrane is <1%, which is below what is 
given by [CONTACT_87686] n of protein -leaking membranes (1-3%). The average clinical 
albumin loss of 3 g per 4 h hemodialysis session16 is also at the lower end of his 
definition (2 -6 g/4 h). Increased patient mortality is correlated with lo w serum albumin 
levels, but not directly correlated with albumin loss per treatment. Human serum albumin 
homeostasis in general and in various disease states17, particularly in patients on dialysis , 
has been extensively reviewed. Although observational studies have sho wn a significant 
association between lower serum albumin level and greater risk of all -cause death, in HD 
patients as well as in peritoneal dialysis ( PD) patients recent research has led to the 
conclusion that the association between serum albumin and outc ome is principally 
mediated by [CONTACT_87687], at least in renal failure patients, there is evidence that 
plasma concentration is determined primarily by [CONTACT_87688], and 
this synthesis is decreased in inflammatory states. Al bumin is a negative acute phase 
reactant and uremic inflammation, which is common in dialysis patients, is a main 
determinant of a low serum albumin level through reduced synthesis of albumin.18,[ADDRESS_95534]

3.3 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
This multi -center, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel study is 
designed to demonstrate superiority of the Theranova 400 dialyzer compared to the 
Elisio-17H dialyzer in regards to removal of λ FLCs and safety of the Theranova 400 
dialyzer during extended use (study duration 24 weeks). The Elisio -17H dialyzer is a 
marketed, Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) cleared hemodialyzer  device with 
comparable design, membrane polymers and surface area, and performance specifications 
to the study device. The main difference between the Theranova 400 dialyzer and the 
Elisio-17H dialyzer is the larger pore size within the Theranova 400  dialyzer, which 
allows a wider range of molecul es to diffuse across the device membrane without the 
need of convection.  
Both devices will be studied in medically stable patients who require chronic 
hemodialysis therapy due to end stage renal disease. The dialysis prescriptions for the 
Theranova 400 dialyzer follow the same method as for a conventional high -flux dialyzer; 
no device -specific modifications to the dialysis prescriptions are required. Use of the 
study devices during the study treatment period is consistent with conventional, current 
institutional practice.21 
Benefits of the Theranova dialyzer products are associated with the removal of serum 
middle molecules. The removal of serum middle molecules such as λ FLCs, may be 
associated with a reduction in both patien t morbidity and mortality.22-25 Data from this 
clinical study will also be used to support the new device classification for Theranova  
dialyzer, as a new device modality that effectively reduces serum levels of middle 
molecules such as λ FLCs during individual HD treatments.  

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 21 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment [ADDRESS_95539] day of  
treatment, after 4 and after 24 weeks of treatment:  
1. Factor VII (Activates IX, X): 50,000 Da (bleeding diathesis)  
2. Protein C: 53,000 -62,000 Da (deficiency causes hypercoagulable state)  
3. Factor II: 72,000  Da (deficiency causes bleeding disorder) 
In addition, Vitamin A levels will be measured on the first day of treatment, after [ADDRESS_95540] 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_897], are well described (Factor VII deficiency , Factor II deficiency , Protein C 
deficiency), and represent different parts of the coagulation cascade. They are too large to 
be effectively removed by [CONTACT_5019] -flux hemodialysis only, but represent the higher end of 
the Theranova dialyzer removal range. Studying these molecules in vivo is also expected 
to complement previous in vitro investigations on single (simulated) treatment removal of 
coagulation factors by [CONTACT_87689]. Baxter believes that the comparison of the Theranova dialyzer cohort to the high -
flux dialysis control group will examine the significance  of changes in serum levels.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_95541] patient is treated.  
3.4 Study Duration and Dates  
Patients will undergo 3 dialysis sessions per week, for 24 weeks.  The participating 
patients should continue  with their  pre-study HD prescriptions  (in terms of treatment time, 
blood flow rate and dialysate flow rate) and prescriptions  should be kept stable 
throughout the study .

  4.4 Recruitment  
Recruitment for the study will commence after review and approval from the IRB for 
each respective study center. After the patient has received the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF) and allowed time to consider their participation in the study , inclusion and 
exclusion c riteria will be verified . Patients will be considered enrolled in the study  once 
the ICF has been signed  and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed . 
4.5 Removal of Patients from Therapy, Assessment, or Study  
Patients are considered withdrawn/prematur ely discontinued from the study if their 
participation is discontinued before completion of the required evaluations as described 
in this protocol. Patients may be withdrawn/prematurely discontinued for any of the 
following reasons:  
1. AE 
2. Inadequate dialysis based on Investigator judgement  
3. Protocol violations (i.e. the patient fails to meet protocol entry criteria or does not 
adhere to protocol requirements)  
4. Pregnancy  
5. Lost to follow -up (i.e. patient fails to return for study visits)  
6. Voluntary withdrawal (i.e. patient’s request)  
7. Termination of study  
8. Investigator’s discretion  
9. Renal transplantation  
10. Switch to PD  
11. Death 
12. Change to another dialysis center , that is not a clinical study site  
13. Missing 3 consecutive study treatments  
14. Other reason (with reason noted on the el ectronic case report form [eCRF])  
The Investigator may terminate a patient’s study participation at any time during the 
study if he/she judges it to be in the patient’s best interest. In addition, a patient may 
discontinue his or her participation any time  during the study without having to justify 
his/her decision. If a patient’s participation is discontinued, the reason(s) must be 
recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF. If a patient discontinues for any 
reason, every effort should be made to perform all of the procedures that are scheduled 

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 26 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment 5  2018 FEB 09  
  
   
  for the follow -up visit occurring at the pre -dialysis on the next treatment day. In addition, 
SAEs (related or not) and adverse device effects (ADEs), will be followed  until 
resolution or stable, includi ng following the patient after the end of the study if necessary.  
The Investigator or designee should inform their site monitor the moment any patient is 
withdrawn or  discontinued from the study , regardless of the reason(s) for withdrawal or 
discontinuatio n. 
4.6 Missed Visits  
In general, missed dialysis session visits will not be replaced. I f a patient misses a  mid-
week dialysis session, where a study treatment visit was scheduled to occur, the missed 
study visit procedures will be performed during the next mid-week dialysis session  and 
subsequent visits and follow -up visit will occur as planned. However, i f the patient fails 
to return for that mid-week dialysis session  and also misses  the subsequent  week (a third 
mid-week session) , then the patient will be term inated from the study. Study termination 
also applies if the patient misses 3 consecutive study treatments  (i.e. missing a full week 
of dialysis) . Reasons for missed visits will be capture d on the eCRF.  
5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)  
5.1.1 Study Device – Theranova 400  dialyzer 
Theranova dialyzers are indicated for treatment of chronic and acute renal failure by 
[CONTACT_2900]. This study is intended to support an indication  for extended hemodialysis to 
remove middle molecular uremic toxins.  
The membrane  used in Theranova 400 dialyzer is a blend of polyarylethersulfone  and 
polyvinylpyrrolidone . Each hollow fiber has an inner diameter of approximately 180 µm 
and a wall thickness of approximately 35 µm, the effective membrane length is 236 mm , 
with an effec tive surface area of 1.7 m2. On each end of the device the hollow fibers are 
potted in polyurethane (PUR) to isolate the blood compartment from the filtrate dialysate 
compartment. The housing and the end caps of the dialyzer are made of polycarbonate . 
Dialysis fluid and blood connectors are designed according to ISO 8637.  Theranova 400 
dialyzer is sterilized by [CONTACT_87693] , according to ISO [ZIP_CODE] -1. 
5.1.2 Study Device – Elisio-17H dialyzer 
The membrane used in t he Elisio-17H dialyzer (Polynephron™) is made of 
Polyether sulfone and Polyvinylpyrrolidone . The fiber walls are [ADDRESS_95555] an 
internal diameter of about 200 µm. The effective length is 271 mm, with an effective 
surface area of 1.7 m2. On each end of the device the hollow fibers are potted in PUR to 

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 27 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment 5  2018 FEB 09  
  
   
  isolate the blood compartment from the filtrate dialysate compartment. The housing and 
the end caps of the dialyzer are made of Polypropylene.  The Elisio-17H dialyzer is 
sterilized by [CONTACT_87694].  
Hemodialysis with an Elisio -17H hemodialyzer is indi cated for patients with acute or 
chronic renal failure when conservative therapy is judged to be inadequate. It may also be 
indicated in the treatment of patients intoxicated with poisons or drugs. It is FDA cleared 
under 510(k) K131935. 
5.2 Treatments Adminis tered 
All randomized patients will receive dialysis treatments with either Theranova 400 
dialyzer or Elisio-17H dialyzer, 3 times weekly for a period of 24 weeks.  Trained HD 
staff will administer all treatments.  
5.3 Selection and Timing for Each Patient 
Treatments will occur at sites that routinely implement high -flux dialysis. Dialysis 
prescription and management will be performed per institutional practice. All patients  
will receive  in-center HD treatments, 3 times per week for a total of 24 weeks using the 
study device which he/she has been randomized to. Actual treatment dur ation of the 
individual dialysis session will vary based on clinical requirements determined by [CONTACT_87695]. 
Hemodialysis treatment duration  per session  for each individual patient will vary based 
on clinical requirements determined by [CONTACT_737], based on the patient’s need, 
residual renal function (via estimated Gl omerular Filtrations Rate ), access function, 
tolerance to HD and other relevant factors. The participating patients’ HD prescriptions 
should be kept stable throughout the study; any changes to the prescription s must be 
recorded. 
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
All patients who sign the ICF will be assigned a unique patient identification number.  
Only patients confirmed to meet screening eligibility  will be randomized and allowed to 
continue in the study. A sufficient number of patients will be enrolled in the study in 
order to randomize 166 patients acros s up to 30 study sites.  
The type of study dialyzer each patient will use during their treatment sessions will be 
determined according to a central randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_87696] (via the 
Electronic Data Capture [ EDC] system used for the study). Patients will be randomly 
assigned to receive one of the following two study dialyzers in a 1:1 ratio:  

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 28 of 66

begins (ICF), will be recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medications, including dose, 
unit, frequency, route of administration , start and stop dates and indication for use, will 
be recorded on th e eCRF throughout the study.  Sites will not enter “other” or 
“prophylaxis” as indications.  
Erythropoiesis -stimulating agents are often used to stimulate red blood cell production in 
dialysis patients. During the course of this study, ESAs should be adminis tered according 
to each clinic’s standard practices, either subcutaneously or intravenously. If 
administered intravenously, it should be done post -dialysis or in the venous part of the 
extracorporeal circuit (downstream of the dialyzer).  
A treatment medica tion will be anything given once the patient enters Visit 1.

done according to current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regulations for 
dialysis water (ANSI/AAMI RD62:2001) and conventional dialysate (ANSI/AAMI 
RD52). Sites will also adhere to all requirements stip ulated by [CONTACT_63217].  
There are no activity or diet restrictions specific to the study. Patients should disc uss their 
daily diet and activities with their physician.  Medical management of HD patients is per 
institutional practice. Dialysis prescription and management will be per institutional 
practice.

  ICF will be given to the patient and the original will be placed in the patient’s medical 
record. Confirmation of a patient’s informed consent must also be documented in the 
patient’s medical records prior to any data collection under this protocol. An IRB 
approved patient ICF will be provided to the Invest igator. The ICF must not be altered 
without the prior agreement of the relevant IRB and Baxter.  
If modifications are needed according to local regulations, or if new information becomes 
available (e.g., from Baxter) that can significantly affect a patient’ s future health and 
medical care, a new version of the patient information and informed consent form must 
be prepared in cooperation with the investigator(s) and approved by [CONTACT_87696]. Patients still 
participating in the study must provide written informed co nsent by [CONTACT_87702] a copy of the signed form and the patient information. A 
copy of the new version of the form and patient information shall be given to each 
previously enrolled patient for information.  
Upon signatu re of the ICF , the study patient will be screen ed to verify eligibility (see 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively).  
6.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics will include the date of birth, gender, and ethnicity. 
A complete medical history including a review of all major body systems and medical 
history, as applicable, will be performed.  
Information regarding the type and frequency of dialysis therapy r eceived prior to 
enrollment in this study, and the type of access will be obtained. The information 
gathered will include mean duration of treatments, blood flow rate ( QB), dialysate flow 
rate (QD) and the type and mean dosage of heparin, erythropoietin an d intravenous iron 
administered.  
Relevant medical history for each patient will be obtained during Screening. Medication 
history, if applicable, will also be evaluated during the Screening period. Past and present 
conditions, as well as surgical procedure s, will be recorded for the main body systems.  
Renal medical history, date and type of first chronic dialysis treatment, date of last 
transplant (if applicable), date of last transplant failure (HD resumed, if applicable), 
primary renal disease etiology wi ll also be captured in the eCRF. In addition, all

A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition, or a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_87704], without serious de terioration in health, is not 
considered a serious adverse event. (ISO [ZIP_CODE])  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, the y may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this

Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment [ADDRESS_95565]  For this protocol, the term “ investigational product” is  
synonymous with Theranova [ADDRESS_95566]  For this protocol, the term “comparator product” is 
synonymous with Elisio-17H dialyzer.  
Date of Onset  The date when the signs and symptoms of the AE begin.  
Signs & S ymptoms vs Diagnosis  If a definitive diagnosis has been medically established 
by [CONTACT_87706], this diagnosis should then be recorded as the 
AE. If a definitive diagnosis has not been medically 
established, th e signs and symptoms should then be 
recorded as the AEs.  
Diagnosis vs Complications  A patient experiences not only a diagnosis, but also 
additionally a complication of the diagnosis ( i.e., 
myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure) ; both 
the diagnosis and the medical complication should be 
collected and recorded as separate AEs.  
Awareness Date or Baxter Awareness Date  The date on which any Baxter employee or their agent 
becomes aware of an AE. This date is considered Day 0 
on the regulatory repo rting time clock.  
 
7.2 Safety Reporting  
All AEs and PCs observed by [CONTACT_87707] (i.e. enrollment) 
through the end of study  visit. 
Any medical  condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s 
condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
An elective procedure/surgery that occurs during the course of a study, but is being 
performed for a documented pre -existing condition and was pre -planned prior to study 
entry will not qualify as an AE. If, however, the pre -existing condition unexpectedly 
deteriorates during the study requiring the procedure/surgery to be performed earlier than 
planned, the condition for which the procedure/surgery is being performed will qualify as 
an AE. 
Laboratory and vital sign abnormalities qualify as AEs if medical intervent ion is required 
to treat or address the abnormality, if the patient must be discontinued from the study due 

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 37 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment [ADDRESS_95567] -of-care 
as qualifying it as an AE.  
If a patient experiences a di agnosis, but also additionally a complication of the diagnosis 
(i.e., myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure); both the diagnosis and the 
medical complication should be collected and recorded on eCRFs as separate AEs.  
Adverse events that chang e in severity will be documented as an additional AE to allow 
an assessment of the event at each level of severity.  
If an AE or PC occurs, a full description of the event should be recorded including the 
date and time of onset, as well as outcome, seriousn ess, severity, event description, 
actions taken, and causal relationship of the AE. Investigators should review and 
reference the severity (see  Table 4) and causality definitions (see Table 5) when 
determining relationship of the AE or PC to the study product. The investigators may also 
discuss the event(s) with the Baxter Medical Monitor or designee.  
All AEs and PCs should be actively solicited and, no matter how common they are for a 
particular patient a nd regardless of the causality assigned by [CONTACT_737]. 
Additionally, any AE voluntarily reported by [CONTACT_87708]. 
Supporting source docum ents should be de -identified. Each SAE will be documented on 
a separate SAE report form.  
The outcome/resolution of all AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_87709]. Investigators will be instructed to follow all 
AEs as follows: Unrelated AEs will be followed until resolution or until the end of the 
study whichever comes first. Adverse device effects (related AEs) and all SAEs (related 
or not) will be followed until resolution or they become stable, including following  the 
patient after the end of study if necessary.  
An AE can result from the use of the investigational product in accordance with the 
protocol, as well as from an accidental or intentional misuse or malfunction of the 
investigational product or any other t reatment error such as unintentional administration 
or use of another product during the course of the study.

Criterion  Definition  
Mild Is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the 
patient’s normal functioning level. The AE resolves spontaneously or may 
require minimal therapeutic interventi on. 
Moderate  Produces limited impairment of function and can require therapeutic 
intervention, but produces no sequelae.  
Severe Results in a marked impairment of function and can lead to temporary inability 
to resume usual life pattern. The AE produces s equelae requiring (prolonged) 
therapeutic intervention.

10.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
The sample size for this study is driven by [CONTACT_87677]. The sample size 
calculation was performed using PASS® 15.0.1 software,  procedure Non -Inferiority 
Tests for the difference between Two Means. Copyright © 2017, NCSS, LLC. All Rights 
Reserved.  The power is based on a t -test with a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 where the 
true difference in  means is assumed to be zero (0) and the non -inferiority margin is 5% .  
Pre-dialysis serum albumin was not evaluated in the previous Theranova 400 dialyzer HD 
study, only the mass (G) of albumin in the dialysate was assessed. H owever, a study 
published in PLo S ONE26 did use a prototype of the Theranova dialyzer (MCO -CI) 
where in pre -dialysis albumin levels were collected after a month of therapy  and, based 
on these data, a mean and standard deviation ( SD) of 35.[ADDRESS_95575] 80% power to demonstrate non -inferiority of the Ther anova 400 dialyzer 
compared to the Elis io-17H dialyzer as assessed by [CONTACT_094] -dialysis serum albumin with a 
non-inferiority margin of 5%. To allow for 15% of patients to drop out, a total of 166 
patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with the Therano va 400 dialyzer or 
treatment with the Elis io-17H dialyzer  (i.e., 83 patients per group). 
The 5% non -inferiority margin is based on results from 2 observational studies.27,28 These 
studies looked at the associati on between serum albumin levels and mortality in large US 
cohorts of HD and PD patients, respectively. In both studies, variations in serum albumin 
of +/- 1 g/L over 6 months (corresponds to +/ -0.1 g/dL) have been defined as  “stable 
serum albumin levels”. A variation of +/ - 1 g/L is a range with a width of 2 g/L,  which is 

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 45 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment 5  2018 FEB 09  
  
   
  larger than 5% if applied to the reported mean baseline serum albumin levels. Therefore, 
a 5% variation in serum albumin can be justified as having no clinical significance.  
A previously conducted Theranova 400 dialyzer prototype HDF study (Comparison of 
the Clinical Performance of Two Theranova 400 Dialyzer Prototypes in Hemodialysis

standard deviation (SD) of 37.8 and 8.26. With a total sample size of 140 evaluable 
subjects as determined based on the primary safety endpoint (70 in the Theranova 400 
dialyzer treatment group and 70 in the Elisio -17H dialyzer treatment group), a difference 
of 4.56 in the λ FLC reduction ratio in favor of the Theranova 400 dialyzer can be 
detected with 90% power at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_95576] assuming equal vari ances. The sample size calculation for the primary 
efficacy endpoint was performed using PASS® 15.0.[ADDRESS_95577] Assuming Equal Variance.  
10.3 Analysis Populations  
The Per-protocol (PP) set will include all randomized patients who have received at least 
three months treatment with a study dialyzer and do not have any major protocol 
violations  that might impact the primary analyses . 
The intent -to-treat full analysis (FA) set will include all randomized patients.  
The primary analys es will be performed on the FA set and supported by [CONTACT_87719]. All other analyses will be performed on the FA set unless otherwise noted.  
10.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Continuous demographic and baseline characteristics including age, height, screening 
laboratory tests and screening vital signs will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_87720] (N), mean, SD, minimum and maximum. A t -test 
will be used to evaluate mean differences between treatment gro ups or a non -parametric 
procedure, as appropriate.  
Categorical demographic and baseline characteristics including gender, race and medical 
history will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_87721]. Treatment group compar ability will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact test. 
Medical history; medical condition or surgery items collected on the eCRF will be coded

  to the appropriate System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Act ivities (MedDRA), Version 18 or higher.  
10.5 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoints will be analyzed in a hierarchical manner, starting with the 
primary safety endpoint.  
The primary  analyses will be performed using a multiple imputation approach. Multiple 
imputations using SAS Proc MI will be used to impute missing data under the missing at 
random assumption and the data sets generated will be analyzed using SAS Proc 
MIANALYZE.  It is expected that the missing values will be monotone (i.e., when a 
variable Yj is missing for an individual i, then subsequent variables Y k, k > j, are all 
missing for the individual i). Thus, the regression method for imputation will be used.  
Using the primary safety analysis as an example, if a subject is missing serum albumin 
values at weeks [ADDRESS_95578] fitted using the non -missing values 
prior to week 20 (baseline, weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16) in order to impute the missing value 
for week 20. This method is then repeated in order to impute the missing value for week 
[ADDRESS_95579] . 
10.5.1  Primary Safety Endpoint(s)  
For the primary safety endpoint of pre -dialysis serum albumin after 24 weeks of 
treatment, l et µT denote the Theranova dialyzer pre-dialysis serum albumin mean and let 
µR denote the Elis io-17H dialyzer pre-dialysis serum albumin mean. Then the null 
hypothesis to demonstrate non -inferiority using a 5% margin can be expressed as:  
Ho: µT- µR ≤ -1.765. The alternative hypothesis is expressed as Ha: µT- µR > -1.765. 
An ANCOVA model w ith fixed effects of treatment and site and the continuous fixed 
covariate of baseline pre -dialysis serum albumin  will be used to generate a two -sided 
95% confidence interval  (CI) for the difference in treatment means (µ T- µR). If the lower 
bound is > -1.765 then non-inferiority will be demonstrated.   

Theranova 400 Dialyzer  Page 47 of 66 
Clinical Trial Protocol : 7905001, Amendment 5  2018 FEB 09  
  
   
  10.5.2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
For the primary efficacy endpoint of RR of λ FLC after 2 4 weeks of treatment , let µT 
denote the Theranova dialyzer RR of λ FLC mean at 24 weeks and let µ R denote the 
Elisio-17H dialyzer RR of λ FLC mean at 24 weeks.  Then the null hypothesis to 
demonstrate superior ity can be expressed as:  
Ho: µT- µR = 0. The alternative hypothesis is expressed as Ha: µ T- µR ≠ 0. 
The primary safety analysis will be conducted first. If the primary safety analysis 
demonstrates non -inferiority, a n ANCOVA model with fixed effects of trea tment and site  
will be used to generate a two -sided 95% CI for the difference in treatment means (µ T- 
µR). If the lower bound is > 0 then superiority will be demonstrated.  The statistical testing 
of the primary efficacy endpoint of the reduction ratio (RR) of λ FLC after 24 weeks of 
treatment is contingent upon the outcome of the analysis of the primary safety endpoint 
and will only be conducted once non -inferiority could be established for the primary 
safety endpoint. This hierarchical testing approach guarantee s that the overall type 1 error 
is controlled at a two -sided 0.05 significance level.  
10.6 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
10.6.1  Secondary Safety Endpoint(s)  
Pre-dialysis serum albumi n: 
A Mixed-effect Model Repeat ed Measurement ( MMRM) model will be used to evaluate 
differences  between treatment groups in the change from baseline in pre -dialysis serum 
albumin after each four weeks of treatment . The model will include the fixed effect of 
treatment, visit ; the continuous, fixed covar iate of baseline measurement ; and the random 
effect of patient.  
Pre-dialysis serum albumin will be further categorized at baseline and final measurement 
into 4 categories: <3.5, ≥3.5-3.9, ≥4.0-4.4, ≥4.5. Shift tables will be generated to cross 
tabulate the number of patients within each category by [CONTACT_3148].  
Pre-dialysis Factor VII , Protein C, Vitamin A , and Factor II : 
An MMRM model will be used to evaluate the differences betwee n treatment groups in 
the change from baseline in pre -dialysis Factor VII , Protein C , Vitamin A , and Factor II  
after [ADDRESS_95580] of 
treatment, visit ; the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline measurement ; and the random 
effect of patient.

  nPNA  (nPCR):  
An MMRM model will be used to evaluate differences between treatment groups in 
nPNA(nPCR)  collected after each [ADDRESS_95581] Complaints:  
The summary of AEs will include AEs that occur on the day of or after the first study 
treatment. AEs  will be mapped to a Primary SOC and PT according to MedDRA and 
summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_2946], PT and treatment group . Treatment group 
comparability in the incidence rates of adverse events will be evaluated using Fisher’s 
exact test.  
An overview (overall) summary table of all AEs will be generated that includes the total 
number of AEs, number and percentage of patients with at least one AE, number and 
percentage of patients with at least one SAE, number and percentage of patients with at 
least one severe AE, number and percentage of patients with at least one AE probably 
associated with study treatment, number and percentage of patients with an AE leading to 
study discontinuation and number and percentage of patients with an AE leading to de ath. 
This summary table will be presented by [CONTACT_87722] 
(Total). 
Furthermore, separate AE summary tables will be provided by [CONTACT_87723] . Separate AE summary tables will be provided  to show 
a breakdown of AEs by [CONTACT_2946], PT and  
a. severity (mild, moderate or severe),   
b. relationship to study treatment (probably related, possibly related, unable to 
determine, unlikely related or not related) . 
Study dialyzer related product complaints will be s ummarized descriptively by [CONTACT_87724]. 
Chemistry and hematology : 
Mean differences between treatment groups in the change from baseline to final measure  
in chemistry and hematology laboratory tests will be analyzed using a n ANCOVA with a 
fixed effect of  treatment and a fixed continuous covariate of baseline laboratory value.

  10.6.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint (s) 
In order to account for multiplicity, secondary efficacy analyses will be held to a 
hierarchical assessment and performed in the order outlined below. If the first analysis 
results in a p -value <0.05, then formal testing will continue to the second analysis. If the 
second analysis also results in a p -value <0.05, then formal testing will continue to the 
third analysis, and so on. This method of hierarchi cal assessment will continue until an 
analysis results in a p -value > 0.05, i.e., is considered statistically insignificant. This 
hierarchical approach guarantees that the overall alpha will not exceed 0.05.

reduction ratios  of λ FLC, CFD, κ FLC, IL-6, TNFα, β2-microglobulin  after [ADDRESS_95582] of baseline 
pre-dialysis β 2-microglobulin will be used to eval uate differences between treatment 
groups for the change from baseline in pre -dialysis β 2-microglobulin after 24 weeks of 
treatment.  
An MMRM model will be used to evaluate differences between treatment groups in 
Kt/Vurea collected after each [ADDRESS_95583] of patient.

Appropriate models will be used to evaluate difference s between treatment groups in the 
utilization for medications (i.e., ESA, anti -hypertensives, iron).  
10.8 Interim Analysis  
An interim a nalysis will be conducted  when 60% of enrollment is completed . The 
purpose o f the interim analysis is a blinded sample size reassessment using the approach 
by [CONTACT_87725]29 for an absolute difference in means which is based on the 
observed one -sample standard deviation calculated from the pooled data across t reatment 
groups. This blinded sample size reassessment will be carried out by [CONTACT_69852] (who otherwise is not involved in the study conduct ) using the [ADDRESS_95585] been 
enrolled (assuming 15% drop out, this corresponds to 84 evaluable patients). In case the 
observed pooled standard deviation at [ADDRESS_95586] 
deviation of 3.7, the method will require an increase in overall sample size  in order to 
maintain an overall power of 80%. If the observed standard deviation is smaller than the 
assumed standard deviation of 3.7, the overall sample size will be kept at 166.

  Appendix 3  Formulas for Calculation of Endpoints  
Reduction Ratios (RR)  
The RR for each solute, based on the change in the arterial plasma concentration over the 
dialysis session, will be calculated as:  
 
where C Pre and CPost are measured arterial plasma concentration of the solute before and 
after dialysis, respectively .c 
However, for the middle molecules (λ FLC and β 2-microglobulin) C Post will be first 
corrected (C Post-corr) for the decrease in total extracellular volume due to fluid removal, as 
follows: 
 
where C Post is the measured plasma concentration of the solute after dialysis; and BW Pre 
and BW Post are the patient’s body weight before and after dialysis, respect ively.d 
Kt/Vurea (quantification of hemodialysis treatment adequacy)  
The linear equation used to calculate Kt/V urea when applied to HD administered 3 times a 
week is as follows:  
 
where R is the ratio of post -dialysis to pre -dialysis BUN; V is the body wat er volume and 
Weightloss is expressed in the same units; and T is treatment time in hours.ef

  nPNA (nPCR) 
The below equations are used to calculate the midweek PNA (PCR) when applied to HD 
patients is as follows:  
 
where C 0 is the pre-dialysis BUN.  
SpKt/V is calculated as per below equation:  
 
where R is the post -dialysis/pre -dialysis BUN, t is the dialysis session in hours, UF is the 
ultrafiltration volume in liters, and W is the post -dialysis weight in kilograms.g 
V is calculated as per Watson formula s below: 
 
 
where V is the total body water.h 
PNA should be normalized to adjust to a specific body size. This will be done using the 
formula below:

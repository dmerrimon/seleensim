Study Design:   This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind controlled study in subjects with 
PsA.  The study will consist of a 30- day screening period, a 48- week double- blind treatment 
period and a 30- day safety follow -up period.  Approximat ely 840 subjects will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups (280 per group):  etanercept [ADDRESS_1075666].  
Sample Size:   Approximat ely [ADDRESS_1075667] Eligibility Criteria:   Subjects must be adults with active PsA  based on the 
Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR)  who are naïve to etanercept and other 
biologics and have no prior use of methotrexate for the treatment of PsA.   Prior  treatment with 
methotrexate is allowed if indicated for psoriasis as long as discontinuation was not due to toxicity 
or intolerance and treatment was discontinued ≥ [ADDRESS_1075668] Dosage and Administration:   Etanercept dosing in the 
planned study follows the recommended label dosing for subjects with PsA.  Etanercept will be 
provided as a [ADDRESS_1075669] Dosage and Administration:   Methotrexate dosing will 
begin at a dose of [ADDRESS_1075670]  Dosage and Administration:   Folic acid dosing will

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
PsA is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the peripheral joints and axial skeleton that 
occurs in 7
% to 34 % of patients with psoriasis (Scarpa et al, 1984; Biondi et al, 1989; 
Espi[INVESTIGATOR_198031], 1992; Shbeeb et al, 2000), which in turn has a prevalence of 1 % to 3% in 
the general population ( Biondi et al, 1989; Koo, 1996).  Articular involvement can vary 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1075697] associated psoriasis, PsA can present without skin changes.  Radiographic features include joint erosions, joint space loss, osteolysis that may cause penciling of the phalanx, and periostitis.  PsA can lead to permanent destruction of joints and functional disabil ities. 
2.2 Etanercept (Enbrel
®) Background 
Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory and immune responses.  It plays a role in the inflammatory process of plaque psoriasis.  Elevated levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis.  Two distinct receptors for TNF, a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble 
forms. Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either c ell surface 
TNF receptor.  Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracelluar 
ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton TNF  receptor linked to the Fc portion of 
human IgG1.  Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF-α and TNF- β (lymphotoxin alpha 
[LT-α ]) to cell surface TNF receptors , rendering TNF biologically inactive. 
In many countries, etanercept is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage of active arthritis, and improving physical function 
in patients with PsA.   
Etanercept is also indicated for the treatment of:  (1) moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis; (2) moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients aged 2 and older; (3) psoriatic arthritis; (4) active ankylosing 
spondylitis; and ( 5) adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure or product label for additional information related to physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulations. 
2.[ADDRESS_1075698] Background:  Methotrexate 
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, 
psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis .  Methotrexate or its metabolites inhibit dihydrofolic 
acid reductase and antagonize thymidylate synthase.  Methotrexate is thought to inhibit 
5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase which leads to an 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1075699] commonly used non-biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) in 
PsA.  Although the use of methotrexate is standard therapy in the medical community 
and it is mentioned in guidelines in the treatment of PsA, it is not an approved drug for 
the treatment of PsA in many countries . 
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert for additional information. 
2.[ADDRESS_1075700] recent randomized placebo- controlled trial of 
methotrexate in PsA is the Methotrexate in Psoriatic Arthritis (MIPA) study 
(Kingsley  et al, 2012).  This was a  6-month, double-blind, parallel -group study in  
methotrexate naïve subjects randomized to receive methotrexate (15 mg/wk; n =  109) or 
placebo (n =  112).  In an intent-to-treat analysis, there were no statistically significant 
improvements in measures of disease activity across groups at 24 weeks.  The odds 
ratios (95 % CI) for  Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria, ACR 20, and Disease activity 
score (28 joint) responders for the methotrexate and placebo groups were 1.77 (0.97, 
3.23; p = 0.06), 2.00 (0.65, 6.22; p = 0.23), and 1.70 (0.90, 3.17; p = 0.10), respectively.  
In a completer analysis, percent responders for methotrexate and placebo were 34 % and 
21% for ACR  20 respectively  for a difference of 13 %.  In the PsA pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], ACR 20 
response at week 24 was 50 % and 1 4% in the etanercept and placebo groups 
respectively  for a difference of 36 %.  Nevertheless, comparisons with the MIPA trial need 
to be qualified by [CONTACT_782264][INVESTIGATOR_782245]ïve.  Furthermore, in the MIPA trial the target dose of 
methotrexate was  15 mg QW, a less than maximal clinically used dose level . 
In rheumatoid arthritis, combining TNF inhibitors such as etanercept with methotrexate 
leads to superior efficacy relative to each agent used alone (Klareskog et al , 2004).  The 
role of methotrexate in combination with etanercept in PsA remains unclear. Analysis of 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1075701] longitudinal observational study 
showed no consistent differences in response over a 12-month period between patients 
who started their TNF inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate 
(Fagerli et al, 2014)  Similar findings were found in a [LOCATION_002] registry  
(Mease  et al, 2013) .  No difference was found in reaching clinical disease activity index 
(CDAI ) low disease activity or staying in low disease activity on anti -TNF monotherapy 
vs. combination with methotrexate in this study  (Mease et al , 2013).  These data suggest 
key differences in the response of PsA patients compared to RA patients to 
methotrexate and highlight the importance of characterizing the role of etanercept as a monotherapy agent in PsA. 
A new disease activity state called MDA, has been developed and validated 
(Coates  et al, 2010a and Coates et al , 2010b).  MDA  represents a low disease activity 
state and would further the ‘treat-to- target’ approach in PsA.  The MDA criteria is specific 
for PsA and incorporates  measures of joint and entheseal inflammation, skin disease, 
PROs  and functional disability to assess the subject’s disease activity.  The results of  the 
validation analysis support the prognostic value of the PsA MDA criteria and show that 
subjects achieving MDA are more likely to have a better radiologic outcome 
(Antoni  et al, 2005a, Antoni et al, 2005b). 
This study will also aim to characterize the response rates of etanercept on enthesitis, 
dactylitis , and psoriatic nail changes.  The PRESTA trial , assesse d two different 
regimens of etanercept ( 50 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly ) in subjects with 
psoriasis and PsA.  Etanercept 50 mg once weekly  resulted in a 70.0
% and 
81.3 % improvement from baseline in enthesitis at week 12 and 24 respectively.  
Similarly, improvement in dactylitis from baseline at weeks 12 and 24 were 78.4 % and 
84.8 %, respectively (Sterry et al, 2010).  There is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy 
of methotrexate monotherapy on dactylitis and enthesitis in patients with PsA.  A recent study looking at the effect of etanercept on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) 
score at week 12 and 24 improved by 50
% and 72 %, respectively on a weekly dose of 
Enbrel of 50 mgs (Ortonne et al, 2013).  In another recent study comparing improvement 
in nail changes on methotrexate monotherapy compared to cyclosporine monotherapy , 
methotrexate demonstrated a 30% improvement at 12 weeks and a 54 % improvement at 
24 weeks in the NAPSI score  (Gümüşel et al, 2011).

CONFIDENTIAL    2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
Primary:  Etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy are more 
efficacious than methotrexate monotherapy as measured by [CONTACT_782265] 20 response at week 24. 
Secondary:  Etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy are 
more efficacious than methotrexate as measured by [CONTACT_782266] 24.

Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board /independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All 
subjects must personally sign and date the informed consent form before 
commencement of study -specific activit ies/procedures. 
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The i nvestigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in the enrollment CRF. 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1075725] who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent form ) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number, assigned by [CONTACT_782268] 
(IXRS ),  will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be 
used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be 
changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is re- screened.  This number will 
not necessarily be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study. 
Subjects not meeting eligibility criteria are permitted to re-screen twice  
(see Section  7.2.1 and 7.2.2). 
5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
Subjects that meet all el igibility criteria will be randomized at baseline to receive 
etanercept plus methotrexate, etanercept plus placebo for methotrexate or methotrexate 
plus placebo for etanercept in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1075726]’s medical record and on the enrollment CRF.  
5.[ADDRESS_1075727]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study .  In the 
event that a subject’s treatment assignment must be unblinded by [CONTACT_782269].  Refer to the 
Investigational Product Instruction Manual  (IPIM) for a  description regarding how 
responsible pharmacists and investigators will access treatment information via IXRS  in 
the event that there is a need to break the treatment blind. 
Other than rescue therapy situations, in the event of inadvertent unblinding (ie, the blind 
was not intended to be broken as described above), the investigator should immediately 
notify [COMPANY_010].  Each scenario will be reviewed individually to determine if the impacted 
subject(s) are able to continue receiving investigational product.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason,  including the scenarios described 
above, will be considered a protocol deviation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged

Contraceptive methods that achieve a failure rate less of less than 1
% per year when 
used consistently and correctly are considered highly effective and may include:  hormonal (combined estrogen and progestogen or progestogen only), contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral , injectable, implantable, intravaginal, or 
transdermal route) , intrauterine device, i ntrauterine hormonal -releasing system , bilateral 
tubal occlusion, v asectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the female participant and the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success) , true sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject.  The reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_471905].

of the subject’s total BSA involvement with psoriasis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 
The assessor who conducts the tender and swollen joint counts will be trained and 
certified by [CONTACT_782279].  The modified NAPSI 
scale is an objective, numeric, and reproducible grading system for nail psoriasis that 
incorporates the many different features of nail psoriasis.  For assessments in this study (including selection of the target nail), a nail is graded on the following 8 clinical features and the modified NAPSI score results. 
• pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940] (scores 0-3, depending on the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_10022])  
• nail plate crumbling (scores 0-3, depending on % of nail involvement)  
• onycholysis  and oil drop discoloration considered together  (scores 0 -3, depending on 
% of nail involvement)  
• leukonychia (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
• red spots in lunula (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
• nail bed hyperkeratosis (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
• splinter hemorrhages (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
In randomized subjects with nails involved with psoriasis, each finger nail will be scored

7.5 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic pr ocesses, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  Biomarker development can be useful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_53391], guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity. 
[COMPANY_010] may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to 
respond positively or negatively to etanercept and/or methotrexate.  Biomarker development may be pursued by [CONTACT_782282], such as proteomic methods or ribonucleic acid transcript profiling.  A cell pel let from the blood 
plasma tube may be utilized to assess the impact of etanercept and/or methotrexate on 
circulating immune cells via deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation analysis, a pharmacodynamic assessment of methylation patterns of relevant genes.  The DNA 
extracted will not be used for optional pharmacogenetic analyses unless the subject signs the additional consent. 
7.[ADDRESS_1075784] consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA 
analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44809].  The goals of the optional studies 
include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of PsA and/or to identify 
subjects who may have positive or negative response to [COMPANY_010] and non -[COMPANY_010] 
investigational product. No additional samples are collected for this part of the study.  For subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may be extracted. 
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can also

remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
inflammatory conditions,  the dose response and/or prediction of response to etanercept 
or methotrexate, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be 
retained for up to [ADDRESS_1075786]’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in  the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by [CONTACT_782283].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor
 is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keepi[INVESTIGATOR_21878]).

protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33204].  If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the 
appropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33205]  (Table 1 ) and collection of data, including 
endpoints and adverse events.  The i nvestigator  must document the change to the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_1560] ( eg, in person, by [CONTACT_756]/mail, through family/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ). 
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Su bject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  The data generated may potentially  not be included in the subject’s study data, except in the case of a possibly 
related serious adverse event, where data will be collected.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.[ADDRESS_1075790]’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-exist ing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves  an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery 
or a medical procedure while on-study , is not considered an adverse event. 
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782251]:  Etanercept

following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay). 
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.[ADDRESS_1075792](s) through the end of treatment period a re reported using the applicable CRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summary).  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if res olved) , 
• Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol ), 
• Assessment of relatedness to investigational product(s) and 
• Action taken.

This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198](s)? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a cl inically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event. 
The Investigator is expected to follow reported a dverse events  until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event Summary CRF. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1075794](s) are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to [COMPANY_010].   All 
serious adverse events must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable e CRF.  
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious a dverse events reported outside of 
the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.

CONFIDENTIAL    If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an eSAE 
Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet/eSAE 
Contingency Report Form.  For EDC studies  where the first notification of a Serious  
Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via the eSAE Contingency Report Form, the data 
must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available. 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure?” 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010].   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_1075796] be consistent with that recorded on the applicable e CRF

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of investigational product.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the actual

10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
The following covariates will be considered to assess their influence on the primary and key secondary endpoints: 
• Age (
≤ 65, >  65) 
• Sex (male, female)  
• Race  (Caucasian, Non- Caucasian)  
• Ethnicity  (Hispanic or Latino vs Non-Hispanic or Latino)  
• Baseline body mass index (BMI ) (≤ 30, > 30) 
• Baseline weight ( ≤ 100 kg, >  100 kg) 
• Baseline BSA ( ≤ 3%, > 3%) 
• Prior use of non-biologic DMARD (yes, no)  
• Disease duration ( ≤ median, > median) 
Subgroup analyses, which would be considered exploratory, may be performed if an 
examination of the above covariates suggests that any treatment difference for the 
prima ry and secondary endpoints depends on any baseline covariates. 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
A total of 840 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy, etanercept monotherapy  and methotrexate 
monotherapy.  
To preserve the family -wise 2 -sided type one error rate at 0.05 for the multiple 
comparisons of the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy 
groups with methotrexate monotherapy , a Bonferroni -based gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_782252] ( Burman et al , 2009 and Millen et al , 2011) will be used to determine 
statistical significance for the primary and key secondary endpoints as described in 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1075801] in parallel the 
primary and key secondary endpoints  (ACR 20, MDA)  for etanercept plus methotrexate 
therapy vs. methotrexate monotherapy and etanercept monotherapy vs. methotrexate 
monotherapy sequentially within each parallel path.  If one of the parallel paths rejects 
both hypotheses sequentially, and the other parallel path has at least one hypothesis not 
rejected, then unspent alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1075802] them sequentially at a level of 0.05. 
The sample size is based on the adequacy to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy as measured by [CONTACT_782284] 20 response at week 24 at a significance level of 0.025 based on the Bonferroni -based gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_782253]. 
There are no published studies of etanercept monotherapy versus methotrexate 
monotherapy for the treatment of PsA.  Therefore for the purpose of this study the  
assumed response rates for ACR 20 for the etanercept monotherapy and methotrexate 
monotherapy arms are derived from separate studies.  In the etanercept PsA pi[INVESTIGATOR_6921] 3 study (20021630 Study) the ACR 20 response rate at week 24 was 50
% for the 
etanercept arm.  However, subjects were allowed to be on a stable dose of methotrexate at study entry.  Assuming a methotrexate naïve population would respond better, the response rate for the etanercept monotherapy arm in this planned phase 3 study is assumed to be 60
%. 
In a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate monotherapy in PsA 
(Kingsley et al , 2012) the ACR 20 response rate for the methotrexate monotherapy arm 
was 34%.  However, the dose of methotrexate was 15 mg QW.  Assuming a higher dose 
of methotrexate (ie, 20 mg QW) would yield better responses, the response rate for the 
methotrexate monotherapy arm in this planned phase 3  study is assumed to be 44 %. 
Therefore, in order to detect a difference of 16% between the etanercept monotherapy 
and methotrexate monotherapy arms, using a two-sided Chi -square test at a significance 
level of 0.025 and 90 % marginal power, each treatment arm will have approximately 
280 subjects adjusting for an anticipated 10 % dropout. 
This sample size will provide marginal power > 90% to detect a treatment difference in 
ACR 20 response at week 24 between the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy  arm 
and the methotrexate monotherapy arm at a two -sided 0.025 significance level.  As 
previously mentioned, the ACR response rate at week 24 is assumed to be 44 % for the

Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  [ADDRESS_1075803] 2016  Page 54 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    methotrexate monotherapy arm.  The ACR response rate at week 24 for the etanercept 
plus methotrexate therapy  arm is assumed to be 5 % higher than the etanercept 
monotherapy arm (ie, 65%).  This is based on a longitudinal observational study 
assessing the role of TNF-inhibitor plus methotrexate combination therapy versus TNF-inhibitor monotherapy (Fagerli et al, 2014 ). 
In addition, this sample size will provide marginal power >  90
% to detect treatment 
differences in MDA response at week 24 between both etanercept arms and the methotrexate arm at a two-sided 0.025 significance level, assuming response rates of 15
%, 30%, and 35 % for the methotrexate monotherapy, etanercept monotherapy, and 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy arms, respectively.  In recent PsA trials, the MDA 24-week response rates for the placebo arm range from 3 to 7
% (Coates et al , 2010a ; 
Kavanaugh et al , 2013).  Therefore, for the methotrexate monotherapy arm, the 
response rate is assumed to be higher at 15 %.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 randomized 
placebo-controlled trial of etanercept in PsA, the MDA response rate for the etanercept monotherapy arm is estimated to be approximately 20
% at week 24 (d ata on file).  For a 
methotrexate naïve population, the response rate is assumed to be higher at 30 %.  In 
addition, the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy arm is assumed to have a 5
% improvement over the etanercept monotherapy arm.

12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection 
The [COMPANY_010] representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contact[CONTACT_21974], 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 
The c linical monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency 
of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The clinical mo nitor is to have access to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved. In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by [CONTACT_21975]’s Global R&D Compliance and Audit function 
(or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy 
storage areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate 
the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available. 
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”. 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data management review is performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries and/or site notifications are created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and subsequently closed by [CONTACT_21976]. 
• The i nvestigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study.  
This signature [CONTACT_214932] s that the investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the 
CRF, the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content.

CONFIDENTIAL    [COMPANY_010] (or designee) will perform self-evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self-Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by [CONTACT_11337] (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same 
date with different visit- week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial 
and at study closeout.  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The i nvestigator is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records (where permitted) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

As noted in Section Adverse Event Grading Scale  
The Common Toxicity  Criteria Version 4.0 is available at the following link: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
General [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration Guidance on Hepatotoxicity 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_53359] 
6.4, a Food and Drug Administration Guidance exists for 
drug-induced liver injury (DILI).  This guidance is general for all investigational and 
marketed products, and is synopsized here as a reference.  It provides criteria for reporting, monitoring, and withholding investigational product in the event that a subject 
develops signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during a clinical trial.  
Criteria for Permanent Withholding of Investigational Product due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
Investigational product should be discontinued permanently and the subject should be 
followed for possible drug-induced liver injury, if ALL of the criteria below are met: 
• TBL >  [ADDRESS_1075833] or international normalized ratio > 1.5 
• AND increased AST or ALT from the relevant bas eline value as specified below: 
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
≤ 1.[ADDRESS_1075834]  > [ADDRESS_1075835]  
• AND no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent; important potential causes for abnormal AST/ALT or TB L 
values include, but are not limited to the following: 
• obstructive gall bladder or bile duct disease  
• viral or alcoholic hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein-Barr virus, 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella)  
• progression of malignancy involving the liver (note that metastatic disease to the 
liver, by [CONTACT_5071], should not be used as an explanation for significant AST/ALT 
elevations)  
• hypoxic or ischemic hepatopathy or congestive hepatopathy in association with 
significant right-sided heart failure  
• concomi tant administration of other hepatotoxins, including drugs that inhibit 
bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, atazanavir, irinotecan) or herbal or dietary supplements  
• heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s syndrome); 
alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency  
• autoimmune hepatitis  
• nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or other “fatty liver disease”  
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207

CONFIDENTIAL    Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or  ALT 
and TBL according to the criteria specified in Section Reporting  
6.4 ([ADDRESS_1075846]/ALT and 
[ADDRESS_1075847] for TBL)  require the following: 
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary 
to facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be 
completed and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin (total and direct) within [ADDRESS_1075848](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified above or 
who experience AST or ALT elevations >  [ADDRESS_1075849] are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  
Assessments that are to be performed during this period include: 
• In cases of TBL >  2x ULN retesting of liver tests, bilirubin (total and direct) is to be 
performed every [ADDRESS_1075850](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic  
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL: 
○ Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophilia 
○ Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody, 
Anti Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
○ Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels 
○ Obtain a more detailed history of: 
− Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness 
− Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents

CONFIDENTIAL    − Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and 
fever  
− Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and 
special diets  
− Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescription medicines and herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
○ Obtain viral serologies 
○ Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear  
○ Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated 
○ Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has 
not already been collected  
○ Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation 
with an hepatologist)  
○ Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL) until all 
laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close 
observation period” is to continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1075852](s) and protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

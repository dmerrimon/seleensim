Protocol version date 05/09/[ADDRESS_1249766] by [CONTACT_892263][INVESTIGATOR_892251]. However, healthy neuronal cells also rely on functional mitrotubules in their axons and dendrites for both structural support and transport of intracellular products. Disruption of these neuronal microtubules leads to a dose- dependent 
peripheral neuropathy that is the  dose- limiting toxicity of taxanes.
2 Taxane- induced peripheral 
neuropathy (TIPN) initially tends to manifest as a progressively worsening sensory impairment  
which is often felt as painful paresthesias with decreased deep tendon reflexes;  this may be 
followed by a delayed motor deficit causin g distal weakness.3 TIPN is often  reversible if it is 
intervened upon early enough with dose reduction or discontinuation of taxane treatment s; if 
treatment is continued there is higher risk of irreversible symptoms .[ADDRESS_1249767] cancer patients found that 10% of them had 
dose- limiting TIPN; roughly half of whom  had early  discontinuation of treatment with  an 
average 28% lower cumulative taxane dose than planned.[ADDRESS_1249768] cancer 
patients.  
TI
PN manifests via several different pathophysiological mechanisms that can be assessed by 
[CONTACT_892264] ; none of which have yet emerged as a widely -adopted standardized 
approach.  Taxane disruption of microtubules impairs  the normal self -maintenance of neurons  
which is evident structurally as the degeneration of distal axons and nerve terminals . 
Inflammatory changes occur as the innate immune system responds to these damaged and leaking organelles. Genetic polymorphisms in neuronal and inflammatory cells contribute to individual variability in TIPN vulnerability. Functionally,  as a neuronal myelin sheath 
deteriorates it increases the membrane surface area through which current must flow, slowing electrical  conduction velocity and weakening its signal amplitude. Finally,  as a result  of the 
above mechanisms , degradation and inflammation can alter lar ge peripheral nerves to the 
point that gross  anatomic  changes are evident on imaging.  
Ul
trasound (US) is a non- invasive, non- irradiating , emerging imaging modality which can be 
used to assess peripheral nerves. Nerve fiber cross- sectional area (CSA) , echo genicity, and 
vascularity are assessed and provide an indication of nerve health and potential pathology. The majority of US  data have been published  on detection of entrapment syndromes such as 
carpal tunnel syndrome. In these cases the most common US findings include nerve enlargement , decreased echogenicity proximal to the entrapment , and an increase in nerve 
vascularity .

compared to 1.40 / 0.59 mm2).9 
To
 date, there has only been one small study assessing US detection of chemotherapy-
induced peripheral neuropathy; this was done amo ng colorectal cancer patients who had 
received oxaliplatin. Similar to several  other etiologies of nerve lesions/neuropathies, this study 
also found an increased peripheral nerve CSA compared to reference values. Interestingly, 
although the patients had denied symptoms of neuropathies at time of recruitment, this study found areas of increased peripheral nerve CSA at upper extremity  sites of entrapment such as 
the carpal tunnel and ulnar groove; it did not find US abnormalities  in terms of CSA or 
echogenici ty at the sural nerve or other sites .
10 Oxaliplatin has a much different mechanism of 
action from the taxanes; as a platinum -based agent it causes DNA cross -linking which  inhibits 
cancer cell growth. Oxaliplatin- induced neuropathy is also a distinct entity that is characterized 
by [CONTACT_892265].
[ADDRESS_1249770] clinicians rely on patients’ self -reported symptoms alone for TIPN 
detection. These symptoms can be measured on one of several clinician- administered grading 
scales, although these have inter -scale and inter-observer variability.12 The European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC)  QLQ -CIPN20 Questionnaire is 
a 20- item self -reported survey that is easy to administer and was validated across participants 
in four large cooperative group trials.13 Furthermore, although in many patients the 
development of acute TIPN symptoms is predictive of eventual chronic TIPN,14 some patients 
develop a disproportionately delayed TIPN that is not able to be self -reported early enough to 
allow for intervention.  
The
 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC)  QLQ -CIPN20 
Questionnaire  is a 20- item self -reported survey that is easy to administer and was validated 
across participants in four large cooperative group trials.[ADDRESS_1249771] cancer patients and was shown to be correlated with patient -reported symptoms from the Common Toxicity Criteria (0.79, p < 
0.[ZIP_CODE]). Since taxanes are not associated with hearing loss, that corresponding item was excluded from analysis in that study .

7.2) and subtotals of 3.2 (7.3) for sensory measures, 3.8 (9.2) for motor, and 4.4 (10.7) for autonomic. The vast majority of non- cancer patients (90.1%) had a sum score of 0- 10%; older 
age and self -reported comorbidities were associated with higher QLQ -CIPN20 scores. Based 
on the results from that study, age- matched normative data has been generated for the QLQ -
CIPN20.

sical examination with quantitative sensory testing (QST) uses tuning forks or 
monofilaments to objectively measure the sensory threshold for proprioception. QST may be a 
useful addition to self -reported symptoms as it is non -invasive, easily implemented, and well -
correlated w ith self -reported TIPN symptoms. Although promising, it has not been shown to 
provide early detection of subclinical TIPN .17,18 
Nerv
e conduction studies  (NCS) measure impairment of electrical function in large peripheral 
nerves and are thought to be a sensitive and specific measure of TIPN. NCS measures 
amplitude and latency of neuronal signaling.  Reduction in the conduction velocity within a 
peripheral nerve indicates damage to the myelin, while reduction in the amplitude indicates 
axonal damage.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_892252] (such as the carpal tunnel)  and an earlier reduction of sural 
sensory amplitude relative to the radial nerve.19 A prospective study of patients receiving 
paclitaxel and carboplatin found a reduction in sural nerve conduction from baseline in terms of the sensory action potential amplitude (14.5 +/ - 9.0 uV to 9.7 +/ - 7.1) and the sensory 
conduction velocity (54.6 +/ - 7.7 m/s to 46.3 +/ - 8.8).
20 A series of patients who received 
paclitaxel and cisplatin had a reduction in the sural nerve amplitude of sensory action potential 
from average 13.7 uV (standard deviation 6.5) to 6.5 (standard deviation 4.1).21 However, NCS 
are invasive; can be mildly painful for the patient ; require expertise and time to administer;  and 
can only detect TIPN once it has progressed to the point that there is functional impairment of large peripheral nerves ; these  problems make it le ss preferable for  the routine clinical 
evaluation for TIPN -like symptoms .

In 
most cases, blood testing will be added on to regularly s cheduled phlebotomy for 
clinical labs which are drawn as part of routine oncology care. Some participants may 
require an additional blood draw if insufficient blood samples were collected. For the purposes of our study, 12mL of venous blood will be collect ed in a sodium heparin 
(green -top) collection tube and then transferred directly to [CONTACT_892279]’s lab for 
processing.  
Blood Sample Preparation  
1.Ema

([EMAIL_16998]) and Yusuke Shiozawa ([EMAIL_16999]) the day
before the blood collection.
2.Bl
ood will be collected in two green- top vacutainer tubes containing heparin (60 USP Units of
Lithium Heparin/ 6ml tube), and immediately inverted 8- 10 times to prevent coagulation.
Attention: Protocol #: CCCWFU # ([ZIP_CODE] ) and the ORIS PID  in addition to the other
standard information should be on the tube.
3.Samples will then be transported from the Cancer Center to the Shiozawa lab (Lab: 3 -6624,
3-5119, Office: 6 -8743).
4.6 Diagnostic testing (Encounter 3) 
Participants will be referred to Diagnostic Neurology clinic for and abbreviate 
neurological exam to assess strength of the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius and deep tendon reflex exam of the Achilles tendon on the limb to be examined in nerve 
conduction studies and ultrasound evaluation  during this encounter. Further, a skin 
biopsy will be obtained.  These tests will  be completed at a single visit and no further 
follow -up with neurology is required as part of the study protocol.  All of these studies are 
considered standard clinical tests for the evaluation of peripheral neuropathy and sensory neuropathy.  Patients will receive a Visa gift card upon completion of the 
neuropathy assessment.

S technique and reference values for the sural and tibial nerves among healthy 
adults are based on data from Chen et al. (2016)  and standard institutional practice 30. 
NCS assessment of the sural sensory nerve involves electrode placement at the ankle 
(posteroinferior to the lateral malleolus) and more distally with a 3cm bar for a distance 
of approximately 14cm; the nerve is stimulated at the calf midline with a display sensitivity 2 -5 uV/div and sweep of 1 ms/div. The sural sensory nerve reference values 
for amplitude is a lower limit (3
rd percentile) of 4 uV (onset -to-peak) and 4 uV (peak -to-
peak); and for latency is an upper limit (97th percentile) of 3.6 ms (onset) and 4.5 ms 
(peak). NCS assessment of the tibial motor nerve involves electrode placement at the medial foot (slightly anterior/inferior to the navicular tubercle) and more distally at the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint for a distance of approximately 8cm; the nerve is stimulated at the ankle (posterior to the medial malleolus) and knee (at the midpopliteal fossa) with a display sensitivity 5 mV/div and sweep of 5 ms/div. The tibial motor nerve reference values for distal amplitude is a lower limit (3
rd percentile) of 4.4 mV across all 
ages; and for distal latency is an upper limit (97th percentile) of 6.1 ms.  
Tw
o skin  biops ies will be obtained as 4-5 mm punch biopsies at distal end of leg in sural 
nerve territory (10cm above lateral malleolus)  and in the upper thigh. As described in a 
review by [CONTACT_892268]  (2007) ,31 biopsied tissue will be cut into 50 uM sections 
which will be hematoxylin and eosin stained and also immunostained with an antibody 
to PGP (protein gene product) 9.5, a neuron - and neuroendocrine cell -specific ubiquitin 
carboxy -terminal hydrolase expressed throughout the peripheral nervous system. Slides 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_892269] ([CONTACT_52449] and/or  [CONTACT_892280]) in order  to count 
PGP9.5 -positive fibers as they cross the dermal -epi[INVESTIGATOR_892256] (IENF/mm).  Additional staining will be done as indicated.  Routine

6.0 Analytic Plan  
6.1 Sample Size and Power 
6.1.1  Primary outcome:  
This current study will enroll a sample size of [ADDRESS_1249791] an 80% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.73 (unit: standard deviation [SD]) when comparing TIPN 
patients to that historical data. We have per mission to utilize  historical data 
(primary data)  collected from healthy patients  which found that  the mean and SD  
of the t ibial nerve CSA were 14.2 and 4.4 mm2, respectively  (published by 
[CONTACT_892267]., 2008) . Assuming the same SD in TIPN patients, we  will have 
more than 80% power to detect a difference of 3.2 mm2 for the t ibial nerve.  
Based on Riazi et al. (2012),[ADDRESS_1249792] sufficient power for this 
analysis.  
6.1.2  Secondary outcome: 
In historical data collected from healthy patients (Cartwright et al., 2008),[ADDRESS_1249793] deviation (SD) of the sural nerve CSA were 5.[ADDRESS_1249794] Comprehensive Cancer Center  (WFBCCC) 
CCCWFU # [ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol version date 05/09/18  Page 18 of 39 80% p
ower to detect a detectable difference of 1.[ADDRESS_1249795] (two-sample t -test selected as primary 
data from the historical control patients is available and will be used for analysis) .  We 
will also compare the nerve CSA  in our study sample to that in the historical diabetic 
neuropathy patients and historical oxaliplatin neuropathy patients  using one- sample t -
test.  The general linear model will be used to evaluate any factors (e.g., age) that may 
be associated with the nerve CSA. Due to the limited sample size, no more than two 
covariates will be included in the model.  
6.3 Analysis of Secondary Outcome 
The analysis of sural sensory nerve CSA will be the same as that specified for primary 
outcome. To exam ine the associations between nerve CSA  and NCS  measures , the 
self-reported neuropathy scale, and intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_192102], Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient will be used.  The general linear model will be also used to evaluate the association after adjusting for one or two risk factors (e.g., age). Nerve CSA will be treated as the dependent variable. NCS  measures , the self -reported 
neuropathy scale, and intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_892257].  They will be fitted in the model one at a time. 
6.4 Analyses of Exploratory Outcomes  
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient will be used to assess the associations between activated mast cells in skin biopsies, serum inflammatory markers, severity of symptoms, and primary outcome and secondary outcomes in TIPN patients.

Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements 
Thi
s document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any  grade 5 (death during protocol intervention) SAEs 
on CCCWFU Institutional  interventional  trial patients . There are multiple entities that require 
reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is reported.  
Ru
les used  by [CONTACT_39785] e ntities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), Ad EERS, MedWatch, etc.) should 
NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be considered.  
As defined in the NCI D ata Table 4  reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional  Interventional  
studies covered by [CONTACT_399348]: In -house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, implementation, and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial initiated by [CONTACT_399349].   
Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Institutional 
protocols are labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as 
Institutional.  
Th
e STRC is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional Interventional studies, as 
defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these trials be reported to the STRC  for review. All Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPD M) 
staff members assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_892260] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648]  (or in -person) , 
followed by [CONTACT_399350].  
TH
ESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the study team 
for a CCCWFU Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported.

Protocol version date 03/02/18 Page 36 of 39 What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure ? 
Any unexpected grade 4  event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention ) 
should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study 
treatment or if they occur within [ADDRESS_1249802] study treatment (even if patient begins a new treatment during the 30 days). This window of [ADDRESS_1249803] that a shorter window can be used to identify events.  In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is unexpected it should be reported.  
Table 1: Summary of STRC Repor ting Requirements for Institutional Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase 1, Phase [ADDRESS_1249804] be specified in 
the text of the approved protocol.  
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1.Make a phone call (or speak in person)  to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as
listed below (page if necessary) —see note [ADDRESS_1249805] knowledge of the event. This
form is  found at either the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_892275]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx .
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team
members and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of yourADVERSE EVENT

Definition of Unavailable:   
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_399353] a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact [CONTACT_399354].  Give the back -up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone call  or page before contact[CONTACT_399355]. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact [CONTACT_380247].  If the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC notification form.  The important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and 
document that you have initiated some type of contact [CONTACT_672057].  
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made  
and further communi cation directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the 
right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator. STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
Is there a ny immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the 
information provided in the STRC report – and if so an immediate suspension of enrollment 
should take place.  
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply all pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report. Go to the original email that 
was received by [CONTACT_399357] “reply to all” and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list date 
of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the additional 
information which you are reporting.

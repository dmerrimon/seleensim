STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 
placebo-controlled , dose-optimized, phase [ADDRESS_374426] the following periods: 
1)Screening Period; up to 28 days;
2)3-day Washout Period for washout and collection of baseline -information. Some
medications may require a washout period greater than 3-days or"'a""aose taper, depending
on the product labelling recommendations;
3)Open-label. Dose-Optimization Period; up to a 7-week, open-label, dose-optimization
period during which subjects will be titrated from a starting dose of 25 mg/day up to his/her
optimal dose (25, 35, 45, 55, 70, 85, or 100 mg/day), and will include one half day
evaluation in a practice ALC;
4)Double-blind Treatment Period; 1-week double-blind treatment period which will include
one full day evaluation in an ALC;
Safety Follow-up Period; 7-day safety follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.
Screening Period (Visit 1, Day -28 to Day -4) 
Any protocol-specific activity which is not part of the normal clinical practice of the site must be 
performed only after obtaining the subject's consent. The screening period may take up to 28 days. 
However, there is no minimum number of days for screening, and subjects may start washout as 
soon as eligibility is confirmed. 
Following receipt of informed consent, the following procedures and assessments will be done: 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, psychiatric history, diagnosis of ADHD using the Diagnostic and 
Statistica l Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) structured clinical interview (SCID-5-CT), 
demographics, medical and medication history including current pharmacological and non­
pharmacologica l treatment for ADHD, physical examination including height and weight, vital signs 
(while seated), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests including urine drug 
screen, serology, urine pregnancy test for subjects of child-bearing potential (a serum pregnancy 
test will be done only if the urine pregnancy test is positive), a documented IQ assessment such as 
the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence II (WASl-11) or Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test­
Second Edition (KBIT-2), and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), 
Baseline/Screening version. Positive findings for suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behaviors are 
exclusionary. Appropriate interventions and follow-up measures will be implemented in such cases. 
Washout Period (Day -3 to Day -1) 
After receipt of all the test results and confirmation that a subject is eligible to participate in the 
stud , eli ible sub·ects who are current! takin an medication for the treatment of ADHD will be in

a washout period of three days prior to the baseline visit (Day 0). Some medications may require a 
washout period greater than 3-days or a dose taper, depending on the product labelling 
recommendations. All pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD must be 
discontinued during the washout period and for the duration of the study. 
Baseline (Visit 2; Day 0) 
Baseline will include the following procedures: confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria; sitting 
vital signs, weight; 12-lead ECG; urine pregnancy test (if applicable), ADHD-RS-IV; one PERMP 
Placement Test; Clinical Global Impressions- Severity (CGI-S); C-SSRS suicidality assessment; 
concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs). Study medication will be dispensed. 
Open-label Dose-optimization Period (Day 1 -Day 49; Week 1 -Week 7) 
Following initial dosing with [ADDRESS_374427] reaches his/her optimal dose and has been on his/her optimal dose for at least 
one week, they will be eligible to attend a half day practice ALC. The visit schedule below is an 
illustration for subjects who participate in the full 7 weeks of dose-optimization. 
Clinic Visits: Visit 3 (Day 7 -1, + 3); Visit 4 (Day 14 -1, + 3), Visit 5 (Day 21 -1, + 3), Visit 6 (Day 28 
-1, + 3), Visit 7 (Day 35 -1, + 3), Visit 8 (Day 42 -1, + 3)
Telephone Contact: [CONTACT_2006] 4, Day 11, Day 18, Day 25, Day 32, Day 39, Day 46 
Half Day Practice ALC Visit and Randomization: Visit 9 (Day 49 + 3) 
Administration of daily open-label study medication will begin on Day 1 (the day following the 
baseline visit) and continue up to randomization (for example, subjects who optimize to PRC-063 
100 mg will take open-label study medication up to Day 49 [end of Week 71). During the open-label 
dose-optimization period of up to [ADDRESS_374428] will administer the study medication once a 
day at home in the morning. On the half da ractice ALC visit, study medication will be 
administered b clinic ersonnel 
Subjects will return to the clinic every week. At clinic visits, subjects will be adjusted to the next 
available dose at weekly intervals, until their optimal dose is reached. Optimal dose will be defined 
as the dose that will produce a reduction in ADHD-RS-IV score 2: 30% from Visit 2, and CGI I score 
of [ADDRESS_374429] their dose further 
optimized. If a higher dose is not tolerated , subjects may step down 1 dose level. Tolerability will 
be determined by [CONTACT_093], based on review of AEs and clinical judgment. Once reached, 
the optimal dose will be maintained for the remainder of the dose-optimization period, and this dose 
will be used in the double-blind period.

assessment,  drug accountability, concomitant medications ; and AEs.  
End of Study Asses s
ments  
End of study assessments will occur during the full day ALC  visit after the 6- hour post -dose 
assessment , or within three days after the  last dose of study medication.  For subjects who 
discontinue from the study early, end of study assessments should be performed at the time of 
discontinuation or within three days after the last dose of study medication.   
Safety Follow -up

STUDY EVALUATIONS:   
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
•Post-dose PERMP -T scores measured on the full day ALC visit
•
Safet
y Endpo
ints: 
•AEs, , weight, suicidality - assessed using C -SSRS,
concomitant medications/therapy, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs .
STATISTICAL METHODS: 
The primary efficacy analysis will use a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM)  which 
includes the full day  ALC visit PERMP-T scores from each time point as the multivariate normally 
distributed dependent variable. The independent variables in the model include fixed effects for 
treatment (2 levels), time ( [ADDRESS_374443]-dose times), treatment -by-time interaction, investigative site 
(number of sites), and covariate terms for the pre- dose PERMP-T score and pre- dose PERMP-T 
score -by-time int eraction (which allows the pre- dose covariate parameter to change over time). An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance among the repeated 
measures . However, in the unlikely event that  the model does not converge, an alternative 
covariance matrix will be used which is appropriate for the repeated measurements (e.g., 
heterogeneous first-order autoregressive).  Since this is a repeated measures analysis with 
potential missing data, the Ken ward- Roger approximation will be used for calculating the 
denominator degrees of freedom and adjusting standard errors. The Full Analysis population will 
be used to generate the primary efficacy results and the Per -Protocol population will be used to 
provi de supportive information.  The repeated measures model -adjusted means (LS -means) for 
PRC -[ADDRESS_374444] with an overall 5% significance 
level to evaluate efficacy. The estimated difference of the two LS -means provides  an overall 
treatment effect across the entire 1 6-hour ALC  evaluation, and an accompanying 95% confidence 
interval will portray the precision of the estimated effect . The null and alternative hypotheses used 
to evaluate efficacy for the primary endpoint are:  
•Null hypothesis: The gr
oup means for PRC -063 and placebo are equal.
•Alternative hypothesis:  The group means for PRC -[ADDRESS_374445] 
deviation of 75, a total sample size of 200 (100 per treatment group) randomized subjects is 
sufficient to achieve at least 90% power with a 0.05, two- sided significance level. Approximately 
250 subjects will enter the dose- optimization period to allow for an expected dropout rate of 20% 
prior to randomization. A blinded sample size re- estimation will be performed when approximately  
75% of the planned randomized subjects have completed their full  day ALC visit.

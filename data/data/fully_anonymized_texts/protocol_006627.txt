1. Abstract 
a. Provide no more than a one page r esearch abstract briefly stati ng the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importa nce of the research. 
Verbal communication greatly affects people’s autonomy and is d irectly related to how they perceive their quality 
of life (Hess, 2005).  The need for effective communication is heightened during critical illness.  Critically ill 
patients requiring mechanical ventilation often need an endotra cheal tube or a tracheostomy tube.  When a patient 
is intubated, communication is o ften accomplished through facia l expressions, gestures, and/or writing, depending 
on the person’s neurological status and sedation level (Batty, 2009).  However, these simple modes of communication are not always eff ective and can often result in frustration for the patie nt (Patak et al., 2006). 
 
A benefit of tracheostomy over an endotracheal tube is that it may facilitate the ability to communicate by 
[CONTACT_43172].  Add itionally, when a pers on receives a tracheo stomy tube, several methods used to elicit 
phonation can be utilized, including the use of a one-way speak ing valve, leak speech, and digital occlusion.  All 
of these methods require toleration of cuff deflation (Batty, 2 009; Astrachan, Kirchner, & Goodwin, Jr., 1988; 
Hess, 2005; Nomori, 2004).  Unf ortunately, some critically ill mechanically ventilated patients cannot tolerate cuff 
deflation despi[INVESTIGATOR_43166].  Uniquely designed 
tracheostomy tubes are available that enable speech and do not require cuff deflatio n.  These “talking 
tracheostomy tubes” are rarely used because of a general lack o f awareness among care providers.  However, 
recently, at the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], there has been an incr ease in the use of these tu bes to facilitate speech.  
One of the tubes that has proven to be effective is the Bluelin e Ultra Suctionaid (BL[LOCATION_003]). 
 In 2010, we conducted a retrosp ective review of 4 cases and fou nd that BL[LOCATION_003] tracheostomy helped facilitate 
communication in this unique population (IRB #: NA_00041547).  Now, we would like to formally conduct a 
prospective study to evaluate the outcomes of patients using a BL[LOCATION_003] using a pretest-po sttest research design. 
 
Identifying the predictors of intelligibility and the impact of  BL[LOCATION_003] on Quality of Life (QOL) and 
communication will promote communi cation between patients and h ealthcare providers.  This empowers patients 
and allows healthcare staff to obtain a more accurate assessmen t of patients’ condition an d tailor care accordingly.

2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
 
Specific Aim 1: Deter mine the impact of a BL[LOCATION_003] on QOL in patie nts requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43167] 1a: The mean health-re lated QOL scores of patients w ho use BL[LOCATION_003] will be signifi cantly higher compared 
to patients who do not use BL[LOCATION_003]. Hypothesis 1b: The mean voice-re lated QOL scores of patients wh o use BL[LOCATION_003] will be significantly higher compared 
to patients who do not use BL[LOCATION_003]. Specific Aim 2: Determine the outcomes of communication followi ng the use of BL[LOCATION_003] in patients requiring 
prolonged mechanical ventilation in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hypothesis 2:  Effectiv eness of communication in patients who u se BL[LOCATION_003] will be significantly improved compared 
to patients who do not use BL[LOCATION_003]. 
Research Question 2a: What is the time to speech among patients  who are unable to speak using a speaking valve? 
Research Question 2b: What is the frequency and duration of spe ech with use of BL[LOCATION_003]? 
Specific Aim 3: Identify the pr edictors of intelligibility in p atients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Hypothesis 3: Several factors su ch as age, sex, educational lev el, primary diagnosis, i ndications for mechanical 
ventilation, indication for tracheostomy, co-morbidities, and severity of illness will significantly contribute to speech 
intelligibility in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Specific Aim 4: Validate the sp eech item in the health-related QOL instrument to evaluate speech as a domain of QOL 
in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_43167] 4: The mean health-re lated QOL scores will moderatel y correlate negatively w ith mean voice-related QOL 
(VR-QOL) questionnaire  (criterion validity). 
 
3. Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinica l data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other rele vant information to justify t he research) 
1. Abstract from the prior study (IRB #: NA_00041547) that got acc epted for publication in Journal of Medical 
Speech-Language Pathology: 
Purpose: To describe the types of talking tracheostomy tubes av ailable, present four case studies of critically ill 
patients who used a specialized tracheostomy tube to improve sp eech, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, 
propose patient selection criteria, and provide practical recom mendations for medical care providers. 
Method: Retrospective chart review of patients who underwent tr acheostomy in 2010.   
Results: Of the 220 patients wh o received a tracheostomy in 201 0, 164 (74.55%) recei ved a percutaneous 
tracheostomy and 56 (25.45%) r eceived an open tracheostomy.  Am ong the percutaneous tracheostomy patients, 
speech-language pathologists were consulted on 113 patients, 74  of whom were on a ventilator.  Four of these 74 
patients received a talking tracheostomy tube, and all four wer e able to speak successfully  while on the mechanical 
ventilator even though they were unable to tolerate cuff deflat ion. 
Conclusions: Talking tracheostomy tubes allow patients who are unable to tolerate cuff deflation to achieve phonation.  
Our experience with talking tracheostomy tubes suggests that cl inicians should consider their use for patients who 
cannot tolerate cuff deflation. 
 
2. Additionally, over the last couple  of years, the use of BL[LOCATION_003] has increased dramatically  at the Johns Hopkins 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

e. Justification for inclusio n of a placebo or non-treatment group . N/A 
 
f. Definition of treatment failure or  participant re moval criteria . 
If there is a change in clinical condition that prevents study team from continuing with t he BL[LOCATION_003] trial or if the 
patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the patient will be dr opped from the study.  
 
g. Description of what happens to pa rticipants receiving therapy w hen study ends or if a 
participant’s participation i n the study ends prematurely. 
If participants receiving BL[LOCATION_003] c omplete the study (after the p ost-assessment), they will continue to use BL[LOCATION_003] 
per our current standard of care.  If the participant’s partici pation using BL[LOCATION_003] ends prematurely due to change in 
clinical condition, then they will be dropped from the study.  But if their condition impr oves and warrants reuse of 
BL[LOCATION_003], they will be off ered BL[LOCATION_003] per our s tandards of care but will not be re-enrolled in the study.

d) Statistical plan including sampl e size justification and interim data analysis. 
In order to compare changes in  health-related quality of life f rom pre-assessment to pos t-assessment, we need 73 
participants in each group.  This allows for a 20% drop out rat e and is based on a sample s ize of 61 individuals in 
each group to achieve 80% power a nd a clinically meaningful 20%  increase in health-relat ed QOL mean score from 
61.16 (SD ± 21.74) to 73.38 (SD ± 26.09) based on another “Qual ity of Life in Mechanically Ventilated Patients” 
study by [CONTACT_976].  We assume a two-ta iled test with a significance l evel of α = 0.05. 
 Interim data analysis will be conducted after [ADDRESS_45381] assessm ent scores of categorical 
variables. Validation of the QOL  instrument will include calcul ation of Cronbach’s alpha, Pearson correlation, 
Kappa.  
 
e) Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
Reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_43170] a participant will inc lude 
1. change in clinical condition 
2. discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
 
8. Risks 
a. Medical risks, listi ng all procedures, thei r major and minor risks and expected frequency. 
Administration of questionnaires repeatedly can be burdensome.  In addition, questions about their quality of life 
while mechanically ventilated may be emotionally distressing. 
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks. 
If at any time the participant a ppears upset or distressed, the  interviewer will stop the interview and refer to the 
medical team providing care in t he ICU.  The interviewer will r emain with the particip ant until she or he has 
regained emotional equilibrium.  If the participant states that  he/she is tired and would lik e to rest, the  interviewer 
will stop the interview and come back at a later time to contin ue with the interview.  The participant may wish to 
withdraw from the study a nytime they choose to.

BACKGROUND  
 
In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and the Infant Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) at 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_242326] (CHONY), a peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) is a 
crucial way to provide high osmotic parental nutrition and to safely adminis ter caustic 
medications. Almost all patients admitted to these units, from the extremely low birth weight 
infant to the full -term infant with congenital heart defects, require a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601112]. The dwelling times for a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601113] 7 days 
to as long as 5 months according to an in -patient chart review. Maintenance of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_601114], phlebitis, th rombosis, infiltration, catheter migration and 
catheter dislodgement. The neonatal population poses a unique challenge due to the small surface 
area of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601115], underdeveloped skin layer, and the inability to contain the child's move ments 
during a dressing change. PI[INVESTIGATOR_601116] (Sharpe et al., 2017). The PI[INVESTIGATOR_601117]/dislodgement mostly occurs 
during PI[INVESTIGATOR_601118] (Acun e t al., 2020). Inadvertent 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_601119] a peripheral vein as a result of dressing 
changes, increases PI[INVESTIGATOR_601120] 3 to 8 times (Sharpe, 2014).  
In our NICU/ 9North ICCU, the policy for PI[INVESTIGATOR_601121] 7 days or 
whenever the integrity of the dressing is compromised (see the attached document for the NICU 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_601122]). Integrity is often compromised as a result of blood at the 
insertion site or lack of adherence  of the dressing to the skin. For patients in the NICU/9 North 
ICCU, it is a common observation that PI[INVESTIGATOR_601123] a result of frequent dressing changes. Medical tissue adherence glue, Cyanoacrylate, has been  
safely used for hemostasis, wound closure, or fistula repair (ASGE, 2013; Nose et al. 2016) and 
has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of catheter migration and insertion site 
bleeding of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601124] (Bierlaire et al., 2021; 
D’Andrea et al., 2021; Kleidon et al., 2017; Ostroff et al, 2020; Scoppettuolo et al., 2013). One 
of the tissue adhesive glues on the [LOCATION_003] market is SecurePortIVTM by [CONTACT_601163]®. 
This product is the first FDA appr oved cyanoacrylate that is intended to secure venous catheters 
including PI[INVESTIGATOR_601125] (Guido et al., 2020). This product is a mixture formula of n -butyl and octyl 
cyanoacrylate that provides prevention of bleeding at the insertion site, a microbial barrier from a 
mechanical seal at the insertion site, and securement of both the catheter at the insertion site and 
the catheter hub (Guido et al., 2020). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_601126], there is 
still a gap of knowledge for our NICU to confidently adopt cyanoacrylate glue as our standard 
practice of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601127]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
this FDA approved medical tissue adhesive glue applied to PI[INVESTIGATOR_601128] r educe catheter 
migration. This study will focus strictly on those patients admitted to the 9 North ICCU who 
require PI[INVESTIGATOR_601125].  
 
RESEARCH AIMS & ABSTRACTS  
 
Research Question(s)/Hypothesis(es):  
Research question: Does the use of a cyanoacrylate glue effect the interval time between 
routine PI[INVESTIGATOR_601129] 9 North ICCU?  
 
Hypotheses:  
The application of micro drops of cyanoacrylate glue at the insertion sites prior to 
dressing a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601130] a standard transparent polyurethane film dressing will increase the 
longevity of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_601131].  
 
Scientific Abstract:  
The most common complication related to PI[INVESTIGATOR_601132] a catheter 
migration in the neonatal population. Frequent PI[INVESTIGATOR_601133] a commonly observed 
culprit of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601134]. This study is a randomized control study to 
investigate an application of a cyanoacrylate glue to determine its impact on the duration of the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_601135]. All patients in 9 North ICCU with 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_601136].  
Once patients needing a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601137], they will be randomly assigned to 
two groups: control and study. The control group will receive the current standard method of 
securing a PI[INVESTIGATOR_67688]. The study group will receive a new way of se curing PI[INVESTIGATOR_601138] a 
cyanoacrylate glue in addition to a transparent film dressing over the PI[INVESTIGATOR_601139].  
The subjects who do not participate in the research will receive regular medical care. 
Also, NICU providers who perform a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601140] a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601141] t he acceptability of 
the use of the glue. The survey will be filled out voluntarily.  
If the application of cyanoacrylate glue at the insertion site demonstrates an increase in 
longevity of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601142] a reduction of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601143], then its use can be 
incorporated as a standard care of neonatal PI[INVESTIGATOR_601144] e in 9 North ICCU.  
 
Study Design:  
The proposed study is a randomized control study with aimed data collection of 60 
subjects; of the [ADDRESS_796059] data are to be used for statistical analysis and additional 
10 subjects to account for withdrawals.  
The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one (the control group) 
receiving our standard PI[INVESTIGATOR_601145] (the study group) receiving 
cyanoacrylate glue at the PI[INVESTIGATOR_601146] a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601147] h a standard 
transparent film dressing. The control group will reflect our standard practice of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601148] a standard transparent polyurethane film dressing, 3MTMTegadermTM 
Film. The study group will reflect the application of micro  drops of cyanoacrylate glue, 
SecurePortIVTM by [CONTACT_601163]® at the insertion sites prior to dressing a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601149] a standard transparent polyurethane film dressing. The data will be collected from the 
electronic medical records. This stud y will be conducted in the 9 North Infant Cardiac Care unit 
at CHONY.  
Sample : Patients in the [ADDRESS_796060] a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601150].  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria : 
Inclusion : All patients admitted to the [ADDRESS_796061] a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601151] a NICU provider.  
Exclusion : Any patient with a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601152]. Any patient 
with a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601153], namely the interventional radiology 
department. Any patient with a PI[INVESTIGATOR_601154], such as Vygon 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_601155] -Cava catheter because of limited accuracy of measuring a movement of the catheter 
migration after 25 centimeter mark due to absence of a centimeter mark on the catheter.  
 
Study variables : 
Independent variables : Gestational age, Postconceptural  age, Sex, Diagnosis, Catheter 
size, PI[INVESTIGATOR_601156], Cyanoacrylate glue, and 3MTMTegadermTM Film dressing.  
Dependent variables : The interval of time between initial insertion and first dressing 
change, the interval of time between dressing changes after the first dressing change, and the 
incidence of catheter migration from the initial documented insertion measurement.  
 
Statistical analysis plan:  
Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_601164] T -test to compare control group (standard 
transparent film dressing, 3MTMTegadermTM Film) and study group (micro drops of 
cyanoacrylate glue in addition to the standard transparent film dressing) on the interval of time 
between each dressing change and the incidence of catheter migration.  
Also, multiple general linear regression will be used to control for the effects of potential 
covariates (age, sex, diagnosis, catheter size, & PI[INVESTIGATOR_601156]) on the outcome.  
As per our CLABSI (central line -associated bloodstream infections) surveillance quality 
assurance data of PI[INVESTIGATOR_601157] [ADDRESS_796062] deviation of 1.66 days. Our hypothesis (Hypothesis I) is 
that using the cyanoacrylate glue, we expect that the day of first dressing change will be 
significantly longer, approaching [ADDRESS_796063] of recommended 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_601158]. Using this information, if we were to hypothesize that using the glue 
would extend the mean dressing change to 4 days in the experimental group, assuming an alpha 
of 0.05 and Power  of 80%, we would need to include 24 study subjects in each group.  
We further hypothesize (Hypothesis II) that over the course of the stay for any patient for 
whom the glue was used, that patient will have experienced fewer dressing changes per week 
compared to patients receiving the standard care.  
Lastly, based on available quality assurance data showing the average centimeter of 
catheter migration was 0.[ADDRESS_796064] deviation of 0.777 cm, we hypothesize that 
patient receiving the cyanoacrylate glue will experience significantly reduced ca theter migration. 
Based on this assumption, if we were to aim for a mean catheter migration in a study group of 
0.25 cm, assuming an alpha of 0.05 and Power of 80%, we would need to study 25 subjects each 
group to prove this hypothesis.  
We are planning to recruit total of 60 subjects to allow for up to 10 withdrawal due to 
failure to use the glue or missing follow up data in the medical records.

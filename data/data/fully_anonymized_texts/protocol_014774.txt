1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Worldwide, nearly 1.3 million patients are diagnosed with and more than 600 000 patients die from colorectal cancer every year  (Ferlay et al , 2013). Regora fenib is a novel 
oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the a ctivity of several protein kinases, including 
kinases involved in angiogenesis, oncogenesis and tumor microenvironment (Kies et al, 2010) . Regorafenib was recently shown to provide a survival benefit in metastatic 
colorectal cancer patients who have progressed after all standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Grothey, et al). This led to its approval in September [ADDRESS_1150884], toxicities 
such as Palmar -planter erythr odysesthesia syndrome (PPES) (which occurs early in the 
first 1 -2 weeks) and fatigue have widely limited its use in the US. Multiple practices 
across the US have adopted, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_829321], various dosing or interval scheduling inc luding starting at lower doses and escalate as tolerated, every other 
week dosing intervals and other.  
 
In this study, we propose to design a novel strategy to optimize the dose of regorafenib in patients with refractory mCRC to allow maintenance of the observed benefits while improving the tolerability profile. The proposed strategy, arm A (combining A1 and A2) 
consists of starting regorafenib at 80 mg/day for 1 week (w eek1), then if no significant 
drug- related toxicities escalate to 120 mg/ day for another week (w eek 2), then again if 
no significant related toxicities escalate to a total dose of 160 mg/day (w eek 3) followed 
by a week break ( week 4 of cycle 1). If at the end of w eek 1, w eek 2 or w eek 3 toxicities 
are unacceptable as defined by [CONTACT_1758], t he decision will be to deescalate by 40 mg/day 
and there will be no further dose escalations. A comparative arm , arm B (combining B1 
and B2) will include a standard dose/schedule regorafenib of a 160 mg/day starting on day 1 of cycle 1. The primary goal of this study is to compare the proportions of patients 
on each arm who complete 2 cycles of protocol treatment and initiate cycle 3.  We will 
also assess other outcome and quality of life measures and toxicity profile with a focus on 
regorafenib related toxi cities. We will also assess a potential strategy to reduce the 
severity of PPES. Additionally, we will perform limited PK analysis in both arms. 
 
To explore a potential strategy to reduce the severity of PPES,  Clobetasol 0.05% cream 
for first 12 w eeks will  be prophylactically applied to palms and soles of patients in arm 
A1 and (pre -emptive strategy). Patients in arm A2 and B2 will be treated per investigat or 
discretion when they develop PPES (reactive strategy). All patients will be required to fill 
HFS14 quality of life questionnaire on C1D14, C2D1, C2D1 4, and C2D28 intervals.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1150885] prevalent QOL issues with 
these patients are fatigue, pain, weight loss, and other symptoms, as well as more general aspects of QOL such as ability to enjoy life and contentedness in QOL (Odom et. al. 2010).  We hypothesize that patients receiving regorafenib will 
experience greater deficits in QOL as reflected by [CONTACT_829343]14, the BFI and the LASA.  These questionnaires have specific application to this population. 
 
The HSF14 has been specifically designed to capture changes in QOL related to PPES. Cronbach’s alpha for this questionnaire is 0.93. It involves 14 questions 
RU021407I 5  Addendum 6  
 
with three domains:  hand, feet, and social. The final score for this questionnaire 
ranges from 2 -100, where a higher score indicates greater QOL impairment 
(Sibaud et. al., 2011). For comparison to other QOL questionnaires, the HSF14 
will be converted to a 0 -100 scale, where a higher score indicates better QOL.  
 
The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), a 9-item questionnaire, has been valida ted as 
a short and comprehensive instrument to assess severity of fatigue and fatigue-
related impairment in cancer patients.  The reliability estimated with Cronbach’s 
alpha ranges from 0.[ADDRESS_1150886]- reliability (mean scores 
of 0.93) and impairment (mean scores of 0.87) for the German version and 
reliability with Cronbach’s alpha at 0.96 for the Japanese version. Minor 
differences were seen in the validation of the German version compared to the 
original version. 
 
Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA) items have been validated as general 
measures of global QOL dimensional constructs in numerous settings (Grunberg 
et al., 1996; Gudex et al, 1996; Hyland et al., 1996; Srivatanakul, 1983; Wewers, 1990). A series of LASA items have been constructed and validated at Mayo 
Clinic  for use in cancer patients (Bretscher et al, 1999). These items have been 
seen to be important prognostic factors for cancer patient survival and should be included as covariates in surv ival analysis (Sloan, JCO, 2012).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1150887] been assessed 
pharmacokinetically in several phase I studies, both with regorafenib dosed 21 
days on/7 days off (Mross K et al. 2012; Strumberg D et al. 2012; Sunakawa Y et 
al. 2014), and with continuous dosing (Kies MS et al. 2010; Finn RS et al.  2013). 
Based on safety, efficacy and PK analysis (higher exposure o n dosing days), the 
final dose taken into phase III studies was 160 mg 21 days on/[ADDRESS_1150888] absorbed after oral administration with median 
t
max of 3 to 4 hours, and mean C max of 2.5 mg/L. Steady- state is expected to occur 
within [ADDRESS_1150889] administration. The overall mean terminal half -life at 
steady state is 20 -30 hours, with a t max,ss of 5 hrs. Mean C max,ss and AUC (0-24)ss 
with 160 mg dosing were 3.9 mg/L and 58.3 mg•h/L. In the dose escalation phase 
I studies, r egorafenib PK at doses above 60 mg was less than dose proportional. 
Accumulation of regorafenib from day 1 to day 21 was consistent with linear pharmacokinetics (Mross K, et al . 2012). 
 
Regorafenib has [ADDRESS_1150890] elimination half- lifes of 20 -30 hrs, the M5 active metabolite has a 
half-life of 60 hrs (range 40-100 hrs). 
 Regorafenib and its active metabolites have substantial variability in their plasma 
exposure – expressed as either the maximum concentration shortly after 
administration (C
max) or the area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) – 
after oral regorafenib administration. The coefficient in variation (standard 
RU021407I 6  Addendum 6  
 
deviation/mean) of C max ranges from 61.9% to 173.5%, showing considerable 
interpatient variability in the absorption.  This is not unexpected since 
regorafenib’s absorption is influenced by [CONTACT_829344] (Section 
15.15). Similarly, the AUC has substantial variability with the CVs ranging from 
77.8 to 182.4%. This i s also not unexpected since regorafenib undergoes 
enterohepatic recirculation, and is susceptible to a multitude of drug interactions 
since it is a CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 substrate (Section 15.15). Furthermore, 
within -patient variability is present such that an  individual patient can have dose -
to-dose variability in their pharmacokinetics.   
 
No relationship was suggested between AUC or C max of regorafenib, M2 or M5 
and adverse events in phase 1 trials, but it was suggested that an exposure of ≥ 60 
mg daily of re gorafenib was associated with greater efficacy (regorafenib IB).  
 1.[ADDRESS_1150891] 2 cycles due to adverse events (Grothey A  et al.  2013). In 
the few phase I studies to date, small patient numbers underwent any PK 
evaluation at steady state beyond cycle 1, to understand a possible connection 
between toxicity and PK parameters.   
 Because this clinical trial seeks to optimize the regorafenib dose and overall 
exposure in patients with refractory mCRC, it is critical that we evaluate the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of regorafenib and its metabolites, and assess 
whether their PK variability is clinically relevant.  To our knowledge, no large 
pharmacokinetic correlative studies – or those studies evaluating if plasma 
regorafenib concentrations are associated with its efficacy or toxicity –have been 
conducted to date.  
 
Therefore, as detailed in Section 14.1, we have developed a clinic- friendly 
sampling schedule to collect the PK trough levels (C
min) for the study drug and its 
metabolites, to maximize patient compliance. In the low dose (dose escalation) cohort, as the regorafenib dose is planned to be escalated weekly in cycle 1 from 
80 to 120 to 160mg, trough levels will be collected on days 7, 14 and 21, when 
each regorafenib dose would be expected to reach steady state. These visi ts 
coincide with regular clinic visits for safety/toxicity evaluation. In cycle 2, PK will be collected o n days [ADDRESS_1150892] dose cohort, similar time -points for PK 
analysis were chosen.

such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669], low potency steroids, or urea- containing creams should be 
administered.  
9.41 Recommended prevention/management strategies for skin toxicities consistent with PPES 
are summarized below:  
 
Control of calluses  
 
Befor e initiating treatment with regorafenib:  
 
• Check condition of hands and feet. 
• Suggest a manicure/pedicure, when indicated.  
• Recommend pumice stone use for callus or ‘rough spot’ removal. 
 
During regorafenib treatment:  
 
• Avoid pressure points. 
• Avoid items that rub, pi[INVESTIGATOR_39670]. 
 
Use of creams  
 
• Over the counter moisturizing creams or ointments are allowed , but patients cannot 
apply these within 1 hour before and after clobetasol applications.  
• For grades 2 or 3, t opi[INVESTIGATOR_39671] (e.g. lidocaine 5% patches, lidocaine/prilocaine 
cream TID, lidocaine 2-5% creams) are to be considered for pain control. 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39672] 0.05% should be instituted  for subjects with 
Grade 2 or 3 PPES (in reactive arm). Avoid systemic steroids.  
• For gr ade 2/3 Oral NSAIDs (celecoxib, ibuprofen) may be used for pain control  
• Continue clobetasol during dose interruptions or decreased dosing/rechallenge  
• Continue analgesia with topi[INVESTIGATOR_829324]/re challenge  
 
  
RU021407I       24   Addendum 6 
 
  Tender areas should be protected as follows:  
 
• Use of thick socks/gloves to cover moisturizing creams 
• Wear well -padded footwear 
• Use insole cushions or inserts (e.g. silicon, gel)  
• Foot soaks with tepid or cool water  
• Use soft shoes or slippers (Crocs, TempurPedic slippers), avoid high heels and wood 
soles/heels  
 
Suggested PPES Reaction Treatment  
 
• CTCAE v4 Grade 1 ((Minimal skin changes or dermatitis (e.g., erythema, edema or 
hyperkeratosis) without pain)) - Continue regorafenib at current dose.   
• CTCAE v4 Grade 2 ((Skin changes (e.g., peeling, blisters, bleeding, edema, or hyperkeratosis) with pain, limiting instrumental ADL  (or intolerable grade 2, defined 
as grade 2 AE that does not decrease to grade ≤1 after 2 weeks of therapy OR that is conside red intolerable per patient)) – See Section 8.33.  
 Oral (NSAIDs or narcotics) OR topi[INVESTIGATOR_767168] (lidocaine cream or  patches

9.5 Prevention/management strategies for diarrhea: Diarrhea can be a common side effect of  
regorafenib. The same dose -modification algorithm used for skin toxicities can be used to address 
these toxicities.  However, the preventive/management strategies for diarrhea should be consistent 
with local standards (e.g., anti-diarrheals and optimized hydration status). Anti- diarrhea 
medications may be introduced if symptoms occur. Previous trials have shown that the diarrhea 
could be managed with loperamide. The recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_1150936] onset, 
followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea-free for 12 hours. In the event of grade 3 or 4 
diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed: hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals. 
 
Patients with severe diarrhea or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_300788].

CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_1150937] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site: ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
) 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1150938], 
identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. Next, determine 
whether the event is expected or unexpec ted (see Section 10.2) and if the adverse event is 
related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.3). With this information, 
determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.4). 
RU021407I       25   Addendum 6 
 
  Important : Expedited adverse event reporting requires submission of a MedWatch  3500A 
report(s). Expedited reports are to be completed within the timeframes and via the 
mechanisms specified in Sections 10.[ADDRESS_1150939] also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by 
[CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.5 and 18.0). 
 10.[ADDRESS_1150940] Level Term (LLT).  
 
• NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT  the same as 
serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent-specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information provided in Section 15.0 
of the protocol. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experie nce that is neither identified 
in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the 
following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s ). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical 
treatment suggest there is eviden ce to indicate a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event.

Exceptions to Expedited Reporting: EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events  
 
An expedited report may not be required for specific Grade 1, [ADDRESS_1150941] Expedited Adverse Event 
Reporting Requirements:  
Note:  These exceptions only apply if the adverse event does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 If the adverse event results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], then the standard expedited adverse events

10.311 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital abnormities or birth defects, must be reported immediately if they occur at any time 
following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a 
serious AE and must be reported to the sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b) . 
 
  
RU021407I       27   Addendum 6 
 
  10.312  Death  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1150943] dose, regardless of 
attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24 -hours.  
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI 
IND/IDE  requires expedited reporting within 24 -hours. 
 
• Reportable categories of Death  
 
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_829349] 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a 
CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (defined as instant or within one 
hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 
5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benigh, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ 
class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes 
suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration 
associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
  
10.313 Secondary Malignancy 
 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, 
radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a 
metastasis of the initial neoplasm . 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an IND/IDE to be reported. Three options are available to describe the 
event:  
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplasti c syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
 
10.314  Second Malignancy  
 
• A second mali gnancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy 
(and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies 
require ONLY routine reporting.

NOTE:  This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote for the table 
regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_459] (R ECIST) guidelines (version 1.1) (Eisenhauer et 
al., 2009) . Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the 
short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline. 
 
RU021407I       31   Addendum 6 
 
  11.1 Schedule of Evaluations:  For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every [ADDRESS_1150949] diameter can be 
accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_1150950] x-ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_1150951] 
component of a PET/CT, or MRI. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1150952] diameter is ≥ 1.0 cm in 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging.  In the ca se of 
skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_1150953] scan (CT scan slice thick ness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm).  
 
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
 
11.221 All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non- measurable disease, 
including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis , inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable as well.  
 
Note:  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition o f measurability described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for se lection as target lesions.  In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 
cm are considered non pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or followed. 
 11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
11.31 Measurement Methods:   
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of 
centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. For patients having 
only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_1150954]- treatment tumor assessments.   
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_711105] a 
treatment.   
 
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:  
• Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_1150955] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion sh ould be 
twice the slice thickness.   
RU021407I       32   Addendum 6 
 
  • As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  
The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence.  Ideally, the same type of 
scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely 
as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
• PET-CT: If the site can d ocument that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.   
• Physical Examination:  For superficial non-nodal lesions, physical examination is 
acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation: 
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met the SD 
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interva l of 8 weeks (see Section 
11.44). 
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between  response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known 
residual benign tumors can remain.) 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1150956]  
 
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline.  These lesions can be non -nodal or nodal (as defined 
in 11.21), where no more than 2 lesions are from the same organ and no more than 2 
malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
 
Note:  If fewer than 5 target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as there often 
will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.  
 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be sel ected on the basis of their size, be 
representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, 
the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD):  A sum of the longest diameter for all ta rget lesions 
plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD).  The BSD will be used as reference 
to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
  
RU021407I       33   Addendum 6 
 
  • Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD):  A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be 
calculated and reported as the post- baseline sum of dimensions (PB SD). If the 
radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or target 
lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_1150957] that the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 cm.  
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD ) is the minimum of the BSD and the 
PBSD.  
 
11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target lesions or non -
target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at baseline.  These les ions and lymph nodes 
should be followed in accord with 11.433.  
 11.[ADDRESS_1150958]/MRI/PET -CT/Chest 
X-ray/physical examination must be measured on re-evaluation at evaluation 
times speci fied in Section 11.1. Specifically, a change in objective status to 
either a PR or CR cannot be done without re- measuring target lesions and target 
lymph nodes. 
 
Note: Non-target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be evaluated at 
each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of 
response.  In selected circumstances, certain non -target organs may be evaluated 
less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when 
complete response is identified in target d isease or when progression in bone is 
suspected. 
 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <1.0 c m. 
 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD ( see 
Section 11.41). 
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph node 
that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1150959] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes 
at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 11.41).  In 
addition, the PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the MSD. 
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD.  
 
11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Complete Respo nse (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
b. Each non-target lymph node must have a reduction in short axis to <1.0 
cm. 
 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesions or non- target 
lymph nodes. 
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
a. At least one new malignan t lesion, which also includes any lymph node 
that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥1.0 
cm short axis during follow-up. 
b. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and non- target 
lymph nodes. (NOTE:  Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion and target lymph node status. It must be representative of overall disease status change.)

14.2 Study Methodology and Storage Information 
 
14.21 Blood/blood product samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis.  
 
PK analysis for regorafenib and M2 and M5 will be performed as follows:  
 
- Cycle 1 day 7: 0, prior to dosing (C
min, trough levels) 
- Cycle 1 day 14: 0, prior to dosing (C min, trough levels) 
- Cycle 1 day 21: 0, prior to dosing (C min, trough levels) 
- Cycle 2 day 1: 0, prior to dosing (C min, trough levels) 
- Cycle 2 day 21; 0, prior to dosing (C min, trough levels)  
- Window sampling times are predose ≤12 hours. 
 
14.211 A portion of the plasma, 0.5 ml (500 mcl), for each sample will initially be 
analyzed for the amount of  regorafenib  in [CONTACT_829366] McCu ne’s laboratory 
using standard laboratory protocols. The samples will be shipped upon request to

Accor
ding to patient consent information, remaining white blood cells /plasma 
will be stored frozen at -70/-80ºC by [CONTACT_829352].  
As protocols are developed, they will be presented for ACCRU and IRB review 
and approval. (This collection is part of a general strategy of investigation for the 
majority of ACCRU studies.) 
 
14.212 Ongoing research is likely to identify putative biomarkers for regorafenib 
efficacy and/or toxicity in the near future. Given the key importance of such 
biomarker identification, our study offers a unique opportunity to validate such 
discoveries given its size and prospective nature. As  such, and as  part of ongoing 
ACCRU research, we will collect plasma and white blood cells for future 
research studies, according to patient consent information, on molecular determinants of efficacy and tolerability.  Samples will be stored frozen at -70ºC 
by [CONTACT_829353].  As protocols are developed, they 
will be presented for ACCRU  (scientific)  and IRB r eview and approval prior to 
any samples being used .  
 
14.3 Return of Genetic Testing Research Results  
 
For this study, DNA (White Blood Cells) is only being banked, and no specific genetic testing is 
being performed. If, at any time, genetic results are obtained that may have clinical relevance, IRB 
review and approval will be sought regarding the most appropriate manner of disclosure and 
whether or not validation in a CLIA- certified setting will be required.  Sharing of research data with 
individual patients should only occur when data have been validated by [CONTACT_427951]-approved laboratories.

15.1 Regorafenib (BAY 73 -4506, Sti varga®)   
 
15.11 Background : Regorafenib is a novel oral multi -kinase inhibitor that targets tumor cells 
and the tumor microenvironment. It inhibits tumor growth, progression and metastasis by 
[CONTACT_829354], the formation of new tumor vasculature and 
stromal signaling in the microenvironment of the tumor. 
 
15.12 Formulation : Regorafenib 40- mg tablets contains regorafenib and the inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_829329], croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, povidone, colloidal 
anhydrous silica, polyvinyl alcohol-part hydrolyzed, talk, titanium dioxide E171 (color 
index [ZIP_CODE]), Macrogol/PEG [ZIP_CODE], lecithin (soy), iron oxide yellow – E172 (color index 
[ZIP_CODE]), iron oxide red – E172. 
 
Regorafenib will be provided by [CONTACT_829355], not divisible, gray -orange-red, oval 
tablets (length 16 mm, width 7 mm, thickness 4.9-5.6 mm). Tablets are in an immediate-
release dosage form with rapid dissolution characteristics under the in vitro test conditions. 
 
Regorafenib tablets will b e packaged in high density polyethylene bottles with a white 
child resistant closure and induction seal.  Each bottle includes [ADDRESS_1150967] 
identification, and quantity of tablets. 
 15.13 Preparation and storage : Once the drug has been received it must be kept in a 
secure, dry location.  Study drug must be stored in its original bottle at a temperature 
not above 25°C (77°F). The study drug must be exclusively used for the investigation specified in this protocol and it will only be accessible to authorized 
staff.  
 15.14 Administration:  Regorafenib tablets should be taken at the same time every day  with 
approximately 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of water after a low- fat (<30% fat) meal . 
Regorafenib should not be taken with grapefruit juice. 
 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a) Absorption – A high -fat meal increased the mean AUC of the parent drug by 
48% compared to the fasted state and decreased the mean AUC of the M-2 (N-
oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl) active metabolites by 20% and 51%, 
respectively.  A low- fat meal increased the mean AUC of regorafenib, M-2 and 
M-5 by 36%, 40% and 23%, respectively (as compared to the fasted state). 
b) Distribution – Regora fenib undergoes enterohepatic circulation with multiple 
plasma concentration peaks observed across the 24 -hour dosing interval. 
Regorafenib is highly bound (99.5%) to human plasma proteins. 
c) Metabolism – Regorafenib is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and UGT1A9. The main 
circulating metabolites measured at steady state are M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-
oxide and N -desmethyl), both of them having similar in vitro  pharmacological 
activity and steady -state concentrations as regorafenib.  M-2 and M-5 are highly 
protein bound (99.8% and 99.95%, respectively). 
  
RU021407I       41   Addendum 6 
 
  d) Excretion – Elimination half -lives for regorafenib and the M-2 metabolite in 
plasma are 28 hours (14 to 58 hours) and 25 hours (14 to 32 hours), respectively. 
M-5 has a longer mean (range) elimination half- life of 51 hours (32 to 70 hours). 
Elimination occurs through:  Feces (71%; 47% as parent compound; 24% as 
parent compound; 24% as metabolites); Urine (19%). 
 
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions: Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(i.e. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital and St. John’s Wort) and 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin and voriconazole).

  16.0 Statistic al Considerations and Methodolog y  
 
16.1 Study Design  
 
This is a randomized phase II study of regoraf enib starting at low dose (Arm A, combining A1 and 
A2) compared to standard dose of regorafenib (Arm B, combining B1 and B2) in patients wit h 
refractory metastatic colo rectal cancer (mCRC). Patients will be randomized 1:1 :1:1 to one of the 
following 4 arms: 
A1: Regorafenib start low dose and pre- emptive Clobetasol for PPES  
A2: Regorafenib start low dose and reactive Clobetasol for PPES  
B1: St andard dose of regorafenib and pre- emptive Clobetasol for PPES  
B2: Standard dose of regorafenib and reactive Clobetasol for PPES  
(see Schema)   
 
16.2 Sample Size, Accrual Time and Study Duration   
Accrual time is anticipated to be 18 months , with  approximately 2 months of follow-up per patient 
until occurrence of  the primary endpoint and approximately 6 months of planned follow-up overall 
per patient . The sample size will be 11 0 patients, with approximately 28 patients randomized per 
regorafenib and strateg y treatment sub -arm (A1, A2, B1, B2). An additional 13 patients overall will 
be enrolled to account for drop-out, cancel s, ineligibles, etc ., to give a total sample size of 12 3 
patients.  The total study durat ion (accrual and follow -up) is expected to be ap proximately 2 years.  
 16.3 Statement for Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients in each arm who complete 2 cycles of protocol treatment and initiate cycle 3 .  The proportion will be calculated among evaluable patients 
separat ely by [INVESTIGATOR_216]  (Arm A vs. Arm B) .  Evaluable patients are defined as patients who are eligible, 
consented, received any protocol treatment.   In the CORRECT trial, among patients who were 
randomized to regorafenib, 45% continued treatment beyond cycle 2.  Othe r than disease 
progression, majority of patients discontinued regorafenib due to adverse events not associated with progression. It was noted that most adverse events occurred during Cycles 1 -2 of the treatment 
(Grothey A et. al., 2013, Lancet). Assuming 45% of patients would complete 2 cycle s of protocol 
treatment and initiate cycle 3  in the control ( standard  dose ; pooled arms B1 andB2 ) group, and 
desiring an improvement to 63% in the experimental (starting low  dose) group (pooled arms A1 
and A2) , a one -sided test with alpha = 0.20 and power of 80 % will require a sample size of 110 
patients enrolled to both regorafenib arms  (A and B). We will enroll [ADDRESS_1150975] a difference in 
proportion of patients who complete 2 cycles of protocol treatment and initiate cycle 3 between 
arms (starting low dose [pooled arm A1 and  A2] vs. standard dose [poled arm B1 and B2]).  The 
proportion of patients who complete 2 cycles of protocol treatment and initiate cycle 3 will be computed by [CONTACT_829359] 95% confidence interval using exact method.

  16.4 Supplementary Analysis Plans (includes all secondary and translational goals) 
 
16.41 Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS 
will be estimated with Kaplan -Meier survival curves and differences between  regorafenib 
arms  (A vs. B)  tested us ing log- rank tests, though we note these analyses are not powered 
for formal non-inferiority assessments. See Section 2.21. 
 
16.42 Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of 
disease progression or death due to any cause, where progressed  disease (PD) is as defined 
by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (see Section 11.0) . PFS will be estimated with Kaplan -Meier survival 
curves and differences between  regorafenib  arms  (A vs. B)  tested using log -rank tests, 
though we note these analyses are not powered for formal non- inferiority assessments. See 
Section 2.21. 
 
16.43 Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to disease 
progression, where progressed disease (PD) is defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (see Section 11.0. 
TTP wil l be estimated with Kaplan -Meier survival curves and differences between 
regorafenib arms (A vs. B) tested using log -rank tests, though we note these analyses are 
not pow ered for formal non -inferiority assessments. See Section 2.21.  
 
16.44 The cumulative (total) dose of regorafenib received by [CONTACT_829360]  (A vs. B)  using the t- test (if approximately normally distributed) or the 
Wilcox on rank sum test (if not approximately normally distributed). Dose intensity is 
defined as the cumulative (total) dose of regorafenib divided by [CONTACT_829361].  See Section 2.22. 
 16.45 The proportion of patients overall and within each arm experiencing grade 3 or 4 HFS or 
fatigue will be computed with 95% confidence intervals, and differences between 
regorafenib dosing strategies (pooled across HFS strategies) tested using a Fisher Exact 
test. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 HFS will also be descriptively compared between those 
receiving a pre- specified preemptive vs. reactive approach for hand and foot syndrome 
(pooled across dosing strategies), and tested using a Fisher Exact test. See Section 2.[ADDRESS_1150976]. La couture of Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center 1 -2 times per month for review. 
 
16.46 Furthermore, patients will be descriptively compared between treatment arms and between 
HFS treatment strategies (pre -emptive vs. reactive) according to self -reported outcomes 
given on the HFS14 questionnaire. See Section 2.24. Results from the cycle [ADDRESS_1150977] as appropriate, as well as taking time -dependence into 
account. Changes in QOL (according to the LASA questionnaire as measured by [CONTACT_829362]) from baseline will also be compared between the treatment arms 
using the t- test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. We hypothesize that patients receiving 
regorafenib will experience greater deficits in QOL as reflected by [CONTACT_829343]14, 
the BFI and the LASA. These questionnaires have specific appl ication to this population. 
See Section 2.24.

free standards can be obtained from Bayer.   
 
After quantitation, the average regorafenib  concentration will be calculated by [CONTACT_69752] (Arm 
A vs. B) at each time point.  
 
As exploratory analysis, t his average concentration will be correlated with toxicity and 
efficacy endpoints. Further descriptive characteristics of the pharmacokinetics will also be calculated, An example includes (but is not limited to) within -patient variability in the 
trough concentrations pharmacokinetic parameters will also be calculated, both overall and within cycles, as a ratio of the maximum:minimum value.

DSMB every six months, with the first report due at the first reporting period after study initiation.  
 
16.8 Missing Data  
 
Patients with missing data will be excluded from relev ant analyses; no imputation of missing data 
will b e performed.  
 16.9 Primary Endpoint Completion Time Estimation  
 
Given 18 months of accrual and 2 months of follow-up per patient to observe the primary endpoint, 
a total of 20 months will be required to observe all primary endpoint events, with subsequen t time 
required for data cleaning and analysis (approximately 2 months).

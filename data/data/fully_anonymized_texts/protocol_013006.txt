NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/[ADDRESS_192513] approximately 
50% chance to achieve a pathological response after concurrent chemo -radiation. 
In a multi -institutional collaboration of 105 patients it was found that triple 
negative tumor carriers achieved pathological response in 54% of the cases and 
that the response reflected on 5 -year DFS and OS. Our group has speculated that 
these effects on the r isk of distant recurrence could depend on the recovery of anti -
tumor immunity among the patients achieving pathological response, after tumor 
cell death induced by [CONTACT_165994] -radiation.  
 
We are proposing a novel study that translates these findings t o the adjuvant 
setting of triple negative tumors (TN). TN breast cancer is a more aggressive form 
of the disease often coinciding with basal -like tumors. BRCA mutated -cancer is 
more frequently TN.  
 
The current protocol converges the experience NYU has deve loped in 
accelerated prone breast radiotherapy with encouraging finding from the use of 
concurrent chemoradiation in LABC.  
 
We will study the feasibility of combining weekly carboplatin with concurrent 
3-weeks prone breast radiotherapy in the adjuvant sett ing of 3 5 women with TN 
tumors, after segmental mastectomy and nodal assessment. Primary endpoint of the 
study is acute toxicity of the combined regimen, with a target of <  25% of grade II-
III dermatitis.

1.2. Secondary Objectives  
1.2.1.  To assess  QOL of  patients  at baseline and after the course of treatment . 
1.2.2.  To compare incidence of late radiation toxicity (fibrosis and telangi ectasia ) 
and to examine genetic determinants of breast fibrosis by [CONTACT_71397] . 
 
1.3. Exploratory Objectives  
1.3.1.  To assess local control rates, distant recurrence and overall survival of at 2, [ADDRESS_192517] conservation 
surgery. [1] Analysis of two prospective randomized trials that included 2644 women, selected 
based on tumor size less than five cm, negative pathological margin of excision and negative 
lymph nodes. No difference in clinical outcome was detected . The conclusion of th e review is 
that the use of unconventional fractionation regimens ( > 2 Gy per fraction) does not affect breast 
appearance or toxicity and does not seem to affect local recurrence or five -year survival rates.  
Hypo -fractionation regimens enable shortening of  the duration of therapy; the findings are 
quite relevant, since changing the standard recommendation of [ADDRESS_192518] cancer patients, s/p segmental mastectomy, found to have HR negative HER2 
negative tumors (TN).  
 
2.2. NYU Experience on Accelerated Concomitant Boost Whole Breast: NYU  03-30 
and 01 -51 
NYU 03 -30. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_165978] -fractionated Canadian trial , [2] we developed a technique  
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/[ADDRESS_192519] -operative tumor bed 
(CTV), the ipsilateral breast volume (IBV), the heart, and the lungs. The Planning Target 
Volume (PTV) was defi ned as CTV + [ADDRESS_192520] volume (RBV) was defined as 
the IBV - PTV. A dose of 40.5 Gy in 15 fractions was prescribed to the IBV. An additional 0.5 
Gy was delivered concomitantly to the PTV for a total dose of 48 Gy. The dose was determined 
by [CONTACT_165996] (BED), to match tumor control 
and risk of late effects of a standard schedule of [ADDRESS_192521] dose of 14 Gy to the tumor bed. A value for tumor  = [ADDRESS_192522] complications (fibrosis, re traction, telangiectasia).  
From September [ADDRESS_192523] 2004, the planned accrual was completed, with 90 patients 
treated in the protocol (mean follow -up of 13 months, range 1 -23 months). Median age was 58 
(range 28 -80). Median tumor size was 13 mm (range 1 -40 mm). Acute toxicity was generally 
mild and is summarized in Table 2 (RTOG score). Most common toxicity was radiation 
dermatitis, which tended to occur the week after completion of treatment.  
 
Table 1.  Acute Toxicity NYU 03 -30

Longer follow up is required to assess local control and late toxicity, likely to determine the 
cosmetic result. Because of blood collection, once sufficient time has elapsed to measure late 
effects, the study will enable to explore association between spe cific genomic profiles and the 
occurrence of fibrosis. [3] In addition, this trial has generated an invaluable repository of physics 
information from the planning and volume inclusion by [CONTACT_165997], offering the 
opportunity for an in -depth investigation of the effect of laterality when patients  are treated 
prone. [4] 
 
01-51: Accelerated Radiotherapy for DCIS  
This protocol aimed at testing the use of accelerated whole breast radiotherapy in women 
with ductal carcinoma in situ. Eligible to the trial were DCIS patients who refused conventional 
5-week radiotherapy. The trial consisted of [ADDRESS_192524] DCIS, some women were initially simulated supi[INVESTIGATOR_165979] h eart in the field were re -simulated prone and often (but 
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/2015  
 
16 of 60 not always) were found to have better normal tissue sparing when prone and were then treated 
consistently.  [5] 
 
2.3. Rationale for Prone Radiotherapy: NYU [ADDRESS_192525] approach was used, the 
same regimen originally pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested for prone IMRT. NYU Protocol #05 -181, “Accelerated 
Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (AIMRT) to the Breast after Segmental Mastectomy: 
Identification of Optimal Individual Positioning ” was opened in [ADDRESS_192526] chemotherapy (if 
indicated), with no history of prior or concurrent malignancy (within 3 years), and with no 
history of active connective tissue disorders. Patients receive d a CT simulation in the prone and 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_67529] n. Treatment followed in the optimal position defined as that which assured the 
smallest volume of heart and lung respectively, in the target field.   
Among right breast cancer patients, the prone position was optimal in sparing lung volume in 
all women, reduc ing the in -field lung volume by a mean 104.6cc (95%CI: 94.01 – 115.16) 
compared to supi[INVESTIGATOR_165980] -up. For left breast cancer patients, the prone position was optimal in 
85%, with in -field heart volume reduced by a mean of 9.9cc (95%CI: 7.37 – 12.45) and in -field 
lung volume reduced by a mean of 95.2cc (95%CI: 84.27 – 106.13). In the [ADDRESS_192527] treated supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the in -field heart volume was reduced by a mean of 6.2cc (95%CI: 2.97  –
 9.33). Only 32% of the women with breast volume <  750 cc were be tter treated supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Prone 
set-up reduced the amount of lung volume irradiated in all patients and reduced the amount of 
heart volume irradiated in 85% of left breast cancer patients. Prone was also superior to supi[INVESTIGATOR_165981] -breasted women, contrary to the common opi[INVESTIGATOR_165982] (submitted for publication).  
Based on the experience gathered from NYU Protocol [ADDRESS_192528] to freely 
fall through an opening. Only if found that conventional tangents in prone position include any 
volume of heart and/or >  5% of lung volume , a second simulation will be required in supi[INVESTIGATOR_165983].  
 
2.4. NYU 09 -0300: a prospective ra ndomized trial aimed at establishing the optimal 
boost schedule  
Solid radiobiological reasons support ed the introduction of a larger fraction dose before a 
two-day treatment break (weekend). In the context of a Phase III randomized study, we are 
studying two different boost schemas. The standard arm  is a concomitant boost protocol over 
three weeks which  has previously been evaluated in over 500 patients (NYU 03 -30 and NYU 05 -
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/2015  
 
17 of 60 181) and has shown excellent tolerance, and results. The experimental arm  evaluates a Friday 
Weekly Boost Dose ( FBD) regimen which  may have a radiobiological advantage  by 
[CONTACT_165998] . Choice of the 
technique was be randomized.  BED calculations for the standard arm using an alpha/beta ratio 
of 4 Gy, result in a BED for 3.2 Gy x 15 fx of 86 Gy 4. By [CONTACT_2163], the BEDs for  possible 
comparative experimental arms  at 2.7 Gy X 12  fx plus 3 fractions given each Friday of either 3.7 
Gy, 4.2 Gy, 4.7 Gy or 5.2 Gy would be 76, 80, 85 and 90 Gy 4, respectively. Thus, the 
experimental arm  delivers 2.7 Gy four times per week (Monday -Friday ) during the 3 weeks 
(i.e., 2.7 Gy x 1 5 fx), but with an addit ional  [ADDRESS_192529] enrolled to this protocol. CTCAE v3.0 
defined radiation dermatitis was evaluated at two month follow -up demonstrating no statistical 
difference between the two arms in RT -related acute toxicity between t erms of the two regimens

2.5. Ratio nale for concurrent chemoRT in TN tumor carriers: the LABC experience  
Triple -negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by [CONTACT_165999] (ER ), progesteron e receptor (PR), and human epi [INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
2 (HE R-2). [6-7] These cancers occur in approximately 20% to 25% of all patients with breast 
cancer, and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.  [7-9] Patients with TNBC derive no 
benefit f rom molecularly targeted treat ments such as endocrine therapy or trastuzumab, because  
they lack the appropriate targets for these drugs . 
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/2015  
 
18 of 60 Liedke et al compared the outcome 255 triple negative carriers out of 1118 treated with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy at MD Anderson cancer center (23%). [10] Patients with TNBC 
compared with non -TNBC had significantly higher pCR rates (22% v s. 11%; P <.034), but 
decreased 3 -year progression -free survival rates (P < .0001) and 3 -year Overall Survival (OS) 
rates (P < .0001). TNBC was associated with increased ris k for visceral metastases (P < 0.0005), 
lower risk for bone recurrence (P < 0.027), and shorter post -recurrence survival (P < 0.0001).  
Recurrence and death rates were higher for TNBC only in the first 3 years. If pCR was achieved, 
patients with TNBC and no n-TNBC had similar survival (P <  0.24). In contrast, patients with 
residual disease (RD) had worse OS if they had TNBC compared with non -TNBC (P <.0001).  In 
their experience patients with TNBC had increased pCR rates compared with non-TNBC, and 
those with pCR had excellent survival. However, patients with RD after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy had significantly worse survival if they have TNBC compared with non -TNBC, 
particularly in the first [ADDRESS_192532]. 
Formenti at USC, three institutions, USC, NYU and Vanderbilt reported the five years 
experience on 105 patients with LABC (White 46%, Non -White 54%) treated with paclitaxel (30

left to the discretion o f the treating physician.  Pathological response (pCR and pPR) after 
neoadjuvant chemoradiation was achieved in 36/105 patients (34%, 95% CI: 25% -44%). 
Achievement of pathologic response was associated with significantly better DFS and OS. 
Patients with pat hologic response had a lower risk of recurrence or death compared with non -

up of [ADDRESS_192534] imated 5 -
year disease -free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) are 61.4% (95% CI: 50.1 -70.8%) and 71.6% 
(95% CI: 60.5 -80.1%), respectively.

response was 54% in TN tumor carriers. 
Importantly, in this study the [ADDRESS_192535] in the survival 

NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/[ADDRESS_192536] that response to therapy was associated with certain immune signatures . [11] A 
superior outcome after concurrent versus sequential chemotherapy and radiation has been 
demonstrated in other settings. [12-16] Standar d anti -cancer modalities such as certain 
chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy are thought to generate an immunogenic cell death, 
converting the original tumor into an in situ immunogenic hub. [17-21] The consequent anti -
tumor immune response might also contro l micro -metastatic foci. Alternatively, it is possible that 
in patients achieving a pathologic response, concurrent chemoradiation successfully eradicated 
CD44+/CD24 -/low or aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)+ tumor cells, shown to possess 
tumor -initiating p otential if they persist after treatment. [22-23] RT and chemotherapy when 
given alone can enrich the population of breast cancer stem - like cells, which are resistant to 
either single modality [23-26], suggesting tha t perhaps they are sensitive to concurrent 
chemoradiation. Finally, the concurrent combination of chemoradiation could have successfully 
eliminated the subset of cancer cells later destined to become circulating cells with seeding 
potential. [27] The relevance of these findings to TN tumors, found to be potentially more 
immunogenic than the other s ubtypes of breast cancer, has justified the design of this 
protocol . 
 
2.5.1.  Rationale for carboplatin and radiation  
Triple negative breast cancer represents approximately 15% of breast cancer of all 
breast can cer cases. [28] Though the sensitivity of these tumors to platinum drugs was 
debated for a number of years only recently the abundance of both basic sc ience and limited 
clinical data lead to a consensus that these drugs play a crucial role in the treatment of these 
tumors both as management of metastatic and locally advanced disease. Patients with TN 
tumors have demonstrated sensitivity to platinum compo unds, possibly because of their 
inherent chromosomal fragility and impairment of DNA repair pathways. [29] 
The possible interaction of platinum agents and PARP inhibitors especially in cancers 
related to the BRCA mutation. So far there is paucity of data investigating the role of 
platinums in the adjuvant management of breast cancer.  
The main platinum agent established in the management of triple negative breast 
cancer is Cisplatin, fewer clini cal studies utilized carboplatin in the setting of triple negative 
disease.  
Over the last decade the difference between the [ADDRESS_192537] been debated. 
The carboplatin toxicity especially vis -a vis nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal (nausea and 
vomiting) is significantly less pronounced compared to equivalent doses of cisplatin. In other 
malignancies (testicular, ovarian cancer etc) the equivalency in efficacy are well established.  
The role of adjuvant chemoradiation in breast cancer has been studi ed mostly in small 
studies and in combinations with CMF, anthracyclines and taxanes. The possibility of better 
locoregional control is debated as well as higher toxicities (fatigue, skin toxicity).  
In the current protocol we propose the combination of plat inum containing 
chemoradiation as adjuvant therapy for patients with triple negative breast cancer.  
The 3 week radiation extensively studied in the adjuvant regimens will be combined 
with weekly carboplatin at a dose of AUC of 2 per week.

2.6. Background for P rimary Objective  
2.6.1.  Measuring Acute Toxicity  
The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) was developed in 1982 for use in adverse drug experience 
reporting, study AE summaries, Investigational N ew Drug (IND) reports to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and publications. The CTCAE v3.[ADDRESS_192538] uniform and 
comprehensive dictionary of AE grading criteria available for use by [CONTACT_166001]. A grading (sever ity) scale is  provided for each AE term.  
The terms considered in this trial are specific to radiation toxicity and include fatigue, 
radiation dermatitis and pain. This information will be collected by [CONTACT_166002] a specific tracking form (see appendix 3).  Acute Toxicity wil l be scored using the 
CTCAE v 3.0 (see A ppendix 1). 
 
2.7. Correlative Studies Background  
2.7.1.  Quality of Life Assessment  
Patients ’ quality of life assessments will be performed at regular intervals (baseline, 
last wee k of radiation treatment, 45-60 days from starting radiotherapy  and 2 -year follow -
up). QOL will be evaluated in several ways.  
First, cosmetic results will be examined using the Breast Cancer Treatment  Outcome 
Scale (BCTOS)  using patient self -reports. This brief self -report instrument has high 
reliability and validity, and has been  used in a variety of previous studies on recovery from 
breast cancer treatment. [30] The BCTOS also will be used as a primary measure to assess 
breast -related symptoms  and treatment effects. Specifically, the BCTOS will be augmented 
with a brief set of  additional items that focus on radiotherapy -relevant symptoms (e.g., 
reports  of skin pr oblems, tenderness/pain in the breast, hardness in the breast due to enhanced 
fibrosis). Second, we will use the MOS SF -36 Vitality  Scale, a widely used measure with 
high reliability and validity will assess fatigue. [31-32] 
 
2.7.2.  Measuring the late toxicities  of breast radiation  
Radiation -induced breast fibrosis is another important late effect of radiotherapy with 
a commonly reported incidence of 5 -15%. [33-34] Manifestations of radiation -induced breast 
fibrosis include pain, cosmetic deformities, and diminishe d quality of life.  Clinically, 
radiation -induced breast fibrosis is characterized by [CONTACT_166003], atrophy, toughness to 
palpation, and  decreased tissue compliance  with associated  functional limitations . Visual 
assessment and palpation are the most important clinical investigatio ns of the skin in 
radiotherapy but they are subjective and unquantitative.  
Hoeller et al . recently reported a careful comparison of The Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group (RTOG) and Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force subject ive, objective, 
management, and analytic (LENT/SOMA) scores for late breast toxicity after radiation in a 
group of breast cancer patients . [35] In comparison, when LENT/SOMA criteria were used, 
telangie ctasia and pi[INVESTIGATOR_165984] 34% an d 36%, respectively, and 
telangie ctasia was downgraded in 45%. Inter -observer variability was similar for both 
classification systems and ranged from Cohen's kappa 0.3 (retraction) to 0.91 
(telangie ctasia). The authors concluded that LENT/SOMA criteria see m to be the better in 
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/2015  
 
22 of 60 grading and recording late radiation toxicity compared with the RTOG scale. Specifically, 
fibrosis scores correlated well with the LENT/SOMA scoring system (Spearman's rho 0.78, 
p = 0.01).  
The Delfin MoistureMeter D  is a portable, non -invasive device that measures the 
dielectric constant of the skin and subcutaneous fat  that can be used to provide a quantitative 
assessment of radiation -induced breast fibrosis.  A report by [CONTACT_166004]. demonstrates that 
two years post irradiation, th e dielectric constant of the irradiated skin increases  with 
increasing clinical findings of  subcutaneous ﬁbrosis. Since the dielectric constant of 
biological tissue s is related to tissue water content, these results demonstrate that the free 
water content and thus the extracellular fluid increases in irradiated skin. [36] 
The LENT/SOMA scoring system will be used in the reporting of late radiation 
morbidity in this protocol  as well as quantifiable measurements using the MoistureD device. 
Patients will be assessed  with the MoistureD device,  as part of their physical examination  at 
baseline and  during the follow up visit s.  
Measurements will be  obtained at the tumor bed (B 1) and at the indexed breast ( B2) 
away from the surgical bed and at the two symmetrical, correspond ing areas in the 
contralateral breast (CB1 and CB2), with a total of four areas of assessment per patient.  For 
each area , the measurement will be  repeated three times, and the average value and standard 
deviation calculated. We will obtain measurement of breast fibrosis at baseline (prior to 
treatment) and at each subsequent follow -up after completing radiotherapy.  
 
2.7.3.  Genetics  of Radiation -induced breast fibrosis  
Since the most likely long -term toxicity of accelerated radiation is soft tissue fibrosis 
and skin telang iectasia the preliminary recognition of genetic predispositions to these 
complications enables the exclusion of high -risk carriers from the trials of acc elerated/hypo -
fractionated radiation. In other words, similar to the impact of pharmacogenomics in medical 
oncology, the field of radiation -genomics is also rapi[INVESTIGATOR_165985], permitting to identify 
individual s with genetic predisposition to inferior repair  of the damage caused by [CONTACT_166005].  
A recent study from Quarmby [CONTACT_166006][INVESTIGATOR_165986] -ionizing radiation. To investigate whether single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) of transforming growt h factor beta -1 (TGF -beta1) were associated 
with the susceptibility of breast cancer patients to severe radiation -induced normal tissue 
damage Quarmby [CONTACT_166007] -Restriction Fragment Length 
Polymorphism - (PCR -RFLP) assays for TGF -beta1 gene polymorphisms on DNA obtained 
from [ADDRESS_192539] cancer patients who  received radiotherapy.  [37] The G -800A, C –509T, 
T+869C and G+915C polymorphic sites were examined, and genotype and allele frequencies 
of two subgroups of patients wer e calculated and compared. The investigators found that the 
less prevalent –509T and +869C alleles were significantly associated with a subgroup of 
patients who developed severe radiation -induced normal tissue fibrosis (n=15) when 
compared with those who d id not (n=88) (odds ratio=3.4, p=0.0036, and 2.37, p=0.035, 
respectively). Furthermore, patients with the –509TT or +869CC genotypes were between 
seven and 15 times more likely to develop severe fibrosis. These findings imply a role for the 
-509T and +869C  alleles in the biological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to radiation -
induced fibrosis.

7 CHEMOTHERAPY  
 
7.1 Carb oplatin Administration  
Carboplatin will be administered with AUC of 2.0 which will be repeated weekly for 6 
weeks. Carboplatin (NSC 241240), other names: Paraplatin® 
 
7.2 Formulation  
Carboplatin Injection is a premixed aqueous solution of 10 mg/mL Carboplatin.  
Carboplatin Injection, 10 mg/mL can be further diluted to concentrations as low as 0.5 
mg/mL with 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  
When prepared as directed, Carboplatin aqueous solutions are stable for 8 hour s at room 
temperature (25°C). Since no antibacterial preservative is contained in the formulation, it is 
recommended that Carboplatin aqueous solutions be discarded 8 hours after dilution.  
How Carboplatin is Supplied  
Carboplatin Injection, 10 mg/mL is available in multi -dose vials, individually carton:  
NDC 0703 -4244 -01 10 mg/mL, 5 mL Vial  
NDC 0703 -4246 -01 10 mg/mL, 15 mL Vial  
NDC 0703 -4248 -01 10 mg/mL, 45 mL Vial  
NDC [ZIP_CODE] -0339 -56 10 mg/mL, 60 mL Vial  
 
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/2015  
 
26 of 60 Storage  
Unopened vials of Carboplatin Injection, 10 mg/mL are stable to the date indicated on the 
package when stored at 25°C (77°F) excursions permitted from 15° –30°C (59° –86°) [see USP 
Controlled Room Temperature] Protect from light.  
Carboplatin injection, 10 mg /mL multidose vials maintain microbial, chemical, and physical 
stability for up to 14 days at 25°C following multiple needle entries.  
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to administration. So lutions for infusion should be discarded [ADDRESS_192548] been published.  There is no general agreement that all of 
the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.  NOTE : Aluminum 
reacts with Carboplatin  causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_165987], therefore, needles or 
intravenous sets containin g aluminum parts that may come in contact [CONTACT_166011] . 
 
7.3 Pharmacokinetic information  
Carboplatin is an alkylating agent which covalently binds to DNA; possible crosslinking and 
interference with the function of DNA. Distribution: Vd: 16 L/kg; into liver, kidney, skin, and 
tumor tissue. Protein binding: 0%; however the platinum from carbopl atin becomes 30% 
irreversibly  bound.  Metabolism: Minimally hepatic to aquated and hydroxylated compounds. 
Half-life elimination: Terminal: 22 – 40 hours. In patients with creatinine clearance 
> 60 mL/minute: 2.5 -5.9 hours. Excretion: Urine (~60% - 90%) wit hin 24 hours.  
 
7.4 Dosing of Carboplatin  
The dose will be calculated to reach a target area under the curve (AUC) of concentration x 
time according to the Calvert formula using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 
Cockcroft ‐ Gault  formula.  
• The i nitial dose of carboplatin must be calculated using GFR. In the absence of new 
renal obstruction or other renal toxicity greater than or equal to CTCAE grade 2 
(serum creatinine 1.[ADDRESS_192549]), the dose of carboplatin will not be recalculated for 
subsequent cycles, but will be subject to dose modification as noted.  
• In patients with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than or equal to 0.6 mg/dl), 
due to reduced protein intake and/or low muscle mass, the creatinine clearance  should 
be estimated using a minimum value of 0. 7 mg/dl. If a more appropriate baseline 
creatinine value is available within 4 weeks of treatment that may also be used for the 
initial estimation of GFR.  
• Calvert Formula:  Carboplatin dose  (mg)= target AUC x (GFR +25)  
• NOTE: the GFR used in the Calvert formula to calculate AUC -based dosing 
should be capped at  125 mL/min  for patients with normal renal function . No 
higher estimated GFR values should be used.  
• Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC(mg ·min/mL ) x 150 mL/min  
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/2015  
 
27 of 60 • The maximum carboplatin dose should not exceed target AUC(mg ·min/mL)  x 150 
mL/min, but it may be less. Many trials have a target carboplatin AUC of 6 which 
would result in a maximum dose of 900 mg.  Highly specific settings like bone 
marrow transplant or pediatric studies may target a higher AUC (see table below).  
 
Maximum AUC -based Carboplatin Dose  
AUC  Maximum Carboplatin Dose  
6 900 mg  
5 750 mg  
4 600 mg  
 
• For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered to be equivalent to the estimated 
creatinine clearance. The estimated creatinine clearance (ml/min) is calculated by [CONTACT_166012] ‐ Gault using the following formula:  
 
Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [140‐Age (years)] x Weight (kg) x 0.85  
72 x serum c reatinine (mg/dl)  
Notes:  
Weight in kilograms (kg): In general, actual weight should be used for estimation of 
GFR. However, it is also acceptable to utilize adjusted weight, when concerned about 
safety in a specific patient, in accordance with local instit utional policy. Suggested ideal 
and adjusted weight calculations:  
Ideal weight (kg) = (((Height (cm)/2.54) – 60) x 2.3) + 45.5  
Adjusted weight (kg) = ((Actual weight – Ideal weight) x 0.40) + Ideal weight  
 
The Cockcroft ‐Gault formula above is specifically  for women (it includes the 0.85 
factor).  
 
At the time of a dose modification for toxicity :  
If the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is lower than the creatinine used to 
calculate the previous dose, use the previous (higher) creatinine; if the  creatinine at the 
time of a dose modification is higher than the creatinine used to calculate the previous 
dose, use the current (higher) creatinine. This will ensure that the patient is actually 
receiving a dose reduction.  
 
If the dose of carboplatin (m g) at the time of dose modification, is higher than the previous  
dose due to the use of the Cockcroft ‐Gault formula [when the previous dose was 
calculated using the Jelliffe formula and IDMS to “non ‐IDMS” conversion (if 
applicable)], use the same method that was used to calculate the previous dose [Jelliffe 
formula and IDMS to “non ‐IDMS” conversion (if applicable)], to calculate the dose of 
carboplatin (mg) at the time of dose reduction. This will ensure that the patient is actually 
receiving a dos e reduction.

9 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
For radiation toxicity: In case of grade 3 acute skin toxicity occurring during the course of 
the 3 weeks radiotherapy treatment, the dose per fraction of the remaining treatment fractions 
will be reduced to 2 Gy/fraction to the whole breast (and [ADDRESS_192562] days) 
until completion of the total prescribed dose. No interruptions are planned. No other grade 3 
toxicity is expected.  
For Carboplatin toxicity, please see table below:

15 DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1 Monitoring plan  
The NYU PRMC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is the monitoring board 
for this study. The Committee  will review safety at scheduled intervals (not less than once/year) 
and at the time of the final analysis according to the NYU Data Safety Monito ring Plan Charter.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] - If safety concerns arise, the DSMC will identify these concerns and 
recommend modification or termination of  the clinical trial. There is no formal interim analysis 
for this trial.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_192571] data manager. Once the discrepancy is 
closed, by [CONTACT_112536] “resolved” or  “irresolvable”, the data is marked clean and an audit trail is 
generated by [CONTACT_1190].  
All key end points will be source verified by a second person and errors will be corrected. 
Once the data is verified and all discrepancies are closed, the data can be  locked/frozen. Locking 
and freezing can be done at different granular levels and will follow institutional SOPs and any 
specific requirements for the project.  
Security measures that will be taken in order to protect patient data will include firewall 
technology and database level security which will be achieved by [CONTACT_166018]. Additional security for data transfer between remot e clients and servers will be 
achieved by [CONTACT_166019]/SSL. All data will be backed -up to tape periodically 
according to the Institutional SOPs. All data will be stored for at least [ADDRESS_192572] access to 
the records as required to administer treatment and comply with the protocol . Neither the name 
[CONTACT_166024]. All laboratory and baseline data will be de -identified and transferred via 
secure links to the Study Biostatisticians . Patient records will be made available for inspection to

the acute effects to < 10% Grade 3 events . 
 
16.1 Endpoints  
16.1.1  Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint for the study is acute toxicity occurring within 60 days after 
treatment; the proportion of patients with grade II or III acute skin toxicity.  
 
16.1.[ADDRESS_192574] treatment  including fibrosis and telangiectasia; the 
proportion of patients with grades 2 or higher toxicity  
 
16.1.3  Exploratory endpoints  
Local recurrence  
Distant recurrence/metastases  
Survival  
 
16.2 Analysis Populations  
All registered patients will be included in th ese analyses (intent to treat).  
 
Statistical Considerations Sample Size and Interim Analysis Plans  
16.3 Accrual estimates  
Estimated number of eligible patients for the trial is 3-5/month . Therefore, we estimate that 
the required [ADDRESS_192575] a 
difference of 18% from a baseline rate of 25% (grade II -III acute dermatitis) with a 2 -sided α =  
0.05 and power of 80%. If we observe 14 or more events among these 35 patients, the null 
hypothesis that the rate  is 25% will be rejected.  
Amendment: With [ADDRESS_192576] a difference of 18%   from a baseline rate of 
25% (grade II -III acute dermatitis) with a 2 -sided α = 0.05 and power of 80%   using an exact 
binomial test . If we observe 15 or more events among these 37 patients, the null hypothesis that 
the rate is 25% will be rejected.  Calculations from PASS 2008, NCSS.

N/A 
 
16.5 Interim analyses  
NYU  10-[ZIP_CODE]  Version 3. 5 11/02/[ADDRESS_192577] 95% confidence intervals.  
Patie nt demographic and disease characteristics at registration will be summarized 
using frequency distributions for qualitative data and summary statistics (means, medians, 
standard deviations, etc .) and graphical displays (e .g., Boxplots). Treatment data will  be 
summarized similarly. Descriptive analyses will report the primary endpoint in subgroups 
defined by [CONTACT_166020].  
 
16.6.2  Secondary Endpoints  
See primary endpoint.  
 
16.6.3  Exploratory Endpoints  
Local recurrence rates will be reported along with 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan 
Meier curves will be used to estimate recurrence free and overall survival.

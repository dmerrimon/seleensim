Study Design:   This is a randomized placebo -controlled study in children diagnosed with autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD s) and neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by [CONTACT_420387] .  
Children will have a documented history of these disorders, as confirmed or consistent with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -10) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Ment al Disorders, Fifth Edition  (Text Revision; DSM -5/4) criteria, having International 
Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) criteria -based sleep disturbances modified to take into 
account the uniqueness of insomnia in the pediatric population  at screening .   
The children will undergo 4 weeks of basic sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention, which will serve as a wash -out period from any hypnotics; a gradual withdrawal wil l take place during 
the first [ADDRESS_530402] 2  weeks .   
Children who are still found to be eligible for the study after the 4 -week, basic sleep hygiene 
and behavioral intervention wash -out period, will continue in a 2 -week single -blind (SB) 
placebo run -in period.  In order to be eligible for the [ADDRESS_530403] 4  weeks 
and therefore will not need to continue this therapy during the study .  Children with a 
documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention, who are still found eligible, will enter directly into the 2 -week SB placebo run -in period.   
Children with a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention who are  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 6 
 
Version 6.0  19 May 2015 Final,  Amendment 5 taking a prohibited medication  will not require additiona l training and will undergo a 2  week 
wash -out peri od before Visit 1 (e.g., Weeks - 2 through 0 to wash out melatonin or any other 
prohibited medications).  During these [ADDRESS_530404] ete the sleep and nap 
diary.  
After the 4 -week sleep hygiene wash -out and 2 -week  SB placebo run- in periods, children who 
are still found eligible for study participation will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
Circadin® [ADDRESS_530405] day of Week  5 ±3 days ( Visit 3), sleep variables will be assessed to 
determine if dose modification (an increase to 5  mg) is required .  Children will then continue 
on 2 or 5  mg of Circadin® or placebo for an additional double -blind period of [ADDRESS_530406] day of Week  28 ±3 days ( Visit 5), sleep vari ables will be 
assessed to determine if a potential additional dose modification ( i.e., an increase either to 5 mg 
for patients who are still on 2 mg or an increase to 10 mg for patients who are on 5 mg ) is 
necessary  (If a dose increase is decided upon, the dose increase should be from 2 mg to 5 mg, 
or from 5  mg to 10 mg) .  Children will continue at 2, 5, or 10  mg Circadin® in an open -label 
period for another [ADDRESS_530407] Drugs/Study 
Medications:  Test drug :   
Circadin® 1 mg minitablets will be used in this study .  These tablets are 3 mm in diameter and 
will allow flexibility of  dosing for the required dose titrations from 2 mg to 5 mg or 10 mg.   
Reference drug :   
Placebo will be identical in appearance and formulation to active Circadin® minitablets, but will 
contain no active melatonin .   
Circadin® and placebo are to be admini stered orally, 1 portion of minitablets daily, taken 
postprandial at 0.5 to 1 hour before desired bedtime (bedtime should be age -appropriate 
bedtime) .  The minitablets should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or halved.  
Inclusion Criteria:  To be eligible for study entry, all patients must satisfy all of the following criteria at screening :

sclerosis]) as confirmed by [CONTACT_420388] a community pediatrician or pediatric neurologist or other 
health care professionals experienced in the diagnosis who took  into account early 
developmental history and school records .   
4. Must have current sleep problems including:  a  minimum of 3 months of impaired 
sleep defined as ≤ 6 hours of continuous sleep AND/OR  ≥0.5 hour sleep latency from 
light off in 3 out of 5  nights based on parent reports and patient medical history .  (The

Descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, changes in physical examinations and vital signs 
measurements .  The number of patients withdrawing during the treatment periods will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_420395] .   
Exploratory Safety Endpoints  
The changes in BMI and Z-score  from baseline to the end of the study will be summarized 
using shift tables showing the number of children having values below, within and above Z-calculated normal at each treatment group separately .  The BMI and Z -score s are designed to 
take into account the amount of weight gain that would be expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents .  The BMI and Z -score s are categorized by [CONTACT_420396] (corresponding to a normal distribution with mean 0 and a SD  of 1) of the 
actual weight measurements, based on the Growth Charts provided by [CONTACT_420397].  
Tanner scores for pubertal  assessment in children ≥8 years of age during the study will be 
analyzed using the web application (http://vps.stefvanbuuren.nl/puberty)
20.  This tool calculates 
SD scores of individual observations of Tanner scores and additionally plots those scores in 
stage line diagram21.   
Descriptive statistics will be provided for head and height measurements and changes in head and height measurements from baseline to Week 108 in children ≤ 5 years of age.  
Descriptive statis tics will also be provided for the number and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_420333], using the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_420334] a later time point by [CONTACT_779].

Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530430] common complaints in children with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), mental retardation or other developmental delays1-3.  High prevalence for moderate sleep 
disturbances in these children  populations is associated with significant sleep problems and subsequent 
distress for the families of these children, which in many cases, lead to the decisi on to institutionalize 
the children4.  Specifically, a frequent cause of families giving up their care is discontinuous sleep with 
frequent awakenings th roughout the night .  There is a growing body of evidence on abnormal 
melatonin secretion in children with neurodevelopmental disorders5, which prompted the use of 
mela tonin to treat sleep disorders in these populations .  Several exploratory studies and case reports 
have led to strong consensus among researchers that exogenous melatonin is beneficial for treating 
chronic sleep disturbances of children who have neurodevel opmental and neuropsychiatric difficulties .  
Although in none of these studies significant adverse events (AEs) as a result of melatonin use have 
been reported, the safe, appropriate dosing (including amounts and timing), have not been established 
for chil dren.  Moreover, in many cases, immediate- release (IR) melatonin preparations that are 
available as food supplements in the [LOCATION_003] were used.  These formulations did not improve total sleep 
time (TST) and sleep maintenance, which are the most disturbing parameters for families6.  As 
melatonin has a very short half -life (40 minutes), prolonged- release (PR) formulations are sought to 
cover the night period, and should affect sleep maintenance.  
Circadin® is a 2 mg PR melatonin formulation that mimics the physiological secretion profile of 
melatonin and can offer more sustained blood levels of melatonin overnight .  Circadin® [ADDRESS_530431] and was approved for marketing in the Europe an Union (EU) in [ADDRESS_530432] looked at the use of Circadin® to 
treat sleep wake cycle disturbances in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities .  The efficacy and 
safety of Circadin® was evaluated in 42 children with chronic sleep–wake cycle disorders10.  All 
42 patient s had severe neurodevelopmental difficulties .  Initially, a randomized, double -blinded, 
cross -over design was used in 16 children, comparing the effectivene ss of IR and PR Circadin®.  In the 
remainder of the patients, the PR melatonin was studied on a clinical basis .  The effectiveness of 
treatment was assessed by [CONTACT_420398] -up.  Emphasis was placed on the judgment 
of the parents, who ha d guidance from the physicians .  The average final PR melatonin dose in the 
42 patients was 5.7 mg (2 to 12 mg) .  The studies showed that the IR melatonin was most effective 
when there was only delayed sleep onset, but PR formulations were more useful for sleep maintenance.   
Data from 44 children with neurodevelopmental disabilities and treatment -resistant circadian rhythm 
sleep disorders who had participated in the placebo controlled, double -blind cross -over trial of 
PR-melatonin (not Circadin®) were reported in a prospective follow -up study9.  The follow -up study 
involved a structured telephone interview of caregiver s every 3 months for up to 3.8 years .  Adverse 
reaction to melatonin therapy and development of tolerance were not evident .  Better sleep was 
associated with reported improvement in health, behavior, and learning .  At the end of the study, the 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530433] which would promote sleep for 8 to 10 hours.  
Treatment with Circadin® was reported in children who presented with Smith- Magenis syndrome 
(SMS), mental retardation, encephalopathy, autism, Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, Bourneville 
syndrome, blindness, and delayed -sleep -phase syndrome12.  Patients aged 3 to 18 years were given 
Circadin® (4 to 6 mg/day) as a single evening dose over a treatment duration which ranged from 6 to 
72 months .  In the group of children for whom there were  full reports by [CONTACT_107605] (49 children) 
within 3 months, sleep latency with Circadin® decreased by 44.0% ( p-value <0.001); sleep duration 
increased by 10.1% ( p-value <0.001); and the number of midnight awakenings decreased by 75% 
(p-value  <0.001) comp ared with baseline.  Additionally, sleep quality improved by 75% compared 
with baseline (2.1±0.34 vs . 1.2±0.4, respectively, p- value  <0.001) .  No serious adverse events (SAEs) 
or treatment related co -morbidities were reported .  Other studies using PR -melatonin15 (not Circadin®) 
indicated long -term effectiveness of PR -melatonin at a maximal dose of 4 mg in children 4 years or 
less and 6 mg over this age .  In children aged 2.6 to 9.6 years with autism without other coexistent 
pathologies, PR -melatonin was evaluated openly .  Treatment gains were maintained at 12 and 
24-month follow -ups.  It was concluded that PR melatonin may provide an effective and well -tolerated 
treatment f or autistic children with chronic sleep disorders .   
In order to establish the efficacy and safety of Circadin® in children with neurodevelopmental disorders 
and to determine the dose, this randomized, placebo- controlled study is planned to evaluate the 
efficacy of a double -blind, 13- week treatment period with Circadin® 2/5 mg in improving maintenance 
of sleep, sleep latency and additional parameters in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities .  
The efficacy and safety of Circadin® 2/5 mg will continue  to be assessed during an open -label 
extension period of 13 weeks .  Withdrawal effects will also be assessed during the 2 -week single -blind 
(SB)  placebo run -out period.

(DSM -5/4) criteria, having International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) criteria -based sleep 
disturbances modified to take into account the uniqueness of insomnia in the pediatric population at 
screening .   
The children will undergo 4 weeks of basic sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention, which will 
serve as a wash -out period from any hypnotics ; a gradual withdrawal will take place during the first 
[ADDRESS_530439] 4 weeks and therefore  will not need to continue 
this therapy during the study .  Children with a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral 
intervention, who are still found eligible, will enter directly into the  2-week SB  placebo run- in period.   
Children with a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention who are  taking 
prohibited medication s will not require additional training and will undergo a 2- week wash -out period 
before Visit  1 (e.g., Weeks - 2 through 0 to wash out melatonin or any other prohibited medications).  
During these 2 weeks there is no need to complete the sleep and na p diary.  
After the 4 -week sleep hygiene (for children who do not have a documented history of sleep hygiene 
and behavioral intervention) and 2- week SB placebo run -in period, children who are still found eligible 
for study participation will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Circadin® [ADDRESS_530440] day of Week  5

Version 6.0  19 May 2015 Final , Amendment 5 Footnotes for Table 5 -2:   
*  The visit should be carried out within ±3 days.  
**  The visit should be carried out within ±7 days.  
1.  End of Phase I of the study  
2.  For female patients of childbearing potential, u rine dipstick pregnancy tests will be administered.   
3.  The Tanner scale will be used to assess and stage physical development in children ≥ 8 years of age.  For children ≤ 5 years of age, only height and head circumference will 
be used to stage children development.  Between the age of 5  and 8 the children ’s physical development will be determined using the BMI .  
4.  For patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_420340] a history of seizures , the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_420341] a seizure, which should include the date, time, duration and type of the seizure  (Appendix  10).  The E pi[INVESTIGATOR_420342] D iary is to be completed only by [CONTACT_4677]’s parent/caregiver after each seizure and to be entered into the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) by [CONTACT_420406].   
5.  The TESS ( Appendix  5) and CGAS ( Appendix 9) must be administered and completed by [CONTACT_420407]/caregiver’s input  at the study visit indicated .   
6.  Sleep and Nap Diary is to be completed 14 nights before each scheduled visit ( Appendix  1 and Appendix  2).  The parent will complete the questionnaire either directly into 
the eCRF or on the printed version .  If the printed version is used, at a later time point, the site coordinator will enter the questionnaire data into the eCRF .  At the screening 
visit, the Sleep and Nap Di ary is dispensed.  The study coordinator/Investigator must provide guidance to the par ents on how to complete the diary by [CONTACT_420408], preferably within [ADDRESS_530455] inator/Investigator provide a thorough review and explanation of the diary to the parents to ensure that the data retrieved i s high quality and reliable.  A 
follow -up phone call to remind patients to begin filling out Sleep and Nap Diaries will be made every week  before Visit s 1 and 2,  as well as every week during the study 
period up to Visit 7.  Between Visit s 7 and Visit 8, the  phone call will be made once a month .   
7.  CSDI  (Appendix  6), SDQ  (Appendix 8) , ESS (Appendix  7), WHO- 5 (Appendix  9), and PSQI ( Appendix  8) are to be completed by [CONTACT_12934]/Inv estigators  with 
the parents/caregiver , by [CONTACT_420409]/caregiver.   Note: Th e ESS, WHO -5, and PSQI are to 
assess sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], quality of sleep, and well -being of the parent/caregiver ’s and NOT the child.   
8.  Actigraphy (Actiwatches) is dispensed to patients at Visit 1 so that they can be worn for 14 days prior to V isit 2.  The device is to be delivered to the patient’s home no 
earlier than [ADDRESS_530456] ( IMP) up to Visit 8 at once.  The site can send new IMP to patients in quarterly intervals 
(i.e., in periods of 3 month intervals).

Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 6 STUDY POPULATION AND SELECTION  
The study population for this study will include patients with confirmed history of ASDs ( pervasive 
developmental disorders) according to DSM -5/4 criteria or ICD -10 or neurodevelopmental disabilities 
caused by  [CONTACT_420387] (SMS, Angelman syndrome, Bourneville’s disease [tuberous 
sclerosis]).  Enough patients  will be screened for the study to allow for 120 patients to be  randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive Circadin® or placebo at Visit 2.  Patients will be screened for the study after 
their legal guardians provide written, informed consent on their behalf (refer to Section  16.2 for further 
details) .  In order to be randomized to treatment, patients must meet all inclusion criteria listed in 
Section 6.[ADDRESS_530457] satisfy all of the following criteria at screening : 
• Must be children 2 to 17.5 years of age at Visit 2 who comply with taking the study drug.  
• Must have written informed consent provided by a legal guardian and assent (if needed).  
• Must have a documented history of ASD according to or consistent with the ICD-10 or 
DSM -5/4 criteria , or neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by  [CONTACT_420387] (SMS, 
Angelman syndrome, Bourneville’s disease [tuberous sclerosis]) as confirmed by [CONTACT_420410] a community pediatrician or pediatric neurologist  or other health care professionals experienced in the diagnosis  who took 
into account early developmental hist ory and school records .   
• Must have current sleep problems including :  a minimum of 3 months of impaired sleep defined 
as ≤6 hours of continuous sleep AND/OR  ≥0.5 hour sleep latency from light off in 3 out of 
5 nights  based on parent reports and patient me dical history .  (The maintenance and latency 
problems do not necessarily have to be in the same 3 nights  of the week .) 
• May be on a stable dose of non- excluded medication for 3 months, including anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], 
anti-depressants ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs ]), stimulants, all mood 
changing drugs and β -blockers .  (Only morning administration of β -blockers is allowed since 
β-blockers at night have the potential to reduce endogenous melatonin levels and might cause 
disturbed sleep) .   
• The sleep disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of any concomitant 
medications such as SSRIs, stimulants, etc .    
After completing  4 weeks of sleep hygiene training  (for those who need it ) and 2 weeks of placebo 
run-in,  patients  will be eligible to continue the study if they comply with the following:  
• Continue to fulfil sleep problem criteria (see Inclusion Criterion 4)  based on the completed 
Sleep and N ap D iary entered into the electronic case report form ( eCRF )   
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 32 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 • Parents demonstrate compliance in Sleep and N ap Diary completion (5 out of 7 nights) .  
Compliance means that in at least 5 out of 7 nights per week  (total of 2 weeks before each 
scheduled visit) the parents complete the diary pages with all mandatory questions (mandatory 
questions are marked with an asterisk [*] in Appendix  1).   
• Continue to fulfil all other eligibility criteria   
6.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Children who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in the study:  
• Have had treatment with any form of melatonin within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1  
• Have a known allergy to melatonin or lactose   
• Have a known moderate to severe sleep apnea  
• Have an untreated medical/ineffectively treated/psychological condition that may be the 
etiology of sleep disturbances  
• Did not respond to previous Circadin® therapy based on past medical history records in the last 
2 years   
• Are taking or have been taking prohibite d medication within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 
(Section  7.1)  
• Are females of child -bearing potential that are not using contraceptives  and/or breastfeeding  and 
that are sexually active (Abstinence is an acceptable method of contraception.)   
• Pregnant females  
• Are currently participating in a clinical trial or have participated in a clinical trial involving 
medicinal product within the last 3 months prior to the study  (this does not include patient s 
who participated in the P hase I PK study who can be already included in the study) .   
• Children with known renal or hepatic insufficiency   
6.[ADDRESS_530458] be wi thdrawn from the clinical study if any of the following reasons occur:  
• The parents or the patient withdraw their consent. 
• The Investigator considers, for safety reasons, it is in the best interests of the patient that the 
patient be withdrawn from the study.  
• A protocol violation or inter -current illnesses occurs, which, in the clinical judgment of the 
Investigator or after discussion with the Sponsor, may invalidate the study by [CONTACT_420411] p roduct (IMP).  
• It is discove red that the patient has entered the study in violation of the protocol. 
• A significant protocol violation occurs during the study ( e.g., a patient violat es a major 
Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria ; Section  13.3.2) .  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 33 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 • The randomization code is broken for that patient by [CONTACT_31617] 1 of the staff at the clinical study site.  
• The patient has taken any prohibited medication  listed in Section 7.1 ( Appendix  11).   
• The patient is lost to follow -up. 
The date and reason for withdrawal should be noted in the Withdrawal Form in the eCRF .  A parent 
who withdraws consent will be asked by [CONTACT_420412] a reason, but is not obligated to do so.  
A patient who withdraws from the clinical study should, if possible, be seen for a Withdrawal Visit 
scheduled as soon as possible  and the end  of study procedures  should be carried out, as shown in 
Section  8.19, after the patient has withdrawn from the clinical study .  No new information will be 
collected from the patient except information collected in relation to the scheduled Follow -up Visit or 
needed for the follow -up of AEs or SAEs .   
If a patient is with drawn from the study, no replacement will be considered .   
6.[ADDRESS_530459] 
2 weeks.  Patients will then enter a 2 -week SB placebo run -in period.  Enough eligible children will be 
screened for the study to allow for 120 patients to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Circadin
® or 
placebo at the end of the 2- week SB placebo run- in period, whether they are children who underwent 
the sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention or not.   
Children with a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention who are taking 
prohibite d medications will not require additional training and will undergo a 2 week wash -out peri od 
before Visit 1 (e.g., Weeks 2 through 0 to wash out melatonin or any other prohibited medications).  
During these 2 weeks there is no need to complete the sleep and nap diary.    
Children with documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention, who are still found 
eligible, will enter directly into the 2 -week SB placebo run -in period.  After the 2- week placebo run -in 
period, patients who are still found eligible will be randomized in a 1:1  ratio to receive either 
Circadin® 2 mg or matching placebo for 3 weeks.  At the end of the 3 -week double -blind period, a 
decision on dose modification (i.e., an increase to 5 mg) will be made based on predefined criter ia 
(Section  7.3.1).  The double -blind period will continue for another 10 weeks (total 13 weeks) after 
which Circadin® 2 or 5 mg will be given open -label for another 13 weeks of follow -up to evaluate 
maintenance of efficacy and safety.  At this time point (Week  28), data gathered from both the 
double -blind and open -label periods will be analyzed.  The study will continue with a second 
opportunity for  dose modification according to the same criteria as before (an increase either to 5  mg 
for patients who are still on 2 mg or to 10 mg for patients who are on 5 mg) after which open -label 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 34 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 treatment will continue for an additional 78  weeks of follow -up to e valuate maintenance of efficacy 
and safety.  At the end of the Circadin® open- label period, patients will undergo a 2- week SB placebo 
run-out period to assess withdrawal effects.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_530460]  open- label period.  A minimum of 50 children are expected to complete the 
second open- label safety follow -up period.  
7.1 PROHIBITED MEDICATIO NS 
The following medications  are not permitted for use for the duration of the study and within 2 weeks 
prior to Visit 1.  If use of these medications is unavoidable for clinical reasons, then the patient will 
need to be withdrawn from the study:  
• Melatonin or melatonin agonists (other than the study treatment)  
• Excessive consumption of alcohol  
The full list of prohibi ted medications is given in Appendix  11.  This is a living list that will not cause 
any protocol amendment if needs to be amended.  
7.[ADDRESS_530461]  
Circadin® 
Generic name:   [CONTACT_420472]:   Circadin® 
Chemical name:  N-Acetyl -5-Methoxytryptamine  
Formulation:   Amino -methacrylate co -polymer  
   Calcium hydrogen phosphate  
   Lactose  
   Silicon dioxide  
   Talcum  
   Magnesium stearate  
The PR of melatonin is achieved primarily by [CONTACT_420413] .  The calcium 
hydrogen phosphate serves as a filling and bindi ng agent and lactose as a diluent and bulking agent .  
Talc and magnesium stearate serve as lubricants .  Circadin® 1 mg minitablets will be used in this study .  
These tablets are 3 mm in diameter and will allow flexibility of dosing for the required dose titrations 
from 2 mg to 5 mg or 10 mg.  
Study drug (IMP) will be stored in the medical center's local pharmacy or in the Investigator's office 
securely, separate from other drugs  (IMP Handling Guidelines) .  Study drug should not be exposed to 
direct sunlight or other sources of heat, and is to be kept at room temperature (<25°C) .   
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 35 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 Placebo  
Placebo will be identical in app earance and formulation to active Circadin® minitablets, but will 
contain no active melatonin .   
7.3 CIRCADIN® ADMINISTRATION 
The dose will be titrated from 2 mg (2 minitablets) to 5 mg (5 minitablets –  Visit 3) to 10 mg 
(10 minitablets – Visit 5), as instructed in Section 7.3.2. 
Circadin® and placebo are to be administered orally, 1 portion of minitablets daily, taken postprandial 
at 0.5 to 1 hour before desired bedtime (bedtime should be age -appropriate bedtime) .  The minitablets 
should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or halved.  Both Circadin® and placebo 
minitablets can be administered in foods such as orange juice, semi -skimmed milk, strawberry yogurt, 
and strawberry jam, to allow dosing of multiple minitablets to the children studied .  Melatonin was 
found to be compatible and stable for up to 6 hours in these specific common foods and liquids16. 
7.3.1 Dose Modification  
At the end of 3 weeks of double -blind treatment  (Visit 3 ) and 13 weeks of open- label treatment 
(Visit 5) , the Investigator will review the Sleep and Nap Diaries and the eCRF recommendation for 
dose increase and then make an assessment of treatment effect .  If the Investigator decides that a dose 
increase is necessary, the following criteria must be met before the increase can take place:   
• The p atient has an absence of SAEs  related to study drug.   
• The p atient has an absence of daytime fatigue  related to study drug . 
• The p arents demonstrate d compliance in Sleep and Nap Diary completion (5 out of 7 nights) .  
Compliance means that in at least 5 out of 7 nights per week (total of 2 weeks before each 
scheduled visit) the parents complete d the diary pages with all mandatory questions ( i.e., those 
marked with an asterisk [ *], Appendix  1).   
• The p atient has received at least 5 of 7 doses in the current week  based on Diary -reported data.  
AND  
• The patient had ≤6 hours of continuous sleep AND/OR  ≥0.5 hours of sleep latency from light 
off in ≥ 3 out of 5 nights (i.e., in [ADDRESS_530462] be 
completed each week)  in each of the 2 weeks  prior to V isit 3 or V isit 5.  This will be derived 
from the Sleep and Nap Diary and calculated by [CONTACT_51084] .   
OR 
• The patient had ≤ 6 hours of continuous sleep AND/OR  ≥0.5 hours of sleep latency from light 
off only in ≤ 2 out of 5 nights (i.e., in [ADDRESS_530463] be 
completed each week) in each of the [ADDRESS_530464] 1 hour as measured by [CONTACT_420414].  Change in sleep duration and sleep latency will be measured 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 36 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 by [CONTACT_420415] 2 mean duration and sleep latency values from the mean duration and 
the mean sleep latency values from all available nights 2 weeks prior to Visit 3 or Visit 5.  
Values will be derived from the Sleep and Nap Diary and calculated by [CONTACT_51084].  The eCRF 
will advise whether a dose increase is recommended or not.  
If any of the above criteria are not met, or if there is any doubt regarding a criterion, the current dose 
should be maintained.   
Allowed  dose i ncreases include 2 mg to 5 mg  at Visit 3 , and/or 2 mg to 5 mg or 5 mg to 10 mg  at 
Visit 5.   
7.3.2 Dose Reduction  
At any time, a patient ’s dose maybe reduced to 2 mg or 5 mg for reasons such as AEs that are 
considered related to the study drug, and/or specifically for the following  reasons :   
• An unacceptable increase in daytime fatigue  
• An unacceptable behavioral change  
• If the patient ceases to respond to study drug (sleep improved and then deteriorated on higher 
dose)  
If a dose reduction is thought to be required following a scheduled telephone call, the Investigator 
should consult with the Principal Investigator (PI) or the Medical Monitor prior to a dose modification.  
If a dose reduction is agreed upon, an unscheduled visit should be arranged.  Dose modifications 
should be documented in the eCRF.   
If a dose is reduced for any reason, the Investigator may, at their  discretion, restart the previous dosage 
at Visit 3 or Visit 5.   
7.4 BLINDING  
The initial 2 -week SB placebo run- in period of this study is designed as a SB  period with the patients 
blinded as to what study drug they will receive .  All patients will receive placebo during the run -in 
period.  The run- in period will be followed by 13 weeks of double -blind treatment, where the 
Investigator and the patient will be blinded to treatment allocation .  Patients will be randomized using 
a 1:1  ratio to receive either Circadin® 2 mg (2 minitablets each containing 1 mg of Circadin®) or 
placebo (2 minitablets containing 1 mg of placebo) .  The placebo will have the same appearance as 
Circadin®.  After 3  weeks of study, if dose modification is deem ed necessary, patients will receive 
increased doses in the same manner (5 minitablets containing 1 mg of Circadin® or placebo) .  The 
randomization scheme will be designed to ensure that patients requiring dose modification will 
continue receiving the same treatment ( Circadin® or placebo).  
Except in an emergency, t he blind should not be broken until all completed eCRFs are received by 
[CONTACT_420416].  
All sites will receive unblinding envelopes to facilitate emergency unblinding if needed.  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530465] of Circadin® in 
doses of 4 to 6 mg in children with various neurodevelopmental disorders12.  Results of these studies 
indicated that the proposed Circadin® dosage regimen provided optimal effects with respect to 
efficacy, and there w ere no safety concerns for the dose proposed for use in this study .  A PR 
preparation, taken postprandial 0.5 to 1 hours before bedtime, will supply and sustain sufficient 
melatonin in the circulation during the whole sleep cycle .   
7.6 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Treatment compliance will be calculated at each study visit by [CONTACT_420417] , except for Visit  8, where treatment compliance will be determined according to 
the parents reporting on the amount of tablets the child has taken since Visit 7:  
Compliance (%) =  Number of tablets dispensed – N umber of tablets returned* –  
Number of tablets lost  × [ADDRESS_530466] visit 
* In case patients/parents forgot to bring in the unused IMP, the number of tablets returned is to be 
replaced by [CONTACT_420418], as reported by [CONTACT_8130] .   
Any divergence from the accepted level of compliance (70% to 130% of expected consumption) is to be investigated by [CONTACT_420419].  
Treatment compliance will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF by [CONTACT_737].  
[ADDRESS_530467] OF STUDY AND STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
This study will be conducted as outlined in the following sections and in accordance with the treatment 
schedule ( Table 5 -1) and the schedule of study assessments ( Table 5 -2).  The first study visit will 
occur at Week  -[ADDRESS_530468] day o f Week  108.  Sleep will be 
measured by (1) Sleep and Nap Diaries 14 nights before each scheduled visit from Visit 1 (Week  0) up 
to and including Visit 7 (54 weeks) and (2) actigraphy 14  nights before Visit s 2 and 4.  Phone calls to 
remind patients to begin filling out Sleep and Nap Diaries will be made every week before Visit s 1 and 
2, as well as every week during the study period up to Visit 7.  Between Visit s 7 and 8, a phone call 
will be made once a month.  
This is a randomized placebo -controlled study in children diagnosed with ASDs and 
neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by [CONTACT_420387] .  Patients will start 4 weeks of basic 
sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention ( wash -out period) followed by a 2- week SB placebo run-in

double -blind period will be followed by [CONTACT_3440] -label period of 13 weeks .  Data will be gathered at the 
end of the 13- week open -label period ( Week  28), and analyzed; however, children will continue in the 
study for another 78 weeks of follow -up.  The study will end with a 2 -week SB  placebo run- out period.  
All together 10  visits are planned, including screening  visit and e nd of s tudy visit, and additional 
unscheduled visits may be necessary ( Section  8.20) .   
At each visit, s tudy questionnaires and diaries will be dispensed and completed according to the 
schedule in Table 5 -2, and as described in the sections below .  Questionnaires and diaries are to be 
completed as follows:   
• The Sleep and Nap Diary is to be completed only by [CONTACT_102]’s parent/caregiver during the 
14 nights before each scheduled visit, every morning 2 to 3 hours after the child awakens 
(Appendix  1 and Appendix  2).  The diary can be completed either directly in the eCRF or by 
[CONTACT_2329] a paper version.  If the diary is completed on paper, the site coordinator will enter the 
questionnaire data into the eCRF during the vis it.  The diaries prior to Visit [ADDRESS_530470] 
be entered in to the system at the respective visit in order to allow eligibility assessment to 
occur at Visit 1 and Visit 2.  Prior to Visit 1, diaries are required only for children who had 
undergone the  4-week sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention training period, to check 
whether they responded to the therapy.  Diaries prior t o Visit 1 are not required for children 
with a documented history of sleep hygiene and behavioral intervention, as Visit 1 el igibility 
for these children is measured based on the parent’s report of their child’s sleep over the 
previous 3 months, which is reported at screening.  If the child doesn’t need the sleep hygiene but needs the 2- week wash -out period prior to Visit 1, the  parent doesn’t need to complete the 
sleep diary either.  
• For patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_110330] a history of seizures, the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_420343]/caregivers at each visit and to be completed by [CONTACT_102]’s 
parent/caregiver onl y on the days that the patients has a seizure .  It should include the date, 
time, duration and type of the seizure  (Appendix  10).  The E pi[INVESTIGATOR_420344]’s parent/caregiver  after each seizure.  
• The questionnaires CSDI, SDQ, ESS , WHO- 5, and PSQI are to be completed by [CONTACT_420420]/Investigators with the parents/caregiver, by [CONTACT_420409]/caregiver.  Note:  The ESS, 
WHO- 5, and PSQI are to assess sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], quality of sleep, and well -being of the 
parent/caregiver and NOT the child.   
• The TESS (Appendix  5) and CGAS ( Appendix  3) must be administered and completed by [CONTACT_420421]/caregiver ’s input .

11 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
11.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study .  Adverse 
events should be elicited using the TESS  (Appendix  5).   
11.1.[ADDRESS_530477] a causal relationship with this treatment.   
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding or 
physical examination), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product .   
An AE includes any noxious, pa thological or unintended change in anatomical, physiological or 
metabolic functions as indicated by [CONTACT_30597], symptoms and/or laboratory changes whether associated with the study drug and whether or not considered drug related .  This includes an 
exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the 
significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments .  Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing conditions, 
including the disease under study, which do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening, need not be considered AEs.  
Patient entry into the study is defined as the time at which informed cons ent is obtained (this must be 
before any protocol -specific diagnostic procedures or interventions) .  All AEs on this study subsequent 
to Visit [ADDRESS_530478] be reported regardless of whether or not they are considered related to study drug.  Any 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 52 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 AEs experienced s ubsequent to signing of the informed consent/assent will be recorded as a medical 
history item.  
At Visit 1, the TESS questionnaire ( Appendix  5) is completed and the information is used to assess 
medical history.  All symptoms that are score of [ADDRESS_530479] visit (i.e., Visit 1).  If a specific symptom ha s the same score or lower from V isit 1 AEs should 
not be reported.  
Adverse events are also to be reported on the appropriate page of the patient’s eCRF.  
11.1.2 Assessment of Severity  
Each AE will be assig ned a category as follows:  
Mild :   Not sufficiently intense to result in discontinuation of the study drug .  Symptomatic 
treatment may have been given.  
Moderate:  Sufficiently intense to result in discontinuation of the study drug .  Symptomatic 
treatment may have been given .   
Severe:   More intense than moderate; moreover the AE interferes significantly with ability to do 
work or usual activity.  
A change in the severity of an AE will require it to be recorded as a separate event.  
11.1.3 Assessment of Frequency  
Frequency should be assessed using the following categories:  
• Unique  
• Intermittent 
• Cont inued 
11.1.4 Assessment of Outcome  
Outcome should be assessed using the following categories:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Not recovered/not resolved 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal

Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 • Unknown  
11.1.[ADDRESS_530480] be recorded in the eCRF .  The Investigator is requested to assess the relationship 
of any clinical adverse experiences to treatment using the following definitions:  
Causality should be assessed using the following categories:  
• Not related :  those AEs which are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes 
(concurrent drugs, environment etc.) and do not meet the criteria for drug relationship listed under Unlikely, Possible, Probable or Related.  
• Unlikely to be related :  an adverse experience may be considered unlikely if it includes at least 
the first 2 features:  
o It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug  
o It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102] 's clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient   
o It does not follow a known pattern to the suspected drug  
o It does not reappear or worsen when the dr ug is re -administered  
• Possibly related :  an adverse experience may be considered possible if it includes at least the 
first 2 features :   
o It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug 
o It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102] 's clinical state, environment or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
o It follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug 
• Probably related :  an adverse experience may be considered probable if it includes at least the 
first 3 features :   
o It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
o It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564] 's clinical 
state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of ther apy administered to the 
patient  
o It disappears or decreased on cessation or reduction in dose .  There are exceptions when 
an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug (e.g ., bone marrow 
depression, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc. ). 
o It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug.

Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 • Definitely related :   An adverse experience may be considered related if it includes all of the 
following features:  
o It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug.  
o It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564] 's clinical 
state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administered to the 
patient . 
o It disappears or decreased on cessation or reduction in dose .  There ar e exceptions when 
an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug .  For example:  bone

11.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any event which is:  
• Fatal  
• Life threatening:  
o An AE is life threatening if the patient is at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurs (i.e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had 
occurred in a more serious form).  
• Disabling or incapacitating :  
o An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent 
disruption of the patient’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]:  
o Complications occurring during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420348].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39939] a pre -existing non- worsening condition is not considered an AE .  The details of such 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420349]/physical examination page of 
the eCRF.  
In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification is required in other situations (i.e., any event which the Investigator regards as serious that does not strictly meet the 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530482] or precaution 
that may be associated with the use of the study drug.  
11.2.2 Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE, is defined as 1 that has not been reported as expected in this protocol or the 
Investigator’s Brochure, either from previous clinical studies or the pre -clinical studies.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_530483] be faxed 
by [CONTACT_420428] 24  hours following knowledge 
of the SAE. 
The Investigator should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before 
notification of a SAE, though additional information may be requested.  Where applicable, information 
from relevant laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117984].  
Instances of death, congenital abnormality or an event that is of such clinical conce rn as to influence 
the overall assessment of safety, if brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after cessation of study medication and linked by [CONTACT_420429] .   
Serious  adverse events should be reported to:

11.3 WITHDRAWAL DUE TO AN ADVERSE EVENT  
Any patient who experiences an AE  may be withdrawn from the study drug at any time at the 
discretion of t he Investigator .  If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an AE , both the 
AEs page and termination page of the eCRF will be completed at that time .  As described in 
Section  6.3, a patient who withdraws from the clinical study is required to be seen for a Withdrawal 
Visit scheduled as soon as possible  after the patient has withdrawn , and end -of-study procedures  are to 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530484] be made of the seriousness, 
intensity and relationship to the administration of the study treatment.  After the initial AE/SAE report 
the Investigator is r equired to follow -up proactively each patient  and provide further information to 
PRA Health Sciences  on the patient ’s condition.  During the study all AE/SAEs should be followed up 
to resolution unless the event is considered by [CONTACT_420430] ’s underlying condition, or the patient is lost to follow -up.   
11.5 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND VITAL SIGNS  
Vital signs and physical examination will be assessed at screening each visit including the placebo run -
out (withdrawal) period.  Physical examination findings at screening  will be classified using standard 
categories as listed on the Medical History e CRFs .  Any physical examination finding that is judged by 
[CONTACT_179821] a clinically significant change (worsening) compared to a baseline value ( Visit 2) 
will be considered an AE, recorded on the adverse event e CRF, and monitored as described in 
Section  11.4.   
A complete physical examination will include examination of body systems (including, but not limited to, general appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, breasts, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph 
nodes, extremities, and nervous system) .   
The Ta nner scale will be used to assess and stage physical development in children ≥ 8 years of age.  
For children ≤5 years of age, only height and head circumference will be used to stage children 
development.  Between the age of 5  and 8 the children’s physical  development will be determined 
using the BMI.   
11.6 TREATMENT OF OVERDOS E OF STUDY MEDICATIO N 
There is no experience of overdosing with Circadin
®.  No specific treatment for overdosing is known.  
Administration of daily doses of up to [ADDRESS_530485] been reported in the literature.  
If overdose occurs, drowsiness is to be expected.  Clearance of the active substance is expected within 12 hours after ingestion.  Treatment given to a patient in case of overdosing should be symptomatic 
and supportive.   
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530486] be filed in the Study Cente r File.  Any AEs associated with 
the overdose should be reported on relevant AE/SAE sections in the e CRF .

the Investigator will remove the patient from the study .  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up  and 
documented even if the patient  was discontinued from the study .  All reports of congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs .  Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled 
as SAEs  (Section  11.2.3) .  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs .  
All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to PRA Health Sciences .   
11.8 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND VITAL S IGNS  
Vital signs and physical examination will be assessed at each visit including the placebo run -out 
(withdrawal) period.  
11.9 OTHER SAFETY A SSESSMENTS  
BMI and Z-score calculations  will be assessed at each visit including the placebo run -out (withdrawal) 
period.

12 DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
12.1 DATA MANAGEMENT  
An eCRF will be used for the current study and a data management plan will be prepared.   
The site will be supplied with the following data collection tools :  a web browser address for an 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system database that has been fully validated and conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 and the Guidance for Industry on Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials requirements .  
The EDC system database will be maintained by [CONTACT_420431].   
Trained s ite staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_420432] 
(e.g., medical records and study -specific data capture forms as needed) into the EDC system .  All 
information on the eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents .  Data recorded directly on the 
eCRFs will be defined before study  start.  The eCRFs will be completed for all patient s randomized to 
study treatment.  The eCRFs for patient s who are randomized but not treated will be completed with 
all data collected at the time of patient  study discontinuation.  Screen failures should also be entered 
into the eCRF.  Clinical Research Associates will review the eCRFs entered by [CONTACT_5375] .   
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530488] igational site.   
All treatment- emergent AEs (events occurring from the first dose of study medication through the last 
study evaluation) will be recorded in the EDC system.  AEs will be code d using the MedDRA 
dictionary (version  16.1) and c oncomitant medications will be coded using a standard dictionary (e.g., 
WHODrug , dated March 2013) .   
The process of randomization and allocating randomized treatments using the eCRF is described in the eCRF completion guidelines and the I MP Handling G uidelines.   
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked .  Any 
changes to the database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_420433].  
12.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLA N 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study database .  
The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided in the protocol .  Additional analyses may be added .  Tables, listing and figures shells will 
also be provided.

study report (CSR) to the regulatory authorities for evaluation of approval of the study drug for use in the investigated population.  At the completion of the study (at the end of the second open- label safety 
follow -up period [ Week  108] ), another final CSR will be submitted to regulatory authorities .  This 
report will include all the remaining results and analyses (this is in compliance with the final Pediatric Committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_420351] (1991) Pediatric Investigational Plan [PIP] for the 
study drug , Circadin
® (IMP), deferring the completion of the safety follow -up part of the study -  EM 
EA-000440-  PIP02 -11).   
12.4 RANDOMIZATION  
At Visit 1, enough eligible male and female children , of ages 2 to 17.5 years , will be screened for the 
study  to allow for 120 patients to then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Circadin® or placebo at 
Visit 2.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_530490] open- label 
period.  A minimum of  50 children are expected to complete the second open -label safety follow -up 
period.  The process of randomization and allocating randomized treatments using the eCRF is 
described in the eCRF completion guidelines and the I MP Handling G uidelines .   
12.5 ANALYSIS SETS

covariance structure will be assumed .  The global treatment effect estimates will be reported, with 
95% CIs and p- values .  Further analysis will include interaction between treatment and visit.  
Interaction p- values will be reported with treatment effect estimates at each visit with 95% CI  and 
p-values.  
Exploratory  
Sleep variables and sleep disturbance will be assessed by [CONTACT_420435], 
respectively, at baseline (Week  2) and after 3 and 13 weeks of double -blind treatment ( Weeks 5 and 
15, respectively ) by [CONTACT_420436] (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) .  For this outcome, the mean 
score at [ADDRESS_530499] the null hypothesis s o that these adjusted mean scores are equal.   
The CSDI and Sleep and Nap Diary  variables will also be summarized after 13, 26, and 39 weeks of 
open- label treatment (Weeks 28, 41, and 54) by [CONTACT_420437] (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) .  
CSDI will be also summarized after 91 weeks of open- label treatment and at the end of study visit 
(Week 108) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, med ian, minimum, and maximum) .   
The CGAS and SDQ scores  will be summarized at baseline (Week 2), after 3 and 13 weeks of 
double -blind treatment ( Weeks 5 and 15, respectively), and after 13 weeks of open- label treatment 
(Week  28) by [CONTACT_420438] (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).

For all exploratory analyses for the double -blind period, a MMRM will be fitted to assess any 
differences in treatment effects over time.  The base models w ill contain the specified outcome 
measure after baseline as the dependent variable, with independent variables in the form of the 
baseline score, the study visit (categorical variable) and treatment allocation.  
12.8.2 Safety Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, changes in physical examinations and vital signs 
measurements .  The number of patients withdrawing during the treatment periods will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_420440].   
12.8.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
The changes in BMI  and Z-score from baseline to the end of the study will be summarized using shift 
tables showing the number of children below, within and above  z calculated normal at each treatment 
group, separately.  The BMI  and Z -scores are designed to take into account the amount of weight gain 
that would be expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents.  The BMI and Z -scores are 
categorized by [CONTACT_420441] (corresponding to a normal distribution with mean 
0 and a SD of 1) of the actual weight measurements, based on the Growth Charts provided by [CONTACT_48667].   
Tanner scores for pubertal assessment in children ≥ 8 years of age during the study will be analyzed 
using the web applic ation (http://vps.stefvanbuuren.nl/puberty)20.  This tool calculates SD  scores of 
individual observations of Tanner scores and additionally plots those scores in stage line diagram21. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for head and height measurements and changes in head and 
height measurements from baseline to Week  108 in children ≤ 5 years of age.   
Descriptive statistics will also be provided f or the number and severity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_420352], using the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_420353] D iaries that are completed by [CONTACT_420442] a later time point by [CONTACT_779] .  
12.9 STUDY TERMINATION CRITERIA 
Neurim Pharmaceuticals (1991) Ltd reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time .  
The reasons will be discussed with the Investigator and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) .  
A study site may also be discontinued by [CONTACT_420443] (1991) Ltd for significant deviations 
from the protocol or due to insurmountable difficulties experienced in running the study at that center .   
The study may be terminated before the planned number of patients has been achieved for the 
following reasons:  
• Safety and tolerability issues with study IMP which have come to light since study started.  
• Slow patient recruitment  
• Global recruitment target achieved  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 63 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 • Sponsors decision 
• Investigator ’s decision 
• Force Majeure  
Specifically, the study may be t erminated prematurely at any time that emergent data indicate that the 
potential benefit of participation is outweighed by [CONTACT_420444] .  Additionally the Sponsor may 
terminate the study if information emerges which demonstrates that the study will not meet its primary 
objective or progress is unsatisfactory.  
A written statement fully documenting the reasons for premature termination will be provided to the 
responsible Ethics Committees (ECs) and Regulatory Authorities within the timelines required by 
[CONTACT_427].  
12.[ADDRESS_530500] the 
interests of patient s in the study and those to be entered, by [CONTACT_420445] .  The data provided to the DSMB will not be considered ‘clean’ 
until the database is locked.  Data will be provided to the DSMB by [CONTACT_420446].  
Further details regarding the DSMB will be provided in the DSMB charter .  The DSMB charter will 
define the primary responsibilities of the DSMB, guide its activities, its relationship with other trial components, its membership and the purpose and timing of its meetings .  It will provide the 
procedures for ensuring confidentiality, formal communication and outline of the content of the reports that will be provided by [CONTACT_4318].  
12.11 HANDLING OF DROPOUTS/MISSING DAT A  
Missing data will not be replaced for both primary and secondary criteria .  The following will be 
applied concerning start and end dates:  
• If the day is unknown and the month and the year are known, it will be replaced by [ADDRESS_530501] day of the month in case of an end date.  
• If the day and the month are unknown, they will be replaced by 01/01 in case of a start date or 
31/12 in case of an end date.  
• If the day, the month and the year are unknown, the date wi ll be considered as missing.  
For start and end dates of AEs, there is an exception from the above mentioned rules:  
• If the day is unknown and the month and the year are the same as the first treatment intake 
known, it will be replaced by [CONTACT_420447] t reatment intake.  
• If the day and the month are unknown and the year is the same as the first treatment intake 
known, it will be replaced by [CONTACT_420448].  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530502] (clinic visit or telephone contact) .  One of these documented 
attempts must include a written communication sent to the patient’s last known address via a courier or 
mail (with acknowledgement of receipt request) asking that they return any unused IMP and return to 
the clinic/site for final sa fety evaluations.  
Sleep and Nap Diaries  should not be amended by [CONTACT_8786], with exception of the following 
situations :   
• Dates presented with i nconsistent  formatting can be edited for consistency .  
• Missing or incorrect dates in a sequence can be corrected (e.g. , the dates Dec 2014 to Jan 2014 
could be corrected to Dec 2014 to Jan 2015)   
• Time entered using the 12 -hour format can be revised to the 24- hour format .   
• Hours can be converted to minutes and vice versa, as needed .   
• If at any visit the site determines that parents were not compliant in completing the Sleep and Nap Diaries (i.e., mandatory questions in the diaries were not correctly completed for at least 
5 out of 7 nights  per week (total of 2 weeks before each scheduled visit) , it will be at the 
discretion of the Investigator to determine whether the patient  will be excluded  from study  as a 
result of lack of compliance ( Section  6.1).  At Visits 1 and 2, this criterion is required to be met 
for patients to be eligible to continue on study  and is considered a major entry criterion .  As 
well, at Visit 3 and Visit 5, if par ents were not compliant in completing the Sleep and Nap 
Diaries the Investigator can not increase a patient’s dose if so desired by [CONTACT_16032]  
(Section  7.3.1) .  If parents were not compliant in completing the Sleep and Nap Diaries at 
Visits 3 and 5, this is to be considered a significant violation ( Section  13.3.2) and reported in 
the eCRF .  If a patient visit is delayed the parents are required to continue with completing  
diaries until the next visit .  Compliance will be judged on the diaries complete d in the 2 weeks 
prior to the newly scheduled visit.  
The study coordinator should follow -up with parents during the phone calls to ensure diaries are 
completed in a timely manner and to make all attempts to prevent missing data and/or inconsistent data entry, according to the instructions in the Sleep and Nap Diary Guidelines.

13.3 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND 
VIOLATIONS   
13.3.1 Protocol Amendments  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_11390] ( IEC) or 
other regulatory authorities, except when necessary to elimin ate immediate safety concerns to the 
patients or when the change involves only log istics or administration .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_420354] .   
13.3.2 Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Exceptions  
A protocol deviation is nonadherence to protocol -specific study procedures or schedules that does not 
involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP guidelines .  
Deviations are considered minor and do not impact the study.  
A protocol violation is any signif icant divergence from the protocol, i.e., nonadherence on the part of 
the patient, the Investigator , or the Sponsor  to protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary 
objective variable criteria, and/or GCP guidelines .  Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, 
by [CONTACT_26271], on the e CRF.  
In this study, significant protocol violations will be defined as those that affect the assessment of safety or efficacy .  The significant protocol violations will be agreed prior to database l ock and will be 
categorised as follows:  
• Patient’s overall treatment compliance for the study is less than 70% or greater than 130%  
throughout the study   
• Patient fails to meet any inclusion criteria or meets any exclusion criteria  
• Any issues related to Sle ep and Nap Diary  completion  
• Patient takes a prohibited medication during the study  
• Wrong I MP kit dispensed 
• Patient has an insufficient wash -out of prohibited medications prior to beginning the 2- week  SB 
placebo r un-in period of the study  
• Other , defined as any deviation that causes the Investigator  to withdraw the patient from the 
study for the reason “protocol violation”, “protocol deviation” or “protocol non- compliance” 
on the study completion/withdrawal page of the eCRF  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530506] ( IRB)/IEC, in accordance with the SOP, is required before the 
patient will be allowed to enter the study .  If investigative site personnel learn that a patient who did 
not meet protoc ol eligibility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must 
immediately inform the Sponsor .  Such patients will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare 
instance following review and written approval by [CONTACT_420451]/IEC, 
according to the applicable SOP .   
13.4 INFORMATION TO STUDY PERSONNEL  
Each Investigator  is responsible for giving information about the study to all staff members involved in 
the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the practical performance of 
the study and during the course of the study (e .g., when new staff become involved) .  Each 
Investigator  must assure that all study staff members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and 
training to perform their specific responsibilities .  These study staff members must be listed on the site 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff member’s responsibilities .  This list 
must be updated throughout the study, as necessary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including each Investigator , and for ensur ing their compliance with the protocol .  Additional information will be made 
available during the study when new staff become involved in the study and as otherwise agreed upon 
with either the Investigator  or the study monitor.

An eCRF will be used to store and trans mit patient  information .  The file structure and format for the 
eCRF will be provided by [CONTACT_420452]. 
It is preferred that the Sleep and Nap diary be entered directl y into the eCRF but dairies are permitted 
to be completed on a paper diary as well .  If the diary is entered directly to the eCRF by [CONTACT_7071], 
then the eCRF serves as the source data.  If the diary is completed on paper and later entered into the 
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page 68 
 
Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 eCRF by  [CONTACT_779], then the paper version serves as the source data .  No amen dment can be made to the 
parent -reported data except in cases indicated in S ection 12.11 (missing data).  
The eCRF must be reviewed and electronically signed, and dated by [CONTACT_737].  
Access to the eCRF will be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly participating 
in the study .  Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by [CONTACT_188223] .  The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after any patient  evaluation or 
communication .  If data are to be changed due to e rroneous input or other reason, an electronic audit 
trail will track these changes .  The eCRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to study 
monitors and other regulatory auditors .   
14.2 DATA COLLECTION  
During each study visit, a physician particip ating in the study will maintain progress notes, in ink, in 
the patient ’s medical records to document all significant observations .  At a minimum, these notes will 
contain:  
The date of the visit and the corresponding day or visit in the study schedule (e.g ., screening , Day 1, 
Day 28, etc.)  
• General condition and status remarks by [CONTACT_102] , including any significant medical findings .  
The severity, frequency, duration, and resolution of any reported AE, and the Investigator's 
assessment as to whether or not the re ported AE is study drug -related  
• Changes in concomitant medications or dosages

Version 6.0  19 May  2015 Final , Amendment 5 Appendix  2:  Sleep and Nap Diary Take -Home Instructions for Parents  
 
The Diary has to be completed  for [ADDRESS_530516] year of participation. The 
diary should be completed  every morning preferably 2-3 hours after the child went out of bed. 
 
    What time did the child go to bed? 
 
    This is the moment that bedtime routines are over (lights off). From this 
moment onwards, no further reading or parent interaction should happen and 
the child is expected to attempt to sleep. Use 24 hour clock (i.e. 21:35) to 
record times. 
    When all bedtime routines are over (lights off), the event marker butto n on the 
Actiwatch is to be pushed. Ensure the time entered in the diary for the child going 
to bed is the same as the one appearing on the Actiwatch screen. 
    If Actiwatch was not pushed, in error, at the correct moment, please use the 
actual time the child went to bed (the time bedtime routines were over) for 
the Diary 
    Do not change the initial time entered in the diary if the child has difficulties 
falling asleep i.e. calls you into the bedroom or leaves the bedroom to find you. 
 
    How long did it take your child to fall asleep? 
 
    This is the duration in minutes from first attempt to fall asleep (bedtime routines 
are over, lights off) to final sleep. 
 
    Times and durations of wakes up during the night. 
 
    Enter the accurate times and durations. Do not round times up or down. For times 
use 
24 hours clock i.e. 01:35 – 02:45. Durations should be entered in minutes, i.e. 
[ADDRESS_530517] estimation. 
 
    How many hours of actual sleep did the child get that night? – 
 
    Please use hours:minutes for example six and a half hours should be entered as 6:30 
 
    What time did the child wake up? 
 
    This is the time your child finally woke up and did not fall asleep anymore (lights on). 
This may be different from the time the child got out of bed. Use 24 hour clock (i.e. 
07:35) to record times. 
 
    The time of wake up (lights on) should be marked also by [CONTACT_420460] n on the Actiwatch – use the time that appears on the Actiwatch 
for the diary. 
 
    Example responses to the questions of the Sleep Nap diary are provided in the table 
–on the next page.

originally developed for the 'Children and Young Persons In- patient Evaluation (CHYPIE) Study.  
CODING THE CGAS  
Code the CGAS on the basis of your patient's worst level of emotional and behavioural functioning in 
the past three months by [CONTACT_420465]/her functioning on a hypothetical continuum of health- illness.  The scores can rang e from 1, which is the very worst, to 
100, which is the very best.  Use intermediary levels (e.g., 35, 58, 62).  
 
Rate actual functioning regardless of treatment or prognosis.  
Do not count functional physical impairments unless they are clearly related to emotional functioning, 
(i.e., functional handicap due to cerebra/palsy or blindness would not be coded, but difficulty as a 
consequence of soiling would be). (Note that the HoNOSCA coding differs here -  cf area A6.)  
 
It will be helpful to take into accoun t how your patient functions in four major areas:  
1. At home with family  
2. At school  
3. With friends  
4. During leisure time  
The overall score will represent an overall rating from these four areas.  
Locating the score  
1. Locate a decile based on the descriptions that follow. 
2. Consider the appropriate decile in thirds and locate the functioning in the upper middle or lower 
third of the decile.  
3. Choose a score within that third as the overall score.

of the Adult Global Assessment Scale (Robert L. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], M.D., Nathan Gibbon, M.S.W., Jean Endicott, 
Ph.D.)  
The examples of behaviour provided are only illustrative  and are not required for a particular rating. 
Specified time period: 1 month  
100-91  DOING VERY WELL  
Superior functioning in all areas (at home, at school and with peers), involved in a range of activities 
and his many interests (e.g., has hobbies or part icipates in extracurricular activities or belongs to an 
organised group such as Scouts, etc.).  Likeable, confident, everyday worries never get out of hand. 
Doing well in school. No symptoms.  
90-81  DOING WELL  
Good functioning 'in all areas.  Secure in fa mily, school, and with peers.  There may be transient 
difficulties and "everyday" worries that occas ionally get out of hand (e.g., mild anxiety associated with 
an important exam, occasionally "blow -ups" with siblings, parents or peers).  
80-71  DOING ALL RI GHT -  minor impairment  
No more than slight impairment in functioning at home, at school, or with peers. Some disturbance of 
behaviour or emotional distress may be present in response to life stresses (e.g., parental separations, 
deaths, birth of a sib ling)  but these a re brief and interference with functioning is transient, such 
children are only minimally disturbing to others and are not considered deviant by [CONTACT_420466].  
70-61  SOME PROBLEMS -  in one area only 
Some difficulty in a single area, but generally functioning pretty well, (e.g., sporadic or isolated 
antisocial acts, such as occasionally playing hooky, petty theft; consistent minor difficulties with 
school work, mood changes of brief duration, fears and anxieties which do not lead to gross avoidance 
behaviour; self -doubts).  Has some meaningful interpersonal relationships.  Most people who do not 
know the child well would not consider him/her deviant but those who do know him/her well might express concern.   
60-[ADDRESS_530524] areas or severe in one area.  
Circadin® Clinical Study Protocol Number:  NEU_CH_7911  Page [ADDRESS_530525] social areas or severe impairment functioning 
in one area, such as might result from, for example, suicidal preoccupations and ruminations, school 
refusal and other forms of anxiety, obsessive rituals, major conversion symptoms, frequent anxiety 
attacks, frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_420358].  
40 1 SERIOUS PROBLEMS -  major impairment in several areas and unable to function in one 
area  
Major impairment in functioning in several areas and unable to function in one of these areas (i.e., 
disturbed at home, at school, with peers, or in the society at large [e.g., persistent aggression without 
clear instigation; markedly withdrawn and isolated behaviour due to either mood or though disturbance, suicidal attempts with clear lethal intent]).  Such children are likely to require special 
schooling and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420359] (but this is not a sufficient criterion for 
inclusion in this category). 
30-[ADDRESS_530526] all areas (e.g., stays a t home, in ward or in bed all day without taking part 
in social activities ) OR severe impairment in reality testing OR serious impairment in communication 
(e.g., sometimes incoherent or inappropriate).  
20-11  VERY SEVERELY IMPAIRED - considerable supervis ion is required for safety.  
Needs considerable supervision to prevent hurting others or self (e.g., frequently violent, repeated 
suicide attempts OR to maintain personal hygiene)  OR gross impairment in all forms of 
communication (e.g., severe abnormalities  in verbal and gestural communication, marked social 
aloofness, stupor, etc. ).  
10-1  EXTREMELY IMPAIRED  - constant supervision is required for safety.  
Needs constant supervision (24- hour care) due to severely aggressive or self -destructive behaviour or 
gross impairment in reality testing, communication, cognition, affect, or personal hygiene.

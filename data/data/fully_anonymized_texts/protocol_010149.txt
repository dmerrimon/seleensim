Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration:  
GC4419 is formulated as a clear solution at a concentration of 9 mg/mL in 26 mM sodium 
bicarbonate- buffered 0.9 wt. % saline for parenteral administration (drug product).  GC4419 will 
be presented in single-use amber vials.  Vials will be filled with 11 mL of GC4419, of which 10 mL 
be added into a 240 mL bag of normal saline, for daily IV administration over 60 minutes.  GC4419 will be administered Monday through Friday on days when SBRT is administered. On days when 
fractions of SBRT are administered, the completion of infusion of GC4419 or placebo will be within 
180 minutes prior to that day’s SBRT.   
Duration of treatment:  
Five doses will be administered with 5 daily fractions of SBRT, given Monday through Friday  
whenever possible.  On days when SBRT is  administered, GC4419 will be administered before 
the SBRT fraction, with a goal of delivering the SBRT fraction within 180  minutes from the end of 
the GC4419 infusion.  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Matching placebo will be prepar ed by [CONTACT_618112] ’s  pharmacy, who will be 
unblinded; the rest of the clinic staff will be blinded.  For those subjects randomized to the placebo 
arm, the treatment assignment will be prepared by [CONTACT_618113] 
100% normal saline at 250mL, for IV ad ministration  over 60 minutes. Placebo will be administered

 Monday through Friday on weeks when SBRT is administered. On days when fractions of SBRT 
are administered, placebo will be administered  prior to that day’s SBRT. 
Assessment Criteria:  
Toxicity:  
• Unacceptable toxicity of SBRT will be defined as related, CTCAE grade 3 or 4 gastro-
intestinal (GI) toxicity or death, occurring within 90 days from the start of therapy.  
Efficacy:  
• Radiographic stable disease (SD) or better based on modified RECIST criteri a for the primary 
target, compared to baseline imaging of the same type, as evaluated at day  90 from the start 
of therapy.  
Safety: 
National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.[ADDRESS_820950]- SBRT  Patient-Reported Outcomes:   
• Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA)  
• NCI Patient Reported Outcomes CTCAE (PRO -CTCAE) version 1.0  
Safety Monitoring and Toxicity Management:  
1. Adverse/Serious Adverse Event assessments per CTCAE version 4.03  
2. Safety monitoring will be built into the model and ongoing LO -ET analysis using a pre-
specified trade-off between efficacy and toxicity.  
3. Toxicity requiring 25% GC4419 or PBO dose reduction:  
• Grade 2 or greater hypotension within 2 hours after the start of GC4419/placebo infusion 
• GC4419 Grade 3 or greater nausea or vomiting   
Two dose reductions of GC4419/placebo for toxicity will be permitted per patient. Patients unable 
to tolerate GC4419/pl acebo after two dose reductions must discontinue treatment with the study 
drug GC4419 but may continue with SBRT at the discretion of the treating investigator. 
For other toxicities (including those attributable to SBRT): management per institutional and A SCO 
guidelines and investigator judgment.   
Concomitant Medications/Treatments:  
Investigators may prescribe any concomitant medication or supportive therapy deemed necessary 
to provide adequate supportive care including antiemetics, systemic antibiotics, hydration to 
prevent renal damage, with the following exceptions :  
• Other concurrent chemotherapy or investigational agent during the period when SBRT is 
being given  
• Nitrates, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors (e.g., sildanefil, tadalafil, or similar 
agents) or other drugs that in the judgment of the treating investiga tor could create a risk of 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_820951] 
dose of GC4419 
• Pyridostigmine or other drugs that in the judgment of the treating investigator could create 
a risk of increased caroti d sinus sensitivity, symptomatic bradycardia, or syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
• Other biologic response modifiers –  except systemic hematopoietic growth factors for the 
management of anemia or myelosuppression  
• Concurrent approved or investigational anti -cancer thera py (e.g., chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone and biologic therapy) other than the Protocol 
regimen  
• Other investigational agents  
Anti-emetic and anti -diarrheal prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factor use are permitted per 
ASCO guidelines.   
Statistical methods:  
A maximum of 2x24 = [ADDRESS_820952] overseeing the trial 
treatment and RT dose assignments.  An overall accrual rate of approximately 3- 4 patients per 
month is anticipated, which will give approximately 1.5-2 pati ents per month in each subgroup. 
Simulations demonstrate a trial length of 6 months (early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618083]) to 12-
16 months (run to trial completion) with model stability. Full design operating characteristics 
are available in subsect ion 13.8. The same adaptive dose-finding design will be used in each of 
the two subgroups.  Within each subgroup, up to [ADDRESS_820953] cohort will be treated at dose level 1, all successive doses will be  chosen by [CONTACT_618114]-ET method to maximize the posterior Efficacy -Toxicity trade- off, and an untried dose level 
(dose level 2) may not be skipped when escalating initially.   
 
The sponsor was unblinded to treatment assignment for overall study monitoring and safety 
review. One unblinded interim  descriptive efficacy analysis will be performed for study design 
planning on the first [ADDRESS_820954] 19 subjects will be provided to participating 
investigators.   Subsequent to the single completed interim analysis by [CONTACT_456], no unblinded 
efficacy analysis will be performed until the final statistical analysis. Investigators and supporting 
staff will remain blinded to randomized treatment assignments for patients 20- 48, with only 
unblinded staff being site pharmacists, MDACC statisticians, and limited sponsor staff relative to 
study management and routine safety oversight.

 1.0 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) remains the fourth leading cause of cancer -related death 
in the [LOCATION_002], with a 5-year overall survival in the range of 5%,1 despi[INVESTIGATOR_618084], as well as advances in radiation and surgical techniques.  Surgical 
resection remains the only reasonable option for cure, given inability to reach ablative doses to local 
tumor with radiation2. Locally  advanced pancreatic cancers (LAPC) are  particularly difficult to treat 
since they only exhibit a modest response to chemotherapy3 and are, by [CONTACT_108], not immediately 
resectable. BRPC and LAPC account for approximately 30% of newly diagnosed PAC and, if not 
resected, a high proportion of patients experience local progression and/or die with a significant 
burden of local disease, and may experience significant amount of morbidity and mortality from 
local progression.4-[ADDRESS_820955] doses of chemoradiation do not improve survival compared to chemotherapy alone, local control is significantly improved
7,8.  
1.2 Rationale for SBRT and Dose Escalation  
1.2.1 Rationale for SBRT  
Pancreatic cancer remains a disease with a dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 5% and 
is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002]. In particular, l ocally advanced 
pancreatic cancer presents an even greater challenge, since these tumors cannot be surgically 
resected upfront and thus can only be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. 
Pancreatic cancer commonly occurs in the head of the pancreas, which abuts a portion of the small bowel called the duodenum.  Progression of the primary tumor is a significant source of morbidity 
and mortality from pancreatic cancer
5, local control will be required for any curative treatments for 
localized disease.  Pancreatic cancer can progress locally and/ or systemically. Therefore, the need 
for a combination of systemic and local treatments is essential in the management of this disease. 
Recent data has shown that up to 30% of pancreatic cancer patients die from progression of disease 
locally5, supporting the need for more aggressive local treatment.  
Definitive chemoradiation to tumors within the head of the pancreas can be technically and 
anatomically challenging due to the surrounding organs at risk, particularly the duodenum. 
Pancreatic cancer requires radiation doses in excess of [ADDRESS_820956] also reported better short-term pain control and quality of 
life10,11. In addition, a short course of SBRT has been shown to cause less immunosuppression and 
lymphopenia when compared to conventional radiation therapy given over 5-6 weeks12. SBRT 
coupled with immunotherapy has also been shown to potentiate both local and systemic responses 
in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma13.    
Intriguingly, SBRT may be able to elicit unique radiobiological responses from pancreatic 
tumors. A recent phase II multi -institutional study involving Hopkins, Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center and Stanford14 demonstrated efficacy and acceptable toxicity levels when adding 
SBRT (6.6 Gy x 5) to full -dose gemcitabine in patients with LAPC15.   Emory University16 recently 
published a dose escalation SBRT + FOLFIRINOX study, which increased dose to 12 Gy x 3 
fractions with acceptable toxicity and efficacy. Unfortunately, at its current doses of 5-7 Gy x 5, only 
palliation can be achieved with no improvements in mean survival rate. Additional  dose escalation 
has not been tried since initial studi es using higher doses such as 25 Gy x 1 had resulted in 
unacceptable duodenal toxicity2.  Currently, with adequate protection of the surrounding normal 
tissues, and/or selective radiosensitization of the pancreatic tumor, the therapeutic ratio of SBRT 
could be significantly  improved.  
The optimal sequencing and doses of chemotherapy and SBRT are not yet known.  
However, most patients with locally advanced disease will now receive newer and more powerful 
chemotherapy combinations that were extrapolated from the metastatic setting, such as 
FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), or gemcitabine-abraxane, and 
may be even more effective at reducing tumor burden and improving resectability.  If patients do 
not metastasize after induction chemotherapy, they could be considered for consolidative radiation 
treatments that would either convert them to a resectable state or maintain sufficient local control 
for a prolonged period of time. SBRT is effective and well -tolerated, but is not curative because its 
biologically effective dose is too low.  Thus, the primary goal of this combined phase I/II study would be to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SBRT in combination with GC4419, a 
dismutase mimetic (DM) , and describe efficacy endpoints consistent or better than historical 
standards in preparation for a phase III trial.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_820957] dose radiation (SDR) for pancreatic cancer is often limited to 50.4Gy in 28 fractions, as 
the dose is constrained by [CONTACT_618115], jejunum and stomach. Radiation dose escalation through more conformal treatment techniques, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) or proton therapy, has overcome this threshold to improve local control and overall 
survival in other tumor sites including cholangiocarcinoma,
[ADDRESS_820958] that achieving an ablative biologically equivalent doses (BED) 
may significantly improve both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). At MDACC, BED doses up to twice as high as SDR have been delivered using intensity modulated

 radiotherapy (IMRT) in a hypofractionated setting in an attempt to improve local control.20,21  The 
results of this technique were recently reported by [CONTACT_618116],21 demonstrating preliminary 
evidence that radiation dose escalation during consolidative chemoradiation therapy improves both 
overall survival and locoregional recurrence free survival in carefully selected patients. Toxicity data 
from Colbert et al [In press ]68 suggests this approach has both long term and short term safety. 
Although hypofractionated escalated dose IMRT (EDR) is appealing, it is still not ideal for a 
patient population in whom time off systemic therapy and patient convenience is of the essence. 
EDR is still delivered over 3-4 weeks, and is inconvenient for both patients and medical oncologists 
who wish to administer other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. As the technical capabilities of radiation rapi[INVESTIGATOR_618085], stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become increasingly popular due to its potential ability to deliver increasing BED with decreased toxicity over three or five days, allowing 
less time off systemic therapy.  New techniques in advanced motion management, on board 
imaging and tumor visualization allow the potential for higher dose escalation than previously 
thought possible. Still, few institutions have tested the bounds of dose escalation in SBRT.

not significantly different between the two arms, chemoradiotherapy was associated with increased 
chemotherapy -free interval, decreased local progression (32% vs 46%, P = .03) and no increase in 
grade [ADDRESS_820960] shown that as 
high as 30% of PAC patients die of local disease alone5, indicating local progression may also 
directly affect overall survival.  
Still, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a local control advantage and although we suspect an overall survival 
advantage would exist with higher BED radiation than the LAP -[ADDRESS_820961] fractionated radiation (local control ranging from 75% to 90%22,23) with decreased 
toxicity24. The potential toxicities are similar to those potentially observed with standard fractionated 
radiation, and are related to proximity of tumor and dose to duodenum, stomach and other small bowel. The majority of the severe toxicities previously noted occurred using single fraction SBRT in 
the era before modern image guidance and tumor localization, but nevertheless instilled a fear of 
utilizing high dose SBRT
25. Data for [ADDRESS_820962] available population of these BRPC and LAPC patients treated with SBRT 
comes from a recent meta analysis by [CONTACT_334868]22, which pooled 19 studies with a total of 1009 
patients . In this study, pooled 1- year OS was 51.6%, local control rate was 72.3% and the 
occurrence of severe adverse events (grade 3-4 toxicity) exceeding 10% in only 3/[ADDRESS_820963] doses studied and those studies performed without fiducials or image guidance. In all studies, the rate of late toxicity ranged from 0-11%, with a rate of 0% in 6/19 studies. Acute 
toxicities noted included anorexia, bleeding, duodenitis, gastritis, diarrhea, gastrointestinal ulcers, 
abdominal pain, nausea, and abdominal pain. Late toxicities included ulcer, fistula, hemorrhage and 
GI obstruction. BED in these studies ranged from 37.5 Gy to 112.5 Gy. The study  which utilized 
112.5 Gy
26 by [CONTACT_618117] 15 Gy in 3 fractions. 66% (8/12) of patients improved in 
performance status at [ADDRESS_820964] that the prescription dose was given to the 
entire PTV volum e, without consideration of nearby [CONTACT_618118] (OAR’s). Our novel 
treatment delivery technique (in section 1.2.5) delivers high dose radiation to the tumor, while respecting nearby [CONTACT_618119]’s. Additionally, we expect the delivery of this BED in 5 fr actions to be safer 
than delivery in 3 fractions as it allows more margin of error for potential OAR shift between treatments. 
1.2.5 Novel SBRT Planning Technique 
Previous radiation therapy planning techniques for SBRT involved contouring a gross tumor 
volume (GTV) and creating a uniform PTV with an expansion ranging from 3mm -7mm. The dose 
was prescribed to the PTV, although more recent studies may include an escalated dose to the GTV simultaneously, in what is described as a simultaneous integrated boost technique (SIB). This 
allows a nested dose delivery, hypothetically protecting normal structures from a higher dose they 
may be unable to tolerate. Unfortunately, this technique does not take into consideration the location 
of the OAR that is to be avoided. Often, these plans are heterogeneous, and heterogeneity up to 
10% in either direction is considered acceptable. The radiation oncologist upon evaluating the plan, 
can take into consideration whether these “hot spots” are in tumor or in OAR and adjust accordingl y, 
but this discrimination is subjective and prone to error. The lead study site, MDACC, has developed 
a novel technique using multiple SIB volumes and a multiple OAR avoidance volumes with 3-5mm 
margins, known as planning risk volumes (PRV’s) . In this method, the PRV is subtracted from the 
PTV volumes, with planning algorithms designed to ensure that normal structures receive no high dose volume. OAR volumes receive only the dose level known to be safe. Using this technique, 
MDACC has  treated >[ADDRESS_820965] provided an SIB to the tumor -vessel interface (TVI) where tumor meets SMA 
and the highest risk for a positive margin resection exists, and have provided SIB to the GTV. We proposed taking advantage of this technique to boost the TVI and center of tumor, while protecting 
OAR’s better than previous studies have. We are curr ently performing dosimetric studies to better 
understand its potential uses and limitations in SBRT, but we feel it may increase safety by [CONTACT_618120] 07 GTI-4419 -101

 contraints and PTV dose l evels. Figure 1a illustrates a typi[INVESTIGATOR_618086], GTV and a symmetric PTV expansion. Figure 1b demonstrates our novel planning technique 
adapted from institutional experience in escalated dose IMRT (EDR) demonstrating avoidance 
structures which take priority over target volumes, thus limiting OAR dose to safe volumes while 
allowing escalation to tumor and to TVI. 
1.2.6 Selected SBRT Dose Levels  
The dose levels selected for this study ( table 1) were designed with previous SBRT studies 
and known dose limitations to OAR’s in mind. The PTV1 dose level is identical for all three dose levels, 6.6 Gy x 5 fractions. At this dose, previous data demonstrates that duodenal toxicity is less 
than 2% and treatment is uniformly safe and well -tolerated. The PTV1 volume covers the tumor 
contour (iGTV) including the high risk of recurrence intravascular space (TVI) adapted to the 4D 
motion and a 3mm margin.The proposed PTV2 volume is PTV1 but with subtraction  of the bowel 
contours with their 5mm  motion margin ( PRV) with the PRV given priority, ensuring that the PRV 
will receive none of this high dose volume. At the dose levels [ADDRESS_820966], one at University of Colorado 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) which started in November 2016 and the second from Memorial Sloan Kettering 
Cancer Center ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , started in December 2015. Both trials are utilizing a standard 3+[ADDRESS_820967] dose level target, and due to the basic design, will 
not provide any phase II data at its conclusion. Additionally, with the addition of a novel 
radioprotectant we anticipate improved toxicity and higher achievable dose levels than trials with radiation alone.

1.2.7  GC4119 as a Radioprotectant Agent in PAC  
GC4419 is a small -molecule mimetic of the human superoxide dismutase enzymes (SOD), 
or dismutase mimetic.  GC4419 is being investigated in clinical trials for  the reduction of the 
incidence and severity of severe oral mucositis (SOM) induced by [CONTACT_69159] (RT), with or 
without systemic therapy under [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IND 111,539.  
In normal biology , superoxide (O 2•-) is generated at moderate levels as a by -product of 
mitochondrial cellular respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. It is also produced by [CONTACT_618121] a number of 
enzymes, including NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)  oxidases.  Particularly 
large amounts are also generated directly or indirectly by [CONTACT_618122], including some chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In all studied species, O 2•- levels 
are normally constrained to an acceptable level by [CONTACT_618123]. These SODs are 
oxidoreductases that dismutate O 2•- into molecular oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2). 
There are three vertebrate SODs: cytoplasmic (“Cu/Zn SOD”), mitochondrial (“MnSOD2”), and 
extracellular (“EcSOD3”) responsible for dismutation of super oxide present in their respective 
compartments.  Additional systems then further process the resulting H 2O2, neutralizing it, or in the 
case of phagocytic activity using it to manage threats such as bacterial infection.  
Since O 2•- and certain daughter products are extremely reactive with biological molecules, 
excess O 2•- can be quite toxic to normal cells. If O 2•- production is excessive or if O 2•- dismutation is 
compromised, the SOD enzymes may be insufficient and excess O 2•- can overwhelm the body’s 
ability to eliminate it leading to a variety of superoxide-initiated or -mediated disease states.  
Ionizing radiation, as used to treat cancer, attacks tumor cells both by [CONTACT_618124], 
but perhaps more importantly by [CONTACT_618125] (ROS), 
particularly hydroxyl radical (HO•).  Radiation also significantly increases O 2•-, another ROS, via at 
least three mechanisms: (1) radiolytic hydrolysis coincident with irradiation, (2) mitochondrial 
dysfunction and direct activati on of O 2•- producing enzymes acutely after radiation, and (3) O 2•- 
production by [CONTACT_618126].  Normal cells in 
the radiation field experience this burst of O 2•-, but counter its damaging effects via their intact redox

 protective enzyme systems (SODs, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, etc.) and by [CONTACT_618127].  However, it appears that in radiation therapy, especially as radiation 
doses increase, these endogenous controls on O 2•- are insufficient to fully protect normal cells, and 
effective cancer radiation therapy often carries major normal tissue toxicity.  Galera’s clinical and 
pre-clinical results with its dismutase mimetics suggest that the SODs are a limiting component in 
this normal tissue response, and that increasing SOD activity can protect against various radiation therapy toxicities  (unpublished data) . 
Cancer cells, on the other hand, are more tolerant of significant elevations in O
2•-, and may 
in fact increase O 2•- levels to support proliferative pathways and modify the tumor microenvironment.  
However, it has been known for decades that cancer cells in general are more sensitive to increases 
in H 2O2 than normal cells, with high levels of H 2O2 production triggering tumor cell apoptosis.  Galera 
and its collaborators have shown that the shift from an excess of O 2•- generated by [CONTACT_618128] H 2O2 driven by [CONTACT_618129]28. This difference in sensitivity to these two key ROS supports the hypothesis and 
Galera’s experimental observations that dismutase mimetics can both protect normal cells from the 
toxicity of ionizing radiation while also increasing anti -tumor efficacy.  
GC4419 (avasopasem manganese) (Manganese, dichloro[(4aS,13aS,  
17aS,21aS) 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,12,13,13a,14,15,16,17,17a,18,19,20,21,21a-eicosahydro-11,7-nitrilo -
7H-dibenzo[b,h][1,4,7,1O]tetraazacycloheptadecine-KN5,KN13,KN18,KN21, 
KN22]-) is a water soluble, highly stable, low molecular weight manganese-containing macrocyclic 
ligand complex whose activity mimics that of naturally occurring SOD enzymes.  Unlike non-specific 
oxygen catalytic agents which may also dismutate O 2•- as part of a generic catalysis of reactions of 
various oxygen species, GC4419 is unique in that it selectively removes O 2•- anions, just as the 
native SODs do, without reacting with other reactive oxygen species, including H 2O2, HO•, nitric 
oxide (•NO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO-).  Also, at physiologic conditions it acts at the extremely rapid 
catalytic rate approaching that of the SOD enzymes.  In addition, unlike native SOD, GC4419 is not 
deactivated by [CONTACT_618130] H 2O2.   
Nonclinical data have identified Galera’s dismutase mimetics, including the next generation 
candidate in this program, GC4419 as promising anti -cancer agents, particularly in combination 
with higher doses of radiation therapy.   
In a prior Phase 1b/2a trial (see Figure 2), 46 head and neck cancer ( HNC) patients received 
GC4419 administered intravenously over 60 minutes at doses up to 112 mg/day, M -F, for up to [ADDRESS_820968] -fractionation RT plus concurrent cisplatin, with acceptable 
toxicity.  A randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind Phase 2b trial compared 30 or 90 mg/day 
of GC4419, or placebo, plus single- agent cisplatin plus IMRT in [ADDRESS_820969] of the patients 
on this study were randomized to receive 90 mg/d, M -F, for 7 weeks, concurrent with 
chemoradiotherapy.  At that dose, the duration, incidence, and severity of severe OM were reduced compared to placebo (Anderson, et al, presentation at ASTRO 2018). Adverse events at the 90 mg 
dose were of similar frequency and severity as in the placebo arm, indicating that GC4419 did not 
appear to increase the toxicity of the underlying chemoradiotherapy regimen.  Therefore, the 90 mg 
dose of GC4419 is expected to be sufficiently safe for administration M -F for 1 week in combination 
with SBRT, which follows a similar short course.  Given the differences in RT schedule, and the

 presence of cisplatin in the HNC studies (but not planned in SBRT studies described in this 
application) , higher doses than [ADDRESS_820970] potent damaging agent 
of radiation,  and thus it has been proposed that reduction of this species could limit radiation-
induced tissue damage
29. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of 
superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which can be easily disposed of through bioreductive pathways 
such as the glutathione system.  Tumors, however, often do not express Glutathione ( GSH ) 
pathway and are thus particularly susceptible to cell kill by [CONTACT_618131].  This differential effect on normal tissue versus tumor provides the rationale of using a superoxide 
dismutase mimetic.  GC4419 is a novel, small -molecule SOD mimetic that selectively removes 
superoxide anions, and thus radiation-induced side effect predominantly in normal tissues.  GC4419  
has been shown to markedly reduce the severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients with 
head and neck cancer, and is being tested in a Phase II I study.  The efficacy of GC4419 in the

To determine the role of GC4419 in protecting the gut in a clinically relevant SBRT model, 
C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10mm SBRT field with AP/PA technique targeted to the pancreas 
of C57BL/[ADDRESS_820972]. Mice were immobilized with an isoflurane anesthesia manifold. We treated these normal mice with 8.5Gyx5 fractions given 
daily (BED
10=78.6Gy).  We found that there was no overt toxicity from GC4419 and that 
administration of the drug 30 minutes prior to each SBRT dose improved survival (p=0.03) . 
Prior data demonstrated dose-related protection of mice from lethal total body irradiation by 
[CONTACT_618132]4419, GC440330. As noted above, initial clinical data with GC4419 
show an apparent marked reduction in severe oral mucositis induced by [CONTACT_618133], consistent with pre-clinical models of 
mucositis31.  In animal studies, Galera’s collaborator [CONTACT_618174] (U. [LOCATION_007]/Southwestern 
[UTSW]) has also demonstrated that GC4419 both prevents (when administered before RT) and 
mitigates (when administered after RT, with prolonged treatment producing progressively greater 
mitigation) pulmonary fibrosis after a very large single focal dose (54 Gy) of radiation to normal 
mouse lung ( see Figure 3), while others have demonstrated the ability of GC4419 and other analogs 
to protect liver32, bone marrow and salivary gland from radiation toxicity.  
Most relevant to combinations with SBRT, an enhancement of tumor response to 
radiotherapy has been demonstrated in multiple non-clinical models, most dramatically with higher fraction doses of radiotherapy.  Further, GC4419 also shows single-agent tumor growth inhibition 
in vitro with an IC50 of approximately 10 micromolar (approximately the plasma C
max with a dose of 
90 mg in clinical studies), and in vivo in susceptible tumors.  This latter  activity is likely linked to the 
significantly (5-10-fold) elevated innate O 2•- levels measured by [CONTACT_618134], which the dismutase mimetic converts to increased H
2O2 levels.

progressively synergistic tumor response has been observed in multiple xenograft and syngeneic 
tumor models with the addition of GC4419 resulting in 100% complete response rates at the highest fraction doses (see Figure 4a). 
 
 
 
As noted above, the major reason for this differential effect on cancer and normal cells is 
the differences in O
2•- and H 2O2 sensitivities between these cells.   Elevated O 2•- may actually benefit 
tumor growth and metastasis, while in normal tissues, O 2•- may enhance radiation toxicity.  This 
difference is because significant elevations in H 2O2 are toxic to cancer cells but relatively benign to 
normal tissue. The addition of a dismutase mimetic (such as GC4419) more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_407837] O 2•- to 
H2O2, creating a burden that is markedly more toxic to tumor cells than normal cells.  Increasing 
radiation fraction doses drive increased O 2•- generation that the dismutase mimetic converts to 
increased H2O2.  Thus, as supported by [CONTACT_618135]4419, the anti -tumor synergy with SBRT and 
dismutase mimetic increases with radiation fraction dose ( see Figure 5).

Antitumor efficacy of GC4419 in mouse SBRT models has been similar with 3, 10, or 24 
mg/kg.  This effective dose range overlaps with that seen with GC4419 in mouse and hamster 
models of normal tissue protection from radiation, such as those supporting the OM study above.  
Further, the GC4419 dosing schedules used in the mouse SBR T models experiments (daily x 5 
after a single SBRT dose) suggest that clinical dosing of the dismutase mimetic on the 5 consecutive weekdays  of planned SBRT (daily  x 5) is appropriate. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_820974] phase I/II dose escalation trials may require upwards of [ADDRESS_820975] phase I/II trial would be negative. Alternatively, a higher toxicity rate may be 
acceptable if a treatment provides a significant survival or disease response benefit, yet this dose would never be reached in a standard phase I/II trial due to a dichotomous toxicity outcome. The 
proposed LO -ET model has been used successfully in radiation studies with similar disease 
outcomes previously, including for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and lung 
adenocarcinoma. It allows for both of these outcomes to be considered, all while requiring often

novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_618087].

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_820977] phase I dose escalation trials often utilize a “3 +3” design ( figure 6), where [ADDRESS_820978] be treated at that dose level without toxicity before escalation 
is allowed. If any of these patients has toxicity, the trial is stopped and the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) has been reached. The phase II portion then serves as a preliminary exploration of efficacy  
utilizing the MTD calculated in the phase I portion, where generally two groups are compared and the study is powered to detect a minimal clinically relevant difference between the two groups. This 
design has several limitations, including the inability to assign patients to the next level until the 
follow up period has been completed for each of the three patients, leading to longer trials requiring 
more patients. Clinically, efficacy and toxicity are often a tradeoff, i.e. higher efficacy and higher 
toxicity may go hand-in -hand where clinicians may tolerate a toxicity rate of 20% if efficacy could 
be 50% higher than current standard of care, yet in this model toxicity is a dichotomous outcome with no consideration of efficacy. In this case, if toxicity oc curs in one patient the calculated MTD 
may not be the most efficacious dose.

The LO -ET model (Thall et al , 2013; Thall et al , 2012) is rooted in the Bayesian continual 
reassessment method (CRM), where probabilities of responses for each dose level are continuously 
assessed as the trial progresses and each patient is enrolled. Instead of requiring all patients to be 
enrolled and assessment done at the completion of the trial, the “person-time” contributed by [CONTACT_618136], in 
addition to any prior data known about the treatment. For example, if two patients have been 
enrolled and completed a 90 day observational period without toxicity, this will increase the posterior 
probability of that dose level being “safe.” The LO -ET model takes this model one step farther by 
[CONTACT_14662] a 2-dimensional continuous reassessment method. In this model, the ideal outcome is estimated as a tradeoff “curve” ( Figure 7) between toxicity and efficacy dictated by [CONTACT_15098], i.e. a 
20% toxicity rate is allowable if 75% disease stability/response can be achieved. As dose levels are 
evaluated with accumulating “person-time,” if at any point it appears the dose level is either too 
toxic or not efficacious, it is eliminated and no longer accrues patients. This continual reassessment 
(Figure 8) continues until either all dose levels are eliminated (all dose levels are either too toxic or 
not efficacious) or a clearly superior arm emerges that meets the prespecified efficacy and toxicity criteria.

levels; where dose levels are eliminated as probability of efficacy and 
toxicity is adjusted for available “person-time” for accrued patients. Each 
arm is eliminated if the probability of efficacy falls below pre-specified level or probability of toxicity is above prespecified level. Two possible outcomes include either  the model assigning all patients to dose levels and 
therefore choosing a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) when all other levels are eliminated, or all arms being deemed too toxic or inefficacious, 
thus ending the trial early and allowing patients to be diverted to other 
trials more quickly.

In this novel p hase I/II adaptive dose escalation trial ( Figure 9) we are addressing two 
primary questions: Determining the MTD of dose escalated SBRT with and without drug, and 
comparing efficacy and toxicity of SBRT with and without drug. Our trial design will enroll 48 patients 
and essentially run two parallel LO -ET models (24 patients per arm) to determine MTD nested 
within a randomized trial design. Patients are randomized to either “SBRT + Drug” or “SBRT” arms, after which the LO -ET models will run independently in each arm. The flexibility of this model will 
also allow the “SBRT + Drug” and “SBRT” arms to each continue to trial completion should all dose levels on either arm be eliminated, meaning the above mentioned potential outcomes of identifying 
an MTD or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618088] “Drug” arm. Efficacy threshold will be set at 75% minimum probability of radiographically stable disease or partial/complete response at 90 days. Maximum toxicity threshold

 2.0 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Rationale for Primary Objective  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for SBRT using a technique that protects adjacent 
OAR’s is unknown. If dose escalation could be achieved while protecting OAR’s, we may be able 
to deliver ablative doses to the pancreatic tumor and increase local control rates and overall survival 
rates. Previous studies of radiation in LAPC and BRPC have failed due to inadequate radiation doses, but better prospective studies cannot be designed until the MTD is known. The novel 
radioprotectant agent, GC4419, may provide additional protection to the gastrointestinal mucosa 
and modulate the interaction of radiation with tumor tissues, thus resulting in an either higher or 
lower MTD when given in conjunction with SBRT over SBRT alone. This primary objective was 
designed to answer this question by [CONTACT_618137]4419.

 3.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a parallel arm adaptive design phase I/ II dose-finding study to determine the optimal 
dose of fractionated SBRT, given either with the radiomodulating agent GC4419 or placebo for 
treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Dose-finding will be done using the sequentially 
adaptive phase I/ II Late onset Efficacy -Toxicity ( LO-ET) trade -off-based design [1-3].  
3.2 Detailed Treatment Plan   
Patients will be randomized to one of two arms in a prespecified randomization to ensure 
24 patients per arm.  
• Arm A:  90 mg GC4419 per day daily (60 min IV infusion), concurrent with daily fractions of 
SBRT to assigned dose level, administered Monday – Friday over one week. 
• Arm B:  Placebo daily (60 min IV infusion), concurrent with daily fractions of SBRT to 
assigned dose level, administered Monday – Friday over one week. 
Planned radiation treatment fields will be according to guidelines in section 6.0. 
GC4419/placebo will be given intravenously in a one hour infusion. SBRT must be initiated 
as soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419/placebo infusion but no later than 180 minutes 
following the end of the GC4419/placebo infusion.  
GC4419/placebo will be given beginning on the first day of radiation and continuing daily, 
concurrent with each dose of SBRT. 
If SBRT administration is not planned on any given day due to a treatment break or 
unforeseen circumstances, GC4419/placebo should not be administered on that day.  If 
GC4419/placebo is given and SBRT is not given, GC4419/ placebo should still be administered on 
each day that SBRT is anticipated to be given. Breaks in SBRT will be determined by [CONTACT_102]’s 
treating physician in accordance with standard of care. Patients should resume GC4419/placebo administration when SBRT resumes.  On days when planned doses of both GC4419/placebo and 
SBRT are not administered (e.g., due to a holiday site closure, etc.), GC4419/placebo dosing may 
be extended along with SBRT to make up the missed dose(s) . 
Anti-emetic and anti -diarrheal prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factor use should be 
administered per ASCO guidelines.   
3.3 Rationale for GC4419 Dose Selection  
Previous data for selection of GC4419 dose is extrapolated from 3 human studies of 
GC4419 in prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancers. GC4419 does not appear to 
increas e the toxicity of IMRT/cisplatin.  The acute toxicity of GC4419 was acceptable at all doses 
tested, and consistent with prior expectations as described in the Investigator’s Brochure67.  A true 
(MTD ) of GC4419 by [CONTACT_407879] 1 trials (>1/6 patients with 
DLT) was not reached in previous trials.  Although dose-limiting toxicities were suggested in two patients receiving 112 mg/dose, the relationship of the events to GC4419 is questionable in each

Confidential  29 
 case.  However, the overall incidence of Grade 3 nausea at 112 mg was nominally greater than at 
lower doses.  Even if not strictly dose- limiting, nausea is highly undesirable in this patient population 
given predilection to nausea with PAC.  In addition, circumoral paresthesia, although mild, was dose-related.  Therefore, to provide an additional margin of safety and reduce the possibility of 
adverse events that could increase the possibility of breaking study blinding, an upper dose of 90 
mg of GC4419 was used in the now-completed randomized Phase 2b trial.  Safety was acceptable 
at this dose when administered for 30 to 35 doses over six to seven weeks with concurrent IMRT 
and cisplatin , and the 90 mg dose is being studied in a Phase 3 trial to reduce severe OM in patients 
receiving chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer.   
3.4 Randomization and Blinding  
Forty eight patients will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B. Patients in Arm A will receive 
GC4419 in combination with their assigned SBRT dose, and patients in Arm B will receive Plac ebo 
(PBO) with their assigned SBRT dose. The randomization will be restricted so that the sample size within each arm is exactly [ADDRESS_820980] (YY, PT) overseeing the trial 
treatment and RT dose assignments.  Each patient will randomized by [CONTACT_618138].   Patients will be followed by [CONTACT_618139] (also 
known as a COR e Number), assigned by [CONTACT_618140].  Operational and system 
details will be included in the Study Plan and Pharmacy Manual. 
Investigators  and patients  will be blinded to GC4419 or PBO assignment, but not to SBRT 
dose level assignment.  Treatment should remain blinded until the end of the study.  Only in the 
case of an emergency, when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the patient, may the investigator unblind a patient’s treatment 
assignment prior to the end of the Post-active Phase.  The investigator will, whenever possible, 
discuss options with the Medical Monitor, on-call physician, or appropriate Galera Therapeutics, 
Inc./CRO study personnel before unblinding.  If the blind is broken for any reason and the 
investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_407884], Inc. prior to unblinding, the investigator will 
notify Galera Therapeutics, Inc./CRO as soon as possible following the unblinding incident without 
revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment, unless the information is important to the safety 
of patients remaining in the study.  In addition, the investigator will record the date and reason for 
revealing the blinded treatment assignment for that subject in the appropriate section of the CRFs. 
If a serious adverse event (SAE; as defined in section 9.0) is reported to Galera 
Therapeutics, Inc./CRO, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. staff may unblind the treatment assignment for 
the individual patient.  If an expedited regulatory report to one or more regulatory agencies is 
required, the report will identify the patient’s treatment assignment.  When applicable, a copy of the regulatory report may be sent to investigators in accordance with relevant regulations, Galera 
Therapeutics, Inc. policy, or both. 
Site pharmacies and  MDACC statisticians responsible for the treatment assignment will 
remain unblinded throughout the study.  Operational precautions will be taken to ensure that patients and participating investigators remain blinded to treatment assignments (GC4419/placebo). Personnel at Galera Therapeutics may be unblinded to the treatment 
assignment for purposes of safety monitoring.  The sponsor was unblinded to treatment assignment 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_820981] 19 subjects will be provided to 
participating investigators.   Subsequent to the single completed interim analysis by [CONTACT_456], 
no unblinded efficacy analysis will be performed until the final statistical analysis. Investigators and 
supporting staff will remain blinded to randomized treatment assignments for patients 20-48, with 
only unblinded staff being site pharmacists, MDACC statisticians, and limited sponsor staff relative to study management and routine safety oversight.

 • Inability to receive consensus -approved SBRT treatment plan after simulation due to organ at 
risk constraints or inability to tolerate simulation (see section 6.1)  
The primary reason for ceasing treatment with the randomized therapy ( GC4419 or placebo) 
will be clearly documented in the patient’s medical record and recorded on the appropriate case 
report form (CRF) page.  Once a patient discontinues, the patient will not be allowed to be retreated. 
If a patient discontinues randomized therapy as a result of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE), every attempt should be made to keep the patient in the study and continue 
to perform the required study -related follow -up and procedures.  If this is not possible or acceptable 
to the patient or investigator, the patient may be withdrawn from the study.  
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.  
4.5 Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with GC4419/placebo dosing, including administration details (e.g., volume, 
start, stop times, etc.) should be documented in the source documents and recorded on the CRF. 
4.6 Central Review  and Study Entry  
4.6.1 Initial Eligibility Determination  
Initial eligibility determination will be at the discretion of the treating institution. Galera and 
MDACC investigators will be available for discussion regarding eligibility criteria. Determination of 
resectability status will be at the discretion of the treating institution’s multidisciplinary teams; 
however, MDACC radiologists will be available for second opi[INVESTIGATOR_618089]. Central pathology review will not be required but will be allowed if clinically 
appropriate.  
4.6.2 Patient Registration and Randomization  
The treating site will notify Galera of new patient consent and submit a Registration Form 
for review  following confirmation of eligibility . Galera will then enroll /registerthe patient and notify 
the MDACC biostatistics team . A Patient ID (previously known as a CORe number ) will be assigned 
as a four digit number  (two digit site – two digit subject number)  and returned to the respective site 
on the Registration Form.  Following simulation , the site will send a request for randomization to 
the MDACC biostatistics team who will then complete randomization of patient to GC4419/placebo. 
MDACC biostastistics team will provide the SBRT dose level assignment to treating institution and 
MDACC investigators for purposes of SBRT treatment planning. The unblinded site investigational 
pharmacy will access the CTC system for  the treatment assignment (GC4419/placebo).  Please 
reference the Pharmacy Manual and Study Plan for additional detail around safety unblinding and 
registration.  
4.6.[ADDRESS_820987] three patients treated at 
each site will be reviewed by [CONTACT_618142]’s PI.  Radiation 
treatment plans will be reviewed to ensure a common  understanding of the procedures listed in 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_820988] or his/her designee at each 
participating institution for compliance with the protocol and standard of practice at each institution.  
When performed, plan reviews for patients from one institution by [CONTACT_618143], including WebEx; and/or other feasible resources 
that comply with HIPPA.  The options for sharing the SBRT plans and communication flow will be 
outlined in a separate document. 
4.7 Study Closure  
Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  
If all dose levels on a specific arm fail to meet prespecified toxicity/ efficacy criteria, that arm shall 
terminate and patients will continue to accrue on the remaining arm. Should all dose levels on the 
second arm also fail to meet prespecified toxicity/ efficacy criteria, the trial will terminate. Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures.  In terminating the study, 
Galera Therapeutics, Inc. and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to 
the protection of the patients’ interests. 
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following activities in conjunction 
with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate:  
• Return of all study data to Galera Therapeutics, Inc. (as applicable)  
• Resolution of all data queries  
• Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for all unused study drug  
• Review of site study records for completeness  
• Shipment of laboratory samples (as applicable)  
In addition, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. reserves the right to temporarily suspend or 
prematurely discontinue this study at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non-compliance.  If Galera Therapeutics, Inc. determines such action is 
needed, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. will discuss this with the investigator s (including the reasons for 
taking such action) at that time.  When feasible, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. will provide advance notification to the investigator s of the impending action prior to it taking effect.

• Patients must have no evidence of active duodenal or gastric ulcers or direct tumor invasion of 
the bowel or stomach on pre-SBRT endoscopy Previous history of ulcers >30 days prior to treatment with no active bleeding or symptoms are eligible for treatment. 
• Patients should not be treated with SBRT if SBRT-sp ecific organ at risk (OAR) constraints (listed 
in section 6.3) cannot be met. 
• Patients must be able to undergo 4D CT simulation to assess tumor motion with respi[INVESTIGATOR_618090]. 
• Patient must not have any contraindication to contrast administration at simulation, including contrast allergy refractory to premedication at the discretion of the treating physician. 
• Patient must have a functioning metal stent in place if biliary or duodenal stent is required. 
6.1.2 Technical Factors including Treatment Delivery and Fiducial Placement  
• Only ≥6  MV photons are permitted for SBRT.  
• Particle therapy is not permitted. 
• Static IMRT or VMAT must be used; 3DCRT is not permissible. It i s recommende d that 6-12 co-
planar  static IMRT fiel ds or 1 -3 arc fields (VMAT/Rapid-Arc) be used in t he radiation treatment 
plan. Flattening Filter Free (FFF) treatment is allowed. 
• Both treatments with CT and MRI guidance for positioning are accepted, for CT guided positioning 
1-5 (preferably ≥3) fiducial markers should be placed for targeting purposes. These markers will be 
placed directly at the tumor periphery and/or within 1 cm of the tumor (normal pancreas) under endoscopic ultrasound at any time prior to radiation simulation.  Fiducials are optional for MR Linac 
based treatment. Simulation can follow fiducial marker placement on  the same day in case of 
an uncomplicated positioning endoscopic procedure, however, some hours of delay are 
recommended to  reduce the risk of post- positioning swelling. The simulation quality and 
timing is  at the decretion of the treating physician. 
• Simulation should be done ≤ [ADDRESS_820997] fraction of SBRT.  
• If simulation is done > 2 weeks prior to treatment start, a verification simulation should 
be performed in the week prior to treatment start.  
• Patient s will be positioned supi [INVESTIGATOR_050], arms above the head, in a custom im mobilization devic e. 
• Administration of IV and oral contrast is required for target and normal tissue delineation unless 
patient has a contrast allergy refractory to premedication or at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  A pretreatment renal scan to assess kidney differential will be performed prior to 
initiation of treatment if clinically appropriate per the treating physician.

6.2 Target Delineation  
6.2.1 Required Structures 
• GTV: Primary pancreatic tumor as delineated on all available pre-treatment imaging and CT 
simulation  
• iGTV: GTV expanded to encompass tumor in all phases of 4DCT or all BH scans obtained 
during simulation.  
• iGTV_Exp = iGTV + 3mm (uniform expansion)  
• TVI: The segment of portal vein, SMV, SMA , and/or celiac artery that is in direct contact [CONTACT_618147]. TVI structures will be contoured to include entire radial extent of any vessel that contacts 
tumor. For example, the SMA TVI will include the entire 360-degree extent of SMA even if there 
is only  90-degree involvement of the SMA by [CONTACT_20150]. This radial contour should extend superiorly

shifts to referenced anatomy at the level of the tumor as appropriate. 
• In case Orthogonal kV/MV, kV/kV projection, or CTOR imaging will be used to verify the locatio n 
of the fiducials prior to delivery of the first treatment beam a secondary shift based on the location 
of fiducials should be utilized, as indicated by [CONTACT_389845].  
• In case MRI imaging is used for position verification, at least 2 contours need to be matched 
(e.g. PTV and duodenum), on-line re-contouring and planning is accepted, while well 
documented as serial plans given  
• Documentation of active monitoring of treatment delivery accuracy will be asked using CBCT, 
MRI images or kV and/or M V projection imaging, either immediately before or during all (or a 
subset of) treatment fields. 
6.6 Compliance Criteria  
6.6.1 Dose Uniformity  
• Variation Acceptable: Minimum dose within the PTV_1 is less than 97% of the prescribed dose, 
but does not fall below 93% of this dose or Maximum dose within the PTV_1 is greater than 
107% of the prescribed dose, but does not exceed 110% of this dose.  
• Deviation Unacceptable: Minimum dose within the PTV_1 is less than 93% of the prescribed dose or Maximum dose is greater than 110% of the prescribed dose.  
6.6.2 Volumes  
• Deviation Unacceptable:  
1. Incomplete contouring of the entire GTV or PTV;  
2. Use of different margins than specified for the PTV 1;  
3. Over -contouring of the GTV by > 30 cc (15  cc if it results in inclusion of extra duodenum, 
small intestine or stomach);  
4. Incorrect contouring of the duodenum, stomach or small intestine that results in > 15 cc 
overlap of the PTV with the OAR.  
6.6.3 Treatment Interruptions 
• Per protocol:  All treatments occur within 8 calendar days  
• Acceptable variation:  All treatments occur with 8 to 16 calendar days  
• Unacceptable variation:  Treatments take greater than 16 days to complete 
6.7 Definitions of Radiation related Adverse Events 
The criteria used for the grading of toxicities encountered in this study are Common Toxicity 
Criteria (CTC) version 4.0.3  
Very likely (80-90%) : 
• Fatigue (which generally goes away after the radiation therapy is completed)  
Protocol Amendment 07 GTI-4419 -101 
24January2020  
 
 
 
Confidential  43 
 • Skin irritation, redness, itchiness, discomfort  
• Temporary changes in blood work (decrease in blood counts, increase in liver enzymes), 
without symptoms  
Less likely (30%): 
• Nausea, vomiting (during therapy) – more common if stomach or gastrointestinal track 
irradiated  
• Chest wall pain, rib fracture (< 10%) 
Less likely, but serious (<20%) : 
• Gastric, esophagus, small bowel or large bowel irritation/ulceration, bleeding, fistula, 
obstruction or changes in motility following therapy (may require medications or surgery) (< 10% permanent changes)  
• Radiation-induced liver  disease (RILD) (<5%). Classic RILD is a clinical diagnosis of 
anicteric ascites, hepatomegaly and elevation of alkaline phosphatase relative to other transaminases that may occur 2 weeks to 3 months following radiation to the liver  
• Non-classic RILD includes elevation of liver enzymes and/or any decline in liver function 
within 12 weeks from start of therapy (~20%). RILD can lead to liver failure that could lead to death. There is an increased risk of liver toxicity in patients with large tumors and in patients with pre-existing liver disease.  
• Permanent thrombocytopenia (<1%); this may lead to bleeding 
• Kidney injury (<1%); this may lead to changes on imaging and more rarely the need for medication.  
6.8 Rapid Review and Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance  
Radiation plans  for all MDACC -treated patients will be reviewed at MDACC prior to 
treatment start during weekly gastrointestinal radiation therapy quality assurance (QA) rounds by a 
minimum of two gastrointestinal radiation oncology specific attending physicians who are not 
investigators on the trial and will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_618148].  
To ensure protocol compliance, the treatment plans for the first three patients treated at 
each participating non- MDACC site will be reviewed by a MDACC Study Lead Investigator  and the 
respective  site PI.   Radiation treatment plans will be reviewed to ensure a common understanding 
of the procedures listed in sections  6.[ADDRESS_821002] or his/her designee at each 
participating institution for compliance with the protocol and standard of practice at each institution.  
When performed, plan reviews for patients from one institution by [CONTACT_618143], including WebEx; and/or other feasible resources 
that comply with HIPPA.

 7.0 STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  
7.1 Description of Study Drug GC4419 
GC4419(avasopasem manganese)  manganese,dichloro[(4aS,13aS,17aS,21aS) -
1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,12,13,13a,14,15,16,17,17a,18,19,20,21a-eicosahydro-11,7 -nitilo -7H-
dibenzo[b,h][1,2,7,10]tetraazacylcoheptadecine- κN5,κN13,κN18,κN21,κN22]-) is a water soluble, 
highly stable, low molecular weight manganese-containing macrocyclic ligand complex whose 
activity mimics that of naturally occurring SOD enzymes. 
GC4419 Administration:   90 mg GC4419, 9 mg/mL in 26 mM sodium bicarbonate- buffered 
0.9 wt. % saline for parenteral administration.  There are no other excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  GC4419 is packaged 
as an 11 mL ± 0.1mL aliquot in a 10 mL amber glass vial with an S -127 4432/50 gray stopper and 
a 20 mm red flip-off seal. 
Placebo Administration:   Matching placebo will be prepared at the unblinded 
investigational  site pharmacy with 100% normal saline at 250 mL, for IV administration over 60 
minutes . 
7.2 Clinical Safety Data with GC4419 
In the completed Phase 1b/2a trial of GC4419 plus IMRT/cisplatin to reduce oral mucositis 
experience by [CONTACT_618149], the most common adverse events observed  were nausea, fatigue, dysgeusia, oropharyngeal pain, decreased white bl ood cell count, 
constipation, dry mouth, anemia, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased lymphocyte count, and decreased appetite. These and other adverse events observed are characteristic of the cisplatin/IMRT regimen 
in this patient population.  
The following mil d to moderate adverse events were reported as possibly related to GC4419  
for >10% of patients in the GT-001 study: nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dizziness, dysgeusia, weight loss, decreased appetite, headache, 
paresthesia, and hiccups. 
The following more severe adverse events were reported by [CONTACT_618150]4419 in the GT-001 study: anemia, nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, low 
white blood cell count, low neutrophil count, weight loss, decreased appetite, arthritis, and reduced 
range of motion.  
Potentially mechanism -related facial tingling or paresthesia, possibly due to nitric oxide 
potentiation, was reported for several patients in the GT-001 study and appears related to GC4419  
dose, occurring in 11/19 (58%) patients receiving 112 mg per dose, 5/9 (55%) patients receiving 90 
mg/dose, but only 2/18 (11%) at lower doses.  This facial tingling/paresthesia was mild to moderate, 
and when it occurred it did so during GC4419 infusion with resolution shortly after the end of the 
infusion.  It was neither treatment-limiting nor troublesome to patients, and does not pose a 
meaningful safety risk.  
Twenty -three (50%) patients experienced at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE). SAEs 
reported for > 1 patient included pyrexia and vomiting (each 11%), febrile neutropenia (9%), nausea 
(7%), and dehydration (4%). Of the 3 patients with nausea reported as an SAE, nausea was

 accompanied by [CONTACT_618151] 3 cases. Two patients, b oth at the 112 mg/dose level, experienced 
at least 1 SAE that was considered by [CONTACT_618152]4419-related, including Grade 3 
gastroenteritis in 1 patient and Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and hyponatremia in other patients; these 
events also were c onsidered DLTs. All other SAEs reported were considered by [CONTACT_618153]4419.  
In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial, GT-201, the safety  
profile of GC4419 was similar to that of placebo, indicating that GC4419 did not appear to add 
significant risk to the known toxicity of the underlying chemoradiotherapy regimen used for patients with HNC in that trial.  
7.3 Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
GC4419 will be presented as individual single- use vials, which represent daily doses to be 
administered IV concurrent with SBRT .  Details regarding labeling can be found within the 
Pharmacy Manual. 
7.4 GC4419  
GC4419 is packaged as an 11 mL ± 0.1mL aliquot in a 10 mL amber glass vial with a S -127 
4432/50 gray stopper and a 20 mm red flip-off seal. Each bottle will be labeled with the appropriate language, including the required regulatory text.  
7.5 Placebo  
Placebo vials will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  The Site will be responsible for preparing 
placebo IV infusion bags with 250 mL of 100% normal saline per the Pharmacy Manual. 
7.[ADDRESS_821003] be stored at 2°C to 8°C at all times until use. GC4419 solutions 
must not be frozen at any time. Temperature excursions above freezing and up to 25°C or down to 0.1°C for four hours are acceptable ; however, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee must be 
notified immediately of the temperature excursion to ensure proper oversight.  
Once prepared, the IV bags containing GC4419/saline mixtures must also be stored at 2°C 
to 8°C until use, and must be administered to patients within [ADDRESS_821004] to treatment arms A (90mg 
GC4419) and B  (placebo) .  GC4419  will be presented in single -use vials . 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_821005] 10 mL from 
a single vial and add to 240 mL normal saline. Note that there is no ex traction of saline (i.e., the 
infusion solution volume will be 240 mL saline + 10mL volume of GC4419/placebo).  No additional 
modifications or adjustments are to be made to the infusion solution.   
The GC4419 solution may appear clear or have a slight yell owish tint. Although solutions 
should be free of particulates, it is possible that some vials may have some fine visible particulates. 
Infusions should be prepared using a sterile 0.2 micron syringe filter prior to introduction into the 
infusion bag. The prepared admixture should be inspected visually for any particulate matter prior 
to administration, and prepared solutions still containing any visible particles after filtration should 
not be used. Filtration does not influence dosage calculations.  
To prepare daily IV solutions of placebo, investigational pharmacists will use 250 mL of 
100% normal saline.  
Further information and preparation details will be provided in a separate Pharmacy Manual.   
Note: Investigational staff who prepare infusion solutions will be unblinded and can not be 
discussed with the  clinical  team . 
7.8 Study Drug Administration  
GC4419 and Placebo: GC4419  or Placebo/saline mixture will be administered 
intravenously at an infusion rate that totals 60 min (± 6 min to account for saline over fill) for the total 
dose assigned. Infusions of GC4419/placebo must be administered using an infusion pump (i.e., not by [CONTACT_119644]).  Infusion pump models are not specified and may be per institutional 
preference/standard. 
To facilitate administration of G C4419 according to the study schedule, an indwelling venous 
access device may be used, at the discretion of the treating investigator.  If an indwelling venous 
access device is placed to facilitate administration of GC4419, this fact will be recorded with the 
study data, as will information about the date of placement, type of device, and subsequent 
complications or adverse events related to the use of the device. 
SBRT must be initiated as soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419/placebo 
infusion, but  no later than 180 minutes following the end of the  GC4419/placebo infusion.  
GC4419/placebo will be given beginning on the first day of radiation and continuing daily, 
concurrently  M-F throughout the administration of SBRT  
If SBRT is not administered on any given day due to a treatment break or unforeseen 
circumstances, GC4419 /placebo should not be administered on that day.  Breaks in SBRT will be 
determined by [CONTACT_102]’s treating physician in accordance with standard of care. Patients should 
resume GC4419/placebo administration when SBRT resumes.  On days when planned doses of 
both GC4419/placebo and SBRT are not administered (e.g., due to a holiday site closure), 
GC4419/placebo dosing may be extended along with SBRT to m ake up the missed dose(s) .

 7.9 Study Drug Accountability  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused 
GC4419.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of GC4419 (quantity and 
condition), patient dispensing records, and quantity of GC4419/placebo returned or destroyed.  
Dispensing records will document quantities received from Galera Therapeutics, Inc. and quantities 
dispensed to patients, including container number or lot number, date dispensed, patient identifier 
number, patient initials, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication.  Any GC4419 that 
is prepared but not used must also be recorded in the dispensing records. Further accountability 
instructions can be found in the Pharmacy  Manual.  
All GC4419  supplies and associated documentation will be reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_119645].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_119605], documenting drug receipt at the study site, drug transportation 
to satellite sites, and drug return to Galera Therapeutics, Inc., together with drug accountability 
records, will be retained according to the regulations governing record retention.  
The investigator will not allow GC4419/placebo to be given to any patient not included in the 
study or any unauthorized person.  
7.10 Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
GC4419: After completion of the study, all unused study drug will be inventoried by [CONTACT_618154], destroyed locally at the site after complete accountability by [CONTACT_63307]/or its representatives .  GC4419  should not be returned directly to Galera Therapeutics, Inc. 
unless specifically requested by [CONTACT_407884], Inc.  The study monitor will instruct the site

 8.0 DOSE AND TREATMENT M ODIFICATIONS  
8.1 Ancillary therapy, concomitant medications and supportive care  
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the study.  
Supportive care medications may be admini stered at the investigator's discretion and recorded in 
the CRF (including administration of prophylactic antiemetic and antidiarrheal medication if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093]).  Concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF up to Week 
[ADDRESS_821006] to the following 
exclusions:  
• Other concurrent chemotherapy or investigational agent during the week of SBRT  
• Nitrates, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors (e.g., sildanefil, tadalafil, or similar agents) 
or other drugs that in the judgment of the treating investigator could create a risk of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_618093] [ADDRESS_821007] dose of GC4419  
• Pyridostigmine or other drugs that in the judgment of the treating investigator could create a risk 
of increased carotid sinus sensitivity, symptomatic bradycardia, or syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
• Other biologic response modifiers –  except systemic hematopoietic gr owth factors for the 
management of anemia or myelosuppression  
• Concurrent approved or investigational anti -cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone and biologic therapy) other than the Protocol regimen  
• Other investigati onal agents  
8.2 Dose Delays and Dose Modifications 
The following toxicities require a 25% dose reduction in GC4419/placebo: 
o Grade 2 or greater hypotension within two hours after the start of GC4419/ placebo 
infusion  
o Grade [ADDRESS_821008] event, the patient 
will be re -challenged at 75% of the original dose (7.5 mL GC4419/placebo in normal saline for a 
total volume of 250 mL). After the second event, the patient wil l be re-challenged at 50% of the 
original dose (5.0 mL GC4419/placebo in normal saline for a total volume of 250 mL). Patients who 
are unable to tolerate GC4419/placebo infusions following two dose reductions must be 
discontinued from the study treatment but may continue with SBRT at the discretion of the treating 
investigator.  
For other toxicities (including those attributable to SBRT), management will be per 
institutional and ASCO guidelines and investigator judgment. 
Any radiation related toxicities ≥  grade 4 will necessitate removal of patient from further 
SBRT.

 9.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Definitions  
The treating physician and investigator team are responsible for the detection and 
documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol.  Throughout the study, AEs will be recorded in 
the source documents and on the appropriate pages of the CRF regardless of whether the AEs are 
considered related to GC4419/placebo, SBRT or other cause.  To avoid confusion, the AE should 
be recorded in standard medical terminology. 
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_618155].   
Adverse Event (AE):  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which may or may not have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended si gn (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Examples of an AE include: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under study.   
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity (grade) of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or di agnosed after investigational product administration even though 
they may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae associated with a suspected interaction of the 
investigational product with a concomitant medication.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae associated with a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, 
• Is life-threatening – NOTE: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to any 
adverse drug experience [adverse event] that places the patient or subject, in the view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include 
a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  [emphasis 
added] 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] – NOTE:  In general, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119612] (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications  that 
Protocol Amendment 07 GTI-4419 -101 
24January2020  
 
 
 
Confidential  50 
 occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1085], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity – NOTE: The term disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
OR 
• Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect. 
• Other Important Medical Event 
9.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All events meeting the criteria for Serious Adverse Events (listed in section 9.1) must be 
reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_119658] 24-hours of becoming aware of the event.  In 
order to determine the sponsor’s timeline for notifying regulatory authorities and investigators per 
Federal Regulations, an event term, serious criteria, and causality is required at the time of the 
initial report.  Specific SAE reporting instructions are provided in a separate manual. 
The investigator will also notify  your local IRB in writing of serious events  per the IRB 
reporing policy.  
9.3 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
Any adverse medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the date 
of randomization is considered to be pre-existing in nature, and part of a patient’s medical history.  Adverse medical conditions that begin on or after date of randomization will be considered an 
adverse event.  Increases in toxicity grade of pre-existing conditions that occur on or after the date 
of randomization are also considered an adverse event.  AEs and SAEs occurring up to 1 year after 
SBRT wi ll be recorded in the electronic data capture system.  All SAEs will be followed to resolution; 
i.e., until they no longer meet criteria for seriousness.  Non-serious AEs will be followed to resolution to the extent possible for up to one year post-SBRT.  The frequency of routine AE assessments will 
be as indicated in the schedule of events.   
All adverse events must be recorded in the patient’s source documents and on the CRF 
regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to randomized therapy. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity will be carefully assessed for causality because GI toxicity will used 
in the primary endpoint.  Disease progression or death due to disease progression will not be 
reported as an AE as it is captured as a study endpoint in the CRF. Progressive disease found by 
[CONTACT_618156]. 
9.4 Grading and Cause Assignment of Adverse Even ts 
The severity of adverse events will be designated as mild, moderate, severe, life 
threatening, or fatal per NCI CTCAE version 4.03. If not specifically addressed in NCI CTCAE version 4.03, use table 3 below. Cause assignment of adverse events will be made in accordance

evaluated at each time point.  Radiographic response will be measured according to a modified 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  as described in section 10.6.[ADDRESS_821012] 1.1 for PFS calculations  (secondary endpoint), but not used for the 
primary endpoint of determining the MTD.  All imaging will be interepreted by [CONTACT_618158] -affiliated

The same method of cross -sectional imaging used at baseline must be used at each follow up 
evaluation for treatment response.

10.6.2 Non-measurable Lesions 
Non-measurable disease will include all lesions < 10cm in longest dimension, in addition to 
truly non-measurable disease including leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
mass/organomegaly that cannot be confirmed on imaging. 
10.6.3 Target Lesion 
The target lesion will be the primary pancreatic tumor classified as measurable disease.  
The response within the target lesion will be used for statistical consideration.  Non -target lesions 
will also be tracked and measured, but will be considered only for the purpose of determining 
progression- free survival.   The primary target lesion will be considered in evaluating local control.  
10.6.4 Response Criteria Definitions 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of the target lesion. Any pathologic lymph nodes 
(target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10mm  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the diameter of the target lesions, 
utilizing baseline measurements as reference. 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for Local Progressive Disease ( LPD). 
Local Progressive Disease (LPD): At least a 20% increase in the the longest diameter of 
the target lesion, utilizing baseline measurement (scan) as reference. The meansurement must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. If the study in which L PD is noted at the 6- [ADDRESS_821014] be confirmed in the  subsequent scan (at the [ADDRESS_821015] SBRT

 scan ) to rule out post-radiation inflammation from SBRT. If a repeat scan is indeterminate, additional 
imaging modalities including MRI or PET/CT can be utilized. Progression will be retroactively dated 
to the initial scan on which the LPD was suspected. 
Distant Progressive Disease (DPD) : The appearance of new unequivocal m etastatic 
lesions on follow up imaging will denote distant progression.  The finding of a new lesion must not 
be attributable to differences in imaging technique, change of imaging modality, or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor , especially if primary target lesions shows partial or 
complete response. If a new lesion is equivocal but suspi[INVESTIGATOR_618097], continued follow up should 
be done until it becomes unequivocal. Progression will  be retroactively dated to the initial scan on 
which the DPD was suspected.  
Biochemical Response (BR) : Elevated CA19-9 level will not be used to determine disease 
progression, but will be used to measure biochemical progression free survival (bPFS). A CA 19 -9 
level that decreases by 50% from pre-treatment value will be considered a biochemical response.  
Biochemical Failure (BF) : If the CA 19-9 level increases by 50% on [ADDRESS_821016] recorded on study value, it will be considered bioc hemical failure.  
10.7 Surgical and Pathologic Determination of Treatment Response 
10.7.1 Evaluation of Resectability  
Determination of locally advanced disease/ technically unresectable disease will be 
determined at diagnosis and at [ADDRESS_821017] treatment by [CONTACT_618159]. This will be  generally  according to the following cri teria at the surgeon’s 
discretion:  
• Greater than 180 degree tumor involvement of the superior mesenteric artery  
• Greater than 180 degree tumor involvement of the celiac axis , including major branches of the 
celiac axis that render it unresectable (e.g. common hepatic artery). 
• Tumor involvement of the first branch of the SMA that is not surgically reconstructible 
• Long segment involvement of the superior mesenteric vein/portal vein or hepatic artery that is 
not surgically reconstructible  
10.7.2 Histologic Response  
Should the patient undergo surgical resection, pathologic review will be performed locally  to 
determine histologic  response according to the following criteria: 
• Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) : 0% residual tumor cells in specimen 
• Near Pathologic Complete R esponse (pNR) : 1 to < 5% residual tumor cells in the specimen 
• Partial Pathologic Response (pPR) : ≥ 5% to 30% residual tumor cells in the specimen  
10.7.3 Margin Status at Resection 
Margins will be assessed according to location (common bile duct, SMA or pancreatic neck)

10.8 Patient Reported Outcomes  using PRO- CTCAE and LASA  
The PRO -CTCAE and LASA i tems will be used to determine QOL and patient reported 
disease and treatment related symptoms. 
We do not anticipate major differences in physical function between the two arms  and 
various dose levels; however, the various domains of the PRO -CTCAE will help elucidate 
differences in short term effects of SBRT and GC4419 on patients’ well -being. Higher doses of 
radiation may be more effective in alleviating patients’ abdominal pain, nausea and obstructive 
symptoms .  
The IRB -approved questionnaires within the protocol can be provided to patients for 
completion.  Please include patient identifiers on all pages.  At visits in which the questionaires are 
to be completed, the questionaires should be given to the patient before any discussion of the 
patient’s health status or test results.  
The single item linear self-assessment or LASA items for overall QOL, fatigue, mental, and 
physical quality of life will be used to assess the quality of life of patients randomized to each 
treatment arm . These single items have been demonstrated to be prognostic for survival in general 
cancer populations and in pancreatic cancers. These LASA items will be assessed at 
screening/ baseline and at specified follow up visits . Overall QOL, fatigue, mental and physical 
quality of life wil l be assessed at post treatment follow -up. 
Potential treatment-related symptomatic adverse events will be measured using the Patient-
Reported Outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO -CTCAE).  To improve precision and patient -
centeredness in the capture of symptomatic AEs, NCI funded a team of investigators led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Basch to develop a library of patient-reported outcome (PRO) items to supplement the CTCAE, 
called the PRO -CTCAE .  Of the 790 AEs in the CTCAE, 78 were identified as amenable to patient 
self-report.  For each of these AEs, PRO items were created reflecting the attributes of frequency 
(with response options of “never”, “rarely”, “occasionally”, “frequently”, or “almost constantly”), 
severity (“none”, “mild”, “moderate”, “severe”, or “very severe”), interference with usual or daily 
activities (“not at all”, “a little bit”, “somewhat”, “quite a bit”, or “very much”), amount (“not at all”, “a 
little bit”, “somewhat”, “quite a bit”, or “very much”), or presence (“no” or “yes”).  One to three 
attributes were selected for any given AE depending on the content of the CTCAE criteria for that 
AE and the nature of that particular AE.  In total, [ADDRESS_821018] recall period of “the past 7 days.”  Cognitive interviews previously determined a high level of patient understanding and meaningfulness of the items and a 
national multi -site validation study showed that items were valid, reliabl e, and sensitive to change.  
For this study, the following symptomatic AEs selected were based on the known symptomatic 
toxicities occurring in >10% of patients  treated with SBRT.  Specifically, at the selected time points, 
patients will complete 15 PRO -CTCAE items measuring:  Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Confidential  56 
 neuropathy, abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, pain, heartburn, decreased appetite, dry 
mouth, taste changes, itching (pruritis), depression, anxiety.  The recall period will be 2 weeks.  AEs 
will be measured at baseline, end of SBRT and at follow up visits . Reporting will occur using table 
based technology or paper booklets, as available.  
The final survey  contains only 4 LASA items plus 15 PRO -CTCAE items it is anticipated that 
the questionnaire will take approximately 10 minutes for the patient to complete at each 
administration time point.  We anticipate having questionnaires  available in English and Spanish.  
Patients may decline to complete a questionnaire at any time.  The primary reason for each missed 
questionnaire will be collected on a case report form.

Patients may not receive additional anti -cancer therapy during the 90 day follow up period, 
except in the instance of progression of disease. After 90 days, patients may receive therapy  at the 
treating physician’s discretion. Any anti -cancer therapy should be recorded in the case report form.  
11.2 Managing ineligible patients and registered patients who never 
receive protocol intervention  
Patients who are randomized but later deemed ineligib le for SBRT or voluntarily withdraw 
from the study will still be eligible for follow up imaging and correlative studies, in addition to PRO 
data, should they so choose. These patients will not be considered in the n=[ADDRESS_821020] be documented.

If, at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health and/or 
the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this event: 
• Document the reason(s) for discontinuation of therapy on the case report forms. 
• Follow the patient for protocol endpoints as required by [CONTACT_618160].

 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
12.1 Study Primary Endpoint  
For the purposes of dose finding the following definitions will be used in determining MTD:  
• Toxicity:  CTCAE grade 3 or 4 related gastro-intestinal (GI) toxicity  or death, occurring within 
90 days from the start of therapy.  
• Efficacy: Radiographic stable disease (SD) or better based on modified RECIST criteria, 
(section 10.6.4), compared to baseline imaging of the same type, as evaluated at day 90 from 
the start of therapy.  
o If a patient dies or has local progressive disease (LPD) at some time t* prior to day 90, 
then Efficacy will be scored at the time t* as not occurring for that patient. 
o If a patient undergoes resection at some time t* prior to day 90, then Efficacy will be scored as occurring at t* and Toxicity will be scored as not occurring within 90 days for that patient.  
Prior to determination of final MTD, 12 month toxicity  will also be evaluated.  If any dose level 
demonstrates >20% grade 4 or 5 gastrointestinal toxicity related to radiation, the preceding dose level will be used as the final MTD. 
12.2 Prior Probabilities  
An adaptive design requires prior mean probabilities of efficacy and toxicity at each dose 
level. These estimates were determined in collaboration by [CONTACT_618161], as discussed in section 1.2.5, with particular weight placed 
on more modern studies using modern radiation techniques. Table 5 outlines the prior mean 
probabilities for each dose level.  
 
 
12.3 Randomization and Sample Size  
A maximum of 2x24 = 48 patients will be randomized between two subgroups. Patients in 
subgroup 1 will receive GC4419  in combination with their assigned RT dose, and patients in 
subgroup 0 will receive their assigned RT dose and placebo (no GC4419). The randomization will 
be restricted so that the sample size within each subgroup is exactly [ADDRESS_821021].

12.4 Phase I -II Dose Finding Design  
Dose -finding will be done using the sequentially adaptive phase I-II Late onset Efficacy -

12.7 Efficacy- Toxicity Trade- Off Contours and Priors  
The three equivalent trade-off (pE, pT) probability pairs used for computing the trade-off 
contours are ( 0.60, 0), (0 .75, 0.15), (1, 0 .40). The prior hyper -parameters were computed based on 
the assumed prior means Prob(Efficacy | dose) =  0.75, 0.85, 0.95  and Prob(Toxicity | dose) = 0.02, 
0.07, 0.10, respectively, at the three RT  dose levels.  The prior effective sample size  = 1 for the 
toxicity parameter prior and 1 for the efficacy parameter prior. This is illustrated in F igure 11.

12.8 Design Operating Characteristics  
Operating characteristics of the design, as conducted within each subgroup, are 
summariz ed in table 6 below, based on simulations with 1000 replications per scenario. In the 
simulations, it is assumed that the times to toxicity and efficacy follow Weibull distributions, the 
percentage of toxicity (or efficacy) events occurring in the later half of each evaluation interval is 
50%, and the accrual rate  is 1.5 patients per month.  The maximum sample size is 24, with up to 8 
cohorts of size 3.

study will accrue to completion (approximately 16 months) with 5, 8 and 10 patients assigned to dose levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Should dose level 2 be the MTD, the study will accrue to 
completion (approximately 16 months) with 6, 12 and 5 patients assigned to dose levels 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  In this scenario, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) would have to occur in a minimum of 2/5 
patients treated at dose level 3.  Should dose level 1 be the MTD, the study will accrue to completion 
(approximately 16 months) with 15, [ADDRESS_821025] to occur in a minimum of 2/5 patients treated at dose level 2. 
12.9 Implementation  
12.9.1 LO-ET Trial Implementation  
The Late-Onset Efficacy -Toxicity  (LO-ET) design will be implemented using the specialized 
computer program developed by [CONTACT_618163].[ADDRESS_821026] in the Department of Biostatistics. This will include (1) randomization of each patient at entry between the two arms, RT+ GC4419 versus RT 
only, and (2) adaptive dose assignment within each arm using the LO -ET method.  Outcome-
adaptive dose-finding will be done by [CONTACT_618164]-ET method.  This process will require close interaction 
between [CONTACT_618175] and personnel in the clinic, including repeatedly providing [CONTACT_618175] with all dose-outcome data from all previously enrolled patients, including each previous patient’s time of 
Toxicity occurrence or current follow up time without Toxicity, up to the defined 90-day observation 
interval, and whether efficacy occurred at day 90.  Critical variable data (provided within your Study 
Manual) should be entered into the electronic data capture clinical database in a timely fashion to 
ensure data is included in the ongoing analysis  for SBRT dose level assignments. Xuemi Wang, a 
Senior Statistical in the Department of Biostatistics, will serve as a backup for  [CONTACT_618175] in the 
process of trial conduct.  Additional statistical support or input will be provided as required by [CONTACT_6283]. 
Peter Thall and Ying Yuan
33,34,36,37.  Details and procedures related to the various safety, efficacy, 
and correlative analyses will be provided in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan. 
12.9.2 Secondary Endpoints and Analysis 
Secondary outcomes will include progression-free survival (PFS) time and overall response 
rate  in addition to rate of long -term toxicity, surgical resection and rates of R0 and pathologic 
complete response at resection.  Unadjusted distributions of the time-to-event outcomes PFS and 
OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and their relationship to prognostic 
covariates and RT cell dose level will be evaluated by [CONTACT_618165][INVESTIGATOR_618101].  
Resectability will be assessed at the seven week time point.  If a patient goes on to resection, 
he or she will be categorized as acceptable efficacy.  If the patient is deemed unresectable, efficacy 
will be reassessed at [ADDRESS_821027]-
induction chemotherapy and prior to initiation of SBRT.  They may then undergo MRI 
abdomen/pelvis  approximately  12 weeks following completion of SBRT.  MRI characteristics will be 
associated with efficacy findings at 12 weeks.  In case of contraindications (eg pacemaker, severe 
claustrophobia, etc) a high quality CT scan can be acquired.

[IP_ADDRESS] Planned/ Potential Analyses  
Circulating tumor DNA/ Cell free (including exosomes) DNA: Peitrasz et al recently 
demonstrated that plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA, or cell free DNA) may play a role as a prognostic marker in PAC. In this study, 48% of patients with locally advanced PAC 
demonstrated detectable ctDNA with a median mutation allelic frequency (MAF) of 6.1%. The 
presence of ctDNA was strongly correlated with overall survival, as was the MAF for individual patients57. In this study, we will have the opportunity to exploratorily examine the effect of SBRT 
on ctDNA levels and the potential utility of ctDNA as a prognostic factor for conversion to surgical resection and overall survival of patients undergoing SBRT for BRPC and LAPC.  
13.2.5 Immune Correlates 
In addition to the CNB and FNA samples collected during endoscopy, endoscopic brushings 
will be collected of the pancreatic tumor. These brushings will be analyzed using multiparametric 
flow cytometry (MPFC) for markers of immune proliferation, activation and exhaustion phenotypes . 
Changes in the immune microenvironment with SBRT for pancreatic cancer have not been 
studied, nor has the interaction of the immune microenvironment on response of PAC to radiation 
therapy. These exploratory analyses will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_618104]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned/ Potential Analyses  
• T cell receptor profiling: Deep T-cell receptor β sequencing (TCR) has been used to 
predict response to immunotherapy and vaccine therapy in other tumor types, including melanoma, lung cancer, prostate and breast cancer
58-61. We have been successfully using 
this technology to analyze cervical and anal cancers using DNA extracted from a non-invasive swab biopsy technique, and the ability to reliably detect T cell profiles us ing 
minimum DNA would allow new insight into predictors of the generation of a robust anti -
tumor immune response stimulated by [CONTACT_618167]. TCR will be used to detect clonal amplification and density of intratumoral T-cells.

 • Immunohistochemistry immune profiling  
• Multiparametric flow cytometry (MPFC): Using cytology brushings, our group has 
previously used MPFC to characterize changes in immune profiles using cytobrush swabs 
of cervical and anal cancers. Cells collected from cytobrushes were stained with 
antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, ICOS, CTLA -4, Ki67, PD -1, FoxP3 and Fixable Aqua Dead 
Cell stain and analyzed by [CONTACT_4133]. Comprehensive analysis of TIL by [CONTACT_618168] T cell ratios relative to Treg and MDSC, as well as phenotypic and functional analysis of multiple T, NK, and myeloid cell subsets.  
• Peripheral Immune profiling: Static immune profiling in other tumor types demonstrates the 
presence of changes in immune markers, but it is unclear whether these changes are 
reflective of radiation induced generation of tumor specific immune response or a 
response to radiation induced direct cell killing. The only way to determine this is through the use of longitudinal immune assays through the course of radiation. Moreover, recent hypotheses suggest that the immune response of radiation may be optimized through a 
one week “package time” and that longer course of radiation may lead to adverse effects 
on immunogenic cell death (ICD) from radiation, in addition to a suggestion that larger single fraction sizes may increase ICD
62-65. If this is true, we may see increased immune 
activation with SBRT, and this effect may change with increased doses. Performing exploratory peripheral immune profiling using deep TCR and MPFC will allow us to better 
characterize these fluid immune changes

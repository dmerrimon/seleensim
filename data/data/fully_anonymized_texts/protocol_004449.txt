 [ADDRESS_743418] cancer and 
about 40,000 women will die of this disease (1). Local treatment opt ions have changed 
dramatically over the past several decades and increasing numbers of women are now effectively 
treated with breast conservati on. Although treatment patterns vary on a geographical basis, 
studies show that in some settings, greater th an 70% of women with breast cancer are now 
preserving their breasts (2).    This shift away from mastectomy came after the publication of results from  several prospective, 
randomized studies comparing mastectomy and c onservative surgery followed by [CONTACT_54615] (3-
10). These studies demonstrated similar survival  and disease–free survival rates regardless of 
which treatment approach women chose. In 1992, the NIH Consensus Development Panel was convened to review these studies . This resulted in the [ADDRESS_743419] to survival 
(11). The primary study done in the United Stat es was the NSABP B-06 published with 12 year 
results in 1995 (5). This study randomized patients between three arms: mastectomy, 
conservative surgery alone and conservative su rgery followed by [CONTACT_565993]. Although 
the overall survival was similar in all three arms, there were dramatic differences in the local recurrence rates. The conservative surgery al one arm had a local recurrence rate of 39% 
compared to 10% local recurrence rate in the mastectomy and conservative surgery plus radiation arms.  Now with [ADDRESS_743420] 
tumor recurrence (IBTR) is approximately 14% (12).  This information led to a standard 
recommendation in the [LOCATION_002] that all patients undergoing breas t conservation receive 
post-operative radiation as pa rt of their care (11). 
 The term breast conserving therapy (BCT) indica tes breast cancer treatment that involves 
resection of the cancer with a ri m of normal tissue, ax illary lymph node diss ection for those with 
invasive cancer, and breast radiotherapy.  The major advantage of BCT is related to the superior cosmetic result and reduced psychological and emo tional trauma resulting from this procedure 
compared to mastectomy.   Standard therapy after tumor exci sion generally includes five week s of external beam XRT to the 
whole breast (45-50 Gy) followed by a boost to the tumor bed with either an additional 8 to 10 
fractions (days) of external beam XRT or a two to  three day interstitial implant. The rationale for 
this approach is based upon two principles. Firs t, higher doses of XRT ar e given to the 'tumor 
bed' in an attempt to control residual small foci  of cancer that may be left behind after excision 
alone. Second, whole breast XRT is used to eliminate possible areas of occult multicentric in situ or infiltrating cancer in remote areas of the breas t. That such remote, multicentric areas of cancer 
exist has long been established.  However, the biological significance of these areas of occult 
cancer is unknown and the necessity to prophylactically treat the enti re breast has recently been 
questioned. For instance, there are now at least five prospective randomized trials that have been 
CASE [ADDRESS_743421] XRT (5,13-17). In all of these trials, the majority of  recurrences in the breast of 
patients who did not receive XRT occurred at or  in the area of the tumor bed. Thus, it would 
appear that XRT after tumor excision exerts its maximal effect upon reducing breast cancer 
recurrence at or near the tumor site (17).   
 One possible attraction for many women who select breast conservation as their treatment, is that if it “fails,” only then would they have to have a mastectomy—i.e. they have an initial 
opportunity to save their breast.  The psychological impact of losi ng one’s breast is difficult for 
some women to accept.  The term “salvage” mastect omy has been applied to the setting in which 
a patient who was initially treated with par tial mastectomy and radi ation therapy, and who 
develops an ipsilateral breast tumor recurr ence (IBTR) then undergoes a mastectomy.  The 
reasons behind the idea of a salvage mastectomy ar e several—first, since radiation treatments for 
breast cancer currently target th e whole breast for the majority of the treatment period, by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-
irradiating the breast, one would risk the po ssibility of unacceptable tissue damage, including 
necrosis and increased incidence of secondary malignancies.  Just like all normal tissues, normal breast tissue has a limit as to how much radiation it may receive before the damage becomes irreparable.  Second, the breasts  of many patients who develop an IBTR may not be able to 
accommodate a second lumpectomy—i.e., cosmetic outcome can be affected, particularly with inferiorly located recurrences.  Fi nally, studies have shown that pa tients who elect to have their 
IBTR removed with a lumpectomy ( without  repeat radiation) may have  recurrence rates that can 
be as high as 35%, which is unacceptably high for most women (18).  When counseling a woman considering a salvage mastectomy, it must be made clear that re-recu rrence rates (i.e. a 2
nd 
recurrence, this one after the mastectomy) ha ve ranged from 2-32% of patients (19, 20). 
 Overall survival after mastecto my for an IBTR in a patient previously treated with breast 
conservation ranges from 52-84% at 5 years, (21, 22).  As one might expect, invasive 
recurrences have a poorer prognosis than do noninva sive (23).  Deaths after a noninvasive IBTR 
occur infrequently—deaths after an invasive r ecurrence occur more frequently and are often 
associated with metastatic disease.  Having an  IBTR increases the rate  of developi[INVESTIGATOR_565983], as well as increases  the risk of dying, when compared to women without an IBTR 
(24).  Many studies have observed that if a patient were  to experience an IBTR, the majority of time it 
would be located in the vicin ity of the original primary.  But, as breast cancer can be 
multicentric, by [CONTACT_565994], one might “miss” residual tumor left in 
other areas of the breast.  The National Surgi cal Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) 
protocol B-06 (25), among other things, looked at [ADDRESS_743422] conservation.  They f ound that 14% of IBTR’s were 
multicentric, however the clinical significance of this multicentricity is unclear.  Since many of these patients did not receive adjuvant radiation initially (i.e. were randomized to lumpectomy 
alone), it is likely that this pe rcentage overestimates the risk of  multicentricity in IBTR as it is 
possible that those receiving adjuvant radiati on may have a lower incidence of having a 
multicentric recurrence.  
CASE [ZIP_CODE] Version date 5.29.2009 Page 6 of 23  While the majority of IBTR’s occur near the loca tion of the original primary, it is clear that a 
breast cancer can manifest in any location in the br east.  The addition of ra diation as well as an 
increase in the amount of time from the original  course of radiation in  increases the likelihood 
that an in breast recurrence represents a new pr imary breast cancer.  Inte restingly, studies have 
shown that the clinical behavior of where th e breast recurrences occur differ.  Huang and 
colleagues at MD Anderson perfor med a retrospective chart review  of patients treated with 
breast conservation, who went on to  develop an IBTR as their fi rst recurrence (19).  A true 
recurrence was defined as a cance r with identical hist ology to the patient’s primary, or one in 
which was located within 3 cm of the original  tumor—all other IBTR were considered new 
primaries.  They found that new primaries had st atistically significant incr eased overall survival 
(77% vs 46%, p = 0.0002), increased cause speci fic survival (83% vs 49%, p = 0.0001) and 
increased distant disease free survival at 10 years (77% vs 26%, p < 0.0001), when compared to 
true recurrences.  This suggests for advocates of  accelerated partial breas t irradiation (treating 
just the site of surgery rather th an the whole breast), that if one were to have a recurrence outside 
of the radiation field, as suggested by [CONTACT_565995], their prognosis might be better. 
 A corollary can be made to an IBTR in a patien t previously treated with  breast conservation, that 
it may be possible, with modern diagnostic equipment, including br east MRI, to identify patients 
with known unifocal IBTR that may be able to be  treated with focal ra diation, thus avoiding a 
mastectomy. There is very little data in the lite rature looking at re-irradiation for patients with 
ipsilateral breast cancer recurrences .  The largest of which is at re port is from The University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109].  Deutsch et al, treat ed [ADDRESS_743423] cancer—31 
invasive and 8 in situ  cancers.  Patients were treated with  en-face electrons to a total dose of 
5000cGy, directed only at the cavity of  the IBTR excision (i.e. partial breast with linac).  At last 
follow-up (median 51.5 months, range 1-180 months),  76.9% of patients had an intact breast free 
of tumor.  At 5 years, overall survival was 78%  and disease free survival was 69%.  Importantly, 
no late sequelae of repeat radi ation therapy developed other th an skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576]—
cosmetic outcome was reported as good to excellent in 69% of patients (26).  There were no rib 
fractures, pulmonary problems or secondary mali gnances, despi[INVESTIGATOR_565984] 10,000 cGy.  All patients ex cept one finished the radiation treatments (RT 
was discontinued for nonmedical reasons).  Distan t metastases developed in 8 women (2 with 
concerning bone scans at the time of diagnosis of IBTR), and [ADDRESS_743424] cancer .  Eight women developed a 2
nd IBTR after re-irradiation (2 of which 
had positive axillary lymph nodes), and only [ADDRESS_743425] conservation after IBTR—s ome refused mastectomy, and some were not 
candidates—they were treated to a dose of 30 Gy (dose rate not me ntioned) (27).  Four (26%) of 
patients developed a 2
nd IBTR at a median follow-up of 4 year s.  There are several criticisms of 
this study, including the lack of reporting of ma rgin status, or brachytherapy dose rate.  Three 
patients had “major” cosmetic sequelae (one with locally treated skin necrosis), but cosmetic 
analyses/comment is only available for 8/[ADDRESS_743426], but over time treatment  was changed to brachytherapy alone.  
Brachytherapy dose for the group who also recei ved EBRT ranged from 12.5 to 28.0 Gy (mean 
22.4 Gy), whereas in the group that received br achytherapy alone, it range d from 40.2 to 50.0 Gy 
(mean 46.5) (28).  At a median follow-up of 59 months, 12 of the 17 women were alive and had 
no evidence of local tumor.  Twenty-four percent of patients (4) experienced a 2nd IBTR—all 
within the 1st year and all in the group who received both EBRT and brachytherapy.  There have 
been no 2nd IBTR’s in the group rece iving brachytherapy alone, suggesting increased local 
control with increasing brachy dos e.  Often dose escalation, with  the hope of increasing local 
control, cannot be maximized due to toxicities of normal tissues.  In this study, no patients had 
unacceptable cosmetic results; it was good or excellent in one third of patients. 
 Recent interest in accelerated part ial breast irradiation relies on th e principle that since the most 
frequent location of an ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence is in the tumor bed, by [CONTACT_565996] e to the whole breast (and therefore 
complications/toxicities that may arise from increased dose to the breast  There is also the possibility that if a patient were to develop an ipsilateral breast can cer recurrence following 
accelerated partial breast irradiati on that it may be possible to re sect this recurrence and then 
treat the whole breast with radiat ion.  This study attempts to clarif y the feasibility and efficacy of 
using accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients who have  already received whole breast 
irradiation.  It only seems natural, that one might consider utilizing partial breast to treat an in-
breast recurrence in someone who, for whatev er reason, refuses mastectomy, or is not a 
candidate for one.  By [CONTACT_565997], treatment can be 
targeted to only the surgical lumpectomy cavity.  Partial breast irradiation can be accomplished 
by a multitude of techniques, including 3-D conformal external beam radiation, MammoSite catheter brachytherapy, multi-cathet er brachytherapy and intra-operative radiation therapy.   
 
There are currently several groups studying the efficacy of lumpectomy bed irradiation alone in 
the management of early stage breast cancer pa tients (29-38). Both interstitial brachytherapy 
techniques as well as external beam irradiati on protocols have been implemented (See Table 1). 
Preliminary results from these trials are very en couraging and the techniqu es have been shown to 
be safe, tolerable, and highly repr oducible. In 1993, Vicini et al. in itiated a pi[INVESTIGATOR_565985] (LDR) brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality with BCT (32).  As of February 2001, 
[ADDRESS_743427] developed a local r ecurrence (five-year ac tuarial rate of 1%) and cosmetic results 
were judged as good to excellent in 98% pati ents (verbal communication). In addition, no 
adverse sequelae were noted on the protocol. More recently, a second protocol employing high 
dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (in the same subset of patients) was also initiated at the same 
institution (39).  Although results were preliminary, no adverse sequelae were noted.

CASE [ADDRESS_743429] in  the use of intraoperative radiation (IORT) in the 
setting of breast conservation has developed. The rationale of IORT is relatively simple. Rather 
than using external beam radiation to treat the entire breast post-operativel y, radiation is applied 
directly to the surgical tu mor bed through the open surgic al incision. There are several 
advantages to this approach. First, the radiation dose is applied directly to the tumor bed with 
little chance for geographical miss. There is also less irradiation of normal tissues. The radiation 
is done at the time of surgery, therefore, there is  no delay between surgery and the initiation of 
radiation. This results in a shor ter overall treatment course an d potentially less cost involved. 
This approach has been utilized  with intraoperative brachythe rapy as well. An advantage of 
utilizing intraoperative electr on beam therapy over brachytherapy may be increased dose 
homogeneity seen with intraoperative treatmen t compared to brachytherapy.  There is also 
decreased risk to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_565986].    
 
The Mobetron is a lightweight, mobile, self-shielde d linear accelerator. It provides electrons with 
energies of 4, 6, 9, or 12 MeV capable of penetr ating to a depth of approximately 1, 2, 3, and 4 
cm to the 80% isodose line, respectively. Trea tment is delivered through applicators with 
dimensions from 3-10 cm. The applicators may be either flat or beveled at 30 degrees. The unit 
weighs 1/6 of what a conventiona l accelerator does allowing it to be moved from room to room. 
There is minimal x-ray contamination eliminatin g the need for a shielded operating room and a 
beam stopper attached to the unit provides the necessary shieldi ng from X-rays generated by [CONTACT_565998]. The control panel for th e Mobetron is located out side of the operating 
room during treatment and the patient  may be directly observed through the windows during the 
treatment (36). The Mobetron is present at only a handful of institutions both inside and outside 
of the [LOCATION_003]. It is currently being utilized in a variety of tumor sites to provide intraoperative 
radiation.  Intra-operative external beam irra diation has also recently been explored as an additional method 
of delivering post-lumpectomy partial breast irradi ation in an accelerated fashion. Veronesi et al 
from the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy recently published their preliminary 
results from a phase I/II dose escalation study of  single-fraction irradia tion given immediately 
after quadrantectomy (42). With minimal toxicity in the first [ADDRESS_743430] irradiat ion ([ADDRESS_743431]) to a 21 Gy 
intraoperative single fraction. As of February 2002, > [ADDRESS_743432] been enrolled in this equivalency trial with an accrual goal of  over 800 patients (verbal communication). 
Vaidya et al recently published their experience with intra-operative pa rtial breast radiation 
therapy as boost treatment (43).  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_743433] been no major complications. A phase  III trial has recently been initiated. 
 
MammoSite® Brachytherapy Experience  
 
One of the primary disadvantages of conventiona l breast brachytherapy is  the complexity and 
reproducibility of the procedure.  Breast brachytherapy is used eith er to deliver a localized boost 
dose of radiation to the lumpectomy cavity or to deliver the primary radiation to the lumpectomy 
cavity.  In clinical practice, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_565987] 10 – [ADDRESS_743434] brachytherapy is an invasive procedure and consists 
of the placement of up to 20 needles or catheter s around the site of the tumor removal.  These 
needles or catheters are loaded with a radiation source for a peri od of 4-5 days. After completion 
of radiation the needles or catheters are removed (43). Even using the best imaging available, the 
technique is difficult and requires a great deal of experience and skill to position the needles or catheters to cover the required treatment area adequately.  
 The MammoSite® applicator was developed to address these disadvantages.  The MammoSite® 
allows an easier implant and reproducible radiation delivery to  the target tissue area.  The 
MammoSite® is a nylon tube (for the radiation source to travel in) with a ba lloon attached at the 
end to expand and conform to th e cavity.  The MammoSite® applicator is inserted into the cavity 
created by [CONTACT_565999], either at  the time of lumpectomy or post lumpectomy.  
The MammoSite® applicator is then inflated and expands to fill the cav ity.  The radiation can 
then be delivered using commercially available radioactive sources usin g the center nylon tube 
of the MammoSite® applicator.  This central s ource creates a symmetrica l radiation delivery 
from the inside of the cavity to the adjacent tissu es where residual cancer is most likely to exist 
while reducing damaging radiation delivery to  the surrounding vital organ structures.   
 In a Phase II clinical trial with the MammoSite®, [ADDRESS_743435] Scale in 88% 
of the women treated.  Patients experienced only m ild to moderate side effects, including skin 
erythema (57%), dry desquamation (13%) and moist desquamation (5%) short term that were related to the radiation thera py dose. The study demonstrated th at the device was safe and well 
tolerated which resulted in FDA clearance of the device on May 6, 2002 (44, 45). The safety and 
effectiveness of the MammoSite® Radiation Therapy System (RTS) as a replacement for whole breast irradiation in the treatment of breas t cancer is currently being investigated.  
    
 
Current Trial Design  
 
Patients enrolled in this protocol  will be selected to insure that their cancers have been 
adequately excised and that tumor bed irradi ation alone will be feasible.  Depending on 
individual patient characterist ics (for example, proximity of the tumor cavity to the skin, 
CASE [ZIP_CODE] Version date 5.29.2009 Page 11 of 23  patient’s ability to tolerate another surgical procedure) a decision will be made jointly by [CONTACT_566000], radiation oncologist and medical oncologist at our multi-disciplinary conference 
as to which method of partial breast irradiation is best suit ed for the patient.  Practical 
considerations will also be taken into account, in  the decision of which type of radiation to 
offer—that said, provided a patient is medically e ligible for either type of radiation, she will be 
given the opportunity to decide  which treatment she would like.  Some patients may not be 
deemed medically fit to under go another surgical procedure, and might then be offered 
MammoSite based APBI, because the catheter does  not necessarily have to be placed in the 
operating room.  Another example in which one ther apy might be more advisable than another, is 
woman who has a history of immune deficiency and resultant life threatening infections—rather 
than leaving a MammoSite catheter with an ope n wound for more than one week, one might opt 
for a single treatment in the operating room at  the time of lumpectomy.  One endpoint of the 
study will be to evaluate which patients are best suited for treatment by [CONTACT_566001]. 
 
The aim of the study will be to evaluate patient acceptance of the concept of partial breast re-
irradiation for an IBTR, in the hope that there wi ll be an alternative treatment to the recognized 
standard of care (mastectomy).  We will al so evaluate cosmetic outcome following the 
procedure.  Long term outcome data regarding fu rther in-breast recurrence s as well as tumor bed 
recurrence will also be recorded and analyzed.

5.2.1a  Applicator selection should allow for tr eatment of the tumor bed with a [ADDRESS_743442] in the operating room. 
5.2.1c Energy of electrons should be such that the tumor cavity with a 1 cm margin will be 
covered by [CONTACT_941] 90% line. The energy of the electrons will be at the discretion of the 
radiation oncologist and determ ined at the time of treatment to ensure proper coverage 
of the tumor cavity. 
5.2.1d A dose of 21 Gy will be pres cribed to the 90% isodose line. 
 5.3.1  MammoSite® Brachytherapy
: 
5.3.1a  Applicator Placement:  
5.3.1a1  The MammoSite® applicator may be placed either  at the time of surgery or in a separate 
procedure using ultrasound guidance after su rgery.   The MammoSite® applicator should 
be selected to best fit th e cavity created by [CONTACT_566004].   
5.3.1a2 The balloon of the MammoSite® applicator sh ould be inflated with a saline/contrast 
mixture (maximum of 25% cont rast) to fill the cavity at the time of placement.  The 
balloon will remain inflated throughout the du ration of the radiation and will be removed 
after the last fraction.   
5.3.1a3 Post implant imaging should be performed after insertion of the MammoSite® to 
evaluate the patient for skin spacing, sy mmetry and conformance of the applicator. 
5.3.1b Treatment Planning  
5.3.1b1 CT image is recommended for treatment pl anning.  Standard brachytherapy treatment 
planning will be conducted using commercially available software and equipment.  The 
treatment should be performed using avai lable high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy.  
5.3.1b2 CT imaging or plain orthogonal x-rays will be performed prior to treatment to ensure 
adequacy of implant. 
5.3.1c Brachytherapy Treatment : 
5.3.1c1 Brachytherapy should start between  [ADDRESS_743443] and 192 Ir  radioactive 
sources. 
5.3.1d Applicator Removal : 
5.3.1d1 The removal of the applicator should be scheduled after the completion of 
brachytherapy.   
5.3.1d2 The applicator should be removed us ing standard sterile technique.   
5.3.1d3 The applicator exit/entrance site should be dressed acco rding to standard medical 
practice.

[CONTACT_5263]-Meier method (46) for all patients (inten d-to-treat) and 5-year recurrence rate will be 
then obtained and compared with those in the li terature. The overall incidence and its confidence 
interval of acute complications following lumpectomy will be estimated. Also, we will estimate the overall incidence and the degr ee of fibrosis as defined on four-level scale of cosmetic 
outcome in appendix I.  
9.0 RECORDS TO BE KEPT  
At time of registration – Patient consent form, signed eligibility checklist and registration card. 
 Following breast conservation surgery for the sec ond time, prior to beginning breast re-radiation, 
the cosmetic results of breast conservation will be assessed. Appendix I should be used. The same will be used to reassess the patient duri ng radiation therapy, at one month post-radiation 
therapy, and every three months thereafter for one year, followed bi-annually for the remainder 
of the [ADDRESS_743450] can co me at varying stages in the

COSMETIC GUIDELINES 
 
Patient #:  _____________________ 
  
Following breast conservation surgery, prior to beginni ng breast re-radiation, th e cosmetic results of 
breast conservation will be assessed using these guideli nes. The same guidelines will be used to reassess 
the patient during radiation therapy, at one mont h post-radiation therapy, and every three months 
thereafter for one year, then bi annually for a tota l of [ADDRESS_743454] describes the cosmetic result. 
 1. EXCELLENT: When compared to the untreated breast or the original appearance of the treated 
breast, there is minimal or no difference in the size or shape of the treated breast. The way the breast 
fells (its texture) is the same or slightly different. There may be thickening, scar tissue, or fluid 
accumulation within the breast but not enough to change the appearance.  2. GOOD: There is mild asymmetry between the breas ts, which means that there is some acceptable 
difference in the size or shape of the treated breast as compared to the opposite breast or the appearance 
of the breast before treatment. There may be some  mild reddening or darken ing of the breast. The 
thickening or scar tissue within the breast ca uses a mild change in its shape or size. 
 3. FAIR: Moderate deformity of the breast, with an obvious difference in the shape and size of the treated breast. This change involve s ¼ or less of the breast. There can  be moderate thickening or scar 
tissue of the skin and th e breast, and there may be obvious color changes. 
 4. POOR: Marked change in the appearance of the trea ted breast involving more than ¼ of the breast 
tissue. The skin change may be obvious and detract from the appearance. Seve re scarring and thickening 
of the breast, which clearly alters its appearance may be present. In re trospect, the breast may have been 
better treated by a mastectomy.  Code a response for each of the following items:

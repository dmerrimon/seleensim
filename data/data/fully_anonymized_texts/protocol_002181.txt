Study Duration  Part 1  
The total study duration is approximately 10 weeks. Subjects will receive study drug for 
approximately 2 weeks.  
Part  2  
The total study duration is approximately 16 weeks for subjects in Cohort  2A and 
18 weeks for subjects in Cohort  2B.  
Study drug will be administered for approximately 8  weeks in Cohort  2A and 
approximately 10 weeks in Cohort  2B. 
  
Study Design  This is a Phase  2, 2-part (Parts 1 and 2) , randomized, double -blind, placebo - and 
VX-661/IVA -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety 
of VX -152 in TC with VX -661 and IVA.  
Parts 1 and 2 will enroll multiple cohorts, with each cohort evaluating 1 dose level of 
VX-152 as part of TC with VX -661/IVA (100 mg daily [qd]/150 mg every 12 hours 
[q12h]). Each cohort will enroll up to approximately 12 subjects  in Part 1 and Part  2 
Cohort  2A and up to approximately 24  subjects in Part  2 Cohort  2B. Subjects in all 
cohorts  will be randomized 3:1 (active TC:comparator). Triple placebo will be the 
compara tor in Part 1, and VX -661/IVA will be the comparator in Part 2.  
Up to 3  cohorts are planned for Part 1 (Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 1C). Up to 2 cohorts are 
planned for Part 2 (Cohorts 2A and 2B). The doses of VX -152 planned for evaluation are 
100 mg q12h in Cohor t 1A, 200 mg q12h in Cohorts 1B and 2A, and 300 mg q12h in 
Cohorts  1C and 2B.  The dose of VX -152 may be adjusted to be lower or the same as the 
dose level evaluated in the previous cohort.  
The actual number of cohorts enrolled in each part may be modified based on emerging 
safety and PK data. Blinded reviews of safety and available PK data will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_460401](s) on an ongoing basis.

Statistical 
Analyses  Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of safety and tolerability of VX -152 in 
TC with VX -661/IVA.  
The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, 
and pulse oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit . The safety analysis for all 
treatment groups in both parts will be descriptive only.  
Secondary Objectives:  
The s econdary objectives of the study include the evaluation of the PD effect of VX -152 
in TC with VX -661/IVA, and the evaluation of the efficacy of VX -152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA.  
The PD endpoint is the absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Day  [ADDRESS_628977] within the mixed -effects model for repeated measures (M MRM) 
framework at a 5% alpha level, with baseline value as a covariate. The adjusted means and 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect at Day 15, for all within -group 
and between -group comparisons will be estimated within MMRM.  
The efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline at Day [ADDRESS_628978] within MMRM at a 5% alpha level. The adjusted means and 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals of the treatment effect at Day 15, for all within -group and between -group 
compariso ns will be estimated within MMRM.  
  
Interim 
Analyses  Interim analy ses for each cohort may be performed after all subjects in the cohort have 
completed the Day 15 Visit.  
  
IDMC Reviews  The independent monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular planned safety 
reviews of study data from all parts of the study as outlined in the IDMC Charter.

.1 Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects more than 70,[ADDRESS_629012] in 
the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel that 
regulates the flow of chloride and other ions in epi[INVESTIGATOR_489355], including lungs, 
pancreas and other gastrointestinal org
ans, and sweat glands.2 Decreased CFTR activity in 
people with CF results in multisystem pathology3, beginning at birth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_489356], the median predicted survival age for a 
person with CF is approximately 40 years.2,4 More effective treatments are needed for CF. 
To address this medical need, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developi[INVESTIGATOR_489357]: the defective 
CFTR protein. Two types of CFTR modulators have been developed: potentiators, which 
increase the channel gating activity of the CFTR protein, and correctors, which increase the 
quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Because potentiators can increase the activity of CFTR 
protein delivered to the cell surface by [CONTACT_489379], CFTR potentiators and correctors are 
complementary therapeutic approaches. 
Ivacaftor (IVA; Kalydeco®), the first CFTR modulator developed by [CONTACT_139383], is an orally 
administered CFTR potentiator that increases the channel-open probability of CFTR protein 
to enhance chloride transport. Globally, Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in 
patients as young as [ADDRESS_629013] the G551D  and certain other gating mutations as well 
as the R117H  mutation in the CFTR  gene depending on the country.5 
Lumacaftor (LUM) and VX-[ADDRESS_629014] prevalent mutation in people with CF, occurs in about 83% of CF 
patients and results in a decreased quantity of CFTR protein at the cell surface. Orkambi™ 
(LUM/IVA combination therapy) is approved in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia for 
patients 12 years and older who are homozygous for F508del . Phase 3 studies of 
VX-661/IVA combination therapy are ongoing in populations that are homozygous or 
heterozygous for F508del . 
VX-152 is a second-generation CFTR corrector that acts through a different site of the CFTR 
protein than LUM and VX-661. In vitro, VX-152 improves the processing and trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR, thereby [CONTACT_489380] F508del-CFTR protein at the 
cell surface. Consistent with different mechanisms of action, the effects of VX-152 and 
VX-661 are additive. The activity of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by 
[CONTACT_94273]-152, alone or in combination with VX-661, is potentiated by [CONTACT_312101]. In human bronchial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells derived from CF patients homozygous for F508del , the triple 
combination (TC) of VX-152, VX-661, and IVA increased CFTR-mediated chloride 
transport more than the dual combinations (VX-152 and VX-661; VX-152 and IVA; VX-661 
and IVA) or individual agents (VX-152; VX-661; IVA). These data, as well as the

8.1 Overview of  Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and VX-661/IVA-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety of VX-152 in TC with VX-661/IVA.  
Up to approximately 72 subjects with CF are planned for enrollment: up to approximately 
36 subjects in each of Part 1 ( F508del /MF genotype) and in Part 2 ( F508del/ F508del  
genotype).  
Parts 1 and 2 will enroll multiple cohorts, w ith each cohort evalua ting 1 dose level of 
VX-152 as part of TC with VX-661/IVA (100 mg qd/150 mg q12h). Each cohort will enroll 
up to approximately 12 subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 Cohort 2A and up to approximately 
24 subjects in Part 2 Cohort 2B. Subjects in all cohorts will be randomized 3:1 (active 
TC:comparator). Triple placebo will be the comparator in Part 1, and VX-661/IVA will be 
the comparator in Part 2. 
Up to 3 cohorts are planned for Part 1 (Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 1C). Up to 2 cohorts are planned 
for Part 2 (Cohorts 2A and 2B). The doses of VX-152 planned for evaluation are 100 mg 
q12h in Cohort 1A, 200 mg q12h in Cohorts 1B a nd 2A, and 300 mg q12h in Cohorts 1C and 
2B. The dose of VX-152 may be adjusted to be lower or the same as the dose level evaluated 
in the previous cohort. The actual number of cohorts enrolled in each part may be modified based on emerging 
safety and PK data. Blinded reviews of safety and available PK data will be conducted by [CONTACT_489381](s) on an ongoing basis. Cohorts will initiate dosing as follows: 
 Cohort 1A will initiate dosing first.  
 Cohorts 1B and 2A may initia te dosing if supported by [CONTACT_489382] 1A complete the Day 15 Visit. 
 Cohorts 1C and 2B may initiate dosing if supported by [CONTACT_489383]: 
o All subjects in Cohort 1B complete the Day [ADDRESS_629016] 12 subjects across Cohorts 1B and 2A complete the Day 15 Visit. 
A schematic of the study design (including the doses of VX-152, VX-661, and IVA to be 
evaluated) is shown in Figure 8-1. 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.[ADDRESS_629017] dose of VX-661/IVA in the Run-in Pe
riod.  
The assessments to be conducted are shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3 and will 
be used to confirm that s
ubjects mee
t the eligibility criteria for the study. The investigator (or 
an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent from each subject before 
any study procedure takes place.  
The screening ophthalmologic examination does not have to be performed if there is 
documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria and was within 3 months before 
the date of informed consent (Section 
11.7.6) or if there is documentation of bilateral lens 
removal for the subject.  
8.1.
1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) 
Repetition of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not 
permitted with the following excepti
ons:  
 If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a rep
eat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or 
assessment may be permitted with the approval of the medical monitor. 
 Exclusionary liver function test (LFT) levels, which may be retested once within 14 days 
of the original screening date, w
ith approval of the medical monitor. 
If screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_489359]/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_139600],6 repeat 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_94230]. 
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and 
completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening 
Subjects may only be rescreened with the approval of the medical monitor. If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was ≥40  mIU/mL during prior 
screening), G6PD activity test (if total bilirubin level was <2 × upper limit of normal [ULN] 
during prior screening), sweat chloride level, and the ophthalmologic examination (if 
documentation shows it was performed within the last 3 months). If a subject is rescreened, 
the new screening window will begin once
 the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.[ADDRESS_629018] the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks, without medical 
monitor approval, for the following reasons: 
 Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
 To meet the eligibility criteria 
 Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (Section 11.7.6) 
 Repetition of spi[INVESTIGATOR_460365] 
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 4 weeks, without medical 
monitor approval, for the following reason: 
 For Part  1 subjects, washout of VX-661/IVA if enrolling from Study VX14-661-110 
(Study 661-110) 
 Operational or logistic delays 
8.1.2  Run-in Period (Part 2) 
The Run-in Period will have a total duration of 4 weeks and is designed to establish a reliable 
on-treatment (VX-661/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of 
VX-661/IVA will be administered at the Day
 -[ADDRESS_629019] dose of VX-661/IVA within 
the Run-in Period will be administered in the evening of Da
y -1 (1 day before the Day 1 
Visit).  
Study eligibility for Part [ADDRESS_629020] dose of VX-661/IVA in 
the Run-in Period (on Day -28). 
Study visits during the Run-in Period will occur as shown in Table 3-[ADDRESS_629021] meet both of the following criteria to continue into t
he Treatment Period: 
 Must have stable CF disease (as judged by [CONTACT_093]) and have remained on a 
stable CF medication regimen during the 28 days before the Day 1 Visit. (For example, 
subjects cannot have an acute upper or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], pulmonary 
exacerbation, or changes in therapy [including antibiotics] for pulmonary disease within 
28 days before the Day 1 Visit.)  
 Must not have had an acute non-CF illness (e.g., gastroenteritis) within the [ADDRESS_629022] dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and 
will occur on Day 1 (or Day -1) after all criteria for entry into the Treatment Period have 
been confirmed. Study eligibility for Part
 1 subjects will be confirmed before randomization. 
For Part 2, subjects who prematurely discontinue VX-661/IVA during
 the Run-in Period will 
not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period.  
8.1.4  Washout Period (Part 2) 
The Washout Period will last approximately 2 weeks and is designed to allow for the 
measurement of off-treatment effects. Subjects will continue
 to receive VX-661/IVA during 
the Washout Period. 
Study visits during the Washout Period will occur as shown in Table 3-[ADDRESS_629023] a Safety Follow-up Visit: 
 Part 2 subjects who do not meet the criteria to enter the Treatment Period ( Section 8.1.3), 
and re-enter Study 661-110 
 Part 2 subjects in Cohort 2A who complete the Day 29 Visit and re-enter Study 661-110  
 Part [ADDRESS_629024] prematurely discontinues treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) 
Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to terminate study drug 
treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete 
the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately [ADDRESS_629025] withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal

This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_139374] (IDMC), 
which will conduct periodic reviews of safety data from all parts of the study 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Procedura

Charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
8.[ADDRESS_629026] clinical study of VX-152 in subjects with CF. It is designed to 
evaluate the safety of VX-152 in TC with VX-661/IVA and to establish proof-of-concept in 
2 populations of subjects defined by [CONTACT_489384]: subjects heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR  mutation with a second CFTR  mutation not expected to respond to 
VX-661/IVA ( F508del /minimal function [MF]) (Part 1) and subjects homozygous for 
F508del  (F508del /F508del ) (Part 2). 
Based on in vitro data, TC is predicted to provide clinically relevant improvements in 
chloride transport in both populations, though the magnitude of response may not be the 
same in these populations. The subjects will be
 evaluated by [CONTACT_489385] 1 and 2, based on the potential for differences in the magnitude of treatment response 
among these genotype categories. PD will be evaluated through the assessment of sweat 
chloride, and efficacy will be evaluated through the assessment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_489360]. Part 1 of the study will also obtain information regarding the 
exposure-response relationship (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Placebo is the comparator in Pa
rt 1, as efficacy has not been established for a corrector, 
potentiator, or corrector/potentiator combination in subjects with F508del /MF genotypes. 
VX-661/IVA is the comparator in Part 2, based on the potential for benefit demonstrated for 
VX-661/IVA in subjects with the  F508del /F508del  genotype in Study VX11-661-101.[ADDRESS_629027] a 4-we
ek run-in period to establish a reliable on-treatment (VX-661/IVA) 
baseline for comparison t
o the Treatment Period, when subjects will additionally receive 
VX-152 or placebo. Off-treatment effects will also be measured at the Safety Follow-up Visit 
in Part 1 and at the end of the W
ashout Period in Part 2. 
8.2.2  Study Drug Dose a
nd Duration 
Part 1 wil
l evaluate up to 3 dose levels of VX-152 (100, 200, and 300 mg q12h) in TC with 
VX-661/IVA in subjects with the F508del /MF genotype.  
 
  
The dose
 escalation of VX-152 is no more
 than 2-fold.  
 
 
  
   

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 35 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                Up to 3 dose levels of VX
-152 will be evaluated as part of the TC in Part 1 to provide a range 
of doses and exposures that will enable dose-response and exposure-response analyses for 
PD (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Dose- and exposure-response information obtained from Part 1 
(F508del /MF genoty
pe) is expected to be applicable to other populations with an F508del  
mutation, including F508del /F508del  genotypes, based on similar in vitro potency for the TC 
in HBE cells with 1 or 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] F508del .8  
The dose of VX-661 and IVA (100 mg qd and 150 mg q12h) in the TC are the same doses 
currently under eva
luation in Phase 3 studies of VX-661/IVA. These doses of VX-[ADDRESS_629028] 
observed within 14 days.
 Given the increa
sed in vitro response of the TC relative to 
VX-661/IVA, it is expected that the 2-week treatment duration will be sufficient to observe 
differences between treatment arms with respect to efficacy and PD endpoints. In addition, 
based on previous clinical experience, 2 weeks is sufficient for VX-152, VX-661, and IVA to 
reach steady-state levels of exposure. The 4-week treatment duration in Part 2 Cohort 2B will 
provide additional safety data for the TC. 
8.2.3  Rationale
 for Study Assessments 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The PD a
nd efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, 
accurate, and relevant to the study of patients in CF. All assessments were routinely 
measured in the registration studies of IVA (Kalydeco) or LUM/IVA combination therapy 
(Orkambi).

4. Body weight ≥35 kg. 
5. Sweat chloride value 60 mmol/L from test results obtained during screening. If the 
value cannot be determined from the screening test, a sweat chloride value documented in 
the subject’s medical record may be used to establish eligibility. (It is a cceptable to use a 
sweat chloride value that was obtained before previous treatment with IVA, LUM/IVA, 
or an investigational CFTR modulator). 
6. Subjects must have an eligible CFTR  genotype as noted below. If the screening CFTR  
genotype result is not received before randomization (Part 1) or before Day -28 (Part 2), a 
previous CFTR  genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility. 
Note: Subjects who have been randomized and whose screening genotype does not 
confirm study eligibility must be discontinued from the study (Section 9.5).

cations 
Medications that are prohibited in this study (Screening Period through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit) are shown in Table 9-1. VX-152, VX-661, and IVA are metabolized extensively via 
cyto
chrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. VX-[ADDRESS_629041] the 
potential to alter the exposure of VX-152, VX-661, or IVA, will be 
restricted in this study. VX-152 was shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of the hepatic 
transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and 1B3 (OATP1B3). 
Therefore, sensitive substrates of OATP1B1/1B3, such as HMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors 
(i.e., “statins”), are also restricted during the study.  
A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for medication will be provided in

[ADDRESS_629046]'s source documents. For subjects who are screened but are not 
subsequently ra
ndomized in the study, details of prior medication will only be documented in 
the subjects' source documents. 
 Subjects must remain on a stable medication (and supplement) regimen for their CF from 
[ADDRESS_629047] not initiate long-term treatment with new 
medication from 28
 days before Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Visit unless 
discussed and approv
ed by [CONTACT_7195]. Guidelines for stable medication 
regimens for CF are as follows: 
o Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled 
antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who cycle onto and off an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on Day 1 should be synchronized 
as closely
 as possible (and not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 
the inhaled antibiotic. 
o Subjects who alternate between [ADDRESS_629048] dose of study drug on 
Day 1 should be synchronized as closely as possible (and not more than ± 3 days) to 
the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. 
 Subjects may receive doses of prednisone of up to 10 mg/day or equivalent (chronically) 
or prednisone 60
 mg qd for up to 5 days without prior approval of the medical monitor. 
 Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_139335] 11.6.1. 
9.[ADDRESS_629049](s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow-up 
Visit, if applicable (see Section 8.1.6), and follow up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs.

Study drug refers to VX-152, VX-661/IVA, IVA, and their matching placebos. 
10.[ADDRESS_629051] "CF" 
high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack or a standard meal, according to the following 
guidelines: 
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or 
snack. 
2. Study drug will be administered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses of study 
drugs will
 be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning 
dose could be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:[ADDRESS_629052]'s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
 If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_629053]'s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning 
dose will be administered in the clinic. 
 If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_629054]'s scheduled 
morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home and the evening dose 
will be administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected 
relative to the evening dose. 
6. For visits after the Day 1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused 
study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_629055] should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_629056] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the 
subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For 
example, 
 if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible. 
 if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and 
more than [ADDRESS_629057] elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 
14:00), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00. 
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Approximately 12 subjects (Part 1 and Part 2, Cohort 1A) and approximately 24 subjects 
(Part 2, Cohort 2B) will be randomized in the ratio 3:1 to TC versus comparator in each 
cohort. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to 
treatment. The randomization code list will be produced by [CONTACT_14448] a qualified 
randomization vendor. 
10.[ADDRESS_629058] elevations of >3 × ULN, or total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by 
[CONTACT_66768] [ADDRESS_629059] the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible 
(ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.[ADDRESS_629060] be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), 
and the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria are met: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2  weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice 
 Indirect bilirubin >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct 
bilirubin) 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued , if confirmatory testing results obtained 
after study drug interruption meet any of the following criteria: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2  weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice 
 Indirect bilirubin >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct 
bilirubin), in association with decreased haptoglobin 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation and/or increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminases or bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval 
of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. 
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin 
should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
10.5 Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug tablets will be supplied in blister cards by [CONTACT_139383]. Study drug labeling will be in

CFTR  genotype (Screening Period only):  CFTR  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_489373]. If the screening CFTR  genotype result is not received before randomization, a 
previous CFTR  genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility. Subjects who 
have been randomized and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibility must 
be discontinued from the study ( Section 9.5). 
G6PD Activity Test (Screening Period only): A single blood sample will be collected for the 
G6PD activity test, which will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay 
routinely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs quantitative G6PD activity assays 
is acceptable as an alternative to the central laboratory. 
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, the central laboratory must be used for all laboratory tests 
with the exception of the G6PD activity test. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion 
of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test 
value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_489389]. If 
it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was

and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry 
will be collected before the morning dose. This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery 
to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. 
11.7.[ADDRESS_629079] 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3). Additional standard 12-lead 
ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
 The subject will be instructed to rest in the seated position for at least 5 minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
 The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate (HR), 
such as blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening Visit and Safety 
Follow-up Visit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_489390]. Clinically significant ECG 
abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded 
as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45 msec from the 
baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs 
will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the
 original measurement. If 
either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs re
mains above the threshold value 
(>45 msec from baseline or ≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until 
QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat 
measurement. Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separ
ate 
document (ECG Manual).

Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below. 
Contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following: 
 True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit through [ADDRESS_629083] 
dose of study drug
. 
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the

12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 
12.1 Sample Size and Power 
12.1.1  Primary Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of safety and tolerability of VX-152 in 
TC with VX-661/IVA. The sample size calculations described below are deemed adequate to 
evaluate the safety objective of the study, based on clinical and statistical considerations.

.1 Safety and Tolerability 
The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of AEs. Up to approximately 72 subjects are 
planned to be enrolled in the study with up to 36 subjects receiving VX-152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA for 2 weeks (Part 1 and Part 2, Cohort 2A), and 18 subjects receiving VX-152 
in TC with VX-661/IVA for 4 weeks (Part 1 and Part 2, Cohort 2B). The sample size for 
each treatment group in Parts [ADDRESS_629093] based on a 
sample size of 9 or 18 subjects subjects per TC treatment group and AE incidences ranging 
from 5% to 15%. The probability calculations are based on a binomial model using the

TC with VX-661/IVA on sweat chloride concentrations, and the evaluation of the efficacy of 
VX-152 in TC with VX-661/IVA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic Effect 
The absolute change from baseline at Day [ADDRESS_629095] for a decreasing 
dose-response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using a 
multiple comparisons procedure (MCP). The procedure consists of testing the null hypothesis 
of a non-decreasing dose-response trend versus a decreasing trend using the 1-sided 
maximum t-statistic that controls the type I error at alpha = 5%. The procedure requires a 
family of 
candidate dose-response models to be prespecified, that covers the range of 
plausible and diverse dose-response profiles.  
The candidate models that best describe the expected decreasing dose-response profile of the 
TC groups compared to placebo include a linear model, a maximum effect (E max) model, and 
a sigmoid E max model. The contrasts (i.e., linear combinations of the treatment group means 
at Day 15) selected to perform the MCP and that capture the shape of these candidate models 
are desc
ribed in Table 12-[ADDRESS_629096] Coefficients for the Multiple Comparisons

12.2 Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set, and Safety Set. 
Additional analysis sets related to the Run-in Period will be defined in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP), as appropriate. 
The All Subjects Set will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 
[ADDRESS_629101] data listings and 
disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended 
CFTR  allele mutation and have received at least [ADDRESS_629102] 1 dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses, unless otherwise 
specified. 
12.3 Statistical Analysis 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary PD and 
efficacy endpoints of the study. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the SAP and 
clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis 
plan (CPAP). Both plans will be finalized before the clinical data lock and unblinding of the 
study.

Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary 
statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, standard error (SE), median, minimum value 
(min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous 
variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, minimum and maximum 
values will be reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean, 
median, SD, and SE will be reported to [ADDRESS_629103] units (metric or International System [SI]) will be converted with 
the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_629104] recent 
non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study 
drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the average 
of the most recent triplicate pretreatment measurements before the first dose of study drug in 
the Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1). 
Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as postbaseline value –  baseline value. 
Relative change  from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value – baseline 
value)/baseline value. 
The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period will include the time from the first dose in the 
Treatment Period to the Safety Follow-up Visit or [ADDRESS_629105] dose of the study 
drug for subjects who do not complete the Safety Follow-up Visit. Additional TE periods 
related to the Run-in period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate.  
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for performing multiple hypothesis tests.  
The rules for handling missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be 
described in the SAP. 
All data will be summarized for Parts 1 and 2, separately, unless specified otherwise. 
12.3.2  Background Characteristics 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Disposition 
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, 
included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed 
study/Safety Follow-up Visit, and discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the 
reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_1570].

Demographic, background (e.g., medical history), and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized using descriptive summary statistics. 
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by 
[CONTACT_460419] (but are not limited to): sex, race, age, baseline 
weight, baseline height, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline 
sweat chloride.  
No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications used in this study will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following: 
 Prior medication:  any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, 
regardless of when it ended 
 Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE Period 
 Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received after the TE Period 
A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; 
or prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose 
of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be 
considered in all [ADDRESS_629106] data listing. 
Additional classifications of concomitant medications related to the Run-in Period will be 
defined in the SAP, as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Exposure to study drug will be summarized for the FAS in terms of duration of treatment a 
subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of study drug plus 1. 
Dosing compliance based on number of tablets taken, will be summarized for the FAS, and 
will be derived as 100  [(total number of tablets dispensed) – (total number of tablets 
returned)]/ (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day  duration of study drug 
exposure in days). 
Dosing compliance based on study drug exposure, will be derived as 100 × [1 - (total number 
of days of study drug interruption) / (duration of study drug exposure in days)].

An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject’s rights, safety, or well -being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in 
the SAP. 
All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing. 
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis 
A secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA in Parts 1 and 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables 
The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change from baseline for ppFEV 1 at Day 15. 
The analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with change from baseline for ppFEV [ADDRESS_629107] errors. Conditional on the fixed effects, missing data due 
to treatment or study discontinuation will be assumed to be missing at random.  
Descriptive analyses of the change from baseline will be performed for all treatment groups. 
Adjusted means and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect at Day 15, with 
1-sided P values for all within-group and between-group comparisons, will be estimated 
within MMRM using LSMeans via PROC MIXED in SAS in both parts.  
 
  
 
 
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for performing multiple hypothesis tests. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The secondary efficacy variables include: 
 Absolute change from baseline for ppFEV 1 through Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B only).  
 Relative change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Day 15 (Part 1 and Part 2), and through Day 
29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B only) 
 Absolute change in the CFQ-R respi[INVESTIGATOR_460352] 15 (Part 1 
and Part 2), and at Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B onl y) 
Details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP. 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.[ADDRESS_629108] of VX-152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA on sweat chloride concentrations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic Effect at Day [ADDRESS_629109] a decreasing 
dose-response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using the 
MCP procedure with the prespecified comparisons (contrasts) of the treatment group means 
within a linear MMRM framework. The model will include the absolute change from 
baseline for sweat chloride as the dependent variable, with treatment group, visit, and 
treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and the baseline sweat chloride value as a 
covariate. The test will be performed using the 1-sided maximum t-statistic of the individual 
t-statistics for the multiple prespecified contrasts at alpha = 5%, based on the treatment group 
means at Day 15.  
Further, adjusted means and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect at 
Day 15, with 1-sided P values for all within-group and between-group comparisons, will be 
estimated within MMRM, in both parts.  
Additional details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic Effect through Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B only) 
The absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B 
only) is also a secondary endpoint used to evaluate the PD objective of the study. The 
adjusted mean and 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the average treatment effect through 
Day 29 for the within-group and between-group comparisons in Part 2, Cohort 2B will be 
estimated within MMRM. 
12.3.5  Safety Analysis 
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of safety and tolerability. All safety 
analyses will be based on data from the TE Period for all subjects in the Safety Set.

dose of study drug through the end of the TE Period 
 Post-treatment AE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed 
beyond the TE Period 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study drug treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.

CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, 
Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1  Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the 
event does not necessarily
 have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any 
newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity 
or freque
ncy) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
13.[ADDRESS_629114] result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a 
diagnosis, the abnorma
l study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine 
or decre
ased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more 
of the following:
 
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of 
whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_1275]. 
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_629115]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.

.3 Documentation of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points: 
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent) 
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit 
 For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the earliest of 
o [ADDRESS_629116] dose of study drug 
(see Section 8.1.6)
. 
All subjects will be que
ried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
[ADDRESS_629117]'s source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE: 
 Description of the event 
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
 Severity 
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity 
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. 
The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
August 2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” In 
consi
dering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in 
the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined 
according to the definitions in Table 13-1.

Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Causality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to 
the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table  13-[ADDRESS_629118] been ruled 
out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the in vestigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action 
taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table  13-[ADDRESS_629119] to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to contin ue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was 
given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications,

treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home)  

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.[ADDRESS_629120] has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurr
ed before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489374]
e subject signed the ICF, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168788], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489375]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419715] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considere
d to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same 
as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
13.1.2
.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow-up Visit, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_155431]. In addition, all 
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) 
will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form 
(hereafter re ferred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_489394](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study 
drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes 
unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study 
analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be 
documented as on
going. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is 
required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using 
the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an 
SAE, reg
ardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE 
Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on 
previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as 
it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:

Protein With Minimal Function (Part 1) 
Per the study eligibility criteria, heterozygous F508del-CFTR  subjects in Part [ADDRESS_629127] a 
second CFTR  allele containing a mutation that is predicted to result in a CFTR protein with 
minimal function and not likely to respond to VX-661 and/or ivacaftor (IVA) therapy. These 
CFTR  mutations were defined using 3 major sources:  
 biological plausibility for the mutation to respond (i.e., mutation class) 
 evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (per CFTR2 patient registry; 
accessed on 15 February 2016) 
o average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, and 
o prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50% 
 in vitro testing 
o mutations resulting in baseline chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR 
were considered minimal function 
o mutations resulting in chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR following 
the addition of VX-661 and/or IVA were considered nonresponsive  
The clinical severity criteria (average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L and %PI >50%) do not 
apply to the individual subjects to be enrolled in this study, but were used to classify the 
mutation status on a population level. 
The list below represents acceptable mutations; however, this list may not include every 
eligible mutation, and investigators should contact [CONTACT_489397].

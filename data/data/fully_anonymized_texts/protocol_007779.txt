Approximately 50 investig ative sites; US only 
Study Duration:  Planned date first patient enr olled to planned date last 
patient completed: November 2017 – April 2020 Phase of Development:  Phase IV (Prospective, 
Observational) 
Study Objective:  
The objective of this prospect ive observational study is to gat her real-world observational 
data from the following assessm ents in individuals in the Unite d States (US) with 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) during XADAGO treatment: the Movement Disorders Society – 
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rati ng Scale (MDS-UPDRS), the Parki nson’s Disease 
Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the Montre al Cognitive Assessment (MoCA ), the Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Me dication (TSQM-9), the Clinica l Global Impression of 
Change (CGI-C), and the Patient G lobal Impression of Change (PG I-C). 
Methodology:  This is a multisite, prospective, observational study to evalua te clinician-reported outcomes 
(ClinRO) and patient-reported outc omes (PRO) related to motor a nd non-motor symptoms, 
health status/QoL, and treatment  satisfaction in PD patients who have been newly prescribed 
XADAGO according to Package Insert indication ( Appendix A ). Eligible study participants 
will be consented, enrolled, and prospectively followed for [ADDRESS_680088] udy extension. ClinRO measures will be completed by [CONTACT_1268] (PI) or certified health care profession al (HCP) designee (i.e., MD,

6.1. Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinson’s disease (PD), a chronic neurodegenerative disorder,  affects approximately 1-2% of 
people over the age of 60 years , and approximately 4% of patien ts older than 80 years ( Dorsey, 
2007). PD is second only to Alzheimer’s disease in frequency. With the aging of the population, 
the number of PD patients is exp ected to increase dramatically (de Lau, 2006; Olanow, 2009). 
The symptoms of PD can be highly variable at disease onset, as well as throughout the 
progression of disease. As a resu lt of the heterogeneity of PD,  and the variation in response to 
treatment, each patient requires individualized care and a pers onalized treatment plan. 
For decades, PD treatment has focused on management of motor sy mptoms. The progressive loss 
of nigrostriatal dopaminergic n eurons leads to the well-known s et of PD motor symptoms 
characteristic of the disease . Although PD is generally considered to be a movement disorder, 
there is a growing recognition of the non-motor symptoms, which  have a major impact on the 
quality of life of patients and their families ( Olanow, 2009; Weintraub, 2008 ). Non-motor 
symptoms are frequently observed in PD prior to the occurrence of any motor symptoms, a 
finding that implicates not onl y dysregulation of the dopaminer gic system but also other 
neurotransmitter involvement i n different areas of the brain ( Chaudhuri, 2009; Barone, 2010 ). 
The understanding that PD is a syndrome of dopamine deficiency led to the introduction of the 
clinical use of levodopa, a precurs or of dopamine that crosses the blood brain barrier, in addition 
to the use of other dopaminergic agents, including selective in hibitors of monoamine oxidase B 
(MAO-B), the major dopamine-metabolizing enzyme in humans. 
Levodopa remains the most effectiv e single pharmacotherapy for PD. Unfortunately, oral 
levodopa use is often limited by [CONTACT_524350], related 
in part to the daily dosage used ( Obeso, 2000; Olanow, 2013 ). Approximately 40% of PD 
patients develop motor fluctua tions after 4 to 6 years of levod opa treatment (Ahlskog, 2001). 
These effects can be managed by [CONTACT_524351], changing the f ormulation of levodopa, or using add-on therapy, but such 
strategies may increase the risk of dyskinesia ( Ferreira, 2013 ). Increasingly, non-dopaminergic 
agents are being studied to dete rmine their potential to supple ment or delay the use of established 
dopaminergic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Fox, 2008). 
6.2. XADAGO® 
XADAGO (safinamide) is one of the newest treatments recently approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in the Unite d States (US) as an add-on the rapy to levodopa/carbidopa in 
patients with PD experiencing off epi[INVESTIGATOR_524306] e XADAGO Package Insert, May 
2017 ( Appendix A ). XADAGO is an orally active, wat er-soluble, α-aminoamide deri vative. It is 
a potent, selective, and reversibl e MAO-B inhibitor. In additio n, the molecule safinamide has 
been shown in animal studies to e xhibit state-dependent blockad e of voltage-gated sodium 
channels, modulation of calcium c hannels, and subsequent inhibi tion of stimulated release of 
glutamate ( Caccia, 2006 ; Caccia, 2007; Chazot, 2007; Pevarello, 1998; Stocchi, 2006 ) which 
may be implicated in the development of dyskinesia (Chase, 2003; Gregoire, 2013 ). The clinical 
implication of the activity is not known.

Confidential Information  Page 17 of 108 XADAGO was evaluated in two do uble-blind, placebo-controlled, m ultinational, 24-week 
studies. In both studies, change in on time without dyskinesia plus on time with non-troublesome 
dyskinesia, as determined by [CONTACT_524352], was the primary end point. Secondary endpoints 
included change in off time and clinician-rated change in Movement Disorders Society - Unified 
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III scores. T he trials were conducted in 
patients with PD who had at least 1.5 hours of daily off time, despi[INVESTIGATOR_524307]/carbidopa. Pat ients could also be taking d opamine agonists, catechol-O-
methyl transferase (COMT) inhi bitors, anticholinergics, and amantadine. In Study 1, patients 
were randomized to placebo, 50 mg/ day or 100 mg/day of XADAGO. In Study 2, patients were 
randomized to placebo or a treat ment group in which all patient s were started on 50 mg/day for 2 
weeks, then increased to 100 mg/day thereafter ( Borgohain, 2014a ; Schapi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], 2017 ). Both studies 
showed significant improvements in on time without troublesome dyskinesia as compared to 
placebo, as well as significant decreases in off time and improvement in UPDRS Part III scores 
(Borgohain, 2014a ; Schapi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], 2017 ). The improvements in on time and off time seen at 6 months 
were maintained out to 2 years in  an 18-month extension of Stud y 1 (Borgohain, 2014b). Both 
the 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day doses of XADAGO were well tolerate d by [CONTACT_524353] t of placebo. The most commonly r eported adverse event (AE) was 
dyskinesia, which was significan tly higher in the treatment gro ups versus placebo. Of the 
patients who discontinued due to an AE, 1% of patients in the treatment group discontinued due 
to dyskinesia and 0% in the placebo group. In addition to the c linical benefits seen in motor 
function, there were also improve ments noted in measures of act ivities of daily liv ing, depressive 
symptoms, patients’ clinical status, and aspects of quality of life such as emotional well-being, 
communication, and bodily discomfort ( Borgohain, 2014a; Borgohain, 2014b; Schapi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], 2017). 
These improvements in non-motor symptoms were seen for the 100 mg/day group in secondary 
measures, specifically the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire; h ealth status/quality of life (PDQ-
39) and the Clinical Global Impr ession of Change in health (CGI-C) outcomes. 
6.3. Study Rationale 
The objective of this prospectiv e, observational, post-marketing study is to obtain further data on 
the effect of XADAGO on motor and non-motor symptoms in patient s newly prescribed 
XADAGO. Although the cardinal symp toms of PD are motor, there i s increasing app reciation of 
the non-motor symptoms, which at times may be a greater burden to the patient than the motor 
symptoms ( Olanow, 2009; Weintraub, 2008). Along with the greater recognition, there is also an 
evolving science into the etio logy of non-motor symptoms in PD.  XADAGO as a treatment 
option is unique in that the mol ecule has a dual mechanism of a ction: 1) MAO-B inhibition 
improves motor symptoms, and 2) the second mechanism of action,  sodium channel inhibition 
and subsequent modulation of glutam ate, may have a role in improving non-motor symptoms. 
Secondary and post-hoc analyses of XADAGO clinical trial data d escribed above find signals for 
improvement with endpoints in p ain, quality of life, and mood t hat suggest possible clinical 
effects of the drug through this second mechanism of action. 
The focus of this study will be on measurement of changes in real-world outcomes (motor and non-motor symptoms, health statu s, and general quality of life) in the near term; therefore, the 
primary endpoint is set at 2 mont hs, with an optional additiona l 4 months of treatment.

7.1. Study Objective
The objective of this prospectiv e, observational study is to ga ther real-world observational data 
from the following assessments in individuals in the United Sta tes (US) with Parkinson’s disease 
(PD) during XADAGO treatment: the Movement Disorders Society – Unified Parkinson’s 
Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), the Parkinson’s Disease Quest ionnaire (PDQ-39), the 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Treatment Satisfactio n Questionnaire for 
Medication (TSQM-9), the Clinical Global Impression of Change ( CGI-C), and the Patient 
Global Impression of Change (PGI-C). 
7.2. Study Endpoints 
Study endpoints are the changes from the Baseline Visit to Visi t 3 (Study Day 60, Primary 
Endpoint) in motor and non-motor symptoms, general health statu s/quality of life, treatment 
satisfaction, and global impression (Section 8.1 and Table 3) as measured by [CONTACT_274657]-
UPDRS, P DQ-39 and MoCA, TSQM-9, and CGI-C/PGI-C, respectively. 
7.2.1. Motor Symptoms and Non-Motor Symptoms 
MDS-UPDRS ( Appendix D) provides an assessment of the e ffects of PD on multiple aspects  of 
a patient’s life. The assessment is administered by [CONTACT_524354] (PI) or certified 
Health Care Professional (HCP)  designee and consists of 4 parts : 
Part I focuses on non-motor expe riences of daily living, such a s mood, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_524308], pain, and fatigue. In IA , the investigator assesses var ious behaviors using
information from the patient a nd caregiver; in IB, the assessme nts are completed by
[CONTACT_524355]. Difficulties a re rated on a 5-point
scale, from 0=no problems to 4=severe problems.
Part II is an evaluation of motor experiences of daily living, such as speech, eating,
hygiene, and movement, and is completed by [CONTACT_102]. Difficu lties are rated using
the same 5-point scale as Part I.
Part III assesses the severity of the cardinal motor findings ( e.g., tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia, and postural instab ility). It includes 33 scores based on 18 items, and
difficulties are rated using the same 5-point scale as Part I.
Part IV is made up of questions on motor complications, and dif ficulties are rated
using the same 5-point scale as Part I. This section integrates patient-derived
information with the investigat or’s clinical observations and j udgments and is
completed by [CONTACT_29975] (Goetz, 2008). It will be scored by [CONTACT_737].
7.2.2. General Health Status/Quality of Life
PDQ-39 (Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire) ( Appendix B ) is a disease-specific, health-related 
quality-of-life assessment. It is a self-completed, patient-reported outcome (PRO) designed to address aspects of functioning and well-being for those affecte d by [CONTACT_4002]. Each of the 39 items is 
rated using a 5-point Likert sc ale, with 0 for never having dif ficulties/problems and 4 for always 
Protocol No. USWM-SA1-4001  12 October 2018 (Amendment 2; Final ) 
Confidential Information  Page 20 of 108 having difficulties/problems. The sum score of the 39 items wil l be calculate d and used for 
analysis, with the maximum score of 156 ( Peto, 1998). 
MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) ( Appendix C ) is a validated, 30-point, 1-page test 
administered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_524309], including visuospatial  abilities (5 points), naming (3 points), attention (6 points), 
language (3 points), abstraction (2 points), delayed recall (5 points), and orientation to time and 
place (6 points).  
7.2.3. Treatment Satisfaction 
TSQM-9  (Treatment Satisfaction Ques tionnaire for Medication) ( Appendix E ) is the abbreviated 
version of the original questionn aire (TSQM 1.4), a reliable an d valid instrument with 
14 questions to assess patients’ satisfaction with medication. This PRO provides scores on four 
scales: side effects, effectiv eness, convenience, and global sa tisfaction. Because questions 
relative to side effects could potentially interfere with patie nt care in a natura listic setting, the 
[ADDRESS_680094] ion are often used without the 5 on 
side effects ( Bharmal, 2009 ). 
7.2.4. Global Impression 
CGI-C  (Clinical Global Impression – Change) ( Appendix F ) is a rating of the patient’s overall 
improvement, based on a 7-point s cale, using a range of responses from 1 (very much improved) 
through to 7 (very much worse) (Guy, 1976). The patient’s improvement is rated by [CONTACT_1600]/certified HCP designee. 
PGI-C  (Patient Global Impression – Change) ( Appendix G ) is a 7-point scale depi[INVESTIGATOR_155772] a 
patient's rating of overall impr ovement. A patient reports his/ her own change as “very much 
improved,” “much improved,” “minimally improved,” “no change,” “minimally worse,” “much 
worse,” or “very much worse” (Hurst, 2004).

8.1. Study Design and Schedule of Assessments 
This is a multisite, prospective, observational study to evalua te clinician-reported outcomes 
(ClinROs) and patient-reported outc omes (PROs) related to motor  and non-motor symptoms, 
health status/QoL, and treatment  satisfaction in a “real world”  PD population in the US newly 
prescribed XADAGO in accordance with the Package Insert indicat ion (Appendix A ). The 
decision to prescribe XADAGO by c linician and patient must be m ade before site study staff 
discuss the study with the patient . If the patient is intereste d in participatin g in the study, an 
informed consent form (ICF) will be provided to the patient for review, contents of the ICF will 
be discussed, and patient’s signature [CONTACT_183884]. Enrolle d patients will be prospectively 
followed for 2 months, with the po tential to participate in a 4 -month Extension Study. 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ) presents all the study activities that will occur at each 
study interaction with patients  during clinic visits, by [CONTACT_524356]-specified time points, 
and by [CONTACT_524357] (eCOA ) system. Investigative sites 
will be provided secure access to 21 CFR Part 11-compliant elec tronic Case Report Forms 
(eCRF), and sites and patients will have access to the eCOA system(s) for collecting all patient data. 
8.1.1. Screening / Baseline Assessments (Visit 1, Study Day 1) 
The Screening Visit and the Baseline Assessment Visit may occur on the same day. During the 
Screening Visit, patients who pr ovide written consent to participate in the study and HIPAA

according to the following procedures: 
•Assessment of eligibility criteria (i.e., Inclusion [Section 9.1] and Exclusion
[Section 9.2] Criteria)
•Collection of demographics and medical history information, including history of PD 
and other neurological conditions 
For patients determined to be elig ible for the study, Baseline Assessments should be conducted 
at the same visit that Screeni ng occurs. If the patient require s a separate Baseline Assessment 
Visit, it should occur no more than 7 days after the Screening Visit. 
Patients will arrive at the Inve stigator’s clinic in an “on” mo tor state. The following activities 
and outcome assessments (Baseline Assessments) will be completed at the clinic Baseline Visit:

11.2. Definition of Adverse Events 
11.2.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or  the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition following or during exposure to a ph armaceutical product, whether or 
not considered related to the product. 
11.2.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is an A E occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 Death 
 Life-threatening 
 Patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_524317] 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical event that , based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, may 
jeopardize the patient or require  medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above 
11.3. Relationship to XADAGO 
For each AE, the investigator wi ll assess the at tribution of XA DAGO to the AE and determine 
whether the AE is or is not re lated to XADGAO as defined below.  When in doubt, the AE should 
be considered at least “possibly related” until further evidenc e becomes available to refute this 
assessment. 
Protocol No. USWM-SA1-4001 12 October 2018 (Amendment 2; Final ) 
Confidential Information Page 31 of 108 Definitely Not Related
 Patient did not receive XADAGO, the  temporal sequence of the AE  onset relative
to administration of XADAGO is not reasonable, or there is anot her obvious 
cause of the AE. 
Possibly Related
 There is evidence of exposure to XADAGO and the temporal sequen ce of the AE
onset relative to administra tion of XADAGO is reasonable, but the AE could have 
been due to another equally likely cause. 
Probably Related
 There is evidence of exposure t o XADAGO, the temporal sequence of the AE
onset relative to administra tion of XADAGO is reasonable, and t he AE is more 
likely explained by [CONTACT_524362]. 
Definitely Related There is evidence of exposure t o XADAGO, the temporal sequence of the AE
onset relative to administra tion of XADAGO is reasonable, the A E is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_524363] n by [CONTACT_364820], and the AE shows a 
pattern consistent with previous knowledge in the label of XADA GO or similar 
drug class. 
AEs determined by [CONTACT_524364] “possibly” or “probabl y” related will be documented as 
related to XADAGO for the purposes of expedited regulatory repo rting and clini cal reporting. 
11.4. Recording Adverse Events 
AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to  an open question from the study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_524365] e study at the inves tigational site. 
Information about AEs (and SAEs)  will be collected from the tim e the patient signs the informed 
consent for this study and takes  the first study dose of XADAGO  until the patient’s last follow-
up visit. The AE term should be rep orted in standard medical te rminology when possible. For 
each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset da te, resolution date, intensity, 
causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and w hether or not it caused the patient 
to discontinue the study. 
Intensity will be assessed accord ing to the following scale: 
Mild (awareness of sign or s ymptom, but easily tolerated)
Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with norm al activities)
Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activi ties)
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_49900] 11.2.2. 
An AE of severe 
intensity may not be considered serious. 
Protocol No. USWM-SA1-4001 12 October 2018 (Amendment 2; Final ) 
Confidential Information Page 32 of 108 11.4.1.  Non-Serious Adverse Event (AE) 
If a non-serious AE occurs for any patient after signing an inf ormed consent for this study and 
having taken XADAGO, the site sh ould record the AE in the patie nt’s source me dical record and 
eCRF in as real time as possibl e, but no later than 5 business
 days of observation or notification 
that such an event has occurred. T he patient’s medical record a nd eCRF should be completed 
with as much information as is a vailab
le at that time and the S ponsor will contact [CONTACT_524366] d regarding the non-serious AE . Additional instruction for 
entering non-serious AE data in th e eCRF is provided in the investigator site fil e (study binder). 
11.4.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
All SAEs (related and unrelated ) that occur for any patient aft er signing an inform
ed consent for 
this study and having taken 
XADAGO m
ust be recorded by [CONTACT_524367]. The 
site should record the SAE in the patient’s source medical reco rd within 24 hours of observation 
or notification
 that such an eve nt has occurred. The patient’s medical record should be completed 
with as muc
h information as is ava ilable at that tim
e with the knowledge that full clin
ical details 
may not be immediately available. The Sponsor w
ill cont act the site if ad
ditional information is 
required regarding the SAE. In addition, an SAE form located in the ISF binder must be 
completed and submitted to  (see
 Table 1 for details). 
All SAEs must be followed until th
ey resolve o r stabilize (i.
e., a new baseline has been 
established). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_524318]-up informa
tion necessary 
to facilitate a thorough understa nding of the experience and ju dgment regarding the relationship 
to XADAGO. Patients who disconti nue because of an SAE before st udy  com pletion will be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 7 days (±3 days) after discontinuation to determine i f the SAE has resolved, continues 
unabated, or has reached a new
 baseline.  
. 
 
 
Reports of congenital abnormalities/
birth defects are SAEs. Spo ntaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions withou t com
plications should not be 
handled as AEs. 
11.4.3. Preg
nancy and Lactation 
Pregnancy is not considered an A E. According to the XADAGO Pack age Insert, XADAGO is 
classified as Pregnancy Categor
y C. There are no adequate and w ell-controlled studies of 
XADAGO in pregnant women. XADAG O should be used during pregnanc y only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
It is not known whether this dr ug is present in hum an milk. Bec ause many drugs are excreted in 
human milk and because of the poten tial for seriou s adverse reactions in nursing infants from 
safinamide, a decision should be m ade whether to discontinue nu rsing or to discontinue drug, 
taking into account the importance of the drug to the m
other.

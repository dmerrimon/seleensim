I. Aims of the Study :  Describe the aims/objectives of the research and/or the project’s re search questions 
or hypotheses.  
 
The objectives of the study are to assess the feasibility, reach and preliminary efficacy of a brief 
intervention that trains Black men who have sex with men [referred to as Index] (a) to use home -based 
testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections a nd (b) promote home -based testing to their peers 
and sexual partners.   The study will be conducted in two phases:  Component Testing and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238].   
We have completed the phase to test the website components and refine the intervention content.  We 
are now requesting permission to conduct the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238].  
 
The overall aims of the study are:      
 
1) To examine feasibility of the Peer Mentor intervention to train BMSM to use and promote to peers 
and sex partners home -based HIV and STI self -testing kits.  Measures include: session attendance, 
facilitators and barriers to outreach, fidelity to PEER co mmunication tool.  
 
2) To examine the reach of the intervention compared to a control condition (use of the self -testing 
website only).  Measures include: number of peers and sex partners who use the website, characteristics 
of peers and sex partners (including sexual risk an d HIV/STI testing history).  
 
3) To determine preliminary effect sizes of the intervention on self -testing uptake.  We expect that a 
greater proportion of BMSM and their peers and sex partners in the Peer Mentor condition will request 
test kits, return specimens for STI testing, and re ceive results compared to those in the control 
condition.  
 
II. Background and Rationale : Explain why this study is being done.  Summarize briefly what is already 
known about the issue and reference previously published research, if relevant.

Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019   
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increase one's risk of HIV infection, are serious co -infections 
that affect HIV clinical outcomes, and remain a risk for individuals using PrEP.  Black men who have sex 
with men (BMSM) experience disparities along the  HIV care cascade, and there is evidence that STIs are 
one of the contributing factors.  In 2014, rates of chlamydia increased by 2.8% and gonorrhea by 5.1%. 
Moreover, in the past [ADDRESS_763883] been shown to be well accepted by [CONTACT_287511]. Therefore, use of self -testing is a potential approach 
through which to improve HIV and STI testing rates in M SM. Internet -based distribution (herein: web -
based) of STI self -test kits enables an individual to request sampling kits via a website, mail biological 
specimens (e.g. urethral swabs) to a laboratory for testing, and view test results through a web -based 
account. Web -based self -HIV oral testing enables an individual to request a test kit, collect an oral 
specimen, and receive results within [ADDRESS_763884] specimens for HIV and STIs (gonorr hea, chlamydia and syphilis) self -testing, and 
providing resources for linkage to HIV and STI treatment and PrEP services.  Study participants will utilize 
a secure website to request test kits (see details in Section III).   
Studies have also shown that BMSM report willingness to distribute self -testing kits to peers, yet 
barriers to peer referral include fear of peer reactions and anticipated negative effects on peer 
relationships. This intervention will also train BMSM to be  Peer Mentors to address these barriers and 
promote uptake of HIV and STI self -testing to peers and sex partners. Peers and sex partners will also use 
a secure website to request test kits and complete surveys about their behavior and satisfaction with 
hom e-based testing.  Using Peer Mentors is a potentially effective method to increase self -testing uptake 
as BMSM have rapport and trust with their peers and partners and can communicate in culturally 
relevant ways.  
The self -testing website will be based on the Iwantthekit.org (IWTK), a publicly -funded internet -
access self -testing service directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gaydos (Co -investigator) that has been providing self -testing 
kits to screen for gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomon iasis since [ADDRESS_763885] kits.  
JHSPH Information Technology, Advanced Technology Services (ATS) will develop, administer, and 
manage the web -based portion of the study.   This website will be hosted on a secure server maintained 
by [CONTACT_580905] – Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  For the component 
testing phase of this study, all information entered into the website will be deleted by [CONTACT_580906].  
 
III. Study  Design : 
Page [ADDRESS_763886] relate to your 
stated aims/objectives.   DETAILS WILL BE REQUESTED LATER.  If your study also involves analysis 
of existing data, please complete Section XI, “Secondary Data Analysis of Existing Data” in the last part 
of this research plan.   If your study ONLY involves analysis of existing data, please use the research 
plan template for secondary data analysis  (JHSPH IRB Research Plan for Secondary Data Analysis of 
Existing Data/Specimens )   
Component testing Phase:  The purpose of this phase is to get feedback on intervention materials 
and the study website.   
A trained facilitator will conduct two sessions with up to two groups of 8 -10 participants (Total 
n=20).   
 
Session 1:  Participants will be asked to view the website using their smart phones (if applicable) or 
via a study computer that will be provided if participants do not have smart phones or choose not to 
use their smartphone. Participants will navigate the  website, establish an account, and request kits.  
For the component testing phase, no self -test kits will be mailed to the participants.  Appendix [ADDRESS_763887], individuals will be asked to prov ide their full name, mailing address, 
cell phone number, and email address.  After creating their personal account, individuals will view 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_580892] -testing kits and descriptions of the infections that they are screening for.  
Individuals will re ad and acknowledge the MD State Names Based Reporting Law (for STIs) and 
indicate the clinic(s) that they intend to use to seek treatment for positive results.  Participants will 
also view an example of the STI results page and be asked to comment on the v isual appeal as well 
as whether the results are understandable (e.g. a positive test indicates an active gonorrhea 
infection that requires treatment with a course of antibiotics.)   
At the end of Session 1, the facilitator will explore potential facilitators and barriers of utilizing the 
self-testing website (such as, "How would you describe your experience with setting up an account, 
requesting kits, and viewing results? What would y ou change about the website?").  Participants will 
also be shown different designs for the coupons to be used to refer peers and sex partners to the 
website and asked about acceptability of the coupon design.  Finally, participants will be asked to 
spend t ime over the next week engaging in conversations with their peers and/or sex partners about 
the referral coupons and website and potential challenges or concerns about being referred to the 
website.  The peers won't be asked to log -onto the website and cre ate an account (because the 
website will not yet be "live",) but the Peer Mentor will have screen shots of different pages of the 
site to show their peers.  The session will be audio -recorded and observed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_580893] a focus on  suggestions for revisions to the intervention materials and website and 
use these results to refine the materials.  
 
Page 4 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  Session 2: Participants will be asked to share the results of their conversations with peers/sex 
partners, such as challenges to having the conversation, concerns of the peers/sex partners and 
reactions/suggestions to the referral coupon and screenshots.   The session will be audio -recorded 
and observed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_580894] a focus on suggestions for revisions to the 
intervention and website. These results will also be used to refine the materials.  
Results of the Component Testing:  12 participants completed the component testing phase.  
Suggestions to change the website included:  increase amount of information about STIs and how 
the testing works, add more visuals such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  Participants we re enthusiastic about the 
concept of being able to self -test at home and share this resources with peers and sex partners.   
 
Full Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]:  This will be a randomized controlled trial with data collection at baseline and 3 
month follow -up.  There will be two types of participants in the trial: Index and Network.  Index will 
be Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) who will b e  randomized to the experimental arm or 
control arm.  Index in both arms will be asked to recruit individuals from their personal social 
networks to enroll in the study via the study web -site (see mock -ups of Star website).    
Index will complete study visits (baseline, randomization session, 5 individual  sessions (if 
randomized to experimental condition), 3 month follow -up) at the Lighthouse Studies @ Peer Point 
community -based research clinic.   
Enrolled network members will complete baseline and 3 months follow -up study activities 
exclusively on -line via the Star website.   
Both Index (in both conditions) and Networks will have access to home -based HIV testing and 
specimen collection for gonorhea and chlamydia testing via the Star website.  
The experimental condition is a five session individual -based intervention that will train Index to be 
peer mentors and promote home -based testing.   
The control condition is one  individual -based session that will review information about HIV and 
STIs, home -based testing methods and how to use the website.   
 
B. Provide a sample size and a justification as to how you arrived at that number.  If you use screening 
procedures to arrive at a final sample  a table may be helpful.    
Component testing phase:  We plan to conduct the component testing with up to 20 participants 
who will be split into two groups.  We will hold one group and make revisions based upon this 
group's feedback then conduct the second group with the revised mate rials.   
 
Full Trial:  Index participants:  We plan to enroll n=140 Index participants.   
Network participants:  Each Index will be able to recruit up to six Network participants - therefore up 
to 720 Networks may enroll.  Based on estimates from one study of self -testing among MSM with 
option to refer peers (but were provided no training), we expect the average number of Index 
coupons distributed to the self -testing website will be to up to 6 peers/partners and that of these 
70% of the peers/partners referred will request a self -test kit.  For experimental condition this 
Page 5 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  results in (n=265) kits requested by [CONTACT_8699]/partners and (n=143) kits requested by [CONTACT_580907]/partners.     
 
IV. Participants : 
Describe the study participants and the population from which they will be drawn.  Specify the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  If you plan to include children,  note their ages  and whether you will include children in 
foster care . Note if the participants are particularly vulnerable in terms of cognitive limitations, education, 
legal migration status, incarceration, poverty, or some combination of factors.

NOTE : If you are recruiting participants or receiving, accessing, or using data from a U.S. health care 
provider, HIPAA  review  is likely  to be required .  If you plan to bring identifiable health information 
from a foreign country to a U.S. covered entity (e.g., lab at the Hopkins  SOM), HIPAA may be 
triggered. Check “yes” to the HIPAA question in the PHIRST application.  
 
V. Study Procedures :  
In this section, provide details of your procedures, particularly as they relate to human subjects. If this is a 
multi -center study, make the role of  JHSPH clear .  If the JHSPH will serve as data coordinating center , 
Page 6 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  indicate in the sections below which procedures JHSPH will not be performing.   Additional information 
regarding data coordinating centers is requested in a later section.   If your study will develop in phases, 
address each item below by [CONTACT_16303].  
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic – All study procedures are being conducted fully remotely.   
 
A. Recruitment Process : 
1. Describe how you will identify, approach, and inform potential participants about your study.   
Include details about who will perform these activities and what their qualifications are.  
Component testing:  Recruitment will be conducted using a variety of methods that focus on 
venues specific to BMSM.  We will post advertisements, both hard -copy and virtual, at venues in 
the Baltimore -metro area such as cafes, community -based organizations , and health clinics.   
 
Full Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]:  Index:  Recruitment will be conducted using a variety of methods that focus on 
venues specific to BMSM. Participants have expressed a preference to communicate with the 
study using text messages from the initial point of inquiry about screening including study 
reminders.  The study has a specific cell phone (Hopkins based cellular account) that is in the 
possession of a trained staff member while at the Lighthouse from 8am -[ADDRESS_763889] and on the Lighthouse Facebook account.   
 
Networks:  Index in both conditions will be e-mailed or mailed  invitations to recruit individuals 
from  their social networks (see Network Invitation).  Each invitation will have a unique code 
(herein referred to as StarCode) that will enable investigators to link the recruited networks to 
the Index.   
 
2. Address any privacy issues associated with recruitment.  If recruitment itself may put potential 
participants at risk (if study topic is sensitive, or study population may be stigmatized), explain how 
you will minimize these risks.  
Component Testing:  This study does involve potentially sensitive or personal information (such 
as sexual orientation) which could be associated with stigma for participants. Recruitment will 
therefore be conducted in a discrete manner. Flyers will be post ed in areas throughout Baltimore 
and will allow potentially interested individuals to tear off a phone number slip or write down 
the Lighthouse contact [CONTACT_69981] a discreet manner and call from a private location.  Trained 
recruiters will

Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  Full Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]:  Index:   This study does involve potentially sensitive or personal information (such 
as sexual orientation/behavior) which could be associated with stigma for participants. 
Recruitment will therefore be conducted in a discrete manner. Fl yers will be posted in areas 
throughout Baltimore and will allow potentially interested individuals to tear off a phone 
number slip or write down the Lighthouse contact [CONTACT_69981] a discreet manner and call from 
a private location.  Recruiters will be instructed to approach all Black male individuals who 
appear to be aged 17 or older and to explain, “if this does not apply to you please pass the flyer 
on to someone who you think may be interested”.  
 
Network:  The study does involve potentially sensitive or personal information sexual behavior 
and testing for sexually transmitted diseases.  The network invitation indicates that individuals 
can use the website to order home -based testing kits for HIV an d sexually transmitted infections.  
This content was suggested by [CONTACT_580910] a 
minimal amount of information is desired for their networks to be interested.  
 
B. Consent Process :   
1. Describe the following details  about obtaining informed consent from study participants.  If a 
screening process precedes study enrollment, also describe the consent for screening.  
a. Who will obtain informed consent, and their qualifications : 
Trained research assistants at the Lighthouse, all of whom have completed the CITI training 
and signed agreements of confidentiality, will obtain the informed consent.  
 
b. How, where, and when the consent discussion(s) will occur : 
Component Testing:  All participants will provide oral informed consent before being screened 
(see Screening survey). If they are deemed eligible for participation, they will provide written 
informed consent before completing the discussion sessions.  For the screening process, 
participants will have two options. They can either call the Lighthouse phone number and ask to 
be screened over the telephone, or they can walk in and be screened on -site. In either case, 
verbal consent is obtained before screening is conducted. The verbal consent includes a 
description of the s tudy procedures, an explanation of any risks and benefits of participation, a 
summary of privacy and the Lighthouse’s data protection procedures, and a reminder that 
participation is entirely voluntary.  The consent statement will be read to participants b efore 
screening. If they do not provide verbal affirmation of understanding and willingness to proceed, 
they will not be screened.  
Prior to participation in the discussion sessions, written informed consent will be obtained by a 
trained research assistant in a private office at the Lighthouse. The signed copy of the written 
consent will be filed in a locked filing cabinet and a second  unsigned copy will be provided to the 
participant for their records.

Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  Full Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]:  Assent will be collected remotely via phone appointment.  
For Index and Network participants aged 17:  The study is requesting a waiver of written 
informed consent (parental permission) but will obtain informed written assent from participants 
aged 17. A waiver is requested for multiple reasons.  The FDA has appr oved use of HIV oral rapid 
self-testing for individuals aged 17 and older.  Requiring parental consent could pose the risk of 
disclosure of sexual attraction, identity, or behavior which could result in harms to the 
participant such as loss of housing or f inancial support and experiences of stigma and 
discrimination.  Requiring parental consent “creates a de facto exclusion of youth who are not 
“out” to their parents about sexual behavior and/or identity.”  Finally, this behavioral health 
study poses no mor e than minimal risk to participants.  Possible risks are breach of 
confidentiality and the chance that answering questions about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_580895].  As risk for emotional distress from any of the questions is highly unlikely , risks 
for breaches of confidentiality are minimized by [CONTACT_580911].  
 
Index:   All participants will provide oral informed consent before being screened (see Screening 
survey).  The verbal consent includes a description of the study procedures, an explanation of 
any risks and benefits of participation, a summary of privacy a nd the Lighthouse’s data 
protection procedures, and a reminder that participation is entirely voluntary.  The consent 
statement will be read to participants before screening. If they do not provide verbal affirmation 
of understanding and willingness to pro ceed, they will not be screened.  Index participants 
determined to be eligible will provide written informed consent or assent prior to any baseline 
study activity.  Participants will meet with a trained Research Assistant in a private office.  The 
partici pant will be emailed  a copy of the consent to follow as the Research Assistant reads the 
consent/assent form to them. The participants will be given time at the end to ask questions 
prior to providing consent/assent.   
 
Networks:  Invited network members will be instructed to log -onto the STAR website using the 
Starcode on their invitation. The network member will be asked to indicate whether they are 
aged [ADDRESS_763890] them the i nvitation.  Then the 
network will view the written informed consent/assent to read.  Contact [CONTACT_580912].  Network 
members will indicate their consent on the website.   If a network does not provide consent, no 
other study activities will take place.   
 
c. The process you will use to determine whether a potential participant meets eligibility criteria : 
Component testing:  An approved screening survey will be administered to interested 
participants to determine eligibility for the study. A trained study staff (either over the phone 
or on -site at the Lighthouse in a private study room) will use an electronic questionnaire 
Page 9 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  which will include questions about all study eligibility criteria. The research assistant will 
input the participant’s answers into the computer -generated survey. Upon completion of the 
survey, an algorithm will automatically generate the results indicatin g whether or not the 
participant is eligible to continue in the study.  
 
Full Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]:  
Index:  An approved screening survey will be administered to interested Index participants to 
determine eligibility for the study. A trained study staff (either over the phone or on -site at 
the Lighthouse in a private study room) will use an electronic que stionnaire which will include 
questions about all study eligibility criteria. The research assistant will input the participant’s 
answers into the computer -generated survey. Upon completion of the survey, an algorithm 
will automatically generate the result s indicating whether or not the participant is eligible to 
continue in the study.  
Network:  Upon logging into the website - the invited network member is asked to indicate 
their date of birth which will be calculated by [CONTACT_198910].  Those who indicate that they are 
not 17 and older will be provided with information about the IWTK websi te and resources for 
sexual and reproductive care and no other study activities will proceed.    
 
d. Whether you will obtain a signature [CONTACT_16312] : 
Component testing:  An oral consent will be obtained from participants for the screening and 
a signature [CONTACT_580937].  
Full Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238]:  
Index:  An oral consent will be obtained from participants for the screening.  We request a 
waiver of signature [CONTACT_580938].  
Network:  We request a waiver of signature [CONTACT_580938].  Network participants 
will click on a button to acknowledge that they read the consent but will not need to provide 
an electronic signature.   
 
e. Whether you will obtain a legally authorized representative’s signature  [CONTACT_112355] : 
Adults who lack capacity to provide consent/assent will not be included in this study.   
 
f. If children are included in the study, if and how you will obtain assent from them : 
Component testing:  Individuals under the age of 18 will not be included.  
Full Trial:   
Index:  We will be including individuals aged 17 and older. An oral assent will be obtained 
from participants for the screening and a signature [CONTACT_580939].  
Page 10 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  Network:  Individuals will electronically indicate their assent on the website.   
 
g. If children are included in the study, how you will obtain permission for them to participate from 
their parent, legal guardian, or other legal authority (if child is in foster care or under government 
supervision) : 
Component testing:  N/A  
Full Trial:   
Index:  We are seeking a waiver of parental informed consent for individuals aged 17.  
Network:  We are seeking a waiver of parental informed consent for individuals aged 17.  
 
h. If you are seeking a waiver of informed consent or assent, the justification for this request : 
A waiver is requested for multiple reasons.  The FDA has approved use of HIV oral rapid self -
testing for individuals aged 17 and older.  Requiring parental consent could pose the risk of 
disclosure of sexual attraction, identity, or behavior which could result in harms to the 
participant such as loss of housing or financial support and experiences of stigma and 
discrimination.  Requiring parental con sent “creates a de facto exclusion of youth who are 
not “out” to their parents about sexual behavior and/or identity.”  Finally, this behavioral 
health study poses no more than minimal risk to participants.  Possible risks are breach of 
confidentiality and  the chance that answering questions about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_580896].  As risk for emotional distress from any of the questions is highly 
unlikely, risks for breaches of confidentiality are minimized by [CONTACT_580913] . 
 
i. Whether you will include a witness to the consent process and why : 
Index:  The research assistants will serve as witnesses to the consent/assent process to 
document that consent was obtained.  They will provide their signature [CONTACT_580940]/assent.  
Networks:  The date and time of the consent/assent will be digitally recorded by [CONTACT_198910].

C. Study Implementation :  
1. Describe the procedures that participants will undergo.  If complex, insert a table below to help the 
reviewer navigate.    
Component Testing will involve participation in two group -based sessions (scheduled one week 
apart).   
 
Session 1:  Participants will be asked to view the home -based testing website using their smart 
phones (if applicable) or on a provided study computer. They will be asked to navigate the 
website, establish an account, and go through the steps for requestin g kits.  These participants 
will also be asked to give their opi[INVESTIGATOR_580897]. Then we will ask participants to 
take time over the following week  to talk to their peers and/or sex partners about the website 
and show them these coupons so that they too can view the materials and provide comments.  
 
Session 2: Participants will be asked to share how the conversations went with peers/sex 
partners, including any challenges they experienced, acceptability of the coupon design and 
suggestions to improve the program.  
 
Both sessions will be audio recorded to allow researchers to listen to the discussions. The 
recordings will be kept on a secure computer with limited access.  
 
Full Trial:  See Star Participant Flow for an overview  
Index:   All Index proc edures are being conducted fully remotely via phone calls.  
[Baseline Visit]  The participant will be contact[CONTACT_580914] a time 
that was scheduled based upon the participant’s convenience .  Informed consent/assent will be 
obtained and a copy will be emailed  to the study participant.  The participant will be given the 
choice of completing the survey self -administered or by [CONTACT_17033].  If the participant 
chooses self -administered a link to the Qualtrics survey will be emailed.  If the participant 
chooses research assistant a dministered the research assistant will directly input responses into 
the Qualtrics link.  No names will appear on the survey data - only a unique code.  After the 
survey, locating information will be collected.  This information will be stored in an encrypted 
and password protected database that is separate from the survey data and the unique c ode.  
The participant will be provided with the date and time of the first group session.  The 
participant will receive $50 for completing the baseline visit.   
 
Page 12 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  [Randomization]  Index Participants will be randomized after the baseline survey and scheduled 
for their first session with the Health Educator .  All Index participants are eligible to be 
randomized up to 60 days after they complete their baseline visit.   
 
[Experimental condition]:  Peer Mentor Training is 5 individual sessions  with a 30 day check -in 
session.  This condition is focused on training Index with communication skills to promote HIV 
and STI testing and treatment and pre -exposure prophalaxis (PrEP) to individuals in their social 
networks.  Peer Mentor training is conducted by a one health educator.  The sessions are held 
once a week and will  last approximately 60 minutes.  The attached table outlines each session, 
objectives and main activities.  Participants will receive $25 for each session they attend.  
 
[Control condition]:  Is one individual -based session which will be conducted by [CONTACT_5583] a video 
of a health educator.  The session is designed to last up to 60 minutes.  The content of the session 
will include an overview about chlamydia, gonnorhea and HIV, home -based testing and specimen 
collection procedures and the Star website.  At the end of the session participants will be given 
six invitations labeled with  Starcodes and instructed to use them to invite friends, peers or sex 
partners from their social network to enroll into the study and access free home -based testing 
kits.  Participants will recei ve $25 for attending this session.   
 
[Home -based testing and specimen collection kits]:  All randomized Index and the networks that 
they invite and to the study will have access to a secure encrypted website that will enable them 
to request kits to test for HIV at home and collect specimens t hat can be mailed to a laboratory 
for testing for gonorhea and chlamydia.   The following are the steps a participant will follow 
when using the website:   
 
• You will set up a personal account on the study website that will have a user name [CONTACT_580941].  By [CONTACT_580915], 
the dates they were mailed to you, the results to gonorhea and  chlamydia testing and to enter 
the results of your HIV home -based test.  
• After you set up the account you will be able to view information about the different sexually 
transmitted infections and treatment and other resources.   
• The kits will be mailed to you within 3 -5 business days in a plain white envelope to the address 
that you want.  The envelope will not indicate anything about the contents or reference the 
study.  
• Instructions will be included in the envelope on how to use the different test kits.  
• For the HIV testing – you will collect an oral swab at your home, place it in a vial of solution and 
will read your result in 20 minutes.  
• For gonorrhea  and chlamydia testing you will place the specimens in a plastic tube that we 
provide and mail to the lab for testing.  Postage for this will be paid by [CONTACT_1758].  These 
specimens will only be labeled with a unique ID number and not your name.  The labora tory will

Maryland State names reporting:  This is a requirement for gonorrhea  and chlamydia tests.  
Participants who request these kits are required to read and acknowledge the Maryland State 
names reporting (see website mock up).  The HIV test result is not required to be reported to the 
State.   
 
[3 month follow -up visit]:  Three months from the date of the last group session, Index 
participants will be contact[CONTACT_580916] -person follow -up visit.   Networks will be sent 
an email with a message reminding them that it is time for their 3 m onth follow -up survey via the 
STAR website.   
 
2. Describe  the number and type of study visits and/or contacts between the study team and the 
participant , how long they will last, and where /how  they will take place . 
 Component testing:  Participants will take part in two group -based sessions on site at the 
Lighthouse. These will be scheduled one week apart. Each session could last up to two hours.  
 
Full trial:  
Index:   
Baseline visit:  up to 60 minutes - over phone or self -administered  
Intervention group sessions ( five) and check -in session if applicable:  up to 90 minutes - private 
group room at the Lighthouse Studies @ Peer Point  
3 month follow -up visit:  up to 60 minutes - private office in the Lighthouse Studies @ Peer Point

Index participant:  The duration of the study is up to 4 -6 months from screening to 3 month 
survey.  
Network participant:  The duration of the study is 3 months from enrollment to 3 month follow -
up.  
  
4.   Provide a brief data analysis plan and a description of variables to be derived.  
Page 14 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019   Component testing:  Audio recordings of the sessions will be transcribed.  For each transcript, 
document variables will be created including the session number, date, and characteristics of the 
participants (such as number of sessions attended).  We will read through each transcript and 
record situations in which participants described aspects of the website experience and referral 
coupons that they did and did not like and any suggestions for changes.  We will also document 
experiences participants had ta lking to their peers about self -testing, HIV, STIs and/or the 
referral coupon. The study team will evaluate the specific experiences and determine whether 
each describes a positive (i.e., easy) or negative (i.e., difficult) interaction with a peers or part ner 
on that topic. In addition, we will also identify the specific strategies participants used to 
overcome these difficulties, such as talking to their peers at a later time, if applicable (as not all 
participants may articulate a specific strategy).  We will create and apply codes about 
interactions (e.g. positive or negative); response/strategies used by [CONTACT_580917], situational 
characteristics (e.g. planned conversation versus spontaneous) and peer characteristics (e.g. 
relationship to participant, sex of peer, closeness of the relationship.) We will review and discuss 
the codes to create a summary about facilitators and barriers experienced by [CONTACT_580918].  
 
Full Trial:   
Aim 1:  Identify facilitators and barriers to peer outreach and fidelity to the PEER 
communication tool from the audio -recordings of Sessions 2 and 3. In Session 2 and 3, 
participants will report their experiences talking to peers about HIV and STI self - testing. Audio 
recordings of Sessions 2 and 3 will be transcribed and uploaded to MAXQDA, qualitative data 
management software that allows data organization, categorization, coding, text retrieval, 
comparison, and analysis.  For each transcript, document va riables will be created including the 
session number and date and characteristics of the participants (total attendance, how many 
described their experiences).   We will read through each transcript record situations in which 
participants described their e xperiences talking to their peers about self -testing, HIV, STIs and/or 
PrEP. As a team, we will evaluate each of the specific experiences and determine whether it 
describes a positive (i.e., easy) or negative (i.e., difficult) interaction with their peers on that 
topic. In addition, we will also identify the specific strategies participants used to overcome these 
difficulties, such as talking to their peers at a later time, if applicable (i.e., all participants may not 
describe a specific strategy).  MAXQDA  allows for the linking of text passages within a transcript, 
which will enable us to connect a particular challenge with a specific strategy.  
 
We will create and apply codes about interactions (e.g. positive or negative); response/strategies 
used by [CONTACT_580917], situational characteristics (e.g. planned conversation versus 
spontaneous) and peer characteristics (e.g. relationship to Index, sex  of peer, closeness of the 
relationship.   We will review and discuss the codes to create a summary about facilitators and 
barriers experienced by [CONTACT_580919].   Results from this analysis can be used to interpret 
the preliminary efficacy findings and  refine the PEER communication tool.  To assess fidelity to 
Page 15 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  the PEER communication tool, we will code examples of when Peer Mentors use each of the 
steps of the tool.  For example, if a Peer Mentor describes starting a conversation by [CONTACT_580920] a good time to talk – this will be coded as an example o f fidelity.  
 
Quantitative analysis of facilitators and barriers:  We will also tabulate the frequencies of 
facilitators and barriers identified by [CONTACT_580921] 3 month 
survey.   
 
Aim 2: We will compare the reach of the two conditions in terms of (i ) the number of peers 
recruited to access the self -testing website; and (ii) the characteristics of those recruited 
including sexual risk behavior, HIV/STI testing behavior, linkage to HIV/STI care, PrEP awareness 
and self -testing -related perceived norms. For the first part, as the number of peers/sex partners 
recruited by a mentor is a count, we will fit a model with log link with intervention condition as 
the only predictor to estimate the treatment -to-control ratio of mean number of peers recruited. 
For the second part, as the peers are clustered in the mentors who recruited them, we will use 
general estimating equations (GEE, which allow correlation among clustered units) to estimate 
treatment -control contrasts in each characteristic.  We will include se x as a biologic variable in 
these analyses.   
 
Aim 3: We will test and estimate differences (i) between intervention and control mentors and 
(ii) between intervention and control recruited peers in terms of: request of self -testing kits, 
return of specimens for STI testing, accessing of STI test result s, and posting of HIV oral test result 
(all binary variables). For the mentors, we will use tests of two sample proportions and simple 
logistic regression with the intervention condition as predictor. For the peers, we will fit GEE 
logistic models to allow  for correlation of outcome among clustered peers and will include sex as 
a biologic variable.  
 
Secondary Analysis  
Changes in knowledge and self -efficacy:  We will examine the changes in the continuous measure 
of Knowledge score using linear regression adjusting for baseline knowledge score and other 
covariates.  We will examine changes in self -efficacy by [CONTACT_2329] a Chi -square test for a difference 
between two proportions of efficacy score.  
 
Reasons for testing and future preferences:  We will tabulate participant responses and compare 
proportions by [CONTACT_580922] -square tests.

VII.  Risks of the Study : 
A. Describe the risks , discomforts , and inconveniences  associated with the study and its procedures, 
including physical, psychological, emotional, social, legal, or economic risks , and the risk of a breach of 
confidentiality .  These risks should be described in the consent documents . 
Participants may face the risk of breaches of confidentiality about their participation or any of 
the information that they share while involved in this project by [CONTACT_580931]. Participating in the group sessions may present as a bu rden to the subjects. Subjects 
will be informed prior to enrolling into the study about the level of time commitment involved. 
Risks for participants could also involve the potential for adverse psychological reactions from 
the voluntary disclosure of sero status and MSM behaviors or in response to the general sensitive 
nature of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_580899]. It is also possible that participants who have conversations 
with their peers about testing will be the target of negative verbal and physical reactions.   
Collecting specimens using the swabs may be uncomfortable.  Instructions are provided and you 
can contact [CONTACT_580932].  Participants may also experience stress and anxiety 
waiting for test results.  
 
B. Describe steps you will take to mitigate or minimize each of the risks described above.  Include a 
description of your efforts to arrange for care  or referral  for participants who may need it.  
  Throughout over [ADDRESS_763894] counseling.  
 
C. Describe the anticipated frequency and severity of the harms associated with the risks identified above; 
for example, if you are performing “x” test/assessment, or dispensing “y” drug, how often do you expect 
an “anticipated” adverse reaction to occur in a  study participant, and how severe do you expect that 
reaction to be?   
  We have a highly trained staff who has experience with handling sensitive and personal data, 
ensuring confidentiality, conducting testing and counseling for HIV and STIs, and managing 
emergency procedures.  We have developed numerous protocols to ensure th at risks are minimized 
during recruitment, assessment, and retention activities.  Staff are monitored by [CONTACT_580933] 25 of 34 
 
 
Research Plan for New Data Collection_ 6Nov2019  and the PI.  In addition, monthly supervision meetings are held with assessment and intervention 
staff to discuss quality assurance and human subjects’ protections.   
 
Audiorecordings  of survey visits and intervention sessions are also stored on a password protected 
computer. All data files/recordings are backed up daily on hard drives of IBM compatible computers 
and burned on a CD at the Lighthouse and protected by [CONTACT_2224] a passwo rd and encryption 
security system and firewall protection from the Internet.  All systems will be virus -protected with 
software updates weekly.  
 
D. Describe the research burden for participants, including time, inconvenience, out of  pocket costs, etc.  
  Component testing:  Participation will entail attendance at two sessions scheduled one week apart 
that will last up to [ADDRESS_763895] the capacity to take 
part in the group sessions.  
 
 Full Trial:   
 Index:  Participation will entail time for a brief screening call to determine eligibility, a baseline and [ADDRESS_763896] home -based testing kits - this process entails creating an account (less than 5 minutes), 
reading about the kits and requesting the kits.   
 
 Network: Participation will entail time to create an account on the study website (less than 5 
minutes), a baseline survey (approximately 20 minutes) and  the option to spend time on the study 
website to request home -based testing kits - this process entai ls, reading about the kits and 
requesting the kits.  Networks will also be asked to complete a 3 mont h follow -up survey 
(approximately 20 minutes).    
 
E. Describe how participant privacy, and if relevant – family privacy - will be protected during data 
collection if sensitive questions are included in interviews, or if study visits occur in the home setting.   
 
Component testing:  In the group sessions, participants will be asked to respect each other’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_580900].  
Participants will be requested to only use their first name [CONTACT_347774] e intervention sessions.

resources to local service and medical providers during the session which may benefit participants.  
 
B. Describe potential societal benefits likely to derive from the research, including value of knowledge 
learned.  
Disparities in HIV and STI rates persist among BMSM. Lack awareness of serostatus and delayed 
treatment are factors that contribute to this public health problem. Culturally -tailored, sustainable 
interventions are urgently needed to engage BMSM and their p eers/sex partners in uptake of testing 
and subsequent linkage to clinical and prevention services. The combination of Peer Mentors and 
self-testing technology in a behavioral intervention will facilitate testing for hard -to-reach, at -risk 
individuals who a re disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_580934].

 During the consent process, study staff will remind participants to report any physical or social harm 
related to study participation to the study staff immediately so that participants may receive 
counseling or other assistance.  When an unanticipated pr oblem or adverse event is reported to the 
study staff, the staff documents the details of the event and refers the participant to medical, 
psychological or social services as deemed appropriate. If deemed necessary by [CONTACT_473], 
action may be taken  to terminate the participant from the study.  The IRB and NIMH will be notified 
of all study -related unanticipated problems or adverse events.  
 
NOTE: The IRB does not require PROMPT reporting of  all AEs, only those that are unanticipated, 
pose risk of harm to participants or others, and are related to the study .  Anticipated AEs

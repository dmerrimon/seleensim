2. Caregiver burden (eg, caregiver missed work days, subject absence from day care) for subjects with 
medically attended LRTI caused by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-confirmed RSV
STUDY DESIGN   
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 2b study is a randomized, double-b lind, placebo-controlled, si ngle-dose study to 
determine if MEDI8897 will be efficacious in reducing medically attended RSV-confirmed LRTI in healthy preterm infants entering their first RSV season. The population to be enrolled is healthy preterm infants born between 29 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days GA who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or other local or national guidelines. These infants will not be 
receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo comparator group for the determination of efficacy and the safety profile. A total of 1,500 infants will be randomized 2:1 to receive a  mg IM dose of MEDI8897 (N = 
1000) or placebo (N = 500). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_316743] (ie, ≤3 months, > 3 – ≤6 months, > 6 
months). Enrollment of infants > 6 months of age will be limited to approximately 500. All infants will be 
followed for approximately 360 days after dosing.
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical attention for a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (inpatient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI. Subjects who have a primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316667] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or who seek outpatient medical attention, including ER visits for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], will be assessed for RSV 
by [CONTACT_316744][INVESTIGATOR_316668]. Testing for 
RSV will be performed centrally using the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-approved 
and Conformité Européenne or European Conformity (CE) - marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR 
assay (Lyra RSV + human metapneumovirus [hMPV] Assay, Quidel, San Diego, CA www.quidel.com ). A 
diagnosis of RSV LRTI requires having a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316669]-PCR.
Subjects with signs of LRTI must have documented physical exam findings of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or 
wheeze AND any of the following:
• Increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_316670] (age < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; age 2–6 months, ≥50 breaths/min; 
age > 6 months – 2 years, ≥40 breaths/min) OR
• Hypoxemia (in room air: oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1800 meters or < 92% at altitudes 
> 1800 meters), OR
• Clinical signs of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnea, 
nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) or dehydration secondary to inadequate oral intake due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (need for intravenous fluid).
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION   
This study will be conducted in he althy pr eterm infants born between [ADDRESS_389587], DOSAGE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION   
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of MEDI8897  mg IM) or placebo.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
General Considerations:
Tabular summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_316745]. Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. Additional details of statistical analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Population is defined as all subjects who are randomized. Subjects will be included 
in the treatment group corresponding to their randomized treatment. All analyses, with the exception of 
safety, will be performed on the ITT Population.
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
[ADDRESS_389588]. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the treatment actually received. All safety analyses will be performed on the As-treated Population.
Sample size:
The sample size of 1,500 is necessary based on advice from the US FDA requesting that 1,000 preterm 
infants be exposed to MEDI8897 in this Phase 2b study. This sample size has approximately 99% power to 
detect 70% relative risk reduction, assuming a p lacebo group medically attended RSV LRTI incidence of 
8%. Power calculations are based on Poisson regression model with robust variance (Zou, 2004) comparing MEDI8897  versus placebo, with 2-sided significance level of α = 0.05.
• The 70% relative risk reduction assumption is based on a placebo-controlled study in Native American 
infants in which there was 87% relative reduction in the incidence of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (11.3% placebo; 1.5% motavizumab; p < 0.001) and 71% relative reduction in the incidence of outpatient RSV 
LRTI (10.0% placebo; 2.9% motavizumab; p < 0.001) in infants who received motavizumab prophylaxis
(O’Brien et al, 2015).
In order to evaluate risk, a sample size of 1,000 subjects exposed to MEDI8897 will provide a 90% 
probability of observing at least one adverse event (AE) if the true event rate is 0.2%; if no AEs are observed, this study provides 95% confidence that the true event rate is < 0.3%.
Statistical Analyses:
There are two planned analyses for this study: the primary analysis and the final analysis. The primary 
analysis will be conducted after all randomized sub jects have completed follow-up through the 5-month RSV 
season (ie, Day 151 visit) and will be the primary analysis for which the study is designed to assess efficacy. 
For the primary analysis, all efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), ADA, and safety data collected through at 
least Day [ADDRESS_389589] visit of the study (ie, Day 361). Since efficacy endpoints are collected in the time interval from randomization up to Day 151, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population. 
The primary and secondary efficacy hypotheses will be assessed in the primary analysis by a hierarchical 
order. That is, the secondary hypothesis will be tested at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_389590] on the primary efficacy endpoint is demonstrated at the significance level of 2-sided 0.05. With that, 
the overall Type I error is controlled at 0.05. Therefore, no further multiplicity adjustment is necessary.
Primary Endpoint Analysis:
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The incidence of RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) during [ADDRESS_389591] results (performed centrally via RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. For subjects with multiple medically attended RSV LRTI events, only the first occurrence will be used in the primary analysis.
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the ITT Population. LRTI caused by [CONTACT_316746]. For subjects who do not have an RSV LRTI prior to disc ontinuation from participation, their event status will be 
imputed assuming the observed placebo RSV LRTI r ate. This will be implemented by [CONTACT_316747]. A Poisson regression model with robust variance will be used as the primary efficacy analysis model to compare the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI between MEDI8897 and placebo, including treatment group, age at the time of randomization (ie, ≤ 3 months, > 3 – ≤ 6 months, > 6 months), and dichotomous temperate (northern and 
southern) hemispheres as covariates. In addition, the 2-sided p-value and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI on 
the relative risk will be provided from the model. Relative risk reduction is defined as (1 - Pn/Ps) where Pn is the incidence of RSV LRTI during 5 months of the RSV season in the MEDI8897 group and Ps is the incidence of RSV LRTI during 5 months of the RSV season in the placebo group generated by [CONTACT_10994].Statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-sided p-value is ≤0.05.
Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
5 of 66 Template 16.2A CMH (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel) approach stratified by [CONTACT_316748] (ie, ≤ 3 months, > 3 – ≤ 6 months, > 6 months) will be used to compare the incidence of RSV 
LRTI during [ADDRESS_389592] RSV LRTI may be performed as a supplementary analysis.
An analysis may also include all RSV positive LRTI endpoints, using results from either the central lab or 
local lab.
Different approaches to handle missing data (ie, early discontinuation and no RSV LRTI prior to 
discontinuation) may be considered for sensitivity analyses. Additional analyses or subgroup summaries may 
be performed to adjust duration of efficacy follow-up and/or other possible confounding factors. These analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Secondary Endpoint Analyses:
Efficacy
The incidence of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316671] [ADDRESS_389593] on RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Following a hierarchical testing procedure, the secondary efficacy endpoint is tested at the significance level of 2-sided 0.05 if the primary analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint has achieved statistical significance at the level of 2-sided 0.05.
Safety
Safety of MEDI8897 will primarily be assessed by [CONTACT_316749]-emergent AEs and SAEs. 
Adverse events will be graded according to the current version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) where applicable for pediatric assessments. Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) and the type, incidence, severity and relationship to study investigational product will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Other safety assessments will include:
• Occurrence of AESIs to include targeted AEs of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), 
thrombocytopenia, and immune complex disease (eg, vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerulonephritis) following investigational product administration.
• Occurrence of NOCDs following investigational product administration
Pharmacokinetics Analysis
Following a single dose of MEDI8897, individual MEDI8897 serum concentration data will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_316750]. Terminal phase half-life (t 1/2) will be estimated using non-
compartmental analysis, if data permit.
Anti-drug Antibody Analysis
The incidence of ADA to MEDI8897 will be assessed and summarized by [CONTACT_316751]. The ADA titer will be listed by [CONTACT_316752]. 
The impact of ADA on PK and association with TEAEs and TESAEs will be assessed.
Exploratory Endpoint Analyses:
The magnitude of HRU (eg, number of admissions to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316672]; number of 
subjects who require respi[INVESTIGATOR_316673]; number and typesof outpatient visits, eg, ER, urgent care, outpatient clinic; and number of prescription and OTC medications and duration of use) will be summarized overall by [CONTACT_1570],  and for the following subgroups:subjects with at least one medically attended LRTI caused by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-confirmed RSV, subjects with medically attended LRTI not caused by [CONTACT_4510], and  subjects without medically attended LRTI.
Caregiver burden (eg, caregiver missed work days, subject absence from day care) for subjects with 
medically attended LRTI caused by [CONTACT_937]-PCR-confirmed RSV will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].

12 of 66 Template 16.21 INTRODUCTION
Prevention of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) illnesses in all infants is a major public health 
priority. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_316674], there is no safe 
and effective vaccine for these children. As there is no approved RSV prophylaxis for the broader population of healthy infants and no treatment for RSV, the current management for 
these patients when they acquire serious RSV illness is supportive care. 
Palivizumab (Synagis
®) is the only approved agent for RSV prophylaxis, and its use is 
restricted to high-risk children (preterm infants ≤ 35 weeks gestational age [wGA], children 
with chronic lung disease [CLD] of prem aturity, and childre n with hemodynamically 
significant congenital heart disease [CHD]). As its terminal half-life (t 1/2) is approximately [ADDRESS_389605] be administered monthly (as an intramuscular [IM] injection) throughout the RSV season, making its use in a broader infant population unfeasible. In addition, due to the cost, further restrictio ns have been implemented by [CONTACT_316753]. For example, in the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]), per the 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, palivizumab is not recommended for 
healthy preterm infants ≥ 29 wGA ( American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on 
Infectious Diseases, 2014 ).
1.[ADDRESS_389606] common cause of lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_316675], resulting in annual epi[INVESTIGATOR_316676] (Hall et al, 2009; Hall, 
2012 ; Nair et al, 2010 ; Shay et al, 1999 ; Stockman et al, 2012 ). All children, including 
healthy term infants, are at risk for severe RSV lower resp iratory illness with primary 
infection during infancy. Ninety percent of children are infected with RSV in the first 2 years of life and up to 40% will have lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (LRTI) (Greenough et al, 
2001 ; Meissner, 2003 ; Parrott et al, 1973 ). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_316677], characterized 
predominantly as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, represents a serious illness with acute and perhaps long-term consequences to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_316678] (Blanken et 
al, 2013 ). It is estimated that RSV causes up to 90% of childhood bronchiolitis and up to 
40% of pediatric pneumonias ( Hall, 2001 ). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_316679] < 1 year of age for any reason in the years 
between 1997 and 1999 ( Leader et al, 2002 ).
Although hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316680], a 
large percentage of the healthcare burden from RSV occurs outside the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Carroll et al, 
2008 ; Hall et al, 2009 ; Hall, 2012 ; Paramore et al, 2010 ) such that office visits and 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
13 of 66 Template 16.2emergency department visits are more frequent than subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], especially in 
healthy infants. In children < 5 years of age in the [LOCATION_003], RSV is estimated to cause 1 in 13 private practice visits, 1 in 38 emergency department visits, and 1 in 334 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (Hall, 2012 ). Another study demonstrated that in otherwise healthy term infants < 12 months 
of age in a Medicaid program (1995-2003), 13.3% had an outpatient visit, 6.2% had an 
emergency department visit, and 5.5% were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316681] (Carroll et al, 
2008 ). Additionally, Paramore and colleagues reported high rates of outpatient RSV LRTI 
among infants and young children, ranging from 157.5 to 252.0 per 1000 children < 1 year of age ( Paramore et al, 2010 ). This study also showed that outpatient RSV LRTI rates for late 
preterm (33 to 36 wGA) infants ranged from 183.3 to 245.7 per 1000 infants, with rates for full-term infants ranging from 128.8 to 171.3 per 1000 infants.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316682]; the rates for infants within the first year of life were invariably the highest, 
19 to 22 per 1,000 children, consistent with the [LOCATION_003] and Canadian data ( Jansen et al, 2007 ; 
van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al, 2005 ; Weigl et al, 2001 ). In addition, RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316683] 0 to 3 years of age were found to be 4 and 9 times greater than the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316684], respectively.
Similarly, high rates of RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316685] < 6 
months of age, in which the incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of severe LRTI was 26.2
(23.6-29.0) per 1000 in those born at ≥ 36 wGA, 125.0 (95.3-159.9) per 1000 in those born at
32 - 35 wGA, and 142.3 (89.5-212.0) per 1000 in those born at < 32 wGA (Madhi et al, 
2006 ).
1.2 MEDI8897 Background
MEDI8897 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for 
details. 
MEDI8897 is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 κ) monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) directed against the pref usion conformation of the RSV F protein. The 
antibody has been engineered with a triple amino acid substitution (YTE; M257Y/S259T/T261E [M252Y/S254T/T256E, according to the European Union numbering 
system]) in the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region to prolong the t
1/2, which is expected to 
provide protection from serious RSV disease for the duration of the RSV season. MEDI8897
neutralizes RSV by [CONTACT_316754] F protein at a site distinct from that bound by [CONTACT_316755]. In preclinical studies, MEDI8897 was > 150-fold more

disease based on an improvement in potency and the extended t
1/2that is expected to support 
once-per-RSV-season dosing.
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience
The potential clinical ut ility of MED I8897 and dose predictions of the antibody were 
evaluated in the cotton rat model of RSV infection. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of 1G7, the non-YTE version of MEDI8897, was evaluated in cotton rats following a single IM dose of 0.25 to 3.0 mg/kg. Serum concentrations increased dose proportionally across the entire dose range with a terminal-phase elimination t
1/2of approximately 1 day. In cotton rats, a serum 
concentration of 6.8 μg/mL resulted in a 3-log reduction in lung RSV titers and was 
identified as the target serum concentrati on to maintain in chil dren to provide antiviral 
activity agai nst RSV over a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5-month RSV season.
The YTE amino acid substitutions introduced into MEDI8897 do not impact RSV 
neutralizing activity when comp ared to the parental mAb, 1G7. MEDI8897/1G7 showed 
potent antiviral activity in vitro against RSV A and B laboratory strains, clinical isolates, as 
well as palivizumab-resistant viruses. MEDI8897/1G7 was > 150- fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro against the laboratory strains and > 50-fold more potent than palivizumab against clinical isolates based on the median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50). 
Toxicity, toxicokinetics (TK) and imm unogenicity of MEDI8897 were evaluated in a G ood 
Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant repeat-dose intravenous (IV) and IM toxicology study 
conducted in cynomolgus m onkeys. Cynomolgus monkeys re present a pharmacologically 
relevant model for nonclinical safety assessment based on similar binding of MEDI8897 to cynomolgus monkey neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) compared to human FcRn. Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys indicate that there is no evidence of MEDI8897 toxicity in these animal models. Once weekly IV or IM administration (5 doses total) of MEDI8897 to 
monkeys, up to and including 300 mg/kg IV or [ADDRESS_389608]-level (NOAEL) was considered to be 300 mg/kg IV and 300 mg IM. No anti-drug antibody (ADA) was detected in any of the monkeys during the treatment phase. During the recovery phase, 4 of 12 animals treated with MEDI8897 and 0 of 6 control animals were

cryosections of a full panel of adult and a selected panel of juvenile, neonatal, and fetal human tissues showed no staining of any tissues, as expected, given the target for MEDI8897 is a non-endogenous viral-specific target. Overall,  data from nonclinical studies do not reveal 
any MEDI8897-related safety concerns.

human (FTIH) study (Study D5290C00001; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in healthy adult volunteers was comp leted in June 2015, and the second study, a Phase 1b/2a 
study (D5290C00002; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), in healthy preterm infants of 32-35 wGA has completed enrollment and dosing; follow-up is ongoing.
The FTIH study, D5290C00001, was a Phas e 1a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose-escalation study to evalu ate the safety and tolerability, PK, and ADA for 
MEDI8897 when administered as a single fixed dose of 300, 1000, or 3000 mg IV, or 100 or 
300 mg IM to healthy adult subjects. Subjects completed 1 year of follow-up in June 2015. A 
total of 136 subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of MEDI8897 (6 subjects each at doses of 300 mg IV, 1,000 mg IV, 3,000 mg IV, and 100 mg IM; 78 subjects at 300 mg IM) or placebo (34 subjects). The mean t
1/2of MEDI8897 ranged from 85 to 117 
days across the IV and IM dose groups, and model-estimated systemic bioavailability after IM administration was 87%. The predicted 3- to 4-fold increase in the t
1/2of MEDI8897 
compared to a standard immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody was confirmed. In healthy adults, the safety profile of MEDI8897 was favorable, with similar proportions of adverse events 
(AEs) reported in placebo (21/34; 61.8%) and MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (64/102; 62.7%). Two 
SAEs (gunshot wound and appendicitis) were reported in 2 MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. AEs judged to be related to study drug were reported in 29.4% (10/34) of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 17.6% (18/102) of MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The most frequently reported AEs in the MEDI8897 cohorts were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (URTI; 19/102; 18.6%), headache 
(9/102; 8.8%), urinary tract infection (UTI; 6/102; 5.9%); and dermatitis contact,musculoskeletal pain, nausea and vomiting (5/ 102, 4.9% each). All other AEs occurred in [ADDRESS_389611]
(AESI). One event of Type 2 diabetes was reported as a new onset chronic disease (NOCD)in the placebo group. There were no deaths. No safety signals in this healthy adult population were observed. Post-baseline ADA was detected in a similar proportion of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (5/33, 15.2%) and MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (14/102, 13.7%), and the presence and titer of ADA

profile for MEDI8897.
The Phase 1b/2a first-in-pediatric study (D5290C00002) is an ongoing, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability, PK and ADA for MEDI8897 in healthy preterm infants of 32 - 35 wGA who
would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics 
Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2014 ) or any other local or national recommending 
bodies’ guidelines. This study population was selected based on advice from the Un ited 
States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) to perform initial clinical evaluations of MEDI8897 in a population where the benefit of RSV prophylaxis has been proven.
Enrolment and dosing have been completed in 89 infants from sites in the [LOCATION_002], Chile, 
and South Africa. Infants were randomized and received a single IM dose of 10 mg, 25 mg, or
50 mg MEDI8897 (N = 71) or placebo (N = 18). All subjects are being followed for [ADDRESS_389613] interim analysis was conducted 30 days (October 2015) after the last subject was dosed to evaluate MEDI8897 serum concentrations, ADA, and safety. At the interim analysis, 1 infant in the placebo group had been withdrawn from the study because the mother could no longer bring the infant in for follow-up visits. At study entry, infants had a mean age (± SD) and mean weight (± SD)  of 6.95 (± 2.63) months and 7.31 (± 1.84) kg in 
the placebo group and 6.50 (± 2.64) months and 6.82 (± 1.90) kg in the MEDI8897 group. MEDI8897 serum concentrations were consistent with the expected extended t
1/2in infants. 
Model-based simulations predict the MEDI8897 median t ½ to range from 83 to 94 days for 
the 50 mg dose in infants with normal clearance. In healthy preterm infants the safety profile of MEDI8897 was favorable with similar proportions of AEs reported in the placebo (12/18, 66.7%) and MEDI8897 (51/71, 71.8%) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. No safety signals were observed with the ascending dose levels. There was 1 serious adverse event (SAE) that occurred in an infant who received 25 mg of MEDI8897. The i nfant was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316686], upon 
subsequent testing, was found to be negative for RSV by [CONTACT_316756]-

[ADDRESS_389614] frequently  reported AEs were URTI (placebo, 7/18, 38.9%; 
MEDI8897 27/71, 38%), anemia (placebo 5/18, 27.8%; MEDI8897, 9/71, 12.7%), cough (placebo 2/18, 11.1%; MEDI8897, 9/71, 12.7%), pyrexia (placebo 0, MEDI8897, 8/71,11.3%), bronchiolitis (placebo 5.6%, MEDI8897 7/71, 9.9%), and rhinorrhea (placebo, 1/18, 5.6%; MEDI8897 7/71, 9.9%). There were no AESIs, NOCDs, or deaths. ADA levels at the 30-day interim analysis were similar for placebo and MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with rates of 12.5% (2/18) and 4.4% (3/71) for placebo and MEDI8897 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], respectively.

50 years of attempted vaccine development and extensive ongoing work (www.clinicaltrials.gov ), there is not yet a safe and effective vaccine. While RSV prevention 
exists in the form of a specific RSV IgG (Synagis®, palivizumab) requiring [ADDRESS_389617] morbidity and mortality 
from RSV (preterm infants ≤ 35 wGA, children with CLD of prematurity, and children with 
hemodynamically significant CHD). In addition, due to the cost of prophylaxis, further restrictions have been implemented by [CONTACT_316757]. For example, 
in the [LOCATION_003], per the AAP guidelines, palivizumab is not recommended for healthy preterminfants ≥ [ADDRESS_389618] all infants from RSV 
disease based on improved potency and an extended t
1/2, which is expected to support once-
per-RSV-season dosing.
Based on advice from the US FDA, this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_316687]8897 will be conducted in healthy preterm infants who are not eligible to receive palivizumab according to AAP or other local guidelines. After 500 preterm infants are dosed with MEDI8897, a benefit: risk assessment will be conducted, and if favorable, a Phase 3 study in healthy infants > 35 wGA can be init iated.

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of the Study
3.1.1 Overview ……….
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 2b study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose 
study to determine if MEDI8897 will be efficacious in reducing medically attended RSV-confirmed LRTI in healthy preterm infants entering their first RSV season. The population to be  enrolled is healthy preterm infants born between 29 weeks 0 days and 
34 weeks 6 days GA who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the AAP or other local or national guidelines. These infants will not be receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo comparator group for the determination of efficacy and the safety profile. A total of 
1,500 infants will be randomized 2:1 to receive a  mg IM dose of MEDI8897 (N = 1000) 
or placebo (N = 500; see Figure 3.1.1-1 ). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_316758] (ie, ≤ 3 months, > 3 – ≤6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of infants > 
6 months of age will be limited to approximately 500. Based on preclinical efficacy results in the cotton rat and pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation, the predicted efficacious dose in infants is a single fixed IM dose of  mg. All infants will be followed for 
approximately 360 days after dosing. 
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical
attention for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (inpatient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI. Subjects who have a primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], arespi[INVESTIGATOR_316667] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, or who seek outpatient medical attention,
including ER visits for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], will be assessed for RSV by [CONTACT_316759][INVESTIGATOR_316690]. Testing for RSV will

Conformity (CE) - marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay (Lyra RSV + human metapneumovirus [hMPV] Assay, Quidel, San Diego, CA www.quidel.com ). A diagnosis of
RSV LRTI requires having a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316669]-PCR.
Subjects with signs of LRTI must have documented physical exam findings of rhonchi, rales, 
crackles, or wheeze AND any of the following:
•Increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_316670] (age < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; age 2–6 months, ≥50
breaths/min; age > 6 months – 2 years, ≥40 breaths/min) OR
•Hypoxemia (in room air - oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1800 meters or < 92% 
at altitudes > 1800 meters), OR 
•Clinical signs of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new 
onset apnea, nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) 
or dehydration secondary to inadequate oral intake due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (need for 
intravenous fluid).

22 of 66 Template 16.23.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
3.2.1 Dose Rationale
In preclinical cotton rat efficacy studies, MEDI8897 serum concentrations of 6.8 μg/mL were 
shown to result in a 3-log decrease in RSV titers in cotton rat l ungs. A population PK model 
developed using PK data from the Phase 1a study in healthy adults and Day 30 interim data 
from the Phase 1b/2a study in healthy preterm infants was used to simulate PK profiles in the 
Phase 2b population. PK profiles were simulated in 1,000 infants for each of the following populations: preterm infant s (29-35 weeks GA) at birth, full-te rm infants at birth, and full-
term infants at 12 months of age. A single mg fixed IM dose of MEDI8897 is predicted tobe the likely efficacious dose that will sustain serum concentrations above the target level of 6.8 μg/mL in the majority of infants over th e entire RSV seas on and provide complete 
protection for infants entering their first RSV season.
3.2.2 Rationale for Study Population
The population of healthy preterm infants born between 29 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 
days GA and who do not meet AAP criteria ( American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on 
Infectious Diseases, 2014 ) to receive palivizumab was selected based on advice from the US 
FDA. The US FDA made the recommendation based on the higher risk of serious RSV 
disease in this population compared to older GA infants and the proven benefit shown in 
previous studies of RSV prophylaxis in this preterm population. In addition, since this population would not be eligible to receive palivizumab (per AAP or other local or national 
guidelines), a study conducted with a placebo control group is acceptable and protective efficacy can be directly evaluated.
3.2.[ADDRESS_389620] 
serious illnesses, will also be evaluated. Additionally, descriptive statistics of the serum concentrations of MEDI8897 at selected time points will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint and to confirm that serum concentra tions are maintained above the target value of 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
23 of 66 Template 16.26.8 μg/mL for 5 months. The serum concentration data will be used to characterize the PK of 
MEDI8897 in infants using a population PK approach. For infants who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316691], an additional se rum sample for measurement of MEDI8897 
concentration and ADA will be obtained around the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Exposure-
response analysis will be performed to relate MEDI8897 serum concentrations and efficacy 
endpoints (LRTI including RSV-associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). 
To determine the duration of MEDI8897 serum levels post dosing and to correlate with the 
development of ADA, serum concentrations w ill be measured at [ADDRESS_389621] LRTI.

of the above time-limited criteria (eg, acute illness) may be reconsidered for enrollment once the condition has resolved as long as the subject continues to meet all other entry criteria.
4.1.[ADDRESS_389624] Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identif ication (SID) number w ill be 
assigned by a central system (eg, an interactive web response system [IWRS]), and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study  eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The 
SID number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation, if applicable. 
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria and/or are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not 
be randomized or administered investigational product. The investigator must consult with the sponsor before a subject who has failed screening may be considered for rescreening.
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects are at any time free to withdraw from  the study (investigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawal of consent). The caregivers 
of such subjects will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, the subject will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_2413]. Adverse events will be followed up. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further study visits or data collection should take pl ace.

Samples Obtained for Future Research
Samples obtained, which may be used for future research, will be labeled with a sample 
identification number. If the subject withdra ws consent for participating in the future 
research, the sponsor will locate the subject’s sample and destroy it after protocol specified analyses are completed. 
If the subject consents to have his/her samples used for future research, this additional 
research may not start immediately and may star t at any time during the storage period. The 
subject’s sample(s) will be stored by [CONTACT_316760] a secure central laboratory. The subject’s samples will not be kept for more than [ADDRESS_389627] chooses not to allow his/her study samples to be used for future res earch, the samples will be destroyed by [CONTACT_316761].

4.3.1 Efficacy ……….
[IP_ADDRESS] Lower Respi[INVESTIGATOR_316698]. All subjects seeking medical 
attention for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (defined as new onset events indicating a change from the 
child’s baseline medical status referable to the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]) will be evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI ( Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 ). These events may occur in the inpatient or 
outpatient setting. Subjects who have a primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], or who have a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316667] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or who seek outpatient medical 
attention, including ER visits, for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316699]. Testing for R SV will be performed centrally using the FDA-
approved and CE-marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay (Lyra RSV + hMPV 
Assay, Quidel, San Diego, CA www.quidel.com ). A diagnosis of RSV LRTI requires having 
a respi[INVESTIGATOR_316669]-PCR.
To meet the protocol-specified criteria for LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI must have 
documented physical exam findings of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheeze AND any of the following:
• Increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_316670] (age: < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; 2–6 months, ≥ 50 
breaths/min; > 6 months – 2 years, ≥40 breaths/min), OR
• Hypoxemia (in room air - oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1800 meters or < 92% 
at altitudes > 1800 meters), OR
• Clinical signs of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new 
onset apnea, nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) 
or dehydration secondary to inadequate oral intake due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (need for 
intravenous fluid).

Subjects will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive a  mg IM dose of MEDI8897 (N = 
1,000) or placebo (N = 500). Rando mization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_316772] (ie, ≤3 
months, > 3 – ≤6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of infants > 6 months of age will be 
limited to approximately 500.
The procedure for using IWRS is as follows:
• The investigator or designee contacts the IWRS and provides the SID number and 
subject’s baseline characteristic(s) used to verify that it is the same subject
• Placebo (provided by [CONTACT_3725]) or a vial from a MEDI8897 kit will be assigned to the subject
• Confirmation of this information is sent to the unblinded investigational product manager 
who prepares the investigational product to be dispensed to the subject per the response 
system and records the appropriate information in the investigational product 
accountability log
Investigational product (MEDI8897 or placebo) must be administered the same day the 
investigational product is assigned. Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of the 
investigational product vial to administration should not exceed [ADDRESS_389643]/legal representative nor any of the investigator or site staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E9). In the event that treatment allocation for 
a subject becomes known to the investigator or other blinded study staff involved in the 
management of study subjects, the sponsor must be notified immediately . If the treatment 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
[ADDRESS_389644] notify the sponsor immediately . The site will maintain a written plan 
detailing which staff members are blinded/unblinded and the process of investigational product administration used to maintain the blind.
4.6.3 Methods for Unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation are contained in the IWRS manual. In general, unblinding 
should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having received investigational product. In the majority of cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same wheth er or not investigational product was received 
by [CONTACT_423]. If this was the case, the i nvestigational product allocation should not be 
unblinded.
MedImmune retains the right to unblind the treatment allocation for SAEs that are 
unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that 
potentially require expedited report ing to regulatory authorities.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding for Primary Analysis Purposes 
The primary analysis will be conducted when all randomized subjects have completed the
Day 151 visit and will include all efficacy d ata for all ra ndomized subjects. All efficacy and 
safety data collected up to the Day 151 visit and available safety data beyond Day 151 at the time of that data cut-off date will be included in the primary analysis. Efficacy and safety for 
MEDI8897 will be evaluated in this unblinded analysis. 
Sponsor personnel will be unblinded at this primary analysis. Study site personnel and the 
subjects’ parent(s)/legal guardian will remain blinded to the treatment assignment of individual subjects until the last subject comple tes the study and the final database is locked.
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s)
The Investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the 
time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
42 of 66 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to 
provide ade quate supportive care including routine vitamins and iron.
4.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
Use of concomitant medications including over-the-counter medications (except for routine 
vitamins and iron), herbal supplements, etc from Day [ADDRESS_389645] dose is 
discouraged. Subjects’ legal representatives must be instructed not to administer any 
medications, including over-the-counter products, without first consulting with the investigator.
4.8 Statistical Evaluation
4.8.1 General Considerations
There are two planned analyses for this study: the primary analysis and the final analysis. 
The primary analysis will be conducted after all randomized subjects have completed the Day [ADDRESS_389646] visit of the study (Day 361).
Tabular summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Categorical data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_96776]. Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. Additional details of statist ical 
analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Populat ion is defined as all subjects who are randomized. Subjects 
will be included in the treatment group corresponding to their randomized treatment. All analyses, with the exception of safety, will be performed on the ITT Population.
The As-treated Population will include all subjects who are randomized into the study and 
who receive any am ount of investigational product. Subjects will be included in the treatment 
group corresponding to the treatment actually received. All safety analyses will be performed on the As-treated Population.
4.8.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations
The sample size of 1,500 is necessary based on advice from the US FDA requesting that
1,000 preterm infants be exposed to MEDI8897 in this Phase 2b study. This sample size has approximately 99% power to detect 70% relative risk reduction, assuming a placebo group medically attended RSV LRTI incidence of 8%. Power calculations are based on Poisson 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
[ADDRESS_389647] variance ( Zou, 2004 ) comparing MEDI8897 mg versus 
placebo, with 2-sided significance level of α= 0.05.
• The 70% relative risk reduction assumption is based on a placebo-controlled study in 
Native American infants in which there was 87% relative reduction in the incidence of 
RSV hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (11.3% placebo; 1.5% motavizumab; p < 0.001) and 71% relative 
reduction in the incidence of outpatient RSV LRTI (10.0% placebo; 2.9% motavizumab; p < 0.001) in infants who received motavizumab prophylaxis ( O'Brien et al, 2015 )
In order to evaluate risk, a sample size of 1,000 subjects exposed to MEDI8897 will provide a
90% probability of observing at least one AE if the true event rate is 0.2%; if no AEs are
observed, this study provides 95% confidence that the true event rate is < 0.3%.
4.8.[ADDRESS_389648] completed the 
Day 151 visit. At the time of this primary analysis, approximately half of all subjects enrolled (722 subjects) will have completed the Day [ADDRESS_389649] on the primary efficacy endpoint is demonstrated at the 
significance level of 2-sided 0.05. With that, th e overall Type I error is controlled at 0.05.
Therefore, no further multip licity adjustment is n ecessary.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis
The incidence of RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) during [ADDRESS_389650] results (performed centrally via RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria and will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. For subjects with multiple 
medically attended RSV LRTI events, only the first occurrence will be used in the primary

An analysis may also include all RSV positive LRTI endpoints, using results from either the 
central lab or local lab.
Different approaches to handle missing data (ie, early discontinuation and no RSV LRTI
prior to discontinuation) may be considered for sensitivity analyses. Additional analyses or 
subgroup summaries may be performed to adjust duration of efficacy follow-up and/or other

5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
The ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1) defines an AE as:
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s pre-
existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including electrocardiogram [ECG] 
finding) that requires medical intervention by [CONTACT_093], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_316777]. If clinical sequelae are 
associated with a laboratory abnormality, th e diagnosis or medical condition should be 
reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, 
urine red blood cells [RBC] increased). Abnormal laboratory values that are not, in the 
investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], medically  significant and do not require  intervention should not be 
reported as AEs.
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new 
sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed 
consent has been obtained but before the subject has received investigational product. 
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
A SAE is any AE that:
• Results in death
• Is immediately life-threatening
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
47 of 66 Template 16.2• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
5.[ADDRESS_389654].
5.3.1 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Administration of polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and mAbs has been associated 
with hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) that occurs during or after dosing. A hypersensitivity reaction is defined as an acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both during administration of investigational product (but does not meet the definition of anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent exposure to antigen, and it is most commonly accompanied by [CONTACT_316778]. It is potentially a fatal, systemic allergic reaction that is distinct from simple allergic reactions (eg, rash, pruritus) because of the simultaneous 
involvement of several organ systems ( Sampson et al, 2006 ). A full definition of anaphylaxis 
is provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_389655] in the form of a number of conditions such as 
vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerul onephritis, serum sickness, and arthralgias. 
Drug-induced immune complex (type III) hypersen sitivity reactions can  occur when host 
immune system generates antibodies to drug resulting in soluble circulating antigen-antibody complexes formation and their deposition in blood vessels. Subsequently this initiates tissue 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00003 Amendment 1
MEDI8897 25Jan2018; Final
48 of 66 Template 16.2damaging inflammatory reactions mediated by [CONTACT_316779]/or leukocytes and mast cells. 
The pathology and clinical manifestations are de pendent on the tissues/organs involved, with 
vascular, skin and renal tissues being common sites of injury. Common examples of immune complex hypersensitivi ty reactions are seru m sickness (systemic) and Arthus reactions 
(local). The clinical manifestations of serum sickness include skin rash, fever, malaise and 
polyarthralgias or polyarthritis. Symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_316725] [ADDRESS_389656] exposure to antigen and usually resolve in several weeks after withdrawal of the causative agent. Serum sickness needs to be differentiated from other ‘serum-sickness-like’ reactions that have a similar clinical presentation (eg, viral infections, anti-seizure drugs), but are believed to have different pathogenic mechanisms. Both serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions have been reported with mAbs (eg, rituximab, infliximab). Clinical presentation and time to onset should be taken into account for the diagnosis and differentiation of these 
reactions. Diagnosis of these suspected reactions is best confirmed via biopsy of the affected 
tissues. See Section 5.5for recording AEs.
5.3.3 Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is a disorder in which there is an abnormally low platelet count; a normal 
platelet c ount ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per μL. The 3 major causes of low 
platelet c ounts include: 1) insufficient platelet synthesis in the bone marrow; 2) increased 
breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream; and 3) increased breakdown of pl atelets in the 
spleen or liver. General symptoms of thrombocytopenia include bleeding in the mouth and gums, bruising, nosebleeds, and petechiae (pi[INVESTIGATOR_316726]/rash). Severe bleeding is the major complication, which may occur in the brain or gastrointestinal tract. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a reversible form of thrombocytopenia that should be suspected in a subject who presents with new onset thrombocytopenia or recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_316727], without an obvious alternative  etiology. It is commonly induced by [CONTACT_9934]-
dependent antibodies that cause platelet dest ruction or clearance by [CONTACT_316780] (drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia ), and less commonly by [CONTACT_9934]-induced bone 
marrow suppression or autoimmune thrombocytopenia that is initiated by [CONTACT_316781]. The initial approach to the subject with suspected drug-induced thrombocytopenia involves confirming thrombocytopenia, establishing a temporal relationship to a drug, and eliminating other causes of thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is made clinically by [CONTACT_316782] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 1 week). Most subjects with drug-
induced thrombocytopenia require no specific treatment, as their platelet counts will recover 
promptly following withdrawal of the causative agent. See S ection 5.5for recording AEs.

immediate notification to the sponsor. See Appendix 2 for guidelines for assessment of AE severity and relationship to IP. If an AE evolve s into a condition that meets the definition of 
“serious,” it will be reported on the AE form in the eCRF as a serious adverse event.

9.1 Protocol Amendment 1, 25Jan2018
Major changes to the protocol are summarized below:
1. The interim analysis was removed from the study. (Changes have been made in the 
synopsis and in Section 4.8 [Statistical Evaluation].)
2. As a result of the removal of the interim analysis, no alpha will be spent so the two-sided 
significance level of α = 0.049 has returned to α = 0.[ADDRESS_389679] ical signif icance of < 0.049 has returned to ≤ 0.05. (Changes have been 
made in the synopsis and in Section 4.8 [Statistical Evaluation].)
3. A decision was made to conduct a primary an alysis rather than an interim analysis; 
therefore, text has been added to explain that the primary analysis will now include all 
efficacy d ata from all randomized  subjects through Day 151 and all available safety data 
up to and beyond Day 151 at the time of the final data cut-off date. (Changes have been 
made in the synopsis and in Section 4.8 [Statistical Evaluation].)

63 of 66 Template 16.2Appendix 2 Additional Safety Guidance
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. Severity will be graded according to the current version of the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteri a for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) where 
applicable for pediatric assessments. The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE should be made by [CONTACT_83763] 1 to 5 as defined below.
Grade 1 (mild) An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not 
generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Grade 2 (moderate) An event that is us ually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Grade 3 (severe) An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The 
event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.
Grade 4 (life threatening) An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily liv ing (eating, ambulation, toileting, 
etc).
Grade 5 (fatal) Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is  defined by [CONTACT_14540] 5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that 
persists for several hours may not meet the definition of an SAE and would be considered a nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151461].

[ADDRESS_389681].
An event will be considered “not related” to use of the investigational product if any of the 
following tests are met:
• An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the investigational 
product and the onset of the event (eg, the event occurred either before, or too long after, 
administration of the investigational product for it to be considered product-related)
• A causal relationship between the investigational product and the event is biologically 
implausible (eg, death as a passenger in an automobile accident)
• A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (eg, typi[INVESTIGATOR_316741] a concomitant drug and/or typi[INVESTIGATOR_5194]-related event)
Individual AE/SAE reports will be considered “related” to use of the investigational product 
if the “not related” criteria are not met. 
“Related” implies that the event is considered to be “associated with the use of the drug” 
meaning that there is “a reasonable possibility” th at the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_316787] (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causation).
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the eCRF (Section 5.6). This includes nontreatment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration of i nvestigational product) as well as treatment-
emergent SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occ ur as a result of a procedure or intervention 
required during the study (eg, blood collection, nasal sample co llection). The following 
guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_316788]:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the 
subject’s medical record.

65 of 66 Template 16.2Not protocol related: The event is related to  an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

Second National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006; 117(2):391-7.
NIAID and FAAN define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and 
may cause death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories). 
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-
uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)
b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula)
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mm 
Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg + [2 × age]) from [ADDRESS_389682] that was signed

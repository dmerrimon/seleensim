The main reas
on for this LOA is to provide guidance for the resumption of study visits, in follow -
up to the COVID -19-related Clarification Memo #2 (CM #2), dated 04/20/20, as US and non-US 
sites begin to open to research visits  in the presence of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic . A 
Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) review occurred on 08/17/[ADDRESS_711446] 10 enrolled 
participants who were enrolled prior to the temporary closure in March 2020 due to the COVID -
19 pandemic. The outcome of the SMC review was that the study may proceed as planned. 
However, enrollment into the study (i.e., Step 1 entry) will remain paused until approval of this 
LOA #3, dated 08/26/20.   
Follow -up for
 these 10 enrolled participants remains ongoing with modifications  to allow for a 
mix of virtual and in-person visits. Registration for  Step 2 for those already enrolled in Step 1 will 
resume upon approval of LOA #2, dated 08/14/20.   
This LOA
 is being implemented for the following reasons, per team decision, unless otherwise 
indicated: 
•The contact [CONTACT_544353] (CTS) needed to be updated in the
roster, and the replacement of one of the statisticians. In response, the following section hasbeen updated: cover page, roster, and study management section.
•Per DAIDS directive, changes made via CM #1, dated 10/15/19, and CM #2
 (with additional
revisions to reflect the current situation with the COVID -19 pandemic) have been
incorporated and remain in bold/strikethrough. In response, the following sections havebeen updated: 4.1.5, 4.1.7, 4.1.8b, 6.2.3, 6.2.4, 6.3, 6.3.8, 6.3.9, 6.3.10.
•The upper window for Step [ADDRESS_711447] been updated: 4.3 ( 4.3.3, 4.3.5), 6.2.1, and
6.2.4.
•Remote consent for Step [ADDRESS_711448] been updated: 6.2.1 and the Sample Informed Consent (SIC).
•The upper window for the Step 1 week 16/SVR12 in-person follow -up visit will remain
extended when the study reopens to accrual, per the COVID -19-related CM  #2, dated
04/20/ 20 (extended upper window = +42 days). This visit remains critical for the primary
outcome of the study ; thus blood sample collection is required within the study window. In
response, the following section has  been updated: 6.2.3.
•For the Step 1 week 16/SVR12 visit, a virtual visit can be scheduled to conduct all other
evaluations with a brief in-person lab visit for blood sample collection. In response, thefollowing sections have been updated: 6.2.3, 6.3.21, and the SIC.
•For the Step 2 SVR12 visit (R+20, R+24, or R+28), the virtual visit should also be pairedwith a brief in-person lab visit for blood sample collection. In response, the following sectionshave been updated: 6.2.3, 6.3.21, and the SIC.
•In the event of possible HCV recurrence/virologic failure in Step 1, participants should returnto the site within 2 weeks for collection of the HCV recurrence/virologic failure evaluations.All samples should be collected per Table 6.1-1 and stored at the site. In addition, due to
COVID -19, for this visit, Liver Function Tests (LFT s), HCV RNA, HCV genotype, and HCV
RAS testing, and should be drawn locally for immediate testing. In response, the followingsections have been updated: 6.2.4 and the SIC.
•If at any point shipment of study samples is paused due to COVID-19, for the Step 1 week
16/SVR12 visit
 and for the Step 2 SVR12 visit, all samples should be drawn per protocol
Table 6.1-1 or Table 6.1 -2, respectively, and stored at the site. In addition, due to COVID -
19, for this visit, an HCV RNA should also be drawn locally for immediate testing. In

•If hematology, chemistries, or LFTs are drawn within 7 days prior to entry (i.e., as a part of
standard of care), these labs do not need to be repeated at entry. In response, the followingsection has  been updated: 6.3.8.
•Testing required for Step 2 entry can be done at the site lab or a local  commercial  lab. In
response, the following section has been updated: 6.3.8.
•Substance use testing has been changed to optional since this is not a clinical test and doesnot affect study integrity. Sites would be able to conduct the respective visit without
collecting urine, given potential logistical challenges sites may face amidst the COVID -[ADDRESS_711449] been updated: 6.3.8 and the SIC.

updated: 6.3.10.
•Virtual visits can be utilized for all follow -up visits  (i.e., non-SVR12 visits for Step 1 and Step
2), due to COVID -19 and the participant’s  inability to come in for an in-person visit, or their
preference not to come to the site for this visit. In response, the following sections have
been updated: 6.3.21 and SIC.

4 (Event-Driven  Evaluations)
•The following revisions have been made to HCV Viral Recurrence/Virologic Failure
subsection to include a newly added first paragraph and revisions to the second
paragraph:
HCV Viral Recurrence/Virologic Failure
In the event of possible HCV recurrence/virologic failure, participants should
return to the site within 2 weeks for collection of the HCV recurrence/virologicfailure evaluations (per Table 6.1- 1, A5380 MOPS, and A5380 Laboratory
Processing Chart [LPC]), and stored at the site. In addition, due to COVID -19, for
this visit, Liver Function Tests (LFTs), HCV RNA, HCV genotype, and HCV RAStesting should be drawn for immediate local testing (i.e., at the local site lab or a
commercial lab).
In Step 1, all cases of confirmed HCV recurrence/virologic failure occurring before or atthe week 16/SVR12 visit will undergo evaluation for preliminary determination of
suspected relapse versus re-infection (see Table 6.1-1, A5380 MOPS, and A5380
Laboratory Processing Chart [LPC] ). Viral recurrence is defined as confirmed HCV RNA
value >LLOQ after achieving HCV RNA <LLOQ (TD or TND). Virologic failure is definedas failure to achieve HCV RNA <LLOQ (TD or TND) and confirmed increase in HCVRNA >1 log10 from nadir. These participants will enter Step 2. This confirmatory sample
should be collected within 56 112 days of prior to Step 2 entry.
•The third paragraph in the HIV -1 Virologic Breakthrough subsection has been revised to
read:
The increase in plasma HIV -1 RNA should be confirmed with repeat central or local
testing as soon as possible (not to exceed 4 weeks); see HIV -1 Virologic Breakthrough
Confirmation in Tables 6.1-1 and 6.1-2. For participants with confirmed HIV -1 viral
breakthrough (≥200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL), a plasma specimen should be sent for HIV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544267] A5380 VSL for evidence of HIV -1 drug resistance. Results
will be reported back to sites in real -time from the designated A5380 VSL. See section

subsection:  
Urine Sample for Substance Use Screen  
Urine substance use screening to be performed for  must be done using a CLIA-waived 
urine drug use screening tool with these common drugs of abuse: amphetamines, 
buprenorphine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, ecstasy, methadone, methamphetamine, barbiturates, marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], oxycodone, and phencyclidine. The screening will be assessed by [CONTACT_544358], pH and creatinine to help in confirmation of sample against adulterants. The methods used may be either 
CLIA -waived point of care assays or laboratory-based methods. The following 
results would be used as confirmation of an unadulterated human urine sample; pH of 4.5 – 8.0 and urine creatinine ≥20 mg/dL. Urine fentanyl testing will be done using a test 
which  that is not currently FDA approved or CLIA -waived.  
Testing will be done per Table 6.1-1 on each scheduled study visit,  and participants with 
positive screens will be counseled before and/or at the next scheduled visit with regard to potential impact on medication adherence, health-related risks, as well as in accordance with prevailing local laws. 
NOTE
: Collection of urine for substance use testing is optional given the potential 
logistical challenges sites may face amidst the COVID -19 pandemic. Sites may 
proceed with all other evaluations for the respective study visit, per Table 6.1-1, 
except for collection of urine for substance use testing.

called  “extra samples.” The ACTG will only allow  your extra samples to be used  in 
other studies if you agree to this. If  you have any questions, please ask.  
Identifiers w
ill be removed from your samples and from any private information that 
has been collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other 
information will know that the samples or information came from you.  
Extra samp
les are stored  in a secure central  place called  a repository.  Your samples 
will be stored  in the ACTG repository located in the [LOCATION_002].  
There is no limit
 on how  long your  extra samples will be stored.  [Site: Revise the 
previous sentence to insert limits  if your  regulatory authority imposes them.]  
When a researcher w
ants to use your samples and information, their research plan 
must be approved by [CONTACT_163426]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board 
(IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106995]’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.] IRBs/ECs protect the rights and well-being of people in research. If the research plan is approved, the ACTG will send your samples to the researcher’s location. This means that researchers who are not part of the protocol team may use your samples without asking you again for your consent.  
You will not be paid f
or your samples. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific  
discovery or product based on the use of your  samples.  If this happens,  there is no 
plan to share any money with you.   
You may wi
thdraw your consent for research on your extra samples at any time, and 
the specimens will be discarded. 
Please choose the response t
hat matches what you want by [CONTACT_544360]. Please ask the staff any questions that you have before you 
indicate your selection. 
Research without Human Genetic Testing

Consent to Use Stored Human Biological Materials (HBM) for Currently Unspecified Analyses. 
If you live outside of
 the US, this study is called ACTG A5243, Plan for Obtaining 
Human Biological Samples at Non-US Clinical Research Sites for Currently 
Unspecified Genetic Analyses. 
Your site m

SUBJECT
: Letter of Amendment #[ADDRESS_711475] be forwarded to each site’s 
institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC) as soon as possible for their information and review. This Letter of Amendment (LOA) must be approved by [CONTACT_5040]/EC before implementation.  
The followi
ng information may also affect the Sample Informed Consent. The site IRB/EC 
is responsible for determining the process of informing participants of the contents of 
this LOA.  
Upon receiving final IR
B/EC and any other applicable regulatory entity approvals for this 
LOA, sites should implement the LOA immediately. Sites are still required to submit an 
LOA registration packet to the DAIDS Protocol Registration Office (PRO) at the Regulatory Support Center. Sites will receive a registration notification for the LOA once 
the DAIDS PRO verifies that all required LOA registration documents have been received 
and are complete. An LOA registration notification from the DAIDS PRO is not r equired 
prior to implementing the LOA. A copy of the LOA registration notification, along with this letter and any IRB/EC correspondence, should be retained in the site’s regulatory 
Letter of Amendment #2           Page 2 of 3 14 Aug 2020 
ACTG A5380 Protocol Version 1.0  file. 
The main reason for this LOA is to provide guidance on Step 2 registration, in follow -up to the 
COVID -19-related Clarification Memo #2 (CM #2), dated 04/20/20, as US and non-US sites 
begin to open to research visits in the presence of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. However, 
enrollment into the study (i.e., Step 1 entry) will remain paused until a Study Monitoring Review 
occurs on 08/17/20, per the protocol, for the first 10 participants who were enrolled prior to the 
temporary closure in March 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Follow -up for these 10 
enrolled participants remains ongoing with modifications to allow for a mix of virtual and in-person visits.  
At this time, any of the 10 participants who are currently in Step 1 of the study, and who qualify for Step 2, may now register to Step 2. The Data Management Center will open the  Step 2 
registration screens  upon release of this LOA . Sites should follow Final Protocol Version 1.0, 
and subsequent CMs  #1 and #2, and LOA  #[ADDRESS_711476] in-person visits. The COVID -related CM 
#2, dated 04/20/20, was written in a way to allow flexibility for remote visits with the only stipulation being that the week 16/SVR12 visit occur in person.  
Additional
 guidance is forthcoming from the team to allow for further flexibility in light of 
uncertainties in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The followi
ng is a change to A5380, Version 1.0, 06/07/19, titled "A Phase II Trial of 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187763]-dose Combination Treatment for Acute Hepatitis C Virus Infection (PURGE -C).” This change will be included in the next version of the A5380 protocol if it 
is amended at a future date.

revised to read:
CD4+ /CD8+ (For participants with HIV -1 infection only)
Screening Obtain absolute CD4+/CD8+ count and percentages must be performed within
28 days prior to study entry from  at a laboratory that possesses a CLIA certification or
equivalent (US sites) or IQA certification (non-US sites).
8.Section 6.3.10 (Virol ogic Studies): The laboratory requirements in the first paragraphs of the
Plasma HCV RNA (screening) , Plasma HCV Genotype, and Plasma HIV -[ADDRESS_711492] been revised to read: 
Plasma HCV RNA (screening)   
The screening HCV RNA result must be obtained by [CONTACT_399910] -approved test for quantifying 
HCV RNA at any local laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent (US sites) or VQA certification (non-US sites). Screening HCV RNA must be obtained within 28 days prior to study entry.  
Plasma HCV Genotype 
At Step 1 screening, the HCV genotype result will be obtained locally (real -time)  from any 
laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent (US sites) or VQA certification (non-US sites). ONLY IF IT IS NOT AVAILABLE LOCALLY should it be done (real -time) at 
the designated testing laboratory (see A5380 LPC). 
Plasma HIV -[ADDRESS_711493] be noted within 28 days prior to Step 1 study entry from any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent (US sites) or VQA certification (non-US sites). On -study HIV -
1 RNA is only required for HIV -1-infected participants and should be performed at the ACTG 
central laboratory. See the A5380 LPC for processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and storage information.

A Phase II Trial of Glecaprevir/ Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187763]- dose Combination Treatment for Acute 
Hepatitis C Virus Infection (PURGE -C) 
 
DESIGN  This is a phase II single -arm, open -label study to assess the efficacy of a 
fixed dose combination (FDC) of glecaprevir /pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (G/P) given for 4 
weeks in acute hepatitis C (HCV) -infected participants, wit h and without 
HIV-1 coinfection.  
  
The study has two steps:   
 
Step 1: F our weeks of treatment for acute HCV infection and up to [ADDRESS_711520] -treatment follow -up visits in Step 1 will occur at  
4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after the end of  study treatment  (G/P). Participants  
with HCV recurrence (reinfection, suspected  relapse or undefined post -
treatment viremia ) or HCV virologic failure before or at the week 
16/SVR12 (sustained virologic response [ADDRESS_711521]- treatment)  visit 
during Step 1 will be eligible for re -treatment  (Step 2) . 
 
Step 2: Re- treatment will  be with G/P  with or without  ribavirin ( RBV) for up 
to [ADDRESS_711522]-treatment follow -up for  Step 2 will include visits for 
SVR12 determination. 
 
DURATION  Up to 28 weeks in Step 1: [ADDRESS_711523] -
treatment follow -up. 
  
Up to 40 weeks in Step 2: up to [ADDRESS_711524] 10 participants living with 
HIV-1 co-infection . If a participant discontinues early for reasons 
unrelated to study treatment and is not evaluable for SVR12 while 
registration  is ongoing, then an additional participant may be enrolled as 
determined by [CONTACT_544369]12. Additional enrollment may occur more 
than once, up to maximum enrollment of 50 participants . 
 
POPULATION  Men and women age ≥18 years with acute HCV -infection (may be first 
HCV infection or re -infection) of any genotype,  living  with or without HIV -1 
co-infection .

20,000 deaths annually in the [LOCATION_002], exceeding the mortality burden due to HIV  
[1, 2]. Recently, incidence of acute HCV has been rising [3], with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) estimating that there are about 30,000 new cases of acute HCV per year, with a range of 24,200- 104,200 cases  [4]. The two groups at 
highest risk for acute HCV infection are people who inject drugs (PWID) and HIV  positive 
men who have sex with men (MSM). For a variety of reasons, only a fraction of persons 
with acute HCV are reported to public health authorities  [5]. Those with recent i nfection, 
if unaware of their status, are at high- risk for transmission to others. Early identification 
of acute HCV infection is essential to provide preventive counseling and, if necessary, curative treatment to clear virus and prevent onward transmission. Models suggest that 
clearance of HCV among high -risk individuals may reduce overall prevalence and 
incidence, despi[INVESTIGATOR_544278]- infection  [6]. 
 
 17 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0

During the era of IFN-based treatments, early identification and treatment of HCV during 
the acute phase has resulted in significantly higher response rates with less intensive 
and shorter durations of therapy, in both HCV mono- infected and HIV/HCV co- infected 
individuals  [7-10]. A meta -analysis of IFN-treated HCV mono -infected individuals with 
acute HCV infec tion (N=602) reported an overall sustained virologic response rate (SVR) 
of 78%, significantly higher than those individuals not receiving any therapy (55%, 
OR=3.08; 95% CI 1.8 -4.8) [9]. A majority of individuals were treated with pegylated 
interferon (peg IFN) mono -therapy with an average duration of therapy of 19.[ADDRESS_711532] SVR rates  [9]. The first approved 
protease inhib itors, boceprevir and telaprevir, were also used for the treatment of acute 
HCV in combination with pegIFN and ribavirin ( RBV); these also suggested that the 
duration of overall therapy could be shortened to as low as 12 weeks with enhanced efficacy compared to those receiving treatment in the chronic phase [11,12] . Moreover, a 
randomized controlled trial of immediate versus delayed treatment found improved SVR 
rates in the immediate treatment group, in part due to lack of follow -up for those 
assigned to the delayed arm  [13].
 In sum, these studies suggested that the timing of IFN-
based therapy matters in determining efficacy and  improving follow -up when utilizing 
shortened IFN -based treatment courses.  
 
For the DAA era, current guidance provided at http://hc vguidelines.org recommends that 
treatment for acute HCV in many cases can be  delayed for at least 12 weeks  [12]. This 
recommendation is based on (1) the extraordinarily low frequency of fulmination during 
acute HCV infection; (2) the possibility of spontaneous clearance which is maximal in that timeframe, especially if female or jaundiced  [14, 15]; and (3) the availability of safe 
and effective antiviral treatments in the chronic phase of infection. This strategy avoids overtreatment, especially for those who would have spontaneously cleared. However, 
the guidance also states that benefits of early treatment may outw eigh the cost -savings 
of waiting for HCV clearance, especially for those at highest risk for onwards 
transmission. As HCV is increasing in incidence in the [LOCATION_002], a “test and treat” 
approach similar to many communicable diseases may be appropriate to combat this 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. Recent data from the Netherlands, where large scale roll out of DAA therapy has been achieved, have shown a dramatic decrease in incident HCV infections among 
HIV positive MSM [16, 17] .  
 However, it is equally important to note the high incidence of re -infection of HCV among 
individuals with elevated risk for acquisition. A meta- analysis showed that for HCV 
monoinfected "high -risk" partic ipants  (n = 771) , the pooled recurrence rate was 
22.32/1000 person -years of follow -up (PYFU ), leading to a summary 5- year risk of 
10.67%. For the 4 studies of HIV/HCV coinfected participants,  the pooled recurrence 
rate was 32.02/1000 PYFU  leading to a summary 5- year risk of 15.02% [18]. These 
individuals are monitored routinely for re- infection and will be an optimal population 
where shorter duration of treatment could play a key role in reducing costs. Additionally, 
curing these infections earlier (as these individuals are more likely to engage in high -risk 
behaviors) will help further the HCV elimination agenda.

As chronic HCV infection is associated with dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, earlier treatment may also prevent dysregulation that may interfere with protective immunity for future infections [19 -22]. 
 Antiviral treatment in the acute phase with regimens of shorter duration than those used 
in the chronic phase with similar SVR rates may mitigate concerns regarding costs 
associated with overtreatment , with potential societal cost saving due to both shorter 
duration of t reatment and reduced risk of transmission [ 23]. As in the IFN-era, shorter 
duration regimens are also compelling for patient acceptability and adherence.  
 
Thus far, clinical trials using novel DAAs to cure acute HCV have produced mixed 
results. Initial attempts at using sofosbuvir  (SOF)  plus RBV for genotype [ADDRESS_711533] resulted in suboptimal SVR rates. The DARE- C II trial treated 19 participants with 6 
weeks of SOF plus RBV and only achieved 32% SVR  [24]. ACTG A 5327 titled, 
“Sofosbuvir -Containing Regimens without Interferon for Treatment of Acute HCV in HIV -
1 Infected Individuals (SWIFT- C),” Cohort 1 included 17 participants treated with 12 
weeks of SOF plus RBV and only ac hieved 59% SVR  [25]. A smaller study suggested a 
higher SVR rate with this regimen [26]. The more potent regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) has been applied for 6 -8 weeks for acute HCV with genotypes 1 or 4. For 
HIV positive  MSM, 6 weeks of LDV/SOF  achieved more robust cure rates for 22 out of 
26 individuals (85% SVR); of note, the four relapses all had high HCV RNA levels 
>9,000,000 IU/mL at the time of treatment initiation [27] . More encouragingly, a recent 
trial in 20 HIV negative individuals with symptomatic acute HCV showed a 100% SVR 
rate with 6 weeks of LDV/SOF; HCV RNA at time of initiation was lower than the above 
trials  [28]. The ACTG A5327 SWIFT- C Cohort 2 achieved SVR in all 27 participants with 
8 weeks of LDV/SOF [ 26]. Other DAA regimens  are also currently being studied 
including 8 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR), although like LDV/SOF, will be 
limited to genotypes [ADDRESS_711534] tended to focus on persons with HIV and those infected with either 
genotypes 1 or 4 infection.

Efficacy and safety of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_544279]  (GLE), an NS3/4A protease inhibitor , and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]  (PIB) , an NS5A 
inhibitor were approved together as a pangenotypic FDC for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in August 2017. Administered as three 100 mg/[ADDRESS_711537] individuals without cirrhosis, whereas a longer course 
of 12 weeks is recommended for those with cirrhosis. Treatment extension to 12- 16 
weeks is also recommended for those with previous exposure to either HCV protease or 
NS5A inhibitors (but not recommended for dual class failures). Neither GLE nor PIB are 
significantly metabolized nor eliminated by [CONTACT_8212], allowing use in chronic kidney disease, including patients on dialysis . The safety profile  of G/P is  favorable, with an 
overall proportion of participants receiving 8- 16 weeks in clinical trials permanently 
discontinuing treatment due to adverse reactions of 0.1%. The most common adverse reactions including all grades in greater or equal to 5% of participants were headache 
(13%), fatigue (11%), and nausea (8%), with 80% of all adverse reactions classified as mild in severity. [Mavyret USPI ; [COMPANY_013] Inc., North Chicago, IL; August 2018]

participants without cirrhosis and 12 weeks of G/P in 16 HIV/HCV -co-infected 
participants  with compensated cirrhosis. Treatment -naïve and treatment -experienced 
participants with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 infection were enrolled. Pa rticipants  were 
either antiretroviral  (ARV) -naïve with a CD4 cell count ≥500/mm3, or on a stable 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for at least 8 weeks with a CD4 cell count 
≥200/mm3. Overall SVR12 was 100% (136/136) among those without cirrhosis on the 8 -
week regimen, and 93% ( 14/15 ) in those with compensated cirrhosis on the 12- week 
regimen . Four serious adverse events  (AEs)  were reported, none of which were DAA-
related. One of these led to treatment discontinuation (cerebral hemorrhage) [31] . 
 2.2 Rational e 
 The combination regimen of G/P is an ideal candidate for the treatment of acute 
infection. This regimen has broad efficacy across HCV genotypes, is dosed once daily, 
avoids RBV, and is associated with minimal side effects. Together, these medications 
have an extremely high barrier to development of resistance and are potent against NS3 and NS5 resistance- associated substitutions (RASs). In contrast to other DAA regimens 
studied in acute HCV infection, 8 weeks of therapy with G/P is highly effective across a 
wide variety of populations with chronic HCV infection and specifically addresses genotype 3, which represents a significant proportion of new cases in the U.S . In phase 
III trials of participants without cirrhosis, the 8- week regimen had high SVR rates , ~95-
100%, for all genotypes and regardless of baseline HC V RNA level [ 34, 35] . In addition, 
the pharmacokinetics  (PK) of this nucleotide- sparing regimen result in rapid steady state 
exposure in the liver tissue, providing biologic plausibility for the potential  to shorten 
length of therapy  in acute HCV . The efficacy and appropriate duration of G/P in the 
acute phase is unknown but we hypothesize that SVR rates with a shorter duration of the highly potent G/P regimen for 4 weeks may supersede 90% based on the above 
reported studies.  
 
The study is designed to conclude with reasonable evidence that the true SVR12 
proportion is greater than 80% in the study population. The 80% SVR threshold was 
chosen as an adjusted average rate from three studies that similarly used half of the 
treatment regimen recommended at that time for chronic HCV: LDV/SOF x 6 weeks  [25] 
and two studies examining SOF/RBV x 12 weeks  [25, 26]. 
 Based on the succes s of the  LDV/SOF  arm of the  two-arm study A5327, which 
examined shortened courses of SOF-based regimens, we propose a phase II trial of  G/P 
FDC treatment for acute HCV  infection (PURGE -C), an open- label study in which 
participants receive 4 weeks of G/P FDC.  
 
Rationale for Inclusion of HIV N egative Participants and Minimum Number of HIV- 1 
Positive Participants  
Unlike A5327, those uninfected with HIV -1 will be included in this trial. As the majority of 
those with HIV and acute HCV are men, this broader inclusion criteria would be expected to enhance enrollment of women and those with injection drug use as a  
 21 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
primary risk factor. However, given the mission and emphasis of the ACTG, a minimum 
of 10 participants  with HIV -1 will be enrolled.  There is no maximum l imit to the 
enrollment of HIV-1- infected participants.  
 
Rationale for Inclusion of Concomitant ART Regimens  
Formal drug -drug interaction studies in HIV/HCV seronegative individuals  have been 
performed with G/P and the following antiretroviral agents:  
• abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir  
• atazanavir/ritonavir  
• darunavir/ritonavir  
• lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  
• raltegravir  
• rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979]  
• tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat  
• tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/efavirenz  
 
No clinically significant interactions were observed with abacavir, lamivudine, 
dolutegravir, raltegravir, rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], tenofovir  alafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 
emtricitabine. Interactions were observed and/or are expected with atazanavir, efavirenz , 
and etravirine and ritonavir and cobicistat- based regimens  [Mavyret USPI]. A description 
of the potential for clinicall y significant interactions follows.  
 
Co-administration of efavirenz with G/P did not affect efavirenz levels but glecaprevir 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_544281]. 
Etravirine has similar potential for drug interactions and while not formally studied to 
date, is not recommended for coadministration with G/P. In contrast, coadministration 
with rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_544282] (Cmax by 105%, AUC by 84%) , no safety issues were 
identified  [36, 37].  
 
Ritonavir -boosted protease inhibitors  increase glecaprevir exposures. When G/P was 
co-administered with atazanavir and ritonavir, glecaprevir Cmax and AUC were 
increased 4 -fold and 6.5 -fold, respectively and asymptomatic (Grades 1 and  2) ALT 
elevations were observed. When G/P was co- administered with darunavir and ritonavir, 
glecaprevir Cmax  and AUC were increased to 3.1 and 5.0- fold, respectively compared to 
controls, but no ALT elevations were observed [Mavyret USPI] . Given this study will 
enroll non- cirrhotic individuals and the duration of co- administration is limited to 4 weeks, 
we will allow participants on ritonavir -boosted darunavir. LFTs will be monitored at 
Weeks 1 and 2 of G/P therapy. Ritonavir -boosted atazanavir will not be allowed.   
 
The pharmacologic booster cobicistat when administered as part of a combination 
(tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, cobicistat, elvitegravir) resulted in increases of 
Cmax and AUC for both glecaprevir (150 to 205%) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (24- 57%), while 
elvitegravir and cobicistat levels were increased by 29- 47%. No attributable AEs were 
reported [38]. Cobicistat -boosted darunavir will be allowed.   
 
 22 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
The EXPEDITION -2 trial included HIV/HCV co -infected participants on abacavir, 
dolutegravir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, raltegravir, rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], tenofovir alafenamide, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. One patient received elvitegravir/cobicistat  [33]. 
 
To summarize, d rug-drug interaction studies and trial data support the concomitant use 
of raltegravir, dolutegravir, rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, tenofovir alafenamide, abacavir, emtricitabine, and lamivudine. Bictegravir is expected to have similar properties as dolutegravir and will be allowed. Cobicistat with elvitegravir , 
cobicistat with darunavir and ritonavir -boosted darunavir will be allowed as the exposure 
of G/P is only [ADDRESS_711538] HIV -1 in vitro; their use in 
participants infected with HIV- 1 who meet criteria for being off therapy is therefore 
considered safe from a v irologic standpoint . 
 
Rationale for Retreatment Approaches  
This study will re -treat participants with viral recurrence or virologic failure.  
 Viral relapse rates are very low after 8 -16 weeks of G/P treatment in NS5A -inhibitor 
naïve popul ations with chronic infection (0 -1%). However, for the small percentage of 
individuals that do experience viral relapse, RASs in NS3 and/or NS5A are present in the majority (89%) [ 39]. Given that the use of ultra- short duration of treatment for acute 
HCV infection could be associated with increased viral relapse rates and there are no data to inform the risk of RAS selection with 4 weeks of G/P treatment, a retreatment strategy within the study is desirable. When G/P alone was assessed as a retreatment 
strategy for ind ividuals  who had failed prior DAA- containing therapy with multiple  drug 
class exposure, the presence of concurrent NS3 and NS5A RASs adversely impacted 
outcomes. In part 1 of the MAGELLAN -1 study, a small number of participants with prior 
DAA treatment were retreated with G/P plus RBV (n=22) or G/P alone (n=22) for 12 
weeks [ 40]. The modified intention to treat ( mITT ) SVR12 was the same in both groups, 
95%. In the subset with prior exposure to both NS3 and NS5A inhibitors, 5/6 (83%) and 8/9 (89%) treated wi th 12 weeks plus RBV and 12 weeks without RBV, respectively 
achieved SVR12. In part 2 of the MAGELLAN -1 study, SVR12 was 100% for those 
without RASs or only NS3 RASs, 89% NS5A RASs and 56% for those with both NS3 and NS5A RASs [ 39]. The duration of G/P ret reatment (12 vs 16 weeks) had no clear 
impact on responses in those with dual class (NS3 and NS5A) exposure with 79% (CI: 52-92%) treated for 12 weeks (n=14) achieving SVR and 81% (CI: 57- 93%) in those 
treated for [ADDRESS_711539] of RASs on retreatment with G/P after DAA failure, none of the participants in this study had prior exposure to G/P 
limiting the applicability to the current study and retreatment approaches. However, in 
the Magellan 3 study retreatment of 23 prior GT1, 2, and 3 G/P treatment failures with 16 weeks of G/P plus SOF plus RBV was highly efficacious with an SVR rate of 96% 
(22/23) [ 41]. 
 
In the DAA era, re -treatment with longer durations using the same agent(s) has been 
attempted with success. For instance, 9 HIV -1/HCV co -infected individuals experienced 
relapse after 12 weeks of LDV/SOF  and 8 of 9 achieved sustained virologic response 
 23 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
with 24 weeks of LDV/SOF  plus RBV [ 42]. In an HCV -mono- infected cohort, participants 
failing 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir were retreated with 12 weeks of the same regimen with 100% (17/17) SVR12 [ 43]. In addition preliminary data suggest that 
Sof/Vel/Vox may be also be a suitable retreatment regimen for G/P treatment failures with 13/14 G/P treatment failures achieving SVR12 following 12 weeks of Sof/Vel/Vox 
retreatment [ 44].  
 
In sum, the limited data remain inconclusive on the benefits of adding RBV or extending 
duration when using G/P to retreat individuals previously exposed to both NS3 and 
NS5A DAAs. Ext rapolation of data from other re- treatment studies does suggest some 
benefit of treatment extension and/or the addition of RBV. Given the ultra- short duration 
of treatment in the current study and that participants are not yet in the chronic phase 
and will  not have cirrhosis, 16 weeks of G/P plus RBV could be an effective treatment 
strategy for recurrence and virologic failures. However, acknowledging the more robust 
data on the use of SOF -based triple DAA regimens for re- treatment of DAA failures, site 
investigators will have discretion to use a SOF -based triple DAA treatment regimen for 
re-treatment of participants. SOF-based treatments will not be provided by [CONTACT_544372].  
 For viral recurrence that is clearly re- infection  (defined by [CONTACT_544373]/subtype), the 
participant will receive the standard regimen used for chronic HCV (8 weeks of G/P) during Step 2. In such circumstances, despi[INVESTIGATOR_544283] a new acute re -infection , the 
participant may not be “re- enrolled” into Step 1.  
 
Rationale for IL28 -B and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Testing 
IL28- B is a gene polymorphism associated with natural clearance of HCV infection and 
of innate IFN stimulation. IL28 -B polymorphism and HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_544284]. IL28- B genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544285]’s innate potential for natural clearance.  
 
 Rationale for Rapid Treatment of Acute HCV  
Guidelines have suggested a waiting period to assess for spontaneous clearance before 
treatment of acute HCV. Reported rates of spontaneous clearance of HCV among HIV -
1-infected individuals are highly variable due to small sample sizes and significant 
variance across study populations. On average it is reported that 5 -15% of HIV -1 
infected individuals acutely infected with HCV will spontaneously clear the infection [ 38, 
45-49]. Multiple baseline factors have been reported as predictive of clearance including 
female sex, host genetic factors including the IL28 -B favorable genotype, and early 
favorable HCV -RNA kinetics [ 14, 50, 51]. There are studies assessing viral kinetics in 
the early infection period and report ranges from 6% -48% of participants having 
detectable HCV RNA [ADDRESS_711540] clinical evidence of infection and go on to 
spont aneously clear the infection [ 52-54]. Indeed on rare occasions participants have 
been reported to spontaneously clear the infection after 12- 13 months or even longer 
[41, 55]. Many of these are very small, single center studies; however, the bulk of 
studies suggest that the majority of participants with acute HCV infection will develop 
chronic infection. Recent data from Europe indicate that the minimal rate of s pontaneous 
 24 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
clearance among HIV positive MSM was  only 11.9%; as the majority of the remainder 
received relatively early antiviral treatment, the true rate of clearance may be somewhat higher  [55, 56]. Ultimately, if antivirals are offered for acute HCV it is a minorit y (6-10%) 
of participants who may receive treatment unnecessarily. Moreover, these data must be balanced with the evidence that suggests a delay in initiation of therapy for acute HCV 
decreases the chance of achieving a SVR. A meta -analysis of early treatment in 417 
HCV mono -infected participants reported that those participants who delayed therapy 
>12 weeks) from diagnosis had lower SVR (67%) than those treated at or within 12 weeks of diagnosis (83%) [9]. Delayed therapy was also associated with decreased SVR 
in a large pooled cohort of injection drug users [ 57]. In ACTG A5327 Cohort 1, those with 
a “less active” immunologic profile had a lower rate of SVR. Preliminary data also 
indicate that earlier treatment may preserve multi -specific HCV -specific T -cell 
responses, which are thought to be critical to the ability to prevent HCV viral persistence [Lauer et al. , unpublished data]. Especially for those with HIV, where spontaneous 
clearance rates are as low as 11.9%, a “test and treat” strategy similar to other infectious 
diseases is justified, especially if the cost -saving strategy of sho rtened DAA courses is 
validated [ 23]. 
 
2.3 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
No clinical safety issues specifically related to G/P have been identified to date in HCV mono- infected or HIV -1/HCV co -infected participants without cirrhosis or with 
compensated cirrhosis.  
 
The expected benefits to participants being treated with G/P is a rapid and durable 
eradication of HCV virus and a shortened treatment period. Potential risks include 
unforeseen safety issues and unknown implications of virologic failure due to the 
emergence of resistant virus.  
 
For the population of HIV -1/HCV co -infected participants, the potential benefit of 
achieving SVR with 4 weeks of an IFN -free regimen outweighs the risks associated with 
the possible development of previously unidentified safety issues or the emergence of quasi -species resistant to  glecaprevir or pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] [ 58]. Furthermore, the benefits of 
limiting the potential for onward transmission carries significant societal benefit and cost 
savings. For participants who experience recurrence or virologic failure after 4 weeks of treatment, a re- treatment regimen will be offered, minimizing risk of participating in this 
study.  
 
If high rates of SV R can be obtained with a shortened, IFN -free regimen, without 
frequent emergence of resistant HCV, the anticipated improvements in safety and 
tolerability would offer a favorable risk -benefit determination for individuals with acute 
HCV infection. 
 
Other risks of the study are outlined below including risks associated with blood draws, 
risks of study drugs, risks of changing ART or other medications in order to qualify for 
the study, and the small risk of HBV reactivation.  
 
 25 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/[ADDRESS_711541] side effects, such as headaches , fatigue, 
diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, p ruritic skin , and abnormal liver function tests. There is a risk 
of serious and/or life -threatening side effects when certain non-study medications are 
taken with the study drugs.  
 
Drug interactions may increase the chances of side effects , may  affect the levels of 
ARVs  or other medications and/or  cause changes in liver enzymes and other  abnormal 
blood tests. Certain HIV medications may be changed  to reduce this risk. For certain 
HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), others may require dose adjustment or careful 
monitoring. For digoxin, the dose should be reduced and closely monitored while on G/P. Drug interactions that lower the levels of glecaprevir or pi[INVESTIGATOR_544286]’s chances for a cure of hepatitis C and/or select for drug resistance.  
Certain drugs known to cause lower levels of glecaprevir or pi[INVESTIGATOR_544287].  
  
Some people with HCV and HBV coinfection receiving DAA therapy for HCV, have 
experienced reactivation of HBV. Some of these cases have led to severe hepatitis, liver 
failure and death. This has been reported mostly in individuals  who are positive for 
HBsAg  and extremely rarely in those who appear to have resolved HBV infection by [CONTACT_544374]. Those with HBsAg will be excluded, while those with resolved HBV infection will 
be monitored.  
 Ribavirin may be used in Step 2 for those with detection of viremia after  4 weeks of 
glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_544288] 1. The most common AE of RBV therapy is anemia due 
to hemolysis. Anemia typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] [ADDRESS_711542] discontinue study treatment and complete 
the discontinuation evaluations as indicated in section 8.2
. 
 
Risks of Delaying HIV Therapy  
While participants  with HIV  are not required to be on ARVs to enter the study and, 
although the HCV treatment period is 4 weeks for Step 1, a delay in necessary HIV 
medications could allow for progression of HIV disease, which can increase the risk of 
opportunistic infections and long- term after effects for participants  living with HIV.

2.4 Adherence Measures  
 
The efficacy of G/P for the treatment of acute HCV may be influenced by [CONTACT_4317]’ 
adherence to the study medications. There is no perfect measure of adherence, but 
tools include pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], pharmacy refill records, self-report, directly observed therapy  
(DOT) , measurement of drug concentrations, and electronic monitoring  (video DOT) . 
This study will use some of these measures (see section 6.3.14 ).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_711543] to the health care system [23]. The potential for treating acute infection with a 
4-week course has the potential to not only improve outcomes, but also to provide cost 
savings or extremely good value for the resources spent. A questionnaire on self-report 
resource use and quality of life (QOL) will be used to assess the number of outpatient 
visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598] (if any) , and quality of life associated with G/P treatment, and a 
microsimulation model [23] for assessment of the cost -effectiveness of the strategy  (see 
section 6.3.16
).  
 
Using the microsimulation model, the life expectancy, quality -adjusted life years, total 
costs, and reduction in HCV transmission for the following two strategies: (1) 4 -week 
G/P treatment of acute HCV; and (2) wait for 6 months and treat only those who develop 
chronic HCV inf ection (referred to as “treat chronic HCV” strategy)  will be estimated . In 
both strategies, simulated patients that get re -infected may get re -treatment. The 
incremental cost -effectiveness ratio of “treat acute HCV ” compared to “treat chronic 
HCV” strategy  will be estimated. The above outcomes separate for HCV/HIV co -infected 
patients and HCV mono- infected patients  will be presented . A one- way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of cost -effectiveness results  will also be 
conducted. 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
A5380 is a phase II single -arm, open- label study to assess the efficacy of FDC G/P in 
acute HCV -infected participants, with and without HIV -1 coinfection, given for 4 weeks. 
This study will assess whether G/P confers successful treatment, superior to a cure rate of 80%.  The study will entail 2 steps: Step 1— treatment of acute infection with 4 weeks 
of G/P , and Step 2— re-treatment of participants  experiencing post -treatment viremia in 
Step 1 with 8- 16 weeks of G/P with or without RBV with modifications to the retreatment 
regimen allowed at the discretion of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_544289] A5380 CMC .  
 Prospective participants will be enrolled in Step 1 if diagnosed with acute infection, 
defined below in section 4.1.3
. Both HIV infected and HIV uninfected participants  will be 
included, and participants with HIV who are taking protocol -defined compatible ARVs , as 
per discretion of the local provider. A minimum of 10 participants with HIV will be 
enrolled.  
 
 27 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/[ADDRESS_711544] dose of study drug ( FDC G/P).  
 
The primary outcome will be SVR12 ( i.e., HCV RNA <LLOQ,  either  TD or TND , at 12 
weeks after end of treatment ).  
 
Participants experiencing documented viral recurrence before or at the week 16 or 
SVR12 visit  will proceed to Step 2 and be classified as either re- infection or  suspected  
relapse, prior to re- treatment. The type of viral recurrence ( suspected  relapse versus re-
infection) will be determined by [CONTACT_941] A5380 team chair, co -chairs, and virologist  
([EMAIL_10422] ) based initially on genotype/subtype information and 
resistance testing  and then reported to the sites  by [CONTACT_544375] -treatment regimen for Step 2.  If a re -infection, they will be re -treated 
with 8 weeks of FDC G/P. If a suspected  relapse, they will be re- treated with a treatment 
regimen of 16 weeks of FDC G/P with or without  weight -based RBV, irrespective of 
genotype. Participants experiencing  virologic failure (failure to achieve HCV RNA <LLOQ  
and confirmed increase in HCV RNA > 1 log 10 from nadir) will also proceed to Step 2 and 
will be re -treated with 16 weeks of FDC G/P with or without  weight -based RBV. 
Participants  experiencing post -treatment HCV viremia not otherwise defined as re-
infection,  suspected relapse or virologic failure will also proceed to Step 2  and will be re-
treated with 16 weeks of FDC G/P with or without  weight -based RBV.  At the discretion of 
the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_544290] A5380 CMC  ([EMAIL_10422]), 
participants experiencing suspected relapse, virologic failure, or undefined post -
treatment HCV viremia may be re -treated with an alternat ive, non- study provided 
regimen. Retreatment options are outlined in the Manual of Procedures ( MOPS ).   
 
Participants who meet criteria for Step 2 , but opt out of therapy will continue study visits 
on the Step 1 schedule.

6.2.4  Event -Driven Evaluations  
 
HCV Viral Recurrence /Virologic Failure  
In Step 1, a ll cases of confirmed HCV recurrence /virologic failure  occurring 
before or at the week 16 /SVR12  visit will undergo evaluation for p reliminary 
determination of  suspected relapse versus re -infection  (see Table 6.1-1, A5380 
MOPS, and A5380 Laboratory Processing Chart [ LPC] ). Viral recurrence is 
defined as confirmed HCV RNA value >LLOQ after achieving HCV RNA <LLOQ 
(TD or TND ). Virologic failure is defined as failure to achieve HCV RNA <LLOQ 
(TD or TND) and confirmed increase in HCV RNA >[ADDRESS_711582] this confirmatory evaluation done, per Table 6.1 -1
, 
before initiation of Step 2 therapy.  Participants  should be re -tested with HCV 
RNA and hepatic panel (LFTs ) as soon as possible after viral recurrence or 
virologic failure to confirm the HCV RNA >LLOQ or >1  log 10 from nadir, 
respectively.  
 If HCV RNA is >1000 IU/mL, as part of Step [ADDRESS_711583] -
treatment viremic sample will be sent for HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544315] . A 
stored baseline sample will also be sent for RAS analysis. Results from these 
assessments will be delivered to the A5380 CMC  via email  
 57 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
([EMAIL_10422] ) by [CONTACT_544389] 
(VSL) and initial determination of  suspected relapse v ersus  re-infection  will be  
made. If HCV RNA is persistently less than or equal to 1000 IU/mL , the 
participant may still meet the criteria of virologic failure and/or post -treatment 
HCV viremia described in section 4.3.1 . 
 
Results of repeat HCV genotype and RAS analysis will be delivered to the A5380 CMC ([EMAIL_10422] ). If the genotype/subtype has switched, this will 
be classified as a re- infection. If the same genotype/subtype and there are 
emergent RASs, this will be  initially  classified as a  suspected relapse. For other 
situations (e.g., same genotype/subtype without  emergent RASs), the 
classifi cation will be determined later by [CONTACT_308130] (with samples sent 
from the repository, see virologic studies in  section 6.3. 10), but for Step 2 these 
will be classified as “undefined post -treatment viremia” but treated as a 
suspected  relapse. Per section 6.3.[ADDRESS_711584] the 
site coordinator and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_544316] -treatment approach for the 
participant .  
 For all participants with recurrence of the s ame genotype/subtype, stored 
samples from the repository will be batched and sent for sequencing, 
phylogenetic analysis, and definitive determination of relapse versus re -infection 
(see virologic studies in section 6.3.10
). Suspected relapse or undefined post -
treatment viremia may then be reclassified as confirmed relapse or re -infection 
for the purposes of exploratory objective 1.4.1 . 
 
HIV-1 Virologic  Breakthrough  
In this study, HIV -1 viral brea kthrough is defined as follows ( this only applies for 
participants on ART):  
 
Among participants  with HIV-1 RNA <50  copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at study entry, a confirmed 
increase to ≥200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at any time after entry  into Step 1 and Step 2 . 
 
The increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA should be confirmed with repeat  central or  
local testing as soon as possible (not to exceed 4 weeks); see HIV -1 Virologic 
Breakthrough  Confirmation in Tables  6.1-1 and 6.1-2. For participant s with 
confirmed HIV -1 viral breakthrough (≥200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL), a plasma specimen should 
be sent  for HIV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_544317] A5380 VSL for evidence 
of HIV -1 drug resistance. Results will be reported back to sites in real -time from 
the designated A5380 VSL.  See section 6.3.10 , Stored Serum and Plasma for 
HIV-1/HCV Studies.  
 
Clinical management of HIV- 1 virologic breakthrough and treatment failure will be 
 58 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/[ADDRESS_711585] -treatment toxicity follow -up 
may be determined by [CONTACT_7880]. 
 
Participants who prematurely discontinue study treatment ( i.e., prior to 
completion of the last dose of G/P per the assigned dosing period) will complete the premature treatment discontinuation evaluations. Participants will then follow 
the post -treatment schedule in Table 6.1-2
. 
 NOTE: In Step 2 where applicable: If G/P is discontinued, participants 
should discontinue RBV. Under no condition should the participant remain 
on RBV monotherapy.  In contrast, participants  who discontinue RBV in 
Step 2 can continue G/P to complete their planned G/ P regimen.   
 
HCV Virologic Failure  
Participants who experience for HCV virologic f ailure (see details in section 
6.2.4 ) in Step [ADDRESS_711586] the option to enter Step 2 for re -treatment, otherwise 
the participants will be followed on study/off treatment through week 28. 
 
 59 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
Participants who permanently discontinue study treatment for HCV virologic failure (see details in section 6.2.4
) in Step 2 will be followed through 12 weeks  
(or 24 weeks , if RBV given) after the treatment completion. No further treatment 
will be provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
Virologic evidence of recurrence, defined as HCV RNA ≤LLOQ at end of 
treatment but HCV RNA quantifiable (>LLOQ) during follow -up, will require 
confirmation and should be performed in real time at the designated VSL as soon as possible but within 2 weeks after determination of initial observation. The 
results will be provided to the co- chairs and site investigators within 2 weeks of 
specimen receipt.

The following on- treatment HCV virologic response- based treatment stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544319] 2:  
• Confirmed increase in HCV RNA >LLOQ if HCV RNA previously declined to ≤LLOQ (detected or not detected) AND  
• Confirmed ≥1 log 10 IU/mL HCV RNA on -treatment increase from nadir  
• Confirmation will be required for all stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544320] 2 weeks after determination of initial observation (see HCV Recurrence/VF Confirmation in Table 6.1-2

CD4+/CD8+  (For participants with HIV-1 infection  only)  
Obtain absolute CD4+/CD8+ count and percentages within 28 days prior to entry 
from a laboratory that possesses a CLIA certification or equivalent (US sites) or 
IQA certification (non- US sites).  
 For entry and post -entry evaluations, all laboratories must possess a CLIA 
certification or equivalent (US sites) or IQA certification (non -US sites).  
 
Stored Plasma and PBMC  
PBMC will be collected, processed, and shipped to the designated immunology laboratory  for analysis of HCV -specific T -cell responses (see A5380 LPC) and for 
IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) /IFN effector gene  (IEG) responses. Based on human 
leukocyte antigen ( HLA) typi[INVESTIGATOR_31545], participants will be screened for the 
presenc e of HCV -specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses using class I and 
class II HLA multimers. Based on the results HCV- specific T -cell populations will 
then be analyzed longitudinally using flow cytometry and/or fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by [CONTACT_544393]. Additional immune cell populations might be studied if warranted by 
[CONTACT_544394].  Findings will be compared to samples from 
chronic HCV already collected by [CONTACT_544395].  
 
Plasma will be analyzed for selected cytokines and chemokines and correlated 
with ISG/IEG and T-cell responses.  
 DNA for HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_544321]: DNA will be extracted from the cell 
fraction of a PBMC tube and stored for HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (class I and class II) and 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) testing for key loci.

this observation on an eCRF.  
 
For Step 2 , study drug will be dispensed at Step 2 entry and every 4 weeks as 
indicated in Table 6.1-2
 based on the length of therapy. Due to the different 
potential lengths of therapy for Step 2, in addition to entry, drug will be dispensed at R+4 for participants receiving 8 weeks of therapy, at R+4 and R+8 for 
participants receiving 12 weeks of therapy, and at R+4, R+8, and R+[ADDRESS_711605] -entry study visits . 
 
6.3.16 Questionnaires  
 Questionnaires are posted on the DMC Portal in the Forms Management Utility.  
 
Risk Factor Assessment 
As indicated in Tables 6.1-1  and 6.1-2, survey will be administered that will query 
participants on risk behaviors. The survey may be self -administered, int erviewer -
administered or a combination of both. At baseline, the survey will ask about risk behaviors in the prior 6 months but at all follow -up visits, the survey will query 
 69 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
about risk behaviors since the prior visit. The questionnaire will capture informati on related to sexual (e.g., history of unprotected receptive anal 
intercourse) and injection drug use practices (e.g., history of sharing of injection 
paraphernalia) as well as other practices that place individuals at a high -risk for 
HCV acquisition. Participants will be made aware they have the option to decline to answer any of the questions in the survey but still be included in the study.  All 
information from the risk assessment questionnaire will be recorded on the 
eCRF.  
Health Outcomes Questionnaire (EQ -5D) 
The EQ -5D is a validated instrument used to collect data about quality of life 
(http://www.euroqol.org) . The instrument asks questions and each has three 
possible responses (EQ5D- 3L version). The instrument asks respondents to 
comment on their degree of mobility, self -care, usual ac tivities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression, and then ask participants to record their current health-related quality of life state using a vertical visual analogue scale (0 -100 range). 
The instrument has been translated into a variety of languages and is available 
as a paper form, a computer -based form, a tablet/cell phone form, or as an 
interview.  
Responses must be recorded on an eCRF. Questionnaires will be administered 
per Table 6.1-[ADDRESS_711606] 4 weeks including: 1) nights spent in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33798], 2) visits 
to an emergency department, and 3) visits to a doctor’s office.  Responses must 
be recorded on an eCRF.  This questionnaire will be administered per Table 6.1 -
1.   
 
6.3.17 Reinfection Prevention Counseling 
 
HCV reinfection prevention counseling will be administered to all participants per 
Tables 6.1-1  and 6.1-2. This information is not recorded on the eCRF. See the 
A5380 MOPS for further details.    
 
6.3.18 Collection and Updating of Locator Information 
 
Given the limited sample size, it is imperative that additional measures are taken 
to ensure that retention at SVR12 is as close to 100% as possible. Consequently, 
locator information will be captured and updated periodically until the SVR 
assessment for Step 1. At Step 1 entry (day 0), detailed information on the primary mode of contact (e.g., mobile phone, email, social media messaging 
services, etc.) will be captured along with a secondary mode of contact (e.g.,  
 70 A5380

tables . 
 
 
7.3.4 Expedited AE Reporting Period 
 
• The expedited AE reporting period for this study is week [ADDRESS_711610] medication dose. For S tep 
2 of this study expedited AEs would only be collected on Step 2 participants  
who are on study drugs (G/P) or G/P and RBV.    
 73 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
• After the protocol -defined AE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only 
suspected, unexpected  serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), as defined in 
Version 2.0 of the EAE Manual, will be reported to DAIDS if the study staff become aware of the events on a passive basis (from publicly available information).  
 7.4 Study Monitoring 
 
A5380 core team members  (including study chairs, medical officer , and statisticians)  will 
monitor the conduct and safety of the study via regular summaries of accrual, AEs, study 
conduct (including premature study discontinuations and premature study treatment discontinuations), data completeness, and specimen collection,  as appropriate. The core 
team will review the individual participant -level HCV virology data  as outlined in
 section 
10.5. 
 The DAIDS clinical representative will review and assess select EAE reports for potential impact on the study participant safety and protocol conduct as per DAIDS policies, 
guidance documents, and standard oper ating procedures ( SOPs ), as applicable. 
Additionally, the DAIDS clinical representative will review aggregated AE summaries 
prepared every 3 months by [CONTACT_295188] ( SDAC ). 
 
The study will undergo interim review at least annually  by [CONTACT_163411] -appointed Study 
Monitoring Committee (SMC). The first planned interim review will occur when the study week [ADDRESS_711611]. An interim review may also be convened if a concern is identified by [CONTACT_68402], the study chairs, or study statistician in consultation with the team . See section 10.5
 for statistical and 
other considerations related to interim monitoring.  
 
Detailed plans for study monitoring will be outlined in a Study Progress, Data, and Safety 
Monitoring Plan (SPDSMP) developed by [CONTACT_163413] (SDMC) prior to enrollment of the first participant.   
 
8.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  ISSUES 
 8.1 Toxicity  
 
It is possible that some participants will experience transient or prolonged AEs during the trial. To minimize the effec ts of these dosing modifications on the eventual evaluation of 
the safety, tolerability, and activity of study treatment, the principles in the following sections will be used to determine the appropriate dose adjustment.  
 
Grades 1 and 2 AEs associated with G/P or RBV require no change in study treatment but close follow -up; with the exception that modifications of RBV dosing for Grades 1 
and 2 anemia are provided in section 8.1.2
. 
 
 74 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
8.1.1  Management of Side Effects of G/P  
 
Most AEs are expected to be mild in severity. However , if a SAE occurs, 
administration of G/P may be discontinued due to clinical or laboratory event s. 
For participants also on a ritonavir ( RTV)-boosted HIV PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a cobicistat-
containing regimen there is potential for higher exposures.    Dose reduction of G/P will not be allowed in the study. If G/P is stopped for 
toxicity, it will not be restarted.  
 All participants must complete weeks 8, 12, 16, and 28 visits (Step 1) or one of 
the following visits in Step 2 depending on re -treatment duration: week R+20, 
R+24 , or R+28 , R+32, R+36, and R+40  visits.  
 
Participants  who meet any of the following laboratory criteria should stop 
treatment with G/P:  
• Confirmed elevation of ALT and/or AST >3 x values measured upon study entry  
• Confirmed direct bilirubin >2x values measured upon study entry  
• Any  ≥Grade 3 rash associated with constitutional symptoms  
• Any Grade 4 event assessed as related to treatment with G/P 
 
8.1.2  Management of Side Effects of RBV (Step [ADDRESS_711612] -treatment viremia) 
 
The most common AE of RBV therapy is anemia due to hemolysis. Anemia typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] [ADDRESS_711613] discontinue 
study treatment and complete the discontinuation evaluations as indicated in 
section 8.2
. 
 
RBV dosing in this study will be based on weight at Step 2 entry (see section 
5.0). Dose reduction of RBV is the recommended management for RBV-
associated anemia and should be performed according to the product label. 
Information is summarized in Table 8.1.[ADDRESS_711614] 
the A5380 CMC with questions regarding difficult anemia management and/or if it 
is felt RBV discontinuation is required. Participants will continue to take G/P if 
RBV is temporarily or permanently discontinued.

due to either a laboratory abnormality or clinical manifestation, an attempt may 
be made to restart RBV at 600 mg daily in two divided doses and further increase 
the dose to 800 mg daily in two divided doses. However, it is not recommended 
that RBV be increased to the original assigned dose. Please refer to the table 
below for dosing intervals.  
 Table 8.1.2 -2: Dosing Intervals  to Restart RBV  
Daily Dose  Morning Dose Evening Dose 
600 mg 400 mg (2 tablets)  200 mg (1 tablet)

NOTE A: The half -life of RBV in participants  with normal renal function is 290 
hours.  
 
NOTE B : The ranges of hemoglobin values used as criteria for triggering dose 
reduction of RBV do not correspond to those used to grade toxicities in 
the DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017. 
Therefore, sites are expected to use specific criteria  shown in Table 
8.1.2 -1 above. 
 
8.2 Pregnancy   
 
Pregnancy  and pregnancy outcome will be recorded on the eCRFs . For co -infected 
participants, pregnancies that occur on study should be reported prospectively to The 
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. More information is available at www.apregistry.com . 
Telephone: 800- 258-4263; Fax: 800 -800-1052. (For studies conducted  at sites outside

pregnancy outcomes at the end of pregnancy. If the information is obtained, pregnancy 
outcomes will be submitted on an e CRF at the end of the pregnancy.  
 Pregnancy will result in immediate discontinuation of the study drugs  and initiation of 
counseling regarding the lack of information of safety in pregnancy with G/P and for 
those in Step 2 receiving RBV, regarding the teratogenicity of RBV. Participants who 
become pregnant while on study will be followed on study/off treatment until study completion. A visit 6 months following the end of pregnancy will be conducted for 
evidence of AEs in the participant and infant, and an outcome eCRF will be completed.  
 
In Step 2 , male participants taking RBV whose partners become pregnant will undergo 
treatment discontinuation and remain on study for continued follow -up until the end of 
the study. They will receive counseling on RBV teratogenicity and the same follow -up 
visit at 6 months after their partners’ delivery as outlined for pregnant women. This same 
risk of teratogenicity is not seen with G/P, thus pregnancy of female partner in Step [ADDRESS_711617] the female participant or male participant with 
a pregnant female partner  regarding pregnancy outcomes at the end of pregnancy.  If the 
information is obtained, pregnancy outcomes will be submitted on an eCRF at the end of 
the pregnancy.  
 9.0 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION  
 9.1 Premature  Treatment Discontinuation  
 
• Drug -related toxicity (see section 8.1
). 
• Pregnancy in a female participant.

A5380 is a prospective, phase II, single- arm study in treatment of acute HCV infection in 
participants with and without HIV -1 coinfection. The study will enroll participants at US 
and non- US sites. The key study objective is to evaluate the efficac y of a 4 -week 
treatment of a FDC of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (G/P), using SVR12 a s the primary 
outcome measure. SVR12 is defined as unquantifiable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after 
treatment discontinuation ( week 16 visit).  
 The study is designed to conclude with reasonable evidence that the true SVR12 
proportion is greater tha n 80% in the study population. This will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_544400] a two- sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the sample proportion is 
entirely above 80%. This is equivalent to showing that the SVR12 proportion is higher than 80% in a one- sided test with a type I error of 5%, where the aim is to rule out 
SVR12 proportions below or equal to 80%. The threshold of 80% was chosen based on 
past studies (see section 2.2
). 
 
The sample size of 44 participants for the evaluation was chosen to provide good power (90%) to show that the SVR12 proportion is not worse than or equal to 80%, assuming 
that the underlying SVR12  proportion is 95% with the 4 -week treatment. The team 
considers SVR12  proportion of 95% to be plausible based on the results of studies in 
chronically HCV infected persons using 8 weeks of treatment and considering higher success with acute HCV infection (see section 2.2
). This sample size is deemed to 
provide reasonable precision around the estimated SVR12  proportion to provide useful 
information in the treatment of acute HCV.  
 
The primary analysis on SVR12 will include all participants who initiate the treatment. As 
such,  participants who discontinue the treatment early for whatever reason will be 
included in the primary analysis. Similar to the recently completed acute HCV study conducted in the ACTG (A5327), not achieving unquantifiable HCV RNA at the study 
visit corresp onding to the SVR12 evaluation will be considered failure for SVR12 
determination in the primary analysis, regardless of the reason. By [CONTACT_13748], early discontinuation of the study prior to the SVR12 visit will be considered a failure 
 78 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0

regardless of the reason, and re- infection prior to the SVR12 visit will  also be considered 
a failure. Understanding reasons for SVR failure is important, and reasons for SVR failure will be described for the anticipated small number of non- SVRs. In addition, an 
important secondary analysis will be an SVR12 analysis that excludes participants who discontinue the study prior to the SVR12 evaluation for reasons clearly not related to 
study treatment and participants who become re -infected prior to when SVR12 can be 
assesse d. Reasons for discontinuation unrelated to study treatment may include: 
participant moved away, participant cannot get to the clinic, participant cannot be located. To ensure that the study is well- powered for this important secondary analysis, 
additional participants may be enrolled if the study is still enrolling participants when the 
team becomes aware of such early study discontinuations. The maximum replacement 
number will be 6 for the study, so that study enrollment will not be greater than 50.  
 
The primary outcome at 12 weeks af ter treatment discontinuation (w eek 16) may be 
evaluated for each participant prior to the completion of study. The primary analysis 
timeline will be driven by [CONTACT_356494]’s completion of the primary outcome visit, 
rather than the study completion date. Results from the primary analysis on SVR12 may 
be presented publicly, for example at a conference, when the data related to such analysis are complete, prior to study database finalization.

maximum.  
 
10.4 Sample Size and Accrual   
 
The sample size was determined to provide good power to show that SVR12 proportion 
is greater than 80%. The true SVR12 proportion is assumed to be 95% when treated 
with 4 weeks of the G/P regimen. With [ADDRESS_711621] 90% power to show that proportion achieving SVR12 is greater than 80% in a one -sided exact binomial 
test with a targeted significance level of 5%. Table 10.4 -1
 below shows the study power 
for a range of values for the underlying SVR12 proportion.

With a sample size of 44 participants, the Wilson confidence interval for the true SVR12 
proportion will be entirely above 80% if 40 or more participants achieve SVR12 out of 44 
participants. The table  10.4-2 below shows two- sided 90% CIs for various potential 
observed SVR12 proportions in a sample of 44 participants. The width of the CI 
indicates precision around the SVR12 estimate.

Accrual of about three  participants per month is expected, to complete enrollment in 15 
months. Should accrual of additional participants be needed for a key secondary 
analysis on SVR12, which excludes participants who are re- infected with HCV or 
discontinue early for reasons not related to study treatment ( see section 10.1 ), the 
enrollment period may be extended. 
 10.[ADDRESS_711622] participant is enrolled.  The reviews will include information about 
accrual, baseline characteristics, retention, completeness of key laboratory 
measurements (HCV RNA), AEs , and available HCV RNA results at study visits.  See 
section 7.[ADDRESS_711623] 10 participants by [CONTACT_941]  
A5380 core team (including study chairs, medical officer and statisticians) for 
consideration of study modification, in case there  is evidence of an unacceptable 
number of participants not achieving unquantifiable HCV RNA, excluding reinfection  (referred to as simply “failures” in this interim monitoring section) with 
the proposed [ADDRESS_711624] 10 
participants. The following guideline will be used to assess failures based on early interim data on 10 participants that may trigger an SMC review :   
 
If [ADDRESS_711625] 10 participants experience failures by [CONTACT_544403] 4 
weeks after the end of treatment ( week 8) , further enrollment will be suspended 
while the core team and the SMC review the data closely and determination is 
made on the future conduct of the study.  
 
The table
 below shows the probabilities of meeting the above criteria under 
various assumed probabilities for failures shown by [CONTACT_544403] 4 weeks 
after the end of treatment, using binomial distributions . We want a high 
probability of meeting the guideline when the probability of failure is unacceptably 
high, so t hat the study can be modified. For example, when the true probability of 
failure is as high as 50%, then there is 95%  probability  of meeting the guideline 
to modify the study. On the other hand, we want a low probability of meeting the 
guideline when the true probability of failure is low. For example, when the true 
probability of failure is as low as 5%, then there is only 1% probability of meeting 
the guideline. When the true p robability of failure is 30%, the probability of 
meeting the guideline to consider modifying the trial is 62% .

available HCV RNA results, genotype results , baseline demographics and key 
clinical characteristics (including HIV status, ALT), study treatment duration, treatment status , and other data that may be related to re -infection. The report 
will be sent to the A5380  core team (mentioned in sections 7.4 and 10.5.1
) 
frequently for review until the 10th participant has week 8 HCV RNA data 
available.  
 10.6 Analyses   
 
The primary efficacy objective will be addressed by [CONTACT_544404]12 ( section [IP_ADDRESS]
 describes this primary endpoint) . All 
enrolled participants who receive any study treatment will be included in the primary 
analysis. A two -sided 90% CI will be calculated around the estimated SVR12 proportion 
using the Wilson method for binomial data. If this CI is entirely above 80%, then it will be concluded that there is evidence that the underlying SVR12 proportion is greater than 
80%.   
 For the primary safety analysis, the AEs occurring after initiation of study treatment 
through the study visit occurring 4 weeks after the treatment completion will be summari zed. The proportion of study participants with AEs will be estimated with a two-
sided 95% CI around the estimate. As a secondary analysis, all reported AEs (which 
include events that occur after the time frame defined for the primary safety analysis) will 
be summarized. A two- sided 95% CI will also be provided for the proportion of study 
participants with AEs. The Wilson method will be used.  
 As a secondary analysis, SVR12 will be assessed in the analysis set that excludes 
participants who discontinued the study early for reasons clearly not related to the study

FINAL Version 1.0

treatment and participants who became re- infected with HCV prior to SVR12 visit.  
Reasons not related to study treatment include: participant moved away, participant cannot get to the clinic, partici pant cannot be located. The analysis will use methods 
similar to the primary analysis. SVR12 results will also be described separately by [CONTACT_10840] -1 
infection status.  
 The secondary HCV RNA endpoints (HCV RNA <LLOQ at study visits) will also be assessed with proportion estimates with two- sided 90% CI using the Wilson method, 
similar to the primary efficacy analysis on SVR 12. 
 
Tolerability  failures  and virologic failures , as defined in section 10.2.2,
 will be listed and 
described. A tolerability  failure  listing will be accompanied by [CONTACT_544405](s). Listing s on virologic failure will be accompanied by [CONTACT_544406]/subtype, RAS and phylogenetic results.  
 
11.0 PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 
Within the context of this trial, adherence to G/P and potentially ARV s using a variety of 
assessments including self -report, pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], and drug concentrations in plasma, cells, 
and/or hair  will be assessed. C oncentration- effect associ ations (e.g., glecaprevir 
exposures and acute LFT elevations or the relationship between G/P exposures and 
likelihood of achieving SVR)  may also be investigated. The former is relevant for this 
study since participants on ritonavir -boosted darunavir and el vitegravir/cobicistat  will be 
included. Exposures of glecaprevir are higher with these ART agents which may 
theoretically increase the risk for hepatotoxicity. There are limited PK and safety data 
with G/P and ritonavir -boosted darunavir and elvitegravir/cobicistat in individuals with 
HIV/HCV coinfection, so this study may provide a unique opportunity to examine any 
associations between exposures and LFT elevations. Also, though there is  not a plan  to 
investigate this prior to limit costs and because what type of ART and substances  study 
participants may use  will not be known, samples and data will also be collect ed that 
allow the assessment of potential drug interactions with drugs and ART agents with G/P. 
There is not a pharmacologic basis to expect a significant drug interaction between G/P and drugs, but formal drug interaction studies with substances  are lacking.  
 
11.1 Pharmacology Objectives  
 
11.1.1  To evaluate participants’ adherence by [CONTACT_544371], including self -report, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_544333]  
 
11.1.2  To assess the pharmacokinetic -dynamic associations for G/P  
 
11.1.3  To evaluate potential drug interactions between common  drugs  of abuse , ARV s, 
and G/P.

11.2 Pharmacology  Study Design  
 For Step 1, plasma for PK, DBS samples, and hair samples (optional) will be obtained 
per Table 6.1-1
. Please see A5380 MOPS for details regarding  optional  hair sample 
collection . Samples are collected prior to treatment initiation and after discontinuing G/P 
treatment in the event there is a need to retrospectively evaluate the potential for ART or 
drug interactions or adherence, but these samples will not be analyzed prior to limit 
costs and because it is not known what ART or drugs study participants will be taking.  
Record dose information (date/time) of last three  doses of study drug and ARVs on 
eCRF.  
 For Step 2, plasma will be obtained per Table 6. 1-[ADDRESS_711627] dose information (date/time) of last three  doses of study 
drug and ARVs on eCRF.  
 
Substance use will be assessed using urine screens and participant self -report and 
potential  drug concentrations.   
 NOTE: The weight recorded at entry to each step will be used as the weight for the corresponding PK analysis.  
 11.3 Primary and Secondary Data, Modeling, and Data Analysis  
 
To address pharmacology objective 11.1.1
, adherence (measured by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_692], self -
report , and/or drug concentrations) may be used as a predictor variable in evaluations of 
associations with viral response, summarized using descriptive statistics, or for ARV, compared before, during, and after G/P treatment.  
 To address pharmacology objective 11.1.2,
 we will investigate glecaprevir exposures 
and LFT elevations or the relationship between G/P exposures and likelihood of 
achieving SVR.  
 
To address pharmacology objective 11.1.3,  if we have a sufficient number of 
participants on a particular ART or drug, we may explore the potential for drug 
interactions between G/P and these agents.  
 
11.4 Anticipated Outcomes  
 
Pharmacology -related objectives for this study may provide clinical context to study 
findings (e.g., if adherence contributed to observed SVR rates, or if LFT elevations were 
associated with glecaprevir exposures) or potentially identify unexpected drug interactions between G/P, ARV, and/or drugs.

PURPOSE The purpose of  Part 1 of  this study is to see if 4 weeks of the hepatitis C 
(HCV ) drug, g lecaprevir/ pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (G/P), cures your acute HCV . People 
with acute HCV have a good chance of being cured of the infection when 
they are treated with a combination of two drugs within the first 6 months 
of getting HCV.  
 
The study will also look at the safety of  4 weeks of G/P and if it is 
tolerated by [CONTACT_39625].  
 
NUMBER OF  
PARTICIPANTS  There will be [ADDRESS_711642] 28  weeks.  
 
REQUIRED 
ACTIVITIES  Blood and urine collections  
• At most visits, some blood will be collected from a vein in your arm. At a few visits, you will be asked to provide a urine sample.  
  
Special procedures   
• You will be asked about the best way to reach you by [CONTACT_756], email , etc., between visits .  
• You will be asked questions about  potential  risks of becoming infected 
with HCV, and  your quality of life.  
• Some of your hair will be collected, if you choose.

RISKS The following are possible:  
• People outside of the study may find out that you are participating in 
this study and treat you unfairly.  
• Discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising from drawing blood 
• Side effects from the study medication 
• Drug resistance , making your HCV more difficult to treat  
• If you are living with HIV, drug interactions with your HIV drugs while taking the study medication. 
• If you have hepatitis B (HBV) and HCV , reactivation of HBV.  
 
BENEFITS  You may be cured of your HCV but no guarantee can be made. 
 
OTHER CHOICES  Instead of being in this study, you have the option of continuing with your 
current treatment, starting a new treatment under the care of your regular 
doctor or other health care provider, or no treatment at all. Your 
participation in this study is completely voluntary.  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have a recent infection with 
the hepatitis C virus (HCV, a virus that affects the liver). You may also be living with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS). This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_4878]. The doctor in charge of this study at this site is: (insert name [CONTACT_544422]). Before you decide if you want to be a part of  Part 1 of  this study, we want 
you to know  about  Part 1 of  the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about Part 1 of this study. The study staff will 
talk with you about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to take part in Part 1 of  this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You 
will get a copy to keep.  
  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 People who are recently infected with a new case of HCV are often considered to have acute 
HCV. People with acute HCV have a good chance of being cured of the infection when they are 
treated with a combination of two drugs within the first 6 months of being diagnosed. This study 
is being done to see if 4 we eks of the HCV drug, glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (G/P), cures your 
HCV, and if 4 weeks of G/P is safe for you and can be tolerated by [CONTACT_39625] . This study will 
include up to two parts:  
 
Part 1  (shorter course of treatment - 4 weeks)  - You will take 3 tablets of G/P by [CONTACT_346041] 
[ADDRESS_711643] the option to enroll into Part 2.  
 94 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
Part 2  (longer course of treatment - more than  4 weeks, and the treatment  may differ from P art 
1) - If you require retreatment approximately 12 weeks after completing the treatment in Part 1, 
you will take 3 tablets of G/P by [CONTACT_544407] 8, 12, or 16 weeks. It is possible another 
drug named ribavirin (RBV) will be added to G/P . The length of treatment will be decided from 
various lab tests. It is possible that the study doctor will suggest a different  
HCV drug  based on your local standard of care. You are not signing up for Part 2 at this time. A 
separate consent form will be obtained in the event you become eligible for Part 2.  
 The medications that is provided in this study is approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) for use in persons who have been diagnosed with HCV.  
 
You will be monitored for safety and viral response (how your body is responding to treatment 
and whether the amount of HCV in  your bod y is decreasing ) while on treatment. After 
completing treatment, you will be evaluated to see how your body responded to treatment at 
various time points up to [ADDRESS_711644] TO DO IF I AM IN  STEP 1 OF  THIS STUDY?  
 
If you would like to be in this study, after you have read and signed this informed consent form, 
you will come to the clinic for a screening visit to make sure you meet the requirements for 
joining the study.  You may have as little as 2.5 tablespoons to as much as 11 tablespoons of 
blood collected at any one visit. Over the course of the study, the amount of blood collected from you will be within approved limits.  
 
If you are also living with HIV, you will continue taking your current anti -HIV drugs  
(antiretrovirals [ARVs] - medications to control HIV)  if you are receiving them. If you are not 
currently on ARVs  and your provider does not think you will need ARVs for the next 4 weeks, 
this is also acceptable. If your HIV regimen  includes atazanavir, efavirenz , etravirine,  
fosamprenavir/ritonavir,  indinavir/ritonavir,  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir , nelfinavir, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
saquinavir/ritonavir,  or tipranavir/ritonavir,  you will need to be switched to another HIV regimen . 
You will need to be sure that your HIV provider discusses all changes to your HIV regimen with the study doctor. See section I
 for a description of the study visits.  
 After the entry visit, you will be given your study medication (G/P) for all [ADDRESS_711645] at room temperature (between 
15º to 25ºC [59º  to 77ºF]).  You will take three pi[INVESTIGATOR_544342] [ADDRESS_711646] 
completed 4 weeks of treatment with G/P, you will continue to have follow -up visits for 24 
weeks.  
 
 95 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
Everyone who enters this study will take a fixed -dose combination (FDC)  of G/P , which will be 
given for free by [CONTACT_1758]. If you have HIV,  your ARVs  will not be provided by [CONTACT_1758]. These 
will be provided by [CONTACT_544408]- study HIV provider.

  06/07/[ADDRESS_711650] several tests, including blood 
tests, to make sure that you qualify to join this  study. Some of the blood taken will be shipped to 
a testing lab. Your new HCV diagnosis and approximately how long you’ve been diagnosed with 
HCV will be confirmed. This visit will take about 1 -2 hours. At this visit:  
• Your HIV status will be confirmed. If there is no record available, another HIV test will be done. You may have to sign a separate consent form before this is done. 
• Your HCV diagnosis status will be confirmed. HCV RNA (to measure the level of the HCV in 
the blood) and genotype ( to determine the genetic makeup of your HCV) will also be done. If 
available, information about cir rhosis (liver damage) status will be collected.  
• Your lab results from the past 12 months (if available) will be documented for liver function 
and HCV tests.  
• You will be asked questions about your medical history and any medications you are taking or have taken in the past.  
• You will have a complete physical exam, including vital signs (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] [the number of breaths you take in a minute], and blood pressure), and weight.  
• You will have blood drawn to see if you are diagnosed with the hepatitis A or B virus (an 
infection of the liver); for routine lab tests for safety; for virologic studies (to help study the 
virus); for serologic studies (to study how your immune system responds HCV); if you are 
living with  HIV, to measure t he amount of HIV in your blood, and to measure your CD4+ and 
CD8+ cell counts (cells that help fight infection). Some of the blood you provide will be stored for future protocol -required testing.  
• If you are a woman and able to get pregnant, some of your blood or  urine will be tested for 
pregnancy. You will also receive counseling on pregnancy prevention.  Men will also be 
counseled on ways to not impregnate a woman while taking study medication. 
• For female participants, who report not being able to get pregnant, and have no medical 
record to confirm, follicle stimulating hormone- release factor (FSH) will be measured.  
 
If you do not enroll into the study  
If you decide not to take part in this study or if you do not qualify to take part in this study, we 
will still use some of your information. As part of the screening visit, some demographic (for 
example, age, sex at birth, race), clinical (for example, disease condition, diagnosis), and 
laboratory  (for example, CD4+ T -cell count, viral load) information is being collected from you so 
that ACTG researchers may see if there are patterns or common reasons why people do not join a study.  
 
Part 1 Entry  
If all of the results from your screening tests show that you are eligible and you decide to take 
part, you will be enrolled in this  study.   
• You will b e asked about your health and any changes in your medicines since your last visit. 
You will have a brief physical exam including vital signs, height,  and weight.

• If you are a woman and able to get pregnant, some of your blood or urine will be tested for pregnancy.  
• You will provide a urine sample to look for the use of drugs.  
• You wi ll have  blood drawn for routine lab tests for safety,  virologic, immunologic (to test how 
your body fights infection), and pharmacokinetic studies (to look at your body’s response to the study medication) . If you are living with  HIV, blood will be drawn to measure the amount 
of HIV  in your blood, and to measure your CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts. Some of the blood 
you provide will be stored for future protocol -required testing.  
• You will provide a hair sample for PK studies  (this helps us learn more about how your body 
handles the study medication). This is optional. 
• You will receive 4 weeks of study medication (G/P) to take home with you.  
• You will receive adherence counseling as described below . 
• You will be asked questions about how well you take your ARVs  (if applicable) . 
• If you are a woman and able to get pregnant, you will be counseled on ways to not become pregnant while taking study medication. Men will also be counseled on ways to not 
impregnate a woman while taking study medication. 
• You will be asked questions about the use of drugs.  
• You will be asked questions about risk factors for HCV.  
• You will receive counseling on how not to become re -infected with HCV.  
• You will be asked for your primary preferred contact [CONTACT_544409] a second contact (spouse, friend, neighbor, etc.) in order for the study staff to reach you throughout the study.  
If you are not able to be reached through the primary contact [CONTACT_3031], then the study 
staff will try to reach you through the second contact [CONTACT_544410].  
 
Study Medication 
At your entry visit (for Part 1),  the study staff  will give you your study medication for the whole 4-
weeks of treatment to take home. You will need to store the medications in a safe place at room temperature (between 15º to 25 ºC [59º to 77ºF]). You need t o take the study medication G/P for 
Part [ADDRESS_711651] time, you may take it later in the day as soon as you remember. Then 
the next day you should continue with the usual schedule that you take the study medication. 
You should always take all 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_544343]. If you miss doses entirely, simply resume 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_544344] (do NOT take 6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]). Do not split or crush the pi[INVESTIGATOR_544345]. After you have completed 4 weeks of treatment with G/P, you will 
continue to have follow -up visits for 24 weeks.  
 
Everyone who enters this  study will take a FDC of G/P , which will be given for free by [CONTACT_1758].

Unplanned visits  
During the st udy, you may have to come back to the clinic for extra visits for testing of any lab 
results that are not normal, or to follow up on a specific side effect or symptom.  
 
HCV Virologic Failure Confirmation  
If laboratory tests show there is evidence of virologic failure (the amount of HCV in your blood is still detectable when tested), you will be asked to return to the clinic to confirm your lab results. 
At this visit:  
• You will have a brief physical exam including vital signs and weight.  
• You will have blood drawn for routine lab tests for safety, serologic, virologic, immunologic, 
and pharmacokinetic studies , and to measure the amount of HCV in your blood, for an HCV 
resistance test (resistance means that the drugs are not likely to fight the HCV in your body). 
If you are living with HIV, the amount of HIV in your blood will be measured. Some of the 
blood you provide will be stored for future protocol- required testing.  
• A urine sample will be taken for the substance use screen .  
• If you are a woman and able to get pregnant, some of your blood or urine will be tested for pregnancy. You will also receive counseling on pregnancy prevention. Men will also be counseled on ways to not impregnate a woman while taking study medication.

respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], heart for cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, hair, nails, and muscles and joints . The 
study staff will also check your vital signs such as temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. Your height and weight will not be recorded at every visit.  
 Medical and medication history  
You will be asked questions about your health and any medicines you have taken or are taking now. Once you are on treatment, you will be asked about any signs or symptoms that you are 
experiencing and any changes in other medications that you have had since your last vi sit.  
 
Sample collections and laboratory testing 
You will have the following samples collected and tested in this study:  
 Blood collected Blood will be taken from a vein in your arm for various tests during the study. These may 
include: routine safety lab tests such as hematology (the study of blood), coagulation markers 
(how your blood clots ), kidney and liver function, and HCV viral load (a test that shows how 
much HCV is in your blood). For those who are living with HIV, HIV viral load (a test that shows  
how much HIV is in your blood), and CD4+/CD8+ counts (a test that shows how many infection-
fighting  cells you have in your blood)  will be done. 
 
Resistance testing  
Blood will be drawn and stored for future HCV/HIV resistance testing that is required for this study. A resistance test is used to determine if the HCV/HIV viruses still respond to your 
medications .  
 Genetic testing  
Some of your blood cells will be tested to see if your responsiveness to the therapy is associated with different genes related to the immune system that fights viruses . You will not 
receive the results of these studies because they will be done in the fut ure.

  CAN I CHOOSE THE TYPES OF RESEARCH THAT MY SAMPLES AND INFORMATION ARE 
USED FOR?  
 Some of your blood will be stored and used for study -required pharmacologic, immunologic, and 
virologic testing. For non -US locations, biological specimens will be shipped and/or stored 
outside of the country from which they are collected.  
 
Identifiers will be removed from your samples and from any private information that has been 
collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other information will be 
able to know that the samples or information came from you.  
 
The tests described above are required by [CONTACT_15365]. If you do not agree to the storage or 
testing that has been described above, you should not join this study .  
  
Some blood that is collected from you during the study may be left over after all required study testing is done. This blood will be stored and, if you give your consent below, may be used for 
ACTG -approved research. This means that researchers who are not  part of the protocol team 
may use your samples without asking you again for your consent. As noted above, none of your 
samples will have any private information about you on their labels.  
 
You may decide whether this “extra” blood may be stored and, if so, whether additional testing 
may be performed on it. None of this testing will be used for commercial profit.   
At this time, we do not know whether any of the research will include testing of your genes or 
your DNA (your own genetic information). We do not know whether a type of testing called 
whole genome sequencing, or WGS, might be done. In WGS, researchers look at all of your 
genes and at almost all of your DNA. In “standard” genetic testing, researchers look at specific

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN PART 1 OF THIS STUDY?  
 Up to 50  people (men and women age 18 years and older) will take part in Part 1 of this study.  
   
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN PART 1 OF  THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be in Part 1 of this study for approximately 28 weeks. If you are not cured of HCV or are 
infected again with HCV in Part 1, and you agree, you will enter Part 2 of the study, and you will be in Part 2 for 20 -40 weeks.  
  
WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE ME OFF PART 1 OF THIS STUDY EARLY?  
 
The study doctor may  need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
• the study is cancelled.  
• a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommends that the study be stopped early (An SMC is an outside group of experts who monitor the study for safety).  
• your doctor thinks the study is no longer in your best interest.  
• the site investigator thinks that you are at significant risk of failing to comply with the 
requirements of the protocol.  
 The study doctor may also need to take you off the study medication without your permission if:  
• you become pregnant.  
• you are breastfeeding.  
• continuing the study medication may be harmful to you.  
• you need a treatment that you may not take while on the study. 
• you are not able to take the study medication as required by [CONTACT_1758].  
• you have not had, or are not able to have the required study visits and evaluations . 
 
If you must stop taking the study medication earlier than indicated by [CONTACT_1758], the study doctor 
will ask you to remain on the study and complete post -discontinuation visits from the date that 
you took the last dose of study medication . 
 
If I have to permanently stop taking study medication during Part [ADDRESS_711661] 
the study, how can I get study medication? 
If you must permanently stop taking study medication before the study is over, the study staff 
will talk with you about other options.  
 After you have finished the study, you will not be able to get G/P through the study.  
  
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
No clinical safety issues s pecifically related to G/P have been identified to date in HCV mono -
infected or HIV -1/HCV co -infected participants without cirrhosis or with compensated  cirrhosis  
(the liver is heavily scarred but can still perform many important bodily functions).

possible that others could find out that you are participating in this study and that social harm 
may result (because you could become labeled as being diagnosed with HCV and/or living with 
HIV). For example, you could be treated unfairly or discriminated against by [CONTACT_103106], friends, and/or the community.  
 
Risks of Drawing Blood  
Drawing blood may cause some discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising 
where the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting, or infection.  
 
Risks of Study Medication 
The drugs used in this study may have side effects, some of which are listed below. Please note 
that this list does not include all the side effects seen with this  medication. These lists include 
the more serious or common side effects with a known or possible relationship. If you have questions concerning study medication side-effects, please ask the medical staff at your sit e. To 
assist you in understanding your risk of side effects we have included reported percentages of these events in clinical studies of the medications concerned.  
 
Glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (G/P)  
• Headaches - 9-16% 
• Fatigue - 11-14% 
• Diarrhea- 3- 7% 
• Nausea- 6- 12% 
• Asthenia ( abnormal physical weakness or lack of energy ) – 7% 
• Pruritic skin  (itchy skin ) – 17% 
• Abnormal liver  function tests - 3.5%  
 
There is a risk of serious and/or life- threatening side effects when some  non-study medications 
are taken with the study medication. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse 
about all medications you are taking before you start the study and before starting any new 
medications while on the study. Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in any other clinical trials while on this study. If you believe you are having side effects from any of 
the study medications make sure to immediately inform your study team.  
 Bradycardia, or slow heart rate, may happen in persons who are taking digoxin (a medicine that 
is used to treat heart failure and heart rhythm problems) particularly for those with a heart disorder and/or advanced kidney disease. Because of this risk the dose of digoxin must be 
reduced by [CONTACT_544413] G/P and be closely monitored. It is also not 
recommended to take G/P with cholesterol lowering medications such as simvastatin, lovastati n, 
or atorvastati n. Other cholesterol lowering medications such as fluvastatin, pravas tatin, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2830],  and rosuvastatin can be used but  either  at lower doses  or at the same dose with 
careful monitoring; you will need to check with your doctor.

FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/[ADDRESS_711663] the levels of  G/P or  HIV medicines in your blood 
could cause changes in liver enzymes and other abnormal blood tests. For certain ARVs, we  
may ask you to change them to another medication to reduce this risk. Drug interactions that 
lower the levels of glecaprevir or pi[INVESTIGATOR_544347] a 
cure of hepatitis C and/or cause drug resistance  (the virus changes form and drugs that used to 
work, no longer work) . 
 For those persons taking HIV medicines, efavirenz can lower the levels glecaprevir or 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_544348] C virus. The 
HIV medication atazanavir when it is taken together with G/P can cause increases in liver 
enzymes and the combination s hould be avoided. Study staff will review the list of all 
medications that should not be taken while in this study. Examples of other medications that shoul d not be taken with G/P include:  
• St. Jo hn’s wort  
• Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
• Rifampin  
• Ethinyl estradiol containing birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_544349]. HC V viral load will be 
monitored regularly to ensure that evidence of early failure of the H CV regimen is ident ified 
quickly. Development of resistance after failing G/P has not been studied that well. However, studies so far suggest that use of G/P could select for mutations (permanent changes in genetic 
material) in the NS3 and NS5A gene which could cause varying  levels of resistance to 
glecaprevir and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]. The impact of these resistance associated  mutations is still not 
known.  
 
Some people with HCV and HBV  coinfection receiving therapy for HCV  with direct -acting 
antivirals (DAA) like G/P have experienced reactivation of the HBV. Some of these cases have 
led to severe hepatitis, liver failure and death. This has been reported in people who are positive 
for HBsAg  (HBV surface antigen [a foreign substance in your body that cause antibodies { cells 
that fight infection}  to develop]) and those who appear to have resolved HBV infection by [CONTACT_544374]. If you have ever been diagnosed with HBV let your study doctor/nurse know.  
  
ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO DELAYING HIV THERAPY?  
 
You are not required to be on ARVs  to enter this study. If you are not on ARVs at the time you 
are diagnosed with HCV and you and your doctor do not think you need to start ARVs , you will 
not be excluded from the study. Also, it is not  recommended  that the start of HIV therapy be 
delayed for entry into the study if your doctor feels they are medically necessary. Although the 
dosing period of the study HCV medication is short, a delay in necessary HIV therapy  could 
allow for progression of HIV disease, which can increase your risk of opportunistic infections 
and long- term effects of living with HIV. If you have any concerns about these risks, you should 
discuss them with your provider.

 WHAT IF I AM DIAGNOSED WITH HIV DURING THIS STUDY?  
 
If you are diagnosed with HIV during this study, study staff will tell you about any available care. 
Study staff will counsel you about HIV. They will also tell you how to lower the risks of giving 
HIV t o others. Researchers may ask you to continue with this study . 
 
 
ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY?  
 The drugs or drug combinations in this study may be unsafe for unborn babies. Therefore, 
becoming pregnant is not allowed. If you are having sex that could lead to pregnancy, you must 
agree not to become pregnant. If you become pregnant, you will be followed after delivery.   
 
Because of the potential risk involved and due to the uncertainty of risk to the fetus, you and 
your partner must use birth control . In Part 1, you must use one of the birth control methods , 
listed below , while receiving study medication, and for 6 weeks  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56007].  
• Condoms (either self or require their partner to use one) with spermicide  
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Hormone- based contraceptive (not ethinyl- estradiol containing)  
• Tubal  ligation  
 If you can become pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_711664] study visits.  
 
If you are man who gets a woman pregnant, then  you will be asked to report this event to study 
staff. You may also be asked to report on your partner’s pregnancy outcomes.  
 Some of the methods listed above may not prevent the spread of HIV to other people. If you are 
living with HIV, y ou should discuss your contraceptive choices with your health care provider to 
choose the best way for you to both prevent pregnancy as required by [CONTACT_544414].  
 
If you think you may be pregnant or are a male who impregnates a female at any time during 
the study, tell your study staff right away. Pregnancy will result in immediate discontinuation of 
the study medications . You will be followed on study until study completion. You will be asked to 
return to the clinic 6 months after the end of your pregnancy to follow up on any side effects. 
Pregnancy  complications and/or  pregnancy  outcomes will be reported to the company that 
makes  G/P, [COMPANY_013] , by [CONTACT_544415] (NIAID) . If you  are also living with HIV and become 
pregnant while on study, pregnancy  complications and/or pregnancy  outcomes will be reported 
to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry . 
 It is not known if G/P is present in breast milk in women who are breastfeeding. Studies done in 
animals however show that there are low concentrations of the drug in breast milk in laboratory

ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you take part in this study, there may be a direct benefit to you (your HCV may be cured) , but 
no guarantee can be made. Your health may be watched more closely than usual while you are in this  study, which may help you to feel better. It is also possible that you may receive no 
benefit from being in this study. Information learned from this study may help others who have 
HCV and/or  living with HI V. Also, the benefits of limiting the potential transmission of HCV to 
others, benefits others in society  and saves in cost of treatment for others . 
  
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
 Instead of being in this study, you have the choice of:  
• treatme nt with other prescription drugs currently available to you 
• treatment with other experimental regimens, if you qualify  
• no treatment; some people may clear HCV on their own over the first year of infection 
 
Please talk to your doctor about these and other treatment choices available to you and the 
risks and benefits of these choices.

drugs within the first [ADDRESS_711668] visits, some blood will be collected from a vein in your arm. At a few visits, you will be asked to provide a urine sample.  
  
Special procedures   
You will be asked questions about potential  risks of becoming infected 
with HCV.  
 
RISKS The following are possible:  
• People outside of the study may find out that you are participating in 
this study and treat you unfairly.  
• Discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising from drawing blood 
• Side effects from the study medications  
• Drug resistance , making your HCV more difficult to treat

• If you are living with HIV, drug interactions with your HIV drugs while taking the study medications . 
• If you have hepatitis B (HBV) and HCV , reactivation of  HBV.  
 
BENEFITS  You may be cured of your HCV but no guarantee can be made. 
 
OTHER CHOICES  Instead of being in this study, you have the option of continuing with your 
current treatment, starting a new treatment under the care of your regular doctor or other health care provider, or no treatment at all. Your 
participation in this study is completely voluntary.  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to continue to take part in Part [ADDRESS_711669] been inf ected again after getting cured. 
This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681]. The doctor in charge of this study at 
this site is: ( insert name [CONTACT_789] ). Before you decide if you want to be a part of 
Part 2 of this study, we want you to know about Part 2 of the study.   
 This is a consent form. It gives you information about Part 2 of this study. The study staff will 
talk with you about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to take part in Part 2 of  this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You 
will get a copy to keep.  
  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 As mentioned in Part [ADDRESS_711670] 6 months of being diagnosed.  However, after 4 weeks of the HCV drug, glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 
(G/P), in Part [ADDRESS_711671] been infected again with hepatitis C after you were cured in Part 1. Therefore, this Part 2 of the study is being done to see if a longer course of treatment will cure your HCV. In 
Part 2 of this study, you will take 3 tablets of G/P by [CONTACT_544407] 8, 12, or 16 weeks. It 
is possible another drug named ribavirin (RBV) will be added. The length of treatment will be 
decided from various lab tests. It is also possible that the study doctor will sugges t a different 
HCV drug.  
 The medication that is provided in this study is approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) for use in persons who have been diagnosed with HCV.  
 You will be monitored for safety and viral response (how your body is responding to treatment 
and whether the amount of HCV in your body is decreasing) while on treatment. After 
completing treatment, you will be evaluated to see how your body responded to treatment at various time points up to 24 weeks of the study.   
 
 115 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/[ADDRESS_711672] TO DO IF I AM IN  PART 2 OF  THIS STUDY?  
 
If you decide to be in Part [ADDRESS_711673] as little as 2.5 tablespoons to as much as 11 tablespoons of blood collected at 
any one visit. Over the course of the study,  the amount of blood collected from you will be within 
approved limits.  
 
If you are also living with HIV, you will continue taking your current anti -HIV drugs  
(antiretrovirals [ARVs] - medications to control HIV)  if you are receiving them. If you are not 
currently on ARVs and your provider does not think you will need ARVs for the next 8, 12, or 16 
weeks , this is also acceptable. If your HIV regimen  includes atazanavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, 
and atazanavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, etravirine, fosamprenavir/ritonavir,  indinavir/ritonavir, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, nelfinavir, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], saquinavir/ritonavir,  or tipranavir/ritonavir, you will need 
to be switched to another HIV regimen . You will need to be sure that your HIV provider 
discusses all changes to your HIV regimen with the study doctor. See section I
 for a description 
of the study visits.  
 After the entry visit, you will be given your study medication for the first 4 weeks of treatment to 
take home . Study medication (G/P and possibly RBV)  will be given to you for free by [CONTACT_1758]. 
If you have HIV,  your ARVs  will not be provided by [CONTACT_1758]. These will be provided by [CONTACT_544416] -study  HIV provider. Your study physician may also decide to treat your HCV based 
on local standard of care , and these medications would not be provided by [CONTACT_1758]. Details on 
study medication for Part [ADDRESS_711674] completed 8, 12, or 16 weeks  treatment with G/P, yo u will continue to 
have follow -up visits for 24 weeks  (depending in whether you also take RBV) . Alternatively, your 
study doctor may choose a sofosbuvir -containing regimen for you. If so, you may continue to 
have follow -up visits in the study.

I. Description of Part 2 Study Visits  
 
Part 2 Entry  
Once HCV confirmation results  are available for the study doctor to review  and it is confirmed 
that you meet all the other eligibility criteria , you will be enrolled into Part 2 of the study.  This 
visit will take about 1 -2 hours. At this visit:  
• Documentation of Step 2 eligibility will be confirmed .  
• Your HIV status will be confirmed.  
• You will be asked about your health and any changes in your medicines since your last visit. You will have a brief physical exam including vital signs and weight.  
• If you are a woman and able to get pregnant, some of your blood or urine will be tested for pregnancy.  Such women will also be counseled on ways to not become pregnant while 
taking study medications . Men will also be counseled on ways to not impregnate a woman 
while taking study medications. 
 117 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
• You will have blood drawn to see if you are diagnosed with the HAV or HBV (an infection of 
the liver) , for routine lab tests for safety , for virologic studies (to help study the virus), and 
immunologic  studies  (to test how your body fights infection). I f you are living with  HIV, you 
will have your blood drawn to measure the amount of HIV in your blood, and to measure 
your CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts  (a test that shows how many infection- fighting cells you 
have in your blood) . Some of the blood you provide will be stored for future protocol -required 
testing.  
• You will receive study medications  to take home with you.  
• You will be asked questions about risk factors for HCV.  
• You will receive counseling on how not to become re -infected with HCV.  
• You will agree to con tinue taking combination ARVs  as prescribed throughout the entire 
study.  
 
Study Medication 
At your Part [ADDRESS_711677] at room 
temperature (between 15º to 25 ºC [59º  to 77ºF]).  You would need to take the study medication,  
G/P, with food. You will take three pi[INVESTIGATOR_544342] 8, 12, or 16 weeks, as instructed by [CONTACT_512340]/nurse. If you forget to take the study medication at the correct time, it may be taken 
later in the day as soon as you remember. Then the next day you should continue with the usual 
schedule that you take the study medications . You should always take all 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_544343]. If you 
miss doses entirely, simply resume 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_544344] (do 
NOT take 6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]). Do not split the pi[INVESTIGATOR_544350]. After you have completed 8, 12, 
or 16 weeks of treatment with G/P  as may be determined by [CONTACT_544417] , you will 
continue to have follow -up visits for 24 weeks  (depending in whether you also take RBV) . 
 
Some participants who enroll in Part [ADDRESS_711678]-entry Visits  
After your entry visit for Part 2, you will come to the clinic at w eeks  2, 4, 8, 12, and 16, and 
weeks 20, 24, or  28 (depending on study regimen  chosen by [CONTACT_4904]) , and week s 32, 36, or  
40 (if necessary) . These visits will last about 1 -1½ hours each.  
• For this part of the study, there will be about [ADDRESS_711679] Study Visits for Part 2  
• You will  be asked about your health and any changes in your medicines since your last visit.  
• You will have a brief physical exam including vital signs and weight.   
 118 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
• You will have blood drawn for routine lab tests for safety, virologic, immunologic, and pharmacokinetic (to look at your body’s response to the study medication) studies;  and to 
measure the amount of HCV in your blood. If you are living with HIV, the amount of HIV in 
your blood and your CD4+ and CD8+ counts  will be measured. Some of the blood you 
provide will be stored for future protocol -required testing.  
If you are a woman and able to get pregnant, some of your blood or urine will be tested for pregnancy  at all on -treatment and post -treatment visits  and study discontinuation.   
• All participants, male and female, will be counseled on the risk of the study medications  in 
pregnancy and on how to prevent pregnancy while taking study medications .  
• You will be asked questions about drug use, sexual habits, and other risk factors for getting HCV.  
• You must return any remaining study medication before your last study visit.  
 
Unplanned visits  
During the study, you may have to come back to the clinic for extra visits for testing of any lab results that are not normal, or to follow up on a specific side effect or symptom.  During any 
unplanned visits, you may have the following tests done: clinical assessments, blood collection (including for PK studies) and laboratory testing, and complete a questionnaire.  
 
HCV Virologic Failure Confirmation  
If laboratory tests show there is evidence of virologic failure (the amount of HCV in your blood is 
still detectable when tested), you will be asked to return to the clinic to confirm your lab results. At this visit:  
• You will have a brief physical exam including vital signs and weight done.  
• You will have blood drawn for routine lab tests for safety, virologic, immunologic, and 
pharmacokinetic studies , to measure the amount of HCV in your blood,  and for an HCV 
resistance test (resistance means that the drugs are not likely to fight the HCV in your body).  
If you are living with HIV, to measure the amount of HIV in your blood.  Some of the blood 
you provide will be stored for future protocol -required testing.  
• You will be asked to stay on the study and complete all of the study visits.  
 
HIV Virologic Failure (Breakthrough)  Confirmation  
If laboratory tests show there is evidence of HIV virologic failure (the amount of  HIV in your 
blood is still detectable when tested) , you will be asked to return to the clinic to confirm your lab 
results. At this  visit: 
• You will have blood drawn for pharmacokinetic studies , HIV RNA (to measure the level of 
the HIV in the blood)  and for an HIV resistance test (resistance means that the drugs are not 
likely to fight the HIV in your body; also known as genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) will also be done.   
• You will be asked to stay on the study and complete all of the study visits.  
 
Early discontinuation 
If HCV virologic failure is confirmed, you will then complete an early discontinuation visit. There are two types of discontinuation (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544351]) in 
which you will be asked to come to the clinic for an extra visit.  Participants in Step [ADDRESS_711680]  
 119 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
HCV virologic failure confirmed will be followed through 12 weeks (or 24 weeks, if RBV is given) after treatment completion  or is discontinued, and no further treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_10748].  
 1. Stop study treatment early  
You or your doctor may decide to stop the study medication that you began at entry. If you must stop taking the study medication early, the study doctor may ask you to stay in the study and come in for some tests.  
 
2. Leave study early  
You or your doctor  may decide that you will no longer stay in the study or you are notified 
the study  is stopped early. You will be asked to complete some evaluations before being 
taken off the study.  
 II. Description of Part [ADDRESS_711681] the following samples collected and tested in thi s study:  
 Blood collected 
Blood will be taken from a vein in your arm for various tests during the study. These may 
include: routine safety lab tests such as  hematology (the study of blood), kidney and liver 
function; and  HCV viral load (a test that shows how much HCV is in your blood). For those who 
are living with HIV, HIV viral load and CD4+/CD8+ counts.  
 
Resistance testing  
Blood will be drawn and stored for future HCV/HIV resistance testing that is required for this study. A resistance test is used to determine if the HCV/HIV viruses still respond to your 
medications .  
 PK Studies  
Blood will be drawn to measure the levels of the drugs in your blood and to understand how the 
drugs interact with your body and how your body responds to the drugs .  
 Pregnancy test  
If you are a woman who is able to become pregnant, you will have blood or urine taken for 
pregnancy testing, or have a Point of Care (POC) test (a test with results available the same 
day) test done prior to study entry. After you enter the study , you will be asked to provide blood 
or urine samples for pregnancy testing.

FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
Pregnancy prevention counseling 
All participants, male and female, will be counseled on the risk of the study medications  in 
pregnancy and how to prevent  pregnancy.  
 
Study medication distribution  
Due to the longer treatment course (compared to Part 1 of the study), you will be given a 4-
week supply of study medication at your return study visits as indicated based on the length of 
therapy. You will be asked to bring any leftover study medication back to the clinic up to week 
16 (depending on your drug regimen in Part 2).  
 
Questionnaire  
You will be asked to fill out the following questionnaire:  
 Risk Factor Assessment 
You will be asked questions  about drug use, sexual habits , and other risk factors for getting 
HCV . 
 
HCV Reinfection Counseling  
You will be counseled by [CONTACT_544418]. Study staff will talk with you about how you could become re -
infected with HCV after being cured and ways to decrease risk of reinfection.  
 
 
CAN I CHOOSE THE TYPES OF RESEARCH THAT MY SAMPLES AND INFORMATION ARE USED FOR?  
 Some of your blood will be stored and used for study -required pharmacologic, immunologic, and 
virologic  testing. For non -US locations, biological specimens will be shipped and/or stored 
outside of the country from which they are collected.  
 
Identifiers will be removed from your samples and from any private information that has been 
collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other information will be 
able to know that the samples or information came from you.  
 
The tests described above are required by [CONTACT_15365]. If you do not agree to the storage or 
testing that has been described above, you should not join this study .  
  
Some blood that is collected from you during the study may be left over after all required st udy 
testing is done. This blood will be stored and, if you give your consent below, may be used for 
ACTG -approved research. This means that researchers who are not part of the protocol team 
may use your samples without asking you again for your consent. As  noted above, none of your 
samples will have any private information about you on their labels.  
 
You may decide whether this “extra” blood may be stored and, if so, whether additional testing 
may be performed on it. None of this testing will be used for c ommercial profit.

FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
At this time, we do not know whether any of the research will include testing of your genes or your DNA (your own genetic information). We do not know whether a type of testing called whole genome sequencing, or WGS, might be done. In WGS, researchers look at all of your 
genes and at almost all of your DNA. In “standard” genetic testing, researchers look at specific 
genes or subsets of genes, but not at all genes. Some possible genetic testing is described 
below.  
 
For each of the questions below, choose the response that matches what you want by [CONTACT_544419]. Please ask the staff any questions that you have before you 
indicate your selections.  
  
Research Without Human Genetic Testing – OPTIONAL (Research on leftover blood; no human 
genetic testing)

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
The number of people who enroll in Part 2 will depend upon participants’ responses to the study 
medication in Part 1.  
 
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN PART 2 OF THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be in Part 2 of this study for approximately 20- 40 weeks.  
  
WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE ME OFF PART 2 OF THIS STUDY EARLY?  
 
The study doctor may need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
• the study is cancelled.  
• a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommends that the study be stopped early (An 
SMC is an outside group of experts who monitor the study for safety).  
• your doctor thinks the study is no longer in your best interest.  
• the site investigator thinks that you are at significant risk of failing to comply with the 
requirements of the protocol.  
 
The study doctor may also need to take you off the study medications  without your permission 
if: 
• you experience HCV treatment failure.  
• you become pregnant.  
• if you are a male whose female partner becomes pregnant (only if you are taking RBV).  
• you are breast feeding.  
• continuing the study medications  may be harmful to you.  
• you need a treatment that you may not take while on the study. 
• you are not able to take the study medications  as required by [CONTACT_1758].  
• you have not had, or are not able to have, the  required study visits and evaluations  
 If you must stop taking the study medication earlier than indicated by [CONTACT_1758], the study doctor 
will ask you to remain on the study and complete the post discontinuation visits from the date that you took the last dose of study medication.  
 
If I have to permanently stop taking study medications  during Part [ADDRESS_711682] 
the study, how can I get study medications ? 
If you must permanently stop taking study medications  before the study is over, the study staff 
will talk with you about other options.  
 
After you have finished the study, you will not be able to get G/P through the study.

 WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
No clinical safety issues specifically related to G/P have been identified to date in HCV mono -
infected or HIV -1/HCV co -infected participants, without cirrhosis or with compensated  cirrhosis 
(the liver is heavily scarred but can still perform many important bodily functions). 
 
Risks of Social Harm  
Although the study site will make every effort to protect your privacy and confidentiality, it is 
possible that others could find out that you are participating in this study and that social harm 
may result (because you could become labeled as being diagnosed with HCV and/or living with 
HIV). For example, you could be treated unfairly or discriminated against by [CONTACT_103106], friends, and/or the community.  
 
Risks of Drawing Blood  
Drawing blood may cause some discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising 
where the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting, or infection.  
 
Risks of Study Medications  
The drugs used in this study may have side effects, some of which are listed below. Please note 
that these  lists do not include all the side effects seen with these drugs. These lists include the 
more serious or common side effects with a known or possible relationship. If you have questions concerning study medication side-effects, please ask the medical staff at your site.  To 
assist you in understanding your risk of side effects we have included reported percentages of 
these events in clinical studies of the medications concerned.  
 Glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (G/P)  
• Headaches - 9-16% 
• Fatigue - 11-14% 
• Diarrhea- 3- 7% 
• Nausea- 6- 12% 
• Asthenia (abnormal physical weakness or lack of energy) – 7% 
• Pruritic skin (itchy skin) – 17% 
• Abnor mal liver function tests - 3.5%  
 Ribavirin (RBV)  
Since RBV was given with IFN in most previous studies the risk of side- effects described here 
may be much lower than what could happen to you.  
• Anemia (low iron in your blood) - 12% 
• Severe hypersensitivity (your body’s inability to tolerate RBV) - up to 1%  
• Severe skin reactions (Stevens Johnson Syndrome) - up to 1%  
• Liver Failure – up to 1%  
• Bone marrow suppression (decrease in production of cells responsible for providing 
immunity, carrying oxygen, and/or those responsible for normal blood clotting)  – up to 10%  
 124 A5380 
FINAL Version 1.0  
  06/07/19  
 
• Pancreatitis  (inflammatio n of the pancreas [the organ responsible for releases digestive 
enzymes into the small intestine to aid the digestion of food, and releases the hormones 
insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream, which help the body control how it uses food for 
energy.])  – up to 1%  
• Pulmonary pneumonitis  (infection of the lungs that causes inflammation of the lung tissue)  – 
up to 1%  
 
RBV must always be taken along with another hepatitis C medication; RBV alone is not effective for treatment of hepatitis C. RBV has been shown to cause birth defects in all animals that are 
exposed to this drug. Participants who are put on this medication in this study must agree to be on/use two different forms of birth control. Both men and women taking this drug must take extra care to avoid pregnancy while they are taking this drug and for [ADDRESS_711683] 
dose of RBV. Additional pregnancy testing will be done if you are a woman of child bearing 
potential taking this drug. RBV can also cause severe anemia which could cause life threatening 
heart attacks in people with underlying heart disease.  
 Interactions between RBV and the HIV drugs didanosine (DDI), stavudine (D4T) or zidovudine 
(AZT) can cause increased risk of side effects of these drugs and as such if you are on any of 
these medications, your HIV provider would need to change your regimen if you need to take 
RBV in Part 2.   
 There is a risk of serious and/ or life -threatening side effects when some non -study medications 
are taken with the study medication. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse 
about all medications you are taking before you start the study and before starting any new medic ations while on the study. Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in 
any other clinical trials while on this study. If you believe you are having side effects from any of the study medications make sure to immediately inform your study team.  
 
Bradycardia, or slow heart rate, may happen in persons who are taking digoxin (a medicine that 
is used to treat heart failure and heart rhythm problems) particularly for those with a heart 
disorder and/or advanced kidney disease. Because of this risk the dose of digoxin must be 
reduced by [CONTACT_544413] G/P and be closely monitored. It is also not 
recommended to take G/P with cholesterol lowering medications such as simvastatin, lovastati n, 
atorvastati n. Other forms of cholesterol lowering medications such as fluvastatin, pravastatin, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2830],  and rosuvastatin can be used either at lower doses or at the same dose with 
careful monitoring; you will need to check with your doctor.  
 Drug interactions that increase the levels of medicine in your blood may increase the chances of side effects. Drug interactions that could affect the levels of  G/P or  HIV medicines in your blood 
could cause changes in liver enzymes and other abnormal blood tests. For certain HIV medications, we may ask  you to change them to another medication to reduce this risk. Drug 
interactions that lower the levels of glecaprevir or pi[INVESTIGATOR_544347] a cure of hepatitis C and/or cause drug resistance (the virus changes form and  
drugs that used to work, no longer work) .

  06/07/[ADDRESS_711684] the potency of this drug in fighting hepatitis C virus. The HIV medication atazanavir  when it is taken together with G/P can cause increases in liver 
enzymes and the combination should be avoided.  Examples of other medications that should 
not be taken with G/P include:  
• St. John’s wort  
• Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
• Rifampin  
• Ethinyl  estradiol containing birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_544349]. HCV viral load will be 
monitored regularly to ensure that evidence of early failure of the HCV regimen is identified 
quickly. Development of resistance after failing G/P has not been studied that well. However, 
studies so far suggest that use of G/P could select for mutations (permanent changes in genetic 
material) in the NS3 and NS5A gene which could cause varying levels of resistance to gleca previr and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]. The impact of these resistance associated mutations is still not 
known.   
 
Some people with HCV and HBV  coinfection receiving therapy for HCV  with direct -acting 
antivirals (DAA) like glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_544352]. Some of 
these cases have led to severe hepatitis, liver failure and death. This has been reported in

ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY?  
 The drugs or drug combinations in this study may be unsafe for unborn babies. There is also 
evidence that the use of RBV can result in birth defects. Therefore, becoming pregnant is not 
allowed. If you are having sex that could lead to pregnancy, you must agree not to bec ome 
pregnant. Note that if you become pregnant  or if you are a man whose female partner becomes 
pregnant , the study medications  will be stopped, and you will be followed after delivery.  
 
Because of the potential risk involved and due to the uncertainty of risk to the fetus, you and 
your partner must use birth control. You must use one form of the birth control methods listed 
below, while receiving study medication and for [ADDRESS_711686] 
RBV dose:  
• A condom (male or female) with spermicide  
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide  
• An intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Tubal ligation  
• Hormone- based contraceptives  
 
If you can become pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_711687]. Pregnancy will result in imm ediate 
discontinuation of the study medications . You will be followed on study until study completion. 
You will be asked to return to the clinic 6 months after the end of your pregnancy to follow up on 
any side effects. In addition, pregnancy complications  and/or pregnancy outcomes will be 
reported to the company that makes G/P, [COMPANY_013], by [CONTACT_544415] (NIAID). If you are also 
living with HIV and become pregnant while on study, pregnancy  complications and/or pregnancy  
outcomes will be reported to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry . 
 
It is not known if G/P is present in breast milk in women who are breastfeeding. Studies done in 
animals however show that there are low concentrations of the drug in breast milk in laboratory rats. This did not appear to affect these animals. Breastfeeding is not allowed while on G/P.  It is 
not known if RBV is present in breast milk , however because of possible side effects to breast 
fed babies , breast feeding is not recommended in women taking RBV.  
 If you are a man whose female partner becomes pregnant, then you will be asked to report this 
event to study staff and discontinue therapy. You may also be asked to report on your partner’s 
pregnancy outcomes.

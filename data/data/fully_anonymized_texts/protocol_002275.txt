To evaluate progression free survival of the combination rucaparib and nivolumab as maintenance 
therapy in platinum sensitive (as defined by [CONTACT_240316]/PR via RECIST V1.1) extensive stage SCLC after 
response to initial platinum-based therapy. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives:  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1200695] induction 
chemotherapy baseline (complete response, CR; partial response, PR) or fulfilling the criteria for 
stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.1). 
Patients with CR will be considered to have disease control if they continue to remain in CR since 
they do not have measurable disease at baseline.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_1200696] dose of trial medication to date of death due to any cause. 
1.2.3 To evaluate potential biomarkers for durability of response, especially tumor mutation 
burden (refer to Biomarker Section). 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1200697] 
V1.1. Patients with CR at baseline will be excluded from objective response rate (ORR) analysis. 
1.2.6 To evaluate quality of life (QOL). Quality of life is assessed by [CONTACT_861400], standardized 
EORTC questionnaires (specifically the QLQ-C30 and the LC-13) on screening/pre-study (for pre-
treatment baseline), once during treatment, and at the end of treatment. These EORTC QOL 
measures are located in Appendix D.  
1.2.7 To explore in a preliminary manner the response of genomic subsets to treatment focusing 
on tumor mutation burden, cMEK and TP53 mutation analysis of tumor tissue and evaluation of 
response, using the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) consortium 
whole exome sequencing platform to evaluate tumor mutation burden, somatic and germline 
mutations.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
2.1 Background 
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies with a 5-year survival rate
less than 7%. SCLC is characterized by [CONTACT_452644], high growth fraction and early 
development of widespread metastases. SCLC accounts for roughly 93% of all high-grade
neuroendocrine carcinomas [1]. The prognosis for SCLC is extremely poor with median survival less 
than a year for extensive-stage disease. Therapeutic options have not advanced significantly in over 
two decades, with frontline treatment consisting of platinum doublet therapy for 3-[ADDRESS_1200698] patients show an initial favorable response to Carboplatin/cisplatin + etoposide or 
Cisplatin/Carboplatin +Irinotecan, this response is usually short-lived. Most patients relapse with 
relatively resistant disease between [ADDRESS_1200699] of 2012 (H.R. 
733) requires the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop a scientific framework that assists in 
making progress against recalcitrant or deadly cancers, specifically cancers with 5-year relative 
survival rates below 50%. Small cell lung cancer  clearly qualifies as a recalcitrant cancer via its less 
than 7% 5-year survival rate [2]. Kentucky unfortunately has highest lung cancer incidence and 
mortality in the U.S., with approximately 20% of lung cancer cases being SCLC [3].

8 2.2 Rationale for the Combination of PARP and Checkpoint Inhibition
PARP Inhibitors 
Platinum-based compounds, the backbone of SCLC treatment, cause harmful DNA cross-links, 
which interfere with DNA repair mechanisms and induce DNA damage. Similar to other solid 
tumors, SCLC is characterized by [CONTACT_546765], and dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms 
can contribute to this feature. Targeting DNA repair itself can also represent a novel therapeutic 
strategy for SCLC to increase cytotoxicity of anticancer agents, reverse chemotherapy resistance 
and improve therapeutic efficacy [4]. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) is a key enzyme of 
the base excision repair (BER) system, specifically involved in DNA single-strand break (SSB) 
repair, and an E2F1 co-activator. PARP1 was found to be expressed at the highest relative levels 
among the DNA repair proteins in SCLC [5]. Because PARP1 plays an independent role as an 
E2F1 co-activator [6, 7], it is hypothesized that its inhibition may have a dual role, with direct
effects on DNA repair and on other E2F1-regulated DNA repair proteins. Antitumor activity of 
PARP1 inhibition was confirmed in SCLC cell lines [5]. 
Summary of Non-clinical Experience with rucaparib
The results from nonclinical studies are consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action and 
pharmacological effects of PARP inhibition. Pharmacological assessment demonstrated that 
rucaparib is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-[ADDRESS_1200700] and 
durable in vitro and in vivo activity in multiple BRCA1/2-mutant cell lines and xenograft models. 

MCC Protocol #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.2022 
9 Rucaparib was also active in a BRCA wild-type model, consistent with in vitro data suggesting 
that rucaparib is active in cells with other defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
through synthetic lethality. In vitro screens suggested that rucaparib has a limited potential for off-
target effects. Safety pharmacology studies suggest that when given orally, rucaparib poses a 
minimal risk for causing neurobehavioral and cardiac effects in patients.
In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, rucaparib demonstrated species-dependent oral bioavailability, 
moderate plasma protein binding, and large volumes of distribution in nonclinical species. As a P-
glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate, rucaparib demonstrated 
minimal penetration of rucaparib-derived radioactivity through the blood-brain barrier in rats. In 
vitro data suggested slow metabolism by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) enzymes, with CYP2D6 and to 
a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism of rucaparib. Rucaparib was 
mainly excreted in feces in rats and dogs after oral dosing.
In vitro, rucaparib reversibly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A, and to a lesser 
extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 
(UGT1A1). Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and down-regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human 
hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of multidrug and toxin 
extrusion 1 (MATE1) and MATE2-K, a moderate inhibitor of organic cationic transporter 1 
(OCT1), and may inhibit P-gp and BCRP in the gut. 
Oral dosing of rucaparib in single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs resulted in 
toxicity to the hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and gastrointestinal systems. These toxicities were 
generally both reversible upon recovery and predictive of toxicities observed in patients. Rucaparib 
was shown to be clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay suggesting potential 
genotoxicity in humans.  
Reproductive and development toxicity studies in rat showed that rucaparib caused maternal 
toxicity and was embryotoxic. Although no rucaparib-related effects on sperm total count, density, 
motility, or morphology were identified, based on published studies, PARP inhibitors have the 
potential to impair spermatogenesis and reduce fertility [8-11]. 
Summary of Clinical Experience with rucaparib
Rucaparib is being evaluated in Phase 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1200701] evidence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). There are 4 clinical studies 
in patients with relapsed, high-grade epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal 
cancer: a Phase 2 study in patients whose cancer is associated with a germline BRCA (gBRCA) 
mutation (Study CO-338-010 [Study 10]); a Phase 2 biomarker study (Study CO-338-017 
[ARIEL2]) designed to refine the molecular signature [CONTACT_861450] a response 
to rucaparib; a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (Study CO-338-014 [ARIEL3]) 
evaluating rucaparib as switch maintenance treatment; and Phase 3 Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4), 
which is evaluating rucaparib versus chemotherapy in BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer patients 
with relapsed disease.
Phase 2 Study CO-338-052 (TRITON2) and Phase 3 Study CO-338-063 (TRITON3) are 
evaluating rucaparib as treatment for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer

10 (mCRPC) associated with HRD. An additional Phase 2 study in mCRPC patients is evaluating 
rucaparib in combination with nivolumab. Additional studies of rucaparib as monotherapy and in 
combination with other anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861364], as well as other tumor 
types, are planned. The rucaparib clinical studies and results are described in more detail in the 
rucaparib investigator brochure (IB). 
PARP1 inhibition has shown clinical activity in SCLC as single agent and in combination with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy [12, 13]. Because of the abovementioned preclinical and clinical data, 
PARP1 inhibitors are considered among the target of choice for high-grade neuroendocrine 
carcinoma.

Discovery)
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Immunotherapy has revolutionized the field of oncology due to relatively low toxicity of these agents 
and potential for durable response. High tumor mutation burden and expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 
are often predictive of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors. This may also hold true for SCLC 
[14]. Up to 18% of SCLC patients have PD-L1 expression in tumor infiltrating macrophages and 48% 
SCLC cases showed PD-1 positive lymphocytes [15]. Another study reported PD-L1 expression in 
10.4% of LCNEC and 5.8% of SCLC tumors [16]. Based on strong preclinical rationale, immune 
checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy for 
SCLC. 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have also made it to NCCN guidelines for the management of 
progressive metastatic SCLC as well as front line treatment in combination with chemotherapy. IM

11 Power 133 Phase III clinical trial reported efficacy of atezolizumab in SCLC. 201 patients were 
randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202 patients to the placebo group. At a median 
follow-up of 13.9 months, the median overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 
10.3 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 
0.91; P=0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3 months, respectively 
(hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02) (50). Because of 
the above-mentioned positive study, Atezolizumab is now a one of the category [ADDRESS_1200702] 3-4 month is mostly from platinum-based 
chemotherapy. A detailed look at IM Power 133 Kaplan Meier curves will highlight that benefit of 
adding atezolizumab was not evident until 2-4 months into the maintenance phase (Fig 2). Moreover, 
since the cycle [ADDRESS_1200703] 2 months. Considering SCLC is an aggressive cancer with dismal outcomes, we 
ought to strive for better responses and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We believe that by [CONTACT_20683] a platinum sensitive 
SCLC patient population and by [CONTACT_1583] a potent anti-tumor agent (PARP inhibitor) to immune 
checkpoint inhibitor, we will hopefully see a sharp improvement in outcomes. 
Since Atezolizumab is now considered standard of care (SOC) frontline treatment option for SCLC, 
we will offer newly diagnosed SCLC patient Atezolizumab + Platinum doublet chemotherapy per 
SOC. However, we will also make patients aware of our clinical trial and if they are interested then 
we will prescreen them for the trial. If patient meets any of the exclusion criteria, they will be offered 
SOC therapy instead.

Combination of Rucaparib (PARP inhibitor) with Nivolumab (Immune checkpoint 
inhibitor) 
There is preclinical evidence suggesting that DNA damage promotes neo- antigen expression, and 
DNA-damaging agents result in systemic antitumor responses [17]. Increased DNA damage by a 
PARP inhibitor (PARPi) could potentially yield a greater mutational burden and expand neo-antigens 
[18]. Therefore, addition of PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_861365]. Recently Jiao et al. demonstrated that PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_861366]-L1 expression in breast cancer cell lines and animal models. This is thought to be regulated by 

[CONTACT_861401] #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC  
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.2022 
13 -mediated PD-L1 upregulation. 
PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_861367]-L1, and blockade of PD-L1 
resensitized PARPi-treated cancer cells to T-cell killing [19]. PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_861368], resulting in 
DNA breaks [20]. Fragments of these DNA breaks can enter the cytoplasm and bind to cyclic GMP-
AMP synthase (cGAS) leading to an upregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway within the tumor 
microenvironment, a potent activator of a type I interferons and other immunomodulatory molecules 
[21]. This may explain why olaparib and talazoparib up-regulate PD-L1 expression in preclinical 
models [19]. This could potentiate an anti-tumor immune response.  
Cancers with defects in DNA repair generate excessive tumor neo-antigens, making them sensitive to 
both PARP inhibition and immune activation with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, we 
anticipate the combination of rucaparib and nivolumab to be synergistic. The lack of therapeutic 
options in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas like SCLC, dismal survival statistics, non-
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_861369], and robust 
preclinical data supporting potential activity of PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in 
high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma make this combination suitable for maintenance post induction 
chemotherapy. Phase I/II clinical trials of PARP inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors are currently being explored in a variety of solid tumors. (niraparib in combination with 
pembrolizumab and olaparib in combination with durvalumab) [22]. 
Based on preclinical data supporting the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors and PARP inhibitors in 
small cell lung cancer, we feel that combining these two agents has the potential to prolong progression 
free survival and overall survival. These two classes of drugs have non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685]. This 
novel combination has not been tried in a front-line maintenance setting for SCLC.  
 
A single arm Phase II trial will be performed using FDA approved single agent dosage for both 
nivolumab and rucaparib. Median progression-free survival (PFS) will be compared to historical PFS 
for stage IV SCLC. Based on a phase III randomized clinical trial conducted by [CONTACT_861402] (ECOG), the historical median PFS for Stage IV SCLC post platinum doublet in 
platinum sensitive patients is 2.3 months in the observation arm vs 3.6 month on maintenance 
topotecan arm, a 56 % improvement [23]. We expect our experimental combination will outperform 
topotecan. Assuming a median PFS of 3.6 months from the topotecan arm as historical data, we will 
hypothesize a 75% improvement with the combination of rucaparib and nivolumab (median PFS = 6.3 
months). This is justified by [CONTACT_861403] (unpublished) 
which exhibited exceptional durable responses in second and third line SCLC. Of 59 treated patients 
with nivolumab 3 mg/kg investigator-assessed objective response rates were 12% (95% CI, 5% to 23%). 
Responses were observed regardless of tumor-programmed death-ligand 1 status. With a median follow-
up of 28 months, 12-month progression-free survival rates were 8%, 12-month OS rates were 39% 
respectively [49] 
Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the proposed combination of nivolumab and rucaparib as 
maintenance after front line chemotherapy will show even better responses.

Study Agents: Rucaparib
Rucaparib is a small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3 that has demonstrated 
preclinical and clinical activity in cancers associated with a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2 or 
other HRR gene and/or high level of genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Rucaparib was 
approved by [CONTACT_861404] 2016 for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA 
mutations (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who had been treated 
with 2 or more chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [24] More recently, rucaparib demonstrated improved PFS in the 
maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Although 
HRD was predictive of response to rucaparib, activity was also observed in HRD-negative patients, 
suggesting an incomplete understanding of biomarkers responsible for PARP inhibitor sensitivity 
[25]. 
Prior Experience with rucaparib
OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Assessment of rucaparib PK in cancer patients showed an approximate dose-proportional exposure 
after once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) dosing, rapid absorption with maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) achieved within 1.5 to 6 hours. The oral bioavailability was 36% and terminal 
half-life (T 1/2) was approximately 24 hours. Rucaparib was moderately bound to human plasma 
proteins in vitro (70%). 
At a dose of 600 mg rucaparib BID, steady-state was achieved after approximately 1 week with 
approximately 4-fold accumulation. At the target clinical dose of 600 mg, a high-fat meal increased 
the C max and area under the 0 to 24 hour plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24h) of rucaparib 
by 20% and 38%, respectively, and delayed the median time to occurrence of C max(Tmax) by 
[CONTACT_3450] 2.[ADDRESS_1200704] of 
food on rucaparib PK is not considered to be clinically significant, thus rucaparib can be taken 
with or without food.  
In cancer patients, M324, a carboxylic acid, was a major inactive metabolite of rucaparib. Drug 
interactions with rucaparib as a substrate were assessed in a population PK analysis. CYP2D6 
phenotypes (poor metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, normal metabolizers, and ultra-rapid 
metabolizers) and CYP1A2 phenotypes (normal metabolizers and hyperinducers) did not 
significantly impact the steady-state exposure of rucaparib at [ADDRESS_1200705] that CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 play a limited role in rucaparib metabolism in vivo. 
Although in vitro rucaparib metabolism mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 was slow, a significant contribution 
of CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. No rucaparib dose adjustment is needed when 
concomitantly administered with CYP inhibitors or inducers. 
Concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) showed no clinically significant effect 
on rucaparib PK. No dose modification of rucaparib is required for patients who are receiving 
concomitant treatment with a PPI. Results from Study CO-338-044 evaluating potential drug-drug 
interactions (DDI) with rucaparib, indicated that rucaparib, at 600 mg BID, moderately inhibited 
CYP1A2, weakly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A, and showed no clinically significant

use of drugs that are sensitive clinical substrates of the above CYP enzymes. 
2.3.2 OVERVIEW OF EFFICACY
Ovarian Cancer Treatment Indication 
On 19 December 2016, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the marketing of rucaparib 
(Rubraca®) for monotherapy treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or 
[26]. 
The recommended dose of rucaparib is [ADDRESS_1200707] Version 1.1 (v1.1), with ORR determined by [CONTACT_861405] (IRR) conducted as a supportive analysis. ORR by [CONTACT_861406] 53.8%, while 
ORR by [CONTACT_171332] 41.5%, which confirms the investigator' assessment for this endpoint [27]. 
Responses were durable, indicated by a duration of response (DOR) by [CONTACT_861407] 9.2 months [24]. 
2.3.3 Ovarian Cancer Maintenance Indication 
The efficacy of rucaparib monotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the maintenance 
setting was demonstrated from Study CO-338-014 showing significant benefit of rucaparib compared 
to placebo across primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints [25]. In this study, investigator-
assessed PFS was the primary efficacy endpoint, with PFS by [CONTACT_861408] a key, 
stand-alone, secondary endpoint. Rucaparib maintenance treatment significantly improved PFS 
compared with placebo in all primary analysis groups of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer after a 
complete or partial response to platinum-based therapy ( Table 1). Overall, rucaparib as maintenance 
treatment reduced the risk of progression by 63.5% (hazard ratio 0.365 [95% CI, 0.295 0.451]; p < 
0.0001) in the ITT population, demonstrating a strong treatment effect over placebo. Analysis of non-
nested, non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_861370] (deleterious tumor 
alteration in BRCA) subpopulations ( Table 1). Nearly half (44.6%) of the patients in the rucaparib 
group showed benefit at 1 year compared to 8.8% in the placebo group [25]. At 18 and 24 months, 
32.0% and 26.0%, respectively, of patients who received rucaparib were still progression-free 
compared to 5.8% and 2.6% in the placebo group [25]. These investigator-assessed results were 
confirmed by [CONTACT_861409] [25].

17 2.3.4 OVERVIEW OF SAFETY - RUCAPARIB
The US prescribing information (USPI) for rucaparib in the treatment setting is based on [ADDRESS_1200709] common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
nausea, asthenia/fatigue, vomiting, anemia/hemoglobin decrease, increased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST), constipation, decreased appetite, and dysgeusia [26]. 
Commonly experienced Grade 3 or higher TEAEs included anemia/hemoglobin decreased, 
asthenia/fatigue, and increased ALT/AST. Results of a more recent integrated safety analysis in over 
[ADDRESS_1200710] common TEAEs reported were primarily mild to moderate (Grade 1-2) 
in severity and included gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and 
abdominal pain), asthenia/fatigue, anemia/decreased hemoglobin, increased ALT/AST, decreased 
appetite, and dysgeusia. The most common TEAEs 
increased ALT/AST, neutropenia/decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and asthenia/fatigue. 
Laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the TEAEs; the most commonly occurring were 
decreased hemoglobin (and associated increases in mean corpuscular volume [MCV] and mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH]), increased ALT, increased AST, and increased serum creatinine. 
Decreased platelets, neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, and increased cholesterol were observed to 
a lesser extent. The transient elevations in ALT/AST with rucaparib, in either the treatment or 
maintenance settings were not associated with abnormal increases in bilirubin or other criteria for 
drug-induced hepatotoxicity, and generally resolved over time. Furthermore, no cases met Hy’s law 
criteria for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and few patients discontinued rucaparib due to ALT/AST 
elevations [24, 25]. Similarly, elevations in creatinine were self-limiting and stabilized over time. 
Elevated serum creatinine levels resolved upon interruption or discontinuation of rucaparib, were not 
accompanied by [CONTACT_171334] (BUN) and did not lead to discontinuation of rucaparib 
treatment [24, 25]. Increased creatinine with rucaparib treatment is likely due to the potent inhibition 
by [CONTACT_171335]1 and MATE2-K renal transporters.
Effects on cardiac channel activity in vitro and a comprehensive assessment of the effects of rucaparib 
on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in cancer patients demonstrated a low risk of cardiac effects 
by [CONTACT_171336].
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are considered adverse events 
of special interest (AESIs), as these events have been observed in patients exposed to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (e.g., platinum and anthracyclines) used for treatment of ovarian cancer as well as with 
PARP inhibitors, including rucaparib. Patients in rucaparib clinical studies diagnosed with MDS or 
AML had significant confounding risk factors including prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, as well as 
deleterious BRCA mutations [28, 29]. Based on these confounding factors, there is insufficient 
scientific evidence to conclude that MDS and AML are causally related to rucaparib. Clovis has added 
these potential risks to all Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) / Patient Information Sheets (PI[INVESTIGATOR_53582]). AESI’s 
(both serious and non-serious) will be reported to Clovis within 48 hours of detection and will continue 
to be reported to Clovis under serious adverse event (SAE) reporting requirements. 
More information on AESIs for rucaparib is provided in the rucaparib IB. This information is also 
found in Appendix B.

Rationale for suggested Biomarkers: 
Tumor mutation burden (TMB): Immune checkpoint inhibitor responders tend to have high tumor 
mutation burden (e.g., melanoma, NSCLC, bladder cancer, and microsatellite unstable colorectal 
cancers) [35-38]. Recent data presented at World Lung Meeting suggested a superior response to 
nivolumab in SCLC patients with high TMB [39].  
Smoking status: Smoking has been associated with higher tumor mutational burden and might 
portend a favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibition [40]. We will evaluate whether smoking 
is associated with distinctive mutations, which might predict a favorable response to therapy among 
SCLC patients. 
Micro Satellite Instability (MSI) Status: MSI occurs in a small portion of cancers and represents a 
potential subgroup of patients who might benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy. [35, 37] 
Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation: PARP inhibitors work by [CONTACT_861413]1 or BRCA 2. PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_861373]-mutant cells by [CONTACT_861414]-stranded breaks that result in irreparable DNA double-strand breaks during replication, 
culminating in cell death. We will check for presence of germline BRCA1/2 mutations and evaluate 
as a correlation to response.  
2.6 Rationale for Immune Biomarkers
The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) has provided the roadmap and regular updates on 
immune biomarker development. [41-43].Immunological changes in peripheral blood and the tumor 
could potentially reflect tumor response in patients and serve as immune biomarkers.  
For all study participants: we will be collecting peripheral blood (two 8ml CPT Vacutainer tubes 
with sodium citrate) for flow cytometry at two timepoints, pre-study baseline and during treatment 
(Cycle 3 Day 1) by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cohen’s lab. A total of 16 mL of blood will be collected at each timepoint, 
for cumulative total of 32 mL.  
For all study participants, we will be collecting an additional 10 ml of whole blood (Streck tube) at 
pre-study baseline, and approximately every 2 months (e.g., at 2-months, at 4-months) and at the 
time of progression (for up to a total of 4 blood sample collections) based on SITC recommendations 
to evaluate TP53 levels ([CONTACT_696136]’s lab). It is possible that a total of 40 mL of blood will be 
collected (one 10mL tube drawn at 4 different timepoints).  
For any study participant co-enrolled in Total Cancer Care, peripheral blood is collected at baseline
per the ORIEN protocol for germline mutation testing.  Additionally, for these co-enrolled 
participants, tumor tissue (if available) for whole exome sequencing is also collected at baseline per
the ORIEN protocol. These blood/tissue collections are not part of this study protocol, however the 
results re: tumor mutations will be used in ancillary analyses of correlatives studies in this protocol.

Informed Consent
The goal of the informed consent process is to provide sufficient information so that potential 
participants can make informed choices about whether to begin or continue participation in clinical 
research. The process involves a dynamic and continuing exchange of information between the 
research team and the participant throughout the research experience. It includes discussion of the 
study’s purpose, research procedures, risks and potential benefits, and the voluntary nature of 
participation.
The informed consent document provides a summary of the clinical study and the individual’s rights 
as a research participant. The document acts as a starting point for the necessary exchange of 
information between the investigator and potential research participant. Also, research participants 
and their families may use the consent document as an information resource and reference throughout 
participation in the trial. The informed consent document is often considered the foundation of the 
informed consent process; it does not, however, represent the entirety of the process. Nor is the 
informed consent document a risk-management tool for the investigator and/or institution.
The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature of the 
study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits 
involved, and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the 
study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that withdrawal of 
consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician.
This informed consent shall be provided as a standard written statement, written in non-technical 
language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating it and should 
be given a copy of the signed document. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent 
has been obtained. The informed consent form is considered part of the protocol and must be submitted 
by [CONTACT_181612].
Compliance with Laws and Regulations

Nivolumab and Rucaparib Administration
The recommended starting dose of rucaparib as a continuously administered oral monotherapy is 600 
mg BID. Patients may take rucaparib with or without food. Each dose should be taken with 
approximately 8 oz. (240 mL) of room temperature water. Tablets should be swallowed whole without 
crushing or chewing. Patients should take rucaparib doses as close as possible to 12 hours apart, 
preferably at the same time every day. If a patient misses a dose (i.e., does not take it within 4 hours 
of the scheduled time), the patient should skip the missed dose and resume by [CONTACT_861416]. Missed or vomited doses should not be made up.  
Modification of rucaparib dose may be a necessary component of AE management, and study-specific 
protocol guidelines for dose modifications should be followed. See Section 6.   
Nivolumab will be administered as intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks at fixed dose of 480 mg. 
The FDA has approved a supplemental biologics license application adding a 4-week dosing schedule 
for nivolumab (Opdivo) across several of the PD-1 inhibitor’s indications (non-small cell lung cancer, 
renal cell carcinoma, metastatic urothelial carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, metastatic squamous cell
carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma). Adding a q [ADDRESS_1200722] had no 
problem with using q4 week dosing in SCLC at our center. No dose modification will be allowed
(other than hold or discontinue). Please refer to Section 6 for guidance regarding Nivolumab schedule 
in response to toxicity .
Drug-drug Interactions
Cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme Inhibitors, Inducers, and Substrates
Based on the results from the in vivo CYP interaction study (CO-338-044), rucaparib is a moderate 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Caution should be 
used with concomitant medications that are sensitive clinical substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and/or CYP3A (see IB for rucaparib). Although in vitro rucaparib metabolism mediated 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4 was slow, a significant contribution of CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. Caution 
should be used for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers such as voriconazole, 
clarithromycin etc. (see the FDA website for a list of examples of sensitive clinical substrates and 
strong perpetrators of the above--mentioned enzymes). Selection of an alternative concomitant 
medication is recommended, and concomitant medication use among study participants will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_861417].  
Effects of Rucaparib on Other Medicinal Products or Concomitant Drugs 
At the steady-state following treatment with [ADDRESS_1200723] a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine, theophylline), dose 
adjustments may be considered based on appropriate clinical monitoring.  
CYP2C19 Substrates  No dose adjustment is considered necessary for co-administered medicinal 
products that are CYP2C19 substrates. CYP3A Substrates Caution is advised when co-administering 
MCC Protocol #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.2022 
29 medicinal products that are CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, 
astemizole, cisapride, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, 
sirolimus, tacrolimus, terfenadine). Dose adjustments may be considered, if clinically indicated 
based on observed AEs.  
P-gp Substrates  No dose adjustment is recommended for co-administered medicinal products that 
are P-gp substrates. 
Other Enzymes and Transporters  Interaction of rucaparib with other enzymes and transporters 
was evaluated in vitro. Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1. 
Rucaparib down regulated CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. 
In vitro, rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K, a moderate inhibitor of OCT1, 
and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these transporters could increase metformin renal 
elimination and decrease liver uptake of metformin, caution is advised when metformin is co-
administered with rucaparib.  
In addition, rucaparib is an inhibitor of the BCRP with an IC 50 value suggesting potential BCRP 
inhibition and increased exposures of medicinal products that are BCRP substrates (e.g., 
rosuvastatin). 
Effect of Food on Rucaparib Exposures :  A high-fat meal increased C max by 20% and increased 
AUC 0-24 by 38%. The effect is not considered clinically significant. In clinical studies, rucaparib was 
administered with or without food. 
There were no meaningful changes in cytokines known to have indirect effects on CYP enzymes 
across all dose levels of nivolumab (0.3, 2 and 10 mg/kg) during the course of treatment. This lack 
of cytokine modulation suggests that nivolumab has no or low potential for modulating CYP 
enzymes, thereby [CONTACT_124439] a low risk of therapeutic protein-drug interaction. 
Anticoagulants 
Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo. Warfarin, Coumadin, Tizanidine and Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_861378]. Use of similar medications inhibiting CYP2C9 will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_861418]-study.  
Other Concomitant Medications 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171295]’s well-being may be given at the discretion of the

30 Rucaparib marginally increased digoxin area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
(AUC) by 20%. Caution should be exercised for patients receiving rucaparib and requiring 
concomitant medication with digoxin. Patients taking digoxin should have their digoxin 
levels monitored after starting rucaparib and then regularly per standard clinical practice. 
In vitro, rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2-K, a moderate inhibitor of 
OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these transporters could increase 
metformin renal elimination and decrease liver uptake of metformin, caution is advised 
when metformin is co-administered with rucaparib.  
In addition, rucaparib is an inhibitor of the BCRP with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
value suggesting potential BCRP inhibition and increased exposures of medicinal products 
that are BCRP substrate (e.g., rosuvastatin ).
Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 24 months or 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
Disease progression, 
Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
Unacceptable adverse event(s), 
Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator
The date and the reason for removal from study treatment must be documented in the Case 
Report Form. 
Duration of Follow-Up
Patients will be followed until death or [ADDRESS_1200724].
Patients removed from study therapy due to unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed per 
protocol, until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
Criteria for Removal from Study 
Patients will be removed from study therapy when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.[ADDRESS_1200725] be documented in the Case Report Form.

31 6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
Doses of oral study drug (rucaparib), and/or IV study drug (nivolumab), may be interrupted or delayed for 
toxicity and other protocol-specified criteria. Dose reductions are permitted for Rucaparib, but not for 
Nivolumab. The assessment for delay or discontinuation should be made separately for the oral study drug 
(rucaparib) and the IV study drug (nivolumab) where class-specific safety profiles do not overlap; however, 
if toxicity is considered related to all study drugs or if the investigator is unable to determine which study 
drug is the cause of the AE, then all study drugs in the combination should be delayed and/or discontinued.
For management of AEs which can be clearly attributed to rucaparib OR nivolumab, independent 
dose modification for either agent is allowed. If the relationship to an AE that is common to both drugs 
can be clearly distinguished, then a recommendation from the ET CCART for continuation of the non-
offending drug can be requested by [CONTACT_093].  Treatment may be prematurely discontinued due to 
withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, completion of treatment cycles, or 
termination of the study, whichever occurs first.  
Dose modification and re-treatment of oral and/or IV study drug are to be based on criteria presented in 
Table 4.

Supportive care guideline for rucaparib and nivolumab toxicity
Opportunistic Infections: It is rare for a patient receiving immunosuppression for nivolumab-related AEs 
to develop an opportunistic infection. Subjects with inflammatory events of any organ category expected to 
require more than 4 weeks of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive agents to manage the AE should be 
considered for antimicrobial/antifungal prophylaxis, per institutional guidelines, to prevent opportunistic 
infections such as P. jiroveci (formerly P carinii) and fungal infections. 
Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis: Nivolumab can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as 
requiring use of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology. Fatal cases have been reported. 
Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and for symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for moderate (Grade 2) or more severe 
(Grade 3-4) pneumonitis, followed by [CONTACT_318592]. Please refer to section 6 for dose modification 
guidance.

mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by [CONTACT_318590] (Grade 2) colitis of more 
than 5 days duration; if worsening or no improvement occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_861380], increase 
dose to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents. Refer to section 6 for dose modification guidance. 
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis : Nivolumab can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use 
of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology. Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and 
periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents 
followed by [CONTACT_861421] (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) transaminase elevations, 
with or without concomitant elevation in total bilirubin. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 
mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for moderate (Grade 2) transaminase elevations. Refer to section 6 for dose 
modification guidance.  Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies : Nivolumab can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Monitor 
patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement as clinically indicated and 
corticosteroids at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by [CONTACT_318590] 
(Grade 2) or greater hypophysitis. Refer to section 6 for dose modification guidance. 
Adrenal Insufficiency : Nivolumab can cause immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency. Monitor patients for 
signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
prednisone equivalents followed by a corticosteroid taper for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) 
adrenal insufficiency. Please refer to section 6 for dose modification guidance.Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction : Nivolumab can cause immune-mediated 
nephritis, defined as renal dysfunction or Grade 2 increased creatinine, requirement for corticosteroids, and no 
clear alternate etiology. Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during 
treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by 
[CONTACT_318591]-threatening (Grade 4) increased serum creatinine. Administer corticosteroids at a 
dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) increased 
serum creatinine, if worsening or no improvement occurs, increase dose of corticosteroids to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
prednisone equivalents. Please refer to section 6.
Immune-Mediated Encephalitis : Nivolumab can cause immune-mediated encephalitis with no clear 
alternate etiology. Evaluation of patients with neurologic symptoms may include, but not be limited to, 
consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture.  
Withhold OPDIVO in patients with new-onset moderate to severe neurologic signs or symptoms and evaluate 
to rule out infectious or other causes of moderate to severe neurologic deterioration. If other etiologies are 
ruled out, administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for patients with 
immune-mediated encephalitis, followed by [CONTACT_318592]. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO for 
immune-mediated encephalitis Infusion Reactions : Nivolumab can cause severe infusion reactions, which have been reported in less than 
1.0% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion 
reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions 
Rucaparib 
Rucaparib Photosensitivity: 
Photosensitivity has been observed in patients treated with rucaparib. Patients should avoid spending time in 
direct sunlight because they burn more easily during treatment with rucaparib. When outdoors, patients 
should use typi[INVESTIGATOR_249058] (sun protection factor 50 or greater) and/or 
covering exposed skin with clothing and wearing a hat and sunglasses.
Anticoagulants : Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo. Use of Warfarin, Coumadin,

Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
BMS-specific SAE reporting guidelines:   
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_1200730] be 
collected that relate to any later protocol-specified procedure (e.g., a follow-up skin biopsy). An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness;  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a 
study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form. 
An appropriate SAE form (e.g., [LOCATION_003] = Medwatch form) should be used to report SAEs to BMS.  If 
you prefer to use your own Institutional form, it must be reviewed by [CONTACT_754456].  
Note:  Please include the BMS Protocol number on the SAE form or on the cover sheet with the 
SAE form transmission.   
oThe CIOMS form is available at: http://www.cioms.ch/index.php/cioms-form-i  
oThe MedWatch form is available at: MedWatch 3500 Form
For studies with long-term follow-up periods in which safety data are being reported, include 
the timing of SAE collection.  The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level only) transmitted to BMS 
Global Pharmacovigilance ([EMAIL_555]). Frequency of reconciliation should be 
every 3 months and prior to the database lock or final data summary. BMS GPV&E will email, 
upon request from the Investigator, the GPV&E reconciliation report. Requests for reconciliation 
should be sent to [EMAIL_177]. The data elements listed on the GPV&E 
reconciliation report will be used for case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a 
case was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS. 
BMS will notify investigators of all reported SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational 
product) and unexpected (i.e., not previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria 
is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Investigator notification 
of these events will be in the form of a S[LOCATION_003]R Report.  
oOther important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_228441] (ESR) 
include: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered 
associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that 
poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant safety finding from a nonclinical 
(e.g., animal) study, important safety recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, 
or sponsor decision to end or temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons. 
oUpon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with the IB. 
Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central IRB/IEC for the study, the sponsor 
will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if 
the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
MCC Protocol #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC

39 oIn addition to the Sponsor Investigator’s responsibility to report events to their local HA, 
suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_861423] 
(either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports). 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS within 24

disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response. Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target 
disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.  
Disease Parameters
Measurable disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
with CT scan or MRI. 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short 
axis will be measured and followed. 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm [<1 cm]  short 
axis), are considered non-measurable disease. In addition, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable disease. 
Note: Simple cysts, defined as cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts, should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable).
MCC Protocol #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.2022 
46 Conversely, ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if  non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, the preferred category is as target lesions.
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total should be identified as target lesions, and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, AND additionally should be lesions that lend themselves to 
reproducibly repeated measurements. For instance, if the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement, then the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should 
be selected as a target lesion.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease. 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the [ADDRESS_1200744] and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g., for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
Response Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
MCC Protocol #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC  
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.2022 
47 (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm). 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 cm] short axis). 
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single 
lesion increase. 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should 
be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or PI). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA MANAGEMENT
Study Design and Sample Size
A single arm Phase II trial will be performed using FDA approved single agent dosage for both 
nivolumab and rucaparib.  We will estimate the proportion of patients who exhibit PFS at [ADDRESS_1200745] platinum doublet in platinum sensitive patients, is 2.3 months in the observation 
arm vs 3.6 month on maintenance topotecan arm [23].   Assuming that the proportion who exhibit PFS 
at 6 months is 50%, a sample of 36 patients produces a one-sided 90% confidence interval with a lower 
limit equal to 38%, providing some evidence of efficacy.   
Data Analysis 
Analysis of Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
Progression-free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier curve and the proportion who do 
not exhibit PFS at [ADDRESS_1200746] 95% binomial 
confidence intervals.  
Immune markers including percentage of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells expressing PD-[ADDRESS_1200747]

Data Management 
The study statistician and staff from the MCC Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource 
Facility will work closely with the study team, the Clinical Research Office , and the Cancer Research 
Informatics Shared Resource Facility to implement several aspects of data management for this trial. 
This will include development of eCRFs in the Oncore system, trial-specific processes for data entry, 
generation of reports, data management and statistical analysis. Specifically, the statistician will attend 
several meetings including the eCRF development meeting, the data management process meeting and 
the protocol initiation meeting. Appropriate and accurate collection of primary and secondary study 
endpoints and inclusion of valid values and range checks for data fields will be designed for the eCRFs. 
The OnCore clinical trial management system, managed by [CONTACT_861428], will be the primary database repository of clinical data from all 
patients enrolled into this trial. Data will be accessed by [CONTACT_210573] a regularly scheduled 
basis to perform statistical programming for conduct of data quality control, data management, 
generation of interim reports and statistical analysis. In collaboration with the study team, procedures 
will be developed for data quality control timelines, resolution of data queries, interim reporting and 
final data analysis.
A protocol-specific DMP will be authored by a senior data manager in collaboration with the 
biostatistician and the CRO , each team will be expected to review and sign off on the DMP prior to 
finalization. In order to maintain best clinical practices in data management, the DMP may include, 
but is not limited to, CRF/eCRF design, database build and design, database training, edit 
check/validation specifications, study database testing/release, data and paper workflow, report, 
metrics, query/discrepancy management, management of external (including lab) data, medical 
coding, SAE handling/reconciliation, data transfers and database lock. The protocol specific DMP will 
additionally define the schedule at which data will be accessed by [CONTACT_861429], data control, data management, generation of 
interim reports and statistical analysis. Cross-team members will collaborate to establish procedures 
and timelines for quality control, audits, query resolution, interim and final data analysis.
12. CORRELATIVE STUDIES
Immune studies:
Two 8.0 ml BD Vacutainer® CPT™ Mononuclear Cell Preparation Tubes - Sodium Citrate will be 
drawn prior to treatment (on the day of treatment) and 2 weeks after treatment (per study calendar). 
This should yield up to 16 million PBMCs for each blood draw that will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8315]. We will evaluate three different sets of immune cell markers to identify clinical benefit. 
Percentage of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells expressing PD-1 and Ki-67. 
Increased circulating blood levels of Ki-67, PD-1 expressing T cells is a predictor of clinical 
benefit while on anti-PD-1 therapy. A positive signal will be an increased in cells expressing 
Ki-67, PD-1 on CD4 and CD8 T cells while on treatment compared to the pre-treatment sample

Patient PBMCs will be analyzed by [CONTACT_861439]. PBMC samples will be analyzed 
on a Beckman-Coulter CytoFLEX LX cell analyzer with [ADDRESS_1200751] also enrolled on the 
Markey Cancer Center Total Cancer Care (ORIEN protocol; Yes/No status will be documented in 
the eCRF).  
- Patients enrolled on ORIEN protocol undergo whole exome sequencing of tumor tissue (at 
baseline, and progression, when available) and germline mutation testing via peripheral blood 
or buccal swab. Genomic profiling will be done under Markey Cancer Center Total Cancer 
Care (ORIEN) protocol, wherein all consenting patients treated at MCC are sequenced. 
Genomic testing is funded by [CONTACT_861440].  
For our on-study patients who are also co-enrolled in ORIEN (participant status is “Yes”),  we will 
study patterns of tumor mutation burden and correlate genomic data to durability of treatment 
response and treatment resistance patterns using bioinformatics pi[INVESTIGATOR_861392]. 
The ORIEN Total Cancer Care is a very large clinical research protocol and data are stored
within the Moffitt Data Warehouse (DW). For further details, please visit www.oriencancer.org .

MCC Protocol #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC  
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.[ADDRESS_1200753] of reported side effects as well as other notable side effects considered to be 
possibly due to rucaparib, as reported by [CONTACT_861443]:  
Very common (Occurring in 10% or more of patients)  
• Nausea 
• Feeling tired 
• Low Blood Counts (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Sometimes fever occurs with 
the low blood counts. These low blood count effects may be more likely to occur after multiple 
cycles of treatment.    A low red blood cell count may make you feel tired or dizzy. If you feel dizzy while taking 
rucaparib, you should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating 
machinery.  A low white blood cell count puts you at higher risk for bacterial or viral infection. Having a 
high temperature or fever while your white blood cell count is low is a medical emergency 
and you must proceed to the nearest emergency room as soon as possible   A low platelet count affects the ability of your blood to clot and could lead to bleeding 
events. Symptoms include but are not limited to easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts, 
blood in stools or urine, or nose bleeding. It is possible that rucaparib may make your skin 
and eyes more sensitive to sunlight. You should take all of the usual sun protection 
precautions when going outside. It is advised that you avoid excessive sun exposure, wear 
protective clothing (including wearing a hat and sunglasses), and use sunscreen regularly 
(sun protection factor 50 or greater).  
• A low phosphate level in your blood. Usually there are no symptoms but if the levels are critically 
low, you may notice trouble breathing, confusion, muscle weakness, or irritability.  
• Increase in cholesterol. If your cholesterol increases significantly, your doctor may prescribe a 
medicine to lower your cholesterol level.  
• Changes in kidney and liver function blood tests. These changes will be evaluated by [CONTACT_861444]. 
• Changes in your sense of taste.  
• Stomach-related effects such as constipation, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, stomach pain 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684]), and indigestion.  
• Difficulty breathing 
• Dizziness 
• Photosensitivity reaction
• Fever sometimes can occur independent of a low blood count. If you experience elevation of your 
temperature, please refer to your study doctor for fever management.  
• Difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_861395] #: MCC-18-LUN-107-CLO-PMC  
Protocol Version and Version Date:  21.December.2022 
61 Common Side Effects of Rucaparib (Occurring in 1% to less than 10% of patients)  
• Rash, which will appear as changes in your skin color (e.g. redness) and texture (e.g. bumps, 
blisters, peeling). Some rashes may be itchy, painful, or cause no symptoms at all. This can vary in 
severity from mild to severe. 
• Upper airway infection (like the common cold). You may experience infections involving the nose, 
pharynx, larynx, and sinuses. Symptoms include a blocked (congested nose, a runny nose, and 
sneezing. You may also have clear discharge (mucus) from the nose. You may feel generally unwell 
and may also be associated with fever. Treatment is usually supportive but if symptoms persist 
please inform you doctor.  
• Hand-Foot Syndrome (Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome) When a small amount of 
drug leaks out of the blood vessels, it damages the surrounding tissues. Symptoms would include 
tingling, burning, redness, flaking, swelling, blistering, and sores of the hands and feet due to the 
increased friction and heat your extremities are exposed to. If you experience these symptoms, apply 
ice packs and elevate hands and feet, then contact [CONTACT_861445].  
Uncommon Side Effects of Rucaparib (Occurring in 0.1% to less than 1% of patients)
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)a have been reported in a very 
small number of patients treated with rucaparib during the safety period (while on treatment with 
rucaparib and [ADDRESS_1200754] dose). MDS is a pre-cancerous condition where the bone marrow is 
not as good at producing blood cells (red and/or white blood cells and/or platelets). People with 
MDS may need transfusions (red blood cells and/or platelets) and/or other treatments. In some cases,
MDS can progress to AML, which is a cancer of the bone marrow where more abnormal and 
immature white blood cells (also called blasts) are made than normal white blood cells. People with 
AML need treatment with chemotherapy and/or a bone marrow transplant. Patients may develop 
AML without first being diagnosed with MDS.  
Events of MDS and AML have also been reported with PARP inhibitors similar to rucaparib. At this 
time,  it is not known whether rucaparib or other PARP inhibitors cause MDS or AML, or if these 
developed as a result of previous chemotherapy these patients received. Your study doctor will 
closely monitor your blood cell levels during treatment. If he/she has any concerns about your blood 
counts you may be asked to have a biopsy of your bone marrow.  
a These risks have not yet been determined by [CONTACT_861446]. Some of these risks 
have been reported in a high frequency of patients in clinical trials involving rucaparib (e.g. itchy 
skin, rash), others have been reported in a small number of patients but pose significant risk (e.g. 
MDS/AML) or are generally known to be caused by [CONTACT_342725]-cancer treatments (e.g.,  palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia).

Lung Inflammation (pneumonitis): It is possible that nivolumab may cause inflammation of the 
tissues of the lung. This adverse effect has been reported in those treated with nivolumab. While 
many patients with x-ray or CT abnormalities have not developed any symptoms, some patients have 
developed mild to severe symptoms and in rare cases, death has occurred as a result of their lung 
inflammation. Signs and symptoms of lung inflammation may include difficulty breathing, pain or 
discomfort while breathing, chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, increased rate of breathing, fever, 
low blood oxygen levels, or fatigue. Your study doctor and nurse will watch you closely for changes

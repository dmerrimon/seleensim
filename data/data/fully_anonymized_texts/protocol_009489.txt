2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted ?
The decline of near vision is common among older adults. In 2005, 1.[ADDRESS_163329] lenses. A number of surgical techniques 
are als o used for the treatment of presby[CONTACT_19555], which include monovision photorefractive keratectomy 
(PRK) or laser -assisted in situ keratomilieusis (LASIK) , conductive keratoplasty, intraocular lenses, and 
corneal inlays. However, for each of the existing techno logies mentioned above, visual quality is 
reduced at 1 or more viewing distances (near, intermediate, or distance), and each comes with its own 
unique safety risks and associated complications. For example, bifocals and progressive lenses (e .g., 
reading glasses, contacts) produce optical aberrations and can increase the risk of falls .2,3  Multifocal 
optics reduce image quality uniformly at all viewing distances. For surgical technologies, surgical risks, 
the need for repositioning and explantation, and/or regression of effect have limited their widespread 
adopt ion.4-[ADDRESS_163330] that mimics the actions of the parasympathetic 
neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, on smooth muscle. This causes 2 effects that enhance near vision: 
1)contraction of the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in pupil constriction (miosis); reducing the pupil size 
has long been recognized as an effective way to increase the useful depth of focus, in part by [CONTACT_143608] g 
peripheral aberrations7, and 2) c ontraction of the ciliary muscle, resulting in central lens steepening and 
lens accommodation (focusing from distance to near ).8
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_143560] 
(IOP) in patients with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, management of acute angle -closure 
glaucoma, prevention of postoperative elevated IOP associated with laser surg ery, and induction of
miosis.9  Currently the use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_143561] (AE) of temporal and periorbital headache (i.e., brow ache), which is believed to be due to 
the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_143562].10  However, [COMPANY_013] (formerly Allergan) has established an 
acceptable safety profile of AGN -190584 in 3 Phase 2 clinical studies (Studies 199201 -007, 199201 -009, 
and 199201 -010) and 2 Phase 3 studies (1883 -301-013 and 1883 -302-013). This is likely because the 
posology of pi[INVESTIGATOR_143563] 
(0.5% to 1.5%) and less frequently administered (once to twice daily) than for the treatment of 
glaucoma (1.0% to 4.0% administer ed up to 4 times daily). As a result, discontinuation rates for all 
clinical studies were generally low and safety parameters were not clinically significant between subjects 
who received AGN -190584 compared to subjects who received vehicle or a combinati on therapy. The 
majority of AEs reported in any treatment group were mild to moderate in severity. More detailed 
information regarding clinical safety findings, clinical efficacy findings, chemistry, and pharmacology is 
provided in the Investigator's Bro chure (IB) .

Currently available approaches to presby[CONTACT_143609] (spectacles or 
contact [CONTACT_13276]) and surgical options (PRK or LASIK, conductive keratoplasty, intraocular lenses, or 
corneal inlays ).Each approach has its own risk -benefit ratio. Because the risk -benefit ratio with 
nonsurgical options is generally lower than that of surgical procedures, both historical and 
contemporary practice has been to attempt nonsurgical or pharmacological tre atment before resorting 
to more invasive alternatives. Although the use of spectacles and contact [CONTACT_143610], this approach has limitations.
Multifocal spectacles impair depth perception and edge -contrast sensitivity at cri tical distances for 
detecting obstacles in the environment3, and multifocal lenses have a corridor of nondistorted vision.  
For the se reasons, older people are more than twice as likely to fall when wearing multifocal spectacles, 
and many subjects have difficulty adjusting to using them .2,3  As a result, [COMPANY_013] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
noninvasive, reversible, pharmacological treatment for presby[CONTACT_19555].
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected 
AEs of AGN -190584 may be found in the IB.
Considering the Coronavirus Disease -2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefits and risks to subjects 
participating in this study have been evaluated. Based on the limited information to date, n o additional 
risk to study subjects is anticipated with the use of AGN -190584; however, the risk of study activity 
participation should be evaluated by [CONTACT_093].
3OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
3.1 Objectives , Hypotheses , and Estimands
Objectives
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 
AGN -190584 when administered bilaterally, twice daily for 14 days in subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555].
Hypotheses
The clinical hypotheses are that AGN -190584 ophthalmi c solution dosed bilaterally, twice daily (Hour 0 
and Hour 6) for 14 days will demonstrate a significant improvement in distance -corrected near visual 
acuity (DCNVA) over vehicle after the second dose, and AGN -190584 ophthalmic solution dosed 
bilaterally, twice daily for 14 days will demonstrate an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

approximately 10% of enrolled subjects at selected sites.
3.6 Safety Endpoints
The safety measurements will include AE, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), mesopic and 
photopic, high -contrast, binocular CDVA, IOP, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, manifest refraction, dilated 
fundoscopic examination, post dose tolerability assessment, drop comfort questionnaire, and pregna ncy 
test.
3.7 Patient Reported Outcomes
Patient -reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires are administered in this study. The VFA app should be 
administered as well.
At screening, subjects will answer questions on vision functioning and health -related quality of life using 
the NEI VFQ- 25, including the near vision subscale items (Questions A3 to A5) from the Appendix of 
Optional Additional Questions.
Subjects will also complete the Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI )at screening, which assesses 
symptoms of ocular irritation and their impact on vision -related functioning.
Each subject will also perform [ADDRESS_163341] of presby[CONTACT_143613][INVESTIGATOR_143565] .
Subjects will also answer single -item questions on their overall global impression of status ( PGIS ) and 
their overall global impression of change ( PGIC ). 
After study drug administration, subjects will complete the Drop Comfort Questionnaire to evaluate 
comfort of the study drug after administration.
Finally, the VFA app will be used to assess the subject 's ability to read on electronic devices.
For questionnaires completed on an electronic platform, if technical iss ues prevent the questionnaire 
from being completed, responses can be written down on source documents (preferably a paper copy of 
the questionnaire if available) and entered when the electronic platform is available .

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double -masked, parallel -group, vehicle -controlled study in subjects with 
presby[CONTACT_19555]. Subjects will receive AGN -190584 or vehicle dosed twice daily, bilaterally, for 14 days. 
Approximately 200 subjects with presby[CONTACT_143614] 20 sites in the United 
States.
The study consists of the following visits: screening (Days -30 to -1), Day 1 (baseline), Day 7 ( ±2 days), 
and Day 14 ( ± 2 days). A study schema is shown in Figure 1. Subjects will receive either AGN -190584 or 
vehicle dosed twice daily, bilaterally, for 14 days beginning on Day 1. On nonvisit days, subjects will be 
instructed to instill one drop of the dispensed study drug in each eye twice daily, with each dose 
administered 6 hours apart. On visit days, study drug will be instilled bilaterally by [CONTACT_143615] 0 (8 AM ±1 hour) and Hour 6 (time measured 6 hours from the time of completion of 
the Hour 0 study drug administration). Study procedures on visit days are provided in the Activity 
Schedule ( Appendix D) and further guidance regarding study procedures are located in the Operations 
Manual ( Appendix F). 
Adult subjects 40 to 55 years of age with objective and subjective evidence of presby[CONTACT_143616]. See Section 5for information regarding eligibility criteria.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events : AGN -[ADDRESS_163367] a causal relation ship with 
this treatment. An AEcan therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is c onsidered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational o r 
accidental exposure, off- label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AEor not. Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a repor ted AEshould be reported as a new AE.Changes in 
vital signs are considered to be AEsonly if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate 
therapeutic medical drug, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical evidence of AEson a routine basis throughout the 
study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AEif the 
surgery/ procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as a 
Serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to 
Section 4.[ADDRESS_163368] information):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject
Life-threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical drug had not been taken. 
This does not include an event that would h ave been fatal if it had 
occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. This does not include 
an eme rgency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substa ntially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., spr ained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Drug to Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical drug to prevent any of the outcomes listed above 
(i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/inca pacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous 
abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event along 
with any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a 
medicinal product if no other serious criterion is applicable. 
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
All adverse events , whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423] ,will be collected from 
the time of study drug administration through study exit, unless spontaneously report after study exit . 
In addition, study procedure -related serious and nonserious adverse events will be collected from the 
time the subject signs the study -specific informed consent.
The following definitions will be used for serious adverse reaction (SAR) and suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):
SAR Defined as all no xious and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal 
product ( IMP)related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable reference safety 
information), and meets one of the above serious criteria
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Page 25 of 113abbvie 

STUDY M21 -195  |  Version 2.[ADDRESS_163369] will be monitored during the study:
Headache
Visual disturbance
Subjects reporting a headache AE (including any AE related to headache or migraine) will be provided 
thesupplemental headache AE assessment form tofurther assess the headac he AE and grade the 
degree of severity.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AEas mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of eac h AE:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subj ect's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AEto the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_163370] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is 
consid ered an SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.

according to the randomized study drug.
The safety population will consist of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_163371] of all subjects with evaluable plasma concentrations of AGN- 190584.
7.3 Handling Potential Intercurrent Events for the Primary and Key 
Secondary Endpoints
The following methods will be used to address potential intercurrent events for both the primary and 
key secondary endpoints:
Subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug before the Day 14 visit will be considered as 
nonresponders. 
Subjects who die before assessment of the endpoint will be considered as n onresponders for 
the endpoint .
Subjects who are lost to follow -up and are missing data for the endpoint will be considered as 
nonresponders for theendpoint. 
Missing data will be regarded as a nonresponder, for both the primary and key secondary endpoint s.

AUC 0-tauwill be calculated by [CONTACT_143624] -log trapezoidal rule.
Statistical Analyses of Pharmacokinetic Data
Details of th e statistical analyses of PK data will be described in the PKanalysis plan finalized before 
database lock.
7.6 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analysis will be performed using the safety population; and subjects are assigned to a 
treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless of the treatment randomized.  
An AE will be considered a treatment -emergent adverse even t (TEAE) if the AE began or worsened 
(increased in severity or became serious) on or after the date of the first dose of study drug.
An AE will be considered a treatment -emergent SAE if it is a TEAE that additionally meets any SAE 
criteria.
The number an d percentage of subjects with TEAEs during the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_143625], preferred term, and severity.
If more than one AE is coded to the same preferred term for the same subject, the subje ct will be 
counted only once for that preferred term using the greatest severity and strictest causality for the 
summarizations by [CONTACT_110204].
Summary tables will be provided for subjects with SAEs and subjects with AEs lead ing to discontinuation
of study drug . Listings of all AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug by [CONTACT_143626].
Adverse events of special interest will be summarized by [CONTACT_143627] t he SAP.
Detailed methods for the analysis of other safety variables will be described in the SAP.
7.7 Overall Type I Error Control
A fixed sequence testing procedure will be applied to control the overall familywise Type I error rate at 
α = 0.05 for the primar y and secondary hypotheses sequentially. The hypotheses for primary endpoint 
and the secondary endpoints will be tested in a sequential order:

>251 lux specified in the study p rotocol . For simplicity, photopic isused todefine lighting conditions for these
questionnaires.
*** Detailed instructions for theVFA app areprovided in Section 7.2.
Note: The OSDI and NEI VFQ- 25 questionnaires will be on paper. All other questionnaires will be administered on an 
electronic platform (i.e., cellphone or tablet) .  The VFA app is administered on an iPhone provided by [CONTACT_779].   For 
questionnaires completed on an electronic platform, if technical issues prevent the questionnaire from being 
completed, responses can be written down on source documents (preferably a paper copy of the questionnaire if 
available) and entered when the electronic platform is available .  Please contact [CONTACT_143633] a paper copy of the questionnaire if needed .
The PRO instrument sshould be comple ted prior to drug administration on Day 1 ,and prior to any 
discussion of Adverse event (AE) or any review of laboratory findings.
General Considerations
1.The questionnaires should be completed in an area that is quiet and has adequate privacy.
2.Make the subject as comfortable as possible and reassure the subject that his or her answers 
are confidential and will not impact the type of medical care he or she receive s.
3.Attempt to administer the questionnaire to the subject privately.
4.The study site personnel sh ould choose the correct visit number for the questionnaires to 
correspond to the visit day/schedule before administering the questionnaire (e.g., Visit 1 , 
Day 1).
5.When the questionnaires are finished, thank the subject for participating.
6.Questionnaires for a visit should not be completed after the subject has left the investigator 's 
office on that visit day (e.g., questionnaires for Visit 1 should not be completed at any other 
time than at Visit 1).
Visual Function Assessment application (VFA app)
The VFA app should be administered per the schedule specified in Table 1. Detailed instructions on the 
VFA app areprovided in Section 7.2. Of note, this measure should be administered under photopic 
conditions, with best distance correction . Only half eye style trial frames with full field trial lenses are 
permitted for best d istance correction while administering the VFA app.
OSDI 
The OSDI (Ocular Surface Disease Index) consists of 12 questions, graded on a 5 -point scale from All of 
the Time (4) to None of the Time (0). The subject will complete the OSDI .
The OSDI is scored using the formula: (sum of scores x 25)/number of questions answered.
1.Add the subtotals from questions 1 -5, 6-9, and 10 -12 to get the total score.
2.Multiply this total by 25.

4.You can also use the worksheet that [COMPANY_013] provided to calculate the OSDI score.
Sites will transcribe the subject 'sresponses on the paper OSDI questionnaire into the electronic data 
capture ( EDC).
Administration of the NEI VFQ -[ADDRESS_163408] s'difficulty with near vision when the subject isnot wearing glasses or contacts 
with near correction . As a result, before administration of the VFQ -25 begins (i.e., before the 
initial instructions are read to the subject ), please advise subject sthat for this study they are to 
interpret the instructions as referring to glasses or contacts they need for seeing objects at a 
distance (if required), not their reading glasses or bifocals.
5.The VFQ -25,including all questions from the Appendix of Optional Additional Questions ,will be 
administered by [CONTACT_143635] . However, particular 
items of interest for confirming inclusion criteria only include the near vision subscale (items 5 -
7) and the near vision questions from the Appendix of Optional Additional Questions (items A3 -
A5). Responses to all VFQ -[ADDRESS_163409] understands the 
instructions (including the fact that any references to glasses or contacts should be interprete d

3.Read each question slowly, exactly as worded, followed by [CONTACT_143636] (if 
applicable), and mark the answer choice for the subject .
4.Repeat questions and answer choices as needed ;do not rephrase the question.
5.Do not "lead "the subject to a particular answer . Allow the subject to respond how he or she
feels. If the subject is unsure how to answer, explain that there are no right or wrong answers 
and ask him or her to answer to the best of his or her ability.
Page [ADDRESS_163410] . Do not get "stuck "on a particular question.
8.Reassure the subject sthroughout the interview that they are doing well, as appropriate.
Checking the Questionnaire
Study site personnel should check t he following before the subject leaves the site:
1.In order to be eligible for the study, the subject must: have a score ≥ [ADDRESS_163411] one item from 
either the VFQ -25 Near Vision Subscale (items 5 -7) or from the Appendix of Optional Additional 
Questions (A 3-A5) (i.e. ,a score of ≥ [ADDRESS_163412] one out of these six questions) . If the subject
does not have a score of [ADDRESS_163413] one of these six items (items 5 -7 or A3 -5), the 
subject is not eligible to participate in the study.
2.If a subject communicates information regarding AEsduring the course of the interview, assure 
that these are documented appropriately.
Sites will transcribe the responses on the paper NEI VFQ-[ADDRESS_163414] to read the instructions at the top of the page carefully befo re answering the 
question.
Single Item PGIC Questionnaire
Subjects will be asked to complete a single -item questionnaire asking about their impression of the 
study medication 's effect on their near vision . Subject s should answer this questionnaire under 
photopic conditions using their best distance correction.
Single Item PGIS Questionnaire
Subjects will be asked to complete a single -item questionnaire asking about their impression of their 
problems seeing up close over the past [ADDRESS_163415] s were impacted by [CONTACT_143637]; or engaged in copi[INVESTIGATOR_143576] [ADDRESS_163416] s should 
answer this questionnaire using their habitual distance correction.
Near Vision Presby[CONTACT_143611]- Based Questionnaire
The Near Vision Presby[CONTACT_143611] -Based Questionnaire (NVPTQ) includes 12 questions on 4 paper -based 
reading tasks (book, newspaper, menu, nutrition label) . Subject s will be asked to read a text passage, 
Page [ADDRESS_163417] has completed the task, the study staff should 
proceed with the next task (i.e ., ask the subject to read the next text passage and answer the 3 
questions) . Subject s should read text passages and answer questions under mesopic conditions, using 
their best distance correction.
Lighting Conditions 
Subject s should read text passages and answer questions under mesopic conditions, using their best 
distance correction . Please see definition of mesopic lighting (Section 3.9) for other efficacy measures.
Task Preparation
1.Each of the four reading task examples (book, newspaper, menu, nutrition label) should be 
stacked upon a lectern facing the subject , in the following order:
a.Paragraph from a book
b.Newspaper article
c.Menu
d.Nutrition Label
2.The lectern should be set so that the task examples are perpendicular to the table and so that 
the examples are at the subject 's eye level. Do not adjust the lectern once the subject s have 
begun reading the tasks.
3.Subject s should be given a different task example each time they are asked to c omplete the 
NVPTQ (i.e., at each visit). For instance, subject s should be given tasks labelled "Example A1, A2, 
etc."during their first assessment. At their next assessment, subject s should be given tasks 
labeled "Example B1, B2, etc. ", and so on. Revi ew the NVPTQ in Mesopic Conditions Worksheet 
history to ensure that subject s are not receiving the same task example during the course of the 
trial. Record the task example numbers for this assessment.
Subject Preparation
1.Seat the subject so that the distance between the subject 's eyes and the lectern is [ADDRESS_163418] does not move his/her head significantly during the time he/she is
reading the tasks.
2.Use the NVPTQ in Mesopic Conditions Worksheet provided to confirm proper setup of tasks 
(i.e., ensure tasks are on the lectern, and are in the correct order)
3.Provide the NVPTQ to the subject . It may be helpful to provide the questionnaire on a fixed 
surface to minimize time spent re -adjusting the subject position between tasks. 
4.Instru ct the subject to read the NVPTQ instructions.
5.Before administering the reading tasks, remind the subject of the following:
a.Remember to read the text for each of the reading samples. You can read the tasks out loud 
or to yourself.
Page [ADDRESS_163419] with Task #1 (Book).
7.After the subject has finished reading Task #1, instruct the subject to read and complete the 
questionnaire items pertaining to Task #1 (items 1 -3 in the task -oriented questionnaire).
(IMPORTANT: Before giving the questions to the patient, adjust the brightness on the device to 
the lowest possible setting.)

3.8 Clinical Laboratory Tests
Pregnancy Tests (Urine)
Pregnancy testing should not be performed for postmenopausal women.
A urine pregnancy test will be performed at screening, Day 1, and Day 14 (or upon confinement in each 
period) for all female subjects of childbearing potential . More frequent pregnancy tests can be
performed throughout the study at the investigator's discretion or if required per local/country 
requirements.
If the baseline urine pregnancy test is negative, then dosing with study drug may begin.

The light meter provided by A bbVie should be used to measure room illumination at the target . Before 
taking any measurement, make sure the power switch is turned to the "on"position, and the range 
switch is turned to the "2000 position," as shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Light Meter
When measuring room illumination/lighting conditions: 
1.Remove the light sensor cover .
2.Position the light sensor in the middle of the (mounted) distance VA chart with the sensor facing 
outward to the room .
a.Chart should either be mounted on the wall or on a stable stand.
3.Adjust room lighting until light meter reading achieves the mesopic or photopic range required. 
4.Lighting conditions on the distance VA chart confirms lighting for VA assessments associated 
regardless of distance ;
a.i.e., if mesopic lighting has been confirmed and mesopic VA measurements are being 
performed, lighting does not need to be checked from distance → intermediate → near and 
vice versa .
5.Upon changing lighting conditions, lighting should be re -checked (as per steps 1 to 4) prior to 
performing the associated procedures (e .g., change from mesopic to photopic) .
Page [ADDRESS_163423] 5 -10 minutes prior to the 
start of procedures, once lighting conditions are confirmed .
3.10 Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143577] t
The 'swinging light test 'is used to measure pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143578] . It is a means of detecting 
differences between the two eyes and how they respond to a light shone in one eye at a time . This test 
can be conducted under either photopic or mesopic conditions (it is easier to see under mesopic 
conditions). 
In a normal swinging light test, the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143579] . In an abnormal test, there is less pupil constriction in the eye with retinal or 
optic nerve disease. 
Procedure:
Using a bright torch which can be focused to give a narrow, even beam of light . Perform the following: 
Ask the subject to focus on a distant obj ect, such as a Snellen chart or a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] . This is to 
prevent the near -pupil response (pupil constriction when moving focus from distance to near) .
While performing the test, take care not to get in the way of the fixation target.
Move the whole torch de liberately from side to side so that the beam of light is directed directly 
into each eye . Do not swing the beam from side to side around a central axis (e .g., by [CONTACT_143639]'s nose), as this can also stimulate the near response.
Keep the light source at the same distance from each eye to ensure that the light stimulus is 
equally bright in both.
Keep the beam of light steadily on the first eye for at least 3 seconds . This allows the pupil size 
to stabilize . Note whether the pupil of the eye being illuminated reacts briskly and constricts 
fully to the light . Also note what happens to the pupil of the other eye: does it also constrict 
briskly?
Move the light quickly to shine in the other eye . Again, hold the light steady for 3 sec onds . 
Note whether the pupil being illuminated stays the same size, or whether it gets bigger . Note 
also what happens to the other eye.
Repeat the test, observing what happens to the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143580].
Judge whether the subject 's pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143581] . Enter into the 
source document and eCRF.
Page [ADDRESS_163424] refraction should be conducted at the Screening visit under mesopic and photopic light 
conditions, for both distance and near (this is considered the "baseline manifest refraction "). Manifest 
refraction can be condu cted per the site 's standard clinical practice or following the procedures 
instructed below . The investigator may choose any appropriate method to conduct manifest refraction, 
including a phoropter, trial frames with loose lenses inserted . The prescripti ons obtained from the 
manifest refraction conducted at the Screening visit (for mesopic and photopic distance, if not the same) 
will be used as the best distance correction during the study visits for:
Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (CDVA) and Distance -Corrected Near Visual Acuity (DCNVA)
Some PRO measures under each lighting condition 
Note: If the subject 's habitual monofocal distance correction is the same as the manifest refractions 
under both mesopic and photopic conditions, then their habitual cor rection can be used for the 
procedures above.
Page [ADDRESS_163425] s who lose 
≥ 1line (defined as 5 or more letters) at Hour [ADDRESS_163426]' s Approxim ate Refraction
Prior to manifest refraction, measure the subject 's current distance spectacles (habitual correction) with 
a lensometer, or perform autorefraction if the subject does not wear distance spectacles. This 
measurement will be the starting point for refracting the subject on the phoropter. 
New monofocal correction:
If subject 's habitual distance correction (1) is insufficient to achieve distance visual acuity of 20/32 or 
better, or (2) are not monofocal lenses (i .e., if they are bifocal or progressive), then the study site should 
provide new, monofocal distance correction spectacles to achieve a corrected distance vision of 20/[ADDRESS_163427] 's own habitual correction may be used for distance -
corrected visual acuity measures (i .e., in place of trial frames or phoropter) if they have the same 
prescription as their best correction under the corresponding lighting condition (e .g., some subject s may 
not tolerate best correction as habitual correction, but a new Rx may still get them to qualify at 20/32 or 
better –these subject s may not use their new Rx for visual acuity testing) . However, if the subject 's best 
distance correction is different between mesopic and photopic conditions, a trial frame is still needed 
for the condition that the new monofocal distance correction or subject 's own habitual correction is 
different from the best distanc ecorrection.
Manifest Refra ction
Manifest refraction is performed for distance (4 m) and near (40 cm), under both mesopic and photopic 
conditions. 
To start, the subject 's current distance spectacles are measured with a lensometer; if no spectacles are 
worn, auto refraction is done . One of these measurements is used as the beginning approximate 
refraction. 
The investigator may use any appropriate method to conduct the manifest refraction, including 
phoropter, trial frames with loose lenses inserted, or loose lenses. The A bbVie -provided distance and 
near visual acuity charts should be used for each measure.
The distance and near visual acuity charts provided by [CONTACT_143640] –one each for 
right eye (OD) , left eye (OS) , and OU ( Figure 2). Please use the appropriate letters for distance and near 
measures. N ote that only OD and OS blocks will be used for manifest refraction.
Note: In the rare case i f a subject 's best correcte dvision is 20/[ADDRESS_163428] s should read the 
central OU section because there are no corresponding letters for OD or OS on the charts.  If both OD 
and OS are 20/63 or worse, use a different chart to avoid memorizing . For vision better than 20/63, the 
subject should read the OD or OS sections of the chart as usual .  
Page [ADDRESS_163429] refraction should be done in the following order, beginning with the OD (OS occluded):
1.Enter approximate refraction (from Determine Subject's Approximate Refraction ) into the 
phoropter.
2.Determine SPHERE power:
a.With subject looking at the smallest legible line on the appropriate VA chart (near/distance), 
add +0.[ADDRESS_163430] , is it "Better, worse, or is there no change? "
If BETTER or NO CHANGE:
Replace the +0.25 spherical lens with one with an additional +0.25 D . Check VA again, 
and repeat the process until adding +0.[ADDRESS_163431] 's VA worse. 
If WORSE:
Add a lens that is 0.25 D more minus or less plus than the previous lens . If this improves 
VA, even by [CONTACT_143641], continue to repeat the process until there is no more 
improvement in VA. 
ii.Re-challenge with +0.[ADDRESS_163432] responds that the +0.[ADDRESS_163433] VA.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].NOTE: The following description is for minus cylinder . Adjust accordingly for plus cylinder 
refraction by [CONTACT_143642] (red) with the positive axis (white) in the instructions 
for cylinder axis below.
Ask the subject to look at a line on the visual acuity chart, which is one line larger than the 
smallest line the subject can read . Ask the subject to focus on a round letter such as "C," "G," or 
"O" if one is present.
a.IF CYLINDER WAS NOT PRESENT in the initial approximate refraction: 
i.Place the cross- cylinder with the negative axis (red) first at 90 °, then at 180 °, then 45 °
and 135 °. If the subject states that the vision is improved at any one of these four axis 
positions, place cylindrical lens power in the refractor at the preferred axis and proceed 
to refine the axis . If the subject prefers none of the four positions, skip the re fining 
cylinder power step.
IF CYLINDER WAS PRESENT in the initial approximate refraction: 
ii.Position the cross -cylinder first with the negative axis 45 °to the right of the cylinder 
axis (position one), and secondly with the negative axis at 45 °to the lef t of the cylinder 
axis (position two) . Flip the crossed cylinder and ask, which position improves the 
vision (position one or position two?).
b.If subject responds that NEITHER POSITION IS BETTER and if this was the first test of the 
axis position, move the axis of the cylinder 15 °to the right or left and repeat.
If the subject PREFERS ONE POSITION TO THE OTHER , rotate the cylinder axis toward the 
preferred axis of the cross- cylinder. (If the subject states that one position of the cross -cylinder 
is no better than the other position, proceed to refining cylinder power).
4.Refine CYLINDER power:
a.Ask the subject to look at the lowest line on the visual acuity chart that can be read.
b.Align the cross -cylinder first with the positive axis and then with the negative axis coincident 
with the cylinder axis . Ask the subject which is better.
c.If the subject prefers the positive (white) axis coincident with the cylinder axis, decrease the 
minus power of the cylinde r by 0.[ADDRESS_163434] indicates a change that would introduce positive cylinder power, remove all 
cylinder power and continue testing for negative cylinder power at an axis 90 °away from 
the previous axis. 
e.If the subject prefers the negative (re d) axis coincident with the cylinder axis, increase the 
cylinder power by -0.[ADDRESS_163435] the sphere by 0.25 diopters of the 
opposite power.
5.End the refraction :
a.End the refraction by [CONTACT_143643] +0.[ADDRESS_163436] line read with two, one ,or no 
misses.
d.REPEAT the entire refraction process for the OS.
Note: When determining whether refraction meets entry criteria, either plus OR minus 
cylinder notation may be used.
6.Near Refraction :
a.Best near add should be used when conduct ingnear manifest refraction , including the near 
VAmeasurement .  The recorded near prescription should also include the near add. Both 
best near refraction and near add need to be captured and entered into EDC. 
b.Inclusion criterion 7 "Photopic, high -contrast, near visual acuity correctable to 20/40 (J3+) or 
better in each eye at the screening visit "references the near VA measured by [CONTACT_143644]. 
Note :
• When determining whether refraction meets entry criteria, either plus OR minus 
cylinder notation may be used . Sites do not need to convert the sign when entering 
the data into the source worksheet of EDC. 
3.[ADDRESS_163437] s who lose 
≥ 1line (defined as 5 or more letters) in either eye in CDVA or DCNVA at Hour [ADDRESS_163438] be recorded in the 
source doc ument and entered into EDC ;however ,this new refraction is NOT used for the rest of the 
study . The original correction from the screening manifest refraction should continue to be used.
3.[ADDRESS_163439] s are dilated using 
1%tropi[INVESTIGATOR_143582] 2.5% phenylephrine . Refraction is to be performed a minimum of 30 minutes after 
administration of dilating drops.
When determining whether refraction meets entry criteria, either plus O R minus cylinder notation may 
be used , and considered for each eye individually.
Example: An emmetrope may meet criteria in plus cylinder notation for one eye and minus cylinder 
notation in the other ;however ,if one eye in either notation does not meet e mmetrope criteria, the 
subject would be a nonemmetrope .

Measuring Pupil Diameter
Pupil diameters should be measured with the provided pupil lometer for distance/near VA and under 
mesopic/photopic conditions, per eye . The following VA charts should be utilized: 
Near pupil diameter: 40 cm (near) visual acuity chart
Distance pupil diameter: 4 meter (distance) visual acuity chart. 
Note: Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143583] 
From the home screen, select 'settings '(the gear icon), and select LIGHTS OFF mode.
MUST BE in LIGHTS OFF mode NOT in "variable "mode (the current mode will be displayed)
While measuring pupil size in [ADDRESS_163448] 's eye, as sufficient ambient 
light is necessary for an accurate measurement . Holding the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143584] 
1-2inches separates the subject 's eye from the eyecup should allow sufficient ambient light entry.
Subject Preparation
1.With any spectacles removed, instruct the subject to focus at the target distance with the eye 
that is not being tested.
2.Ask the subject to keep his/her head straight and both eyes wide open during both targeting 
and measurement . In some cases ,if targeting becomes a problem, it may be necessary to 
gently hold the subject 's eye open with your finger.
3.The operator should position the instrument at a right angle to the subject 's axis of vision and 
any tilting of the instrument should be minimized (See Figure 3below) . When taking the 
Page [ADDRESS_163449] 's eye with the eyecup, so as to allow for 
sufficient ambient light to enter. 
4.It may be helpful for the operator to be at the same level as the subject when performing the 
scan to minimize tilting. If necessary, both subject and operator can sit down faci ng each other 
during targeting and measurement. (See Figure 3below).
5.The pupi[INVESTIGATOR_143585] ( see Figure 3

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].3.20 IOP
Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be measured after the biomicroscopic exam is completed and prior to 
pupil dilation . Measurements should be taken using a Goldmann applanation tonometer affixed to a 
slit-lamp with the participant seated . The participant and slit -lamp should be adjusted so that the 
participant 's head is firmly positioned on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without leaning 
forward or straining . Tight fitting neckwear should be loosened . Both eyes will be tested, with the right 
eye preceding the left eye . The measurer will look through the binocular viewer of the slit lamp at low 
power . The tension knob will be preset at a low -pressure value (4 to 6 mm Hg) . The measurer will 
follow the image of the fluorescein -stained semicircles while slowly rotating the tension knob until the 
inner borders of the fluorescein rings touch each other at the midpoint of their pulsation in response to 
the cardiac cycle . When this image is reached, the measurer will take his/her fin gers off the tension 
knob and record the IOP reading along with the date and time of day .
3.21 Gonioscopy
Gonioscopy will be performed to assess the iridocorneal (anterior chamber) angle.  You may use your 
preferred indirect gonioscopy lens (e.g., Posner, Zeis s 4-mirror lens, etc.) .  When gonioscopic 
photography is being performed you should use the appropriate gonioscopic lens for the photography.
General steps to performing gonioscopy:
Room lig hts should be turned off dur ingthe exa mination. All participants should be examined in 
thesameroom with the sameslit lamp if possible to do so, and with consist ent lighting 
conditions.
Perform the angleassessme nt und erhigh mag nification.
With the participant comfortable at the slit lamp, wet the corneal surface of your lens with an 
artificial tear or lubricating solution and place your gonioscopy lens on the participant 's eye.
Direct a bright, narrow light beam away from the pupil to avoid inducing miosis.
Have the participant maintain their gaze in the primary position while you examine the 
iridocorneal angle.
Minimize tilting the lens; only minor movement of the lens is permissible . Otherwise, the angle 
findings may be distorted and a closed or narrow angle may appear open.  Do not apply 
pressure that may caus e indentation.  The presence of corneal striations is an indication that 
the cornea is being indented.
Examine the iridocorneal angle for peripheral anterior synechiae and other angle pathology.

p. 40of [ADDRESS_163458] should be immediately 
followed up with a supplemental headache AE assessment form to further assess the headache.  The 
supplemental headache AEassessment form contains three visual analog scales (VAS) that the subject 
will complete to grade the overall severity , the temporal severity (if applicable) ,and the supraorbital 
severity (if applicable) .  The subjects will be asked to make a vertical mark along each horizontal [ADDRESS_163459] and second dose sof study drug , then the se 
additional questions should be answered about whichever headache had worse outcomes .  For 
example, "How long after taking the study drug did the headache/migraine start ?"should reflect 
whichever headache had the quickest onset ,and "How long did the headache/migraine last? (if 
intermittent, approximately how long did each event last )"should reflect whichever headache had the 
longest dur ation.
The evaluator should measure the distance from the end of the line to the mark that the subject made
with a ruler and record the length on the supplemental headache assessment worksheet.  
If a headache is classified as intermittent or recurrent with the same causality and severity, then one 
supplemental headache AE assessment form should be used. If the subject experience smultiple 
headache swith different causality orseverity, then each headache should have its own supplemental 
headache AE assessment form.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Supplemental study CRFs should be completed in the event of COVID -19-related missed/virtual visits, 
study drug interruptions or discontinuations, or AEs(including capture of specific signs/symptoms of 
infection and testing results).
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2)infections should be captured as AEs. If 
the event meets the criteria for a SAE, then follow the SAE reporting directions per the protocol and 
above . The following COVID -19-related supplemental eCRFs should be completed (for both serious and 
nonserious events):
COVID-1 9 Supplemental Signs/Symptoms
COVID- [ADDRESS_163460] listed above before reintroducing 
study drug.
Reactions known to be associated with the SARS- CoV-2 vaccine should be reported as AEs. Ifthe event

Shipments will be shipped in preconditioned shippers (no temperature monitors will be included) , 
including packing list and study intervention . Upon receipt of the shipment the site should 
confirm /verify the shipment contents against the packing list: 
Site # / PI [CONTACT_2300] 
Kit numbers
Quantity of kits 
Condition of kits 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061] (if applicable) 
Lot No. 
The original packing list should be filed in the site ISF . Any discrepancies should be reported to the 
assigned site monitor .
IP Shipment – Temperature Monitoring
No temperature monitors will be included with shipments because the shippers that the study drugs are 
sent in will be prequalified shippers that will m aintain the temperature between 2 °C and 8 °C. 
Registering Shipments (Consignments) into I RT
Each shipment of IP has a corresponding consignment assignment asnoted on the packing list . These 
consignments must be registered into the EndPoint IRT system immediately upon receipt .
Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
The IPsare for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study . The 
study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the 
conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed on site as appropriate.
Excursion Reporting
Physically set aside affected study intervention under labeled storage conditions , then e nter the 
temperature excursion into ATEMS ; ATEMS will automatically provide an assessment and show the new 
study intervention status . 
Page [ADDRESS_163465] s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the following treatment groups: 
Treatment Dosing Schedul e
AGN -190584 1.25%
1 drop OU, twice daily, 6 hours apart for 14 days
Vehicle
Stratification is based on the following factors at either screening or Baseline/Day 1: 
Age at Screening  ≤50 years 
 >50 yearsScreening 
Binocular Meso pic DCNVA Severity  20/63 or Better (≤ 50%)
 Worse than 20/63Baseline/Day 1
Iris color  Brown 
 Non brownScreening 
Emmetrope status*  Emmetrope 
 Non emmetrope (≤25%) Screening
*Emmetrope status is confirmed via screening cycloplegic refraction .  See Section 3.14 for details.
If correction for each eye iswithin sphere range of -0.50 D to +0.75 D inclusive and ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_163466] should be 
considered a nonemmetrope. 
Note :Refractions may be transcribed in plus or minus cylinder notation to determine whether 
inclusion criteria and/or emmetrope definitions are met .
At the screening visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number using the IRT . For subjects 
who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must contact [CONTACT_143654] a screen fai lure.
Sites are to enter required information into I RTeither in real time or shortly after a reportable event to 
ensure timely reporting of the overall study status . Interactive response technology will provide the 
subject identification number per conse nted subject ;this number will identify the subject throughout 
the course of the trial. Contact [CONTACT_41609].
Interactive response technology will control the stratification for the trial. Once a strat umcap has been 
reached ,no additional subject s can be enrolled ;therefore ,screening entries of age, iris color, and 
emmetrope status will determine the general stratification, which is confirmed on Baseline/Day 1with 
the entry of the [ADDRESS_163467] s meeting 
those stratum factors can be randomized/enrolled . Therefore, sites must review the screening entries 
prior to Baseline/Day 1 to ensure proper stratification (with corresponding docum entation), updating 
Page [ADDRESS_163468] the stratum 
population.
*NOTE -ERRORS IN ENTERING THE STRAT UM GROUP IN I RTMAY IMPACT THE RANDOMIZATION OF THE 
SUBJECT AND DATA ANALYSIS . PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE ASSIGNED STRAT UM GROUP YOU SELECTED 
IN IRTIS ACCURATE BEFORE PROCEEDING IN THE SYSTEM . AFTER YOU PROCEED, YOU CANNOT CHANGE 
THE STRAT UM GROUP .

Baseline/Day 1
Upon randomization in I RT, site staff should perform the following prior to administration/dispensing to 
ensure per kit/carton: 
Verify against carton/kits pulled against assigned carton/kits via I RTprintout 
Verify carton/kit label against affixed bottle label 
Any discrepancies should be reported to the site monitor upon identification .
Baseline/Day 1 IP administration: Upon completion of all Hour 0 procedures (immediately after VAS if 
applicable ) and prior to the tolerability assessment/drop comfort questionnaire, site staff will administer 
one (1) drop in each eye with one of the two (2) drop bottles at 8AM ±1 hour and no sooner than
6hours +[ADDRESS_163470] instructions for at -home and in -office study visit 
administration, IP storage/transport , andany warnings . Printed subject dosing instructions should be 
provided with theIP when dispensed prior to the end of the visit, with any subject education noted 
within source.
Study Visits: IP Administration/Compliance
On visit days site staff will administer IP at Hour 0 in a similar fashion to Baseline/Day 1 at 8AM ± [ADDRESS_163471] adm inistration within + [ADDRESS_163472] s are to bring all used and unused IP for study visits, returning all by [CONTACT_143655] . On-site administration will occur with the IP dispensed during the Baseline/Day [ADDRESS_163473] s should be instructed to bring all used and unused IP for study visits . 
At the conclusion of participation all IP dispensed (used and unused) must be returned to the site for
destruction.
Subject s should not self -administer IP prior to the visit on the visit day, and should provide staff the 
approximate time of their last self -administration (last self -administration should occur no sooner on 
the day before a study visit than 1 2hours prior to the ir scheduled visit time) . During study visits, site 
staff should discuss compliance with daily IP administration and assess reasons for not administering for 
safety and/or re -education needs ,documenting discussion accordingly.

Henr i Matisse 
One ol lhe mos, Imponan1 
artists of the 1wentielh 
cenlury was Frenchman Henn 
Matisse . He led an art 
movement called post-
Impressionism and was one of 
the fIrs1 famous collage artists 
Throughout his career . 
Matisse experimented with 
different colors, art lonms, and 
mediums. He did not follow 
the established rules of art-
he created his own. 
. . . . Matisse was a man with a 
mischievous personality and 
keen sense of humor-
character istics that are 
reflected in his artwork. As a 
master of color , he brought a 
special joyfulness and a 
childlike perspective to his art. 
When Matisse died in 1954 , 
he left a part of himself behind 
for all future generations to 
enjoy . -

Wi-Fi issue while data is being transferred to the cloud -based storage
Every app on iOS has local storage called an app sandbox . No other app or even the user can get into 
this app sandb ox, onlythe app itself . This is a fundamental feature of the iOS operating system, and 
why it isso secure . The data get temporarily stored in the app's sandbox if the app does not have an 
internet connection, and will try again periodically ;we call th is secure 'Caching .' If the internet 
connection resumes and a response from the server is received the data get sent and cleared from the 
cache or successful lysubmi tted . The app can only access the specific user's cache if the user is logged 
in. So once the connection is resolved, the site study personnel need to log in to the app again for data 
to be transferred to the cloud storage.
Wi-Fi issue at some point before subjects complete the task
The app will continue as normal once connection is restored . Any data that can 'tbe sent will be stored 
in the cache, waiting for two things, one for internet connection, and two for the right authenticated 
user to be logged in before sending again . So once the connection is resolved, the site study personnel 
shou ldlog in to the app again, and the subject can complete the task.

5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCATION AND MASKING
5.1. Test Article Allocation 
Use of the test articles will be randomized usi ng a lens fitting schedule supplied by [CONTACT_142452]. The clinical site will follow the lens fitting schedule provided and will complete 
enrollment according to the randomization list a nd will not pre-select or pre-assign subjects.
Randomly-permuted block randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of 
subjects to treatment and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. A computer-generated randomization scheme will be used to randomly assign
subjects to one of the two lens groups (Test or Control). The randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_163077] (daily disposable and daily wear reusable). The ratio of 
habitual wearers of daily disposable lenses to habitual wearers of daily wear reusable lenses 
is 7:3 within each study site (7 habitual wearers of daily disposable lenses versus 3 habitual 
wearers of daily wear reusable lenses). See T able 1. The random sche me will be generated 
using the PROC PLAN procedure from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Software Version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
[ADDRESS_189352] occurred prior to
randomization: 
•Informed consent must have been obtained.  
•The subject must have met all eligibility criteria. 
•The subject’s screening and baseline information must have been collected.
When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
lens fitting schedule. 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the a ppropriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be  recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section. 
5.2. Masking
This is a single-masked trial. Subjects will be unaware of the identity of the investigational product.  The investigators may be aware of the study lenses based on a slight difference in 
lens color (the Test lenses will be slightly more turquoise in color than the Control lens). Investigators and clinical site  personnel involved in the data collection will not be masked as 
to the identity of the investigational product.
CR-6481, v 3.0  
 
Page 22 of 135JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
6.5. Storage Conditions
Test articles will be maintained at ambient temperatures at the clinical site. Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions.
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples
No samples will be collected as part of the study procedures.
When possible, any lens or test article asso ciated with an Adverse Event and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJVC.
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles
JJVC will provide the Investigator with suffici ent quantities of study articles and supplies to 
complete the investigation. The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation for the test article accountability records. 
Test articles must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site  Delegation Log. All test articles must be accounted. This includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits.  
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused, including expi[INVESTIGATOR_93785]. 
3. The number and reason for unplanned replacements. 
The Investigator will collect all unused test artic les from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test ar ticles must be separated from the clinical study 
inventory of un-dispensed test articles and must  be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return. Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or monitor will return all unused test articles to JJVC .
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment  documents and the contents, contact [CONTACT_163078] .

8.2. Withdrawal/Discontinuation from the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
xSubject withdrawal of consent. 
xSubject not compliant to protocol such as st udy lens wear time or habitual lens wear 
while enrolled in the study.
xSubject lost to follow-up. 
xSubject no longer meets eligibility criteria (e.g. the subject becomes pregnant). 
xSubject develops significant or serious adverse events necessitating discontinuation of 
study lens wear. 
xSubjects who have experienced a Corneal Infiltrative Event (CIE). 
xInvestigator’s clinical judgment regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the best interest of the subject to stop treatment).

at least [ADDRESS_189353] 5 days a week over the 2 week wear period)
xSubject not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy and safety including poor vision, poor comfort or unacceptable fit. 
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will:
xComplete the current visit (scheduled or unscheduled). 
xComplete the Final Evaluation, indicating th e reason that the subject was discontinued 
from the study. 
xRecord the spherocylindrical refraction with best corrected distance visual acuity. 
xCollect used test article(s) (worn or brought to the visit) from the subject and discard 
them, unless otherwise stated in section 7.2. 
xCollect all unused test article(s) from the subject. 
xMake arrangements for subject care, if needed, due to their study participation
Additional subjects will be enrolled if a subj ect discontinues from the study prematurely. 
In cases where a subject is lost to follow-up, every possible effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_35508]/withdrawal. The measures taken to follow 
up must be documented including two written attempts and a certified letter (or equivalent) as the final attempt. 
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT INTERVENTION/MEDICATION
Concomitant medications will be  documented during screening and updated during the study.  
xDisallowed medications for this study include : medications that may interfere with 
contact [CONTACT_13279] (see section 9.1).  Habitual medications used by [CONTACT_163079].

JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_35511], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is determined that 
an adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, or that part of the 
investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (either prematur ely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512].
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PR ODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to an y written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following ar e not considered product quality complaints:
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site. 
xLens replacements that occur due to drops/fall-outs. 
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
Within [ADDRESS_189354] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use 
is not configured to send automatic notifications or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor Awareness). 
xWho received the complaint. 
CR-6481, v 3.0  
 
Page 41 of 135JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xStudy number. 
xClinical site information (contact  [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
xLot number(s). 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s). 
xIndication of who first observed comp laint (site personnel or subject). 
xOD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted. 
xAny related AE number if applicable. 
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
xConfirmation of product availability for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return (Refer to Form Control No.
for test article return instructions). 
Once a complaint is received, it will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follow section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the resu lt of a product quality related deficiency, these 
procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Bla nk” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be 
documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.”  
Note : This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices.1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that:

necessitates temporary lens discontinuation < [ADDRESS_189355] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.” 
Note 1 : This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation,  installation, or operation, or any malfunction 
of the investigational medical device.
Note 2 : This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.[ADDRESS_189356] (UADE) – A UADE is any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan , Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include:
CR-6481, v 3.0  
 
Page 44 of 135JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in section 13.1). 
xCausality or Relatedness – i.e. the relations hip between the test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related, unlikely related, possibly 
related, or related - see definition in section 13.2.1). 
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate, or severe - see definition in 
section 13.2.2). 
xOutcome – not recovered or not resolved, recovering or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae, recovered or resolved, death related to adverse event, or
unknown. 
xActions Taken – none, temporarily discontinued, permanently discontinued, or other. 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationshi p between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]:
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures. 
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably expl ained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirme d by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_129814]/her by [CONTACT_3433] e subject. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities. 
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.

13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure. Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of  study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the discretion of the Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal I nvestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.  Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain  documentation of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
xDrawings or photographs (where appropria te) that detail the finding (e.g., size,
location, and depth, etc.). 
xDate the clinical site was notified. 
xDate and time of onset. 
xDate and time of resolution. 
xAdverse event classification, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applicable. 
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropriate), including concomitant medications prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. 
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed. 
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any). 
xLikely etiology. 
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the event, if the AE is related to the visual system. 
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related’ or ‘related’ to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visual system or not), an AE review form 
must be completed. Additiona l dated and initialed entries s hould be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/s he will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be doc umented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatment  beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provi der. The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If 
a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Invest igator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test artic le, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adve rse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatment , or study procedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an  adverse event by e-mail,  facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_163080]/IRB according to 
their requirements (section 13.4.2). The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail or telephone, but no later than 24 hours 
following discovery of the event. The Inves tigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All subjects experiencing a serious/significant advers e event must be followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
CR-6481, v 3.0  
 
Page 47 of 135JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xNotify the Sponsor immediately. 
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject. 
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article. 
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_189357] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_189358].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Re sponsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requireme nts for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events  to the local health authorities according to
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
13.5. Event of Special Interest
None.
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_129815], but due to 
general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Sp ecifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in  refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus.

to the endpoint-specific alpha level 0.0375, and t he smaller p-value will be compared to the 
endpoint-specific alpha level 0.025.

xIf the secondary test with the smaller p-value is successful and the one with the larger 
p-value is not successful, then alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_189360] secondary endpoint cannot 
be tested. 
14.5. Primary Analyses
The primary analysis will be conducted on th e Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with observed 
cases (use only available datapoints and no imputation for missing data). 
End of Day Comfort
End of Day Comfort will be measured using th e individual item “Comfort at the End of the 
Day” at 2-week follow-up. Item responses will be converted into a binary variable for the 
purpose of analysis (Very Satisfied or Satisfied = 1 and others = 0). The dichotomized item 
responses will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model with a binomial distribution 
and the logit as the link function. The model will include lens type as a fixed effect and site as a (G-side) random effect. Other subject characteristics such as ag e, gender, race, iris category,
habitual lens type will be included as fixed effects when appropriate.  
Hypothesis TestingThe null and alternative hypothese s for testing superiority of the Test lens relative to the 
Control lens with respect to end of day comfort are as follows: 
ܪ
଴:  ܴܱ ൑ 1
ܪ஺:ܴܱ>1
Where OR represents the odds ratio of having “Very Satisfied” or “Satisfied” rating for the 
Test lens compared to the Control at the 2-week follow-up. Comparisons between Test and
Control will be carried out using the 95% conf idence interval (CI) constructed for the odds 
ratio (Test over Control). Superiority will be declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval is above 1.  
14.6. Secondary Analyses  
Secondary analyses will be conducted on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with observed 
cases (use only available datapoints and no imputation for missing data). 
CR-6481, v 3.0  
 
Page 53 of 135JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed separately using the same model as described for the 
primary endpoint. Item responses will be converted  into binary variables as follows: Excellent 
or Very Good = 1 and others = 0 for digital device use (“Reduction in the feeling of tired eyes from using a computer or other digital device”) and comfortable vision while night driving 
(“Ability to see comfortably while driving at night”), and Strongly Agree or Agree = 1 and 
others = 0 for comfort throughout the day (“I coul d wear these contact [CONTACT_163081] I wanted to”). 
According to the testing strategy presented in s ection 14, if the primary hypothesis is met, the 
secondary endpoints will be tested as follows:
xfor the first two secondary endpoints (digital device use and comfort throughout the 
day), comparisons between Test and Control will be carried out using the 
corresponding adjusted two-sided CI (96.25% CI for alpha = 0.0375 or 97.5% CI for 
alpha = 0.025), depending on the relative ma gnitude of the obtained nominal p-values,
constructed for the odds ratio (Test ove r Control) separately for each endpoint; 
xfor the last secondary endpoint (comfortable  vision while night driving), a two-sided 
95% CI (alpha = 0.05), 97.5% CI (alpha = 0.025), or 98.75% CI (alpha = 0.0125) will 
be estimated for odds ratio and the confiden ce level will be determined based on the 
success of the previously tested secondary endpoints. 
Superiority will be declared if the lower bound of the corresponding CI is above 1. 
14.7. Other Exploratory Analysis  
All other exploratory endpoints will be descri ptively summarized. A future planned post-hoc 
meta-analysis may be conduc ted using these endpoints.
14.8. Interim Analysis  
Not applicable
14.9. Procedure for Handling Missing Data and Drop-Outs
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed . The count of missing values will be included 
in the summary tables and listings. 
Subject dropout is expected to be one of the main reasons of missing data in this clinical trial. 
Past clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not-at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing da ta on the primary and secondary analyses,
sensitivity analysis may be conducted on th e ITT population using multiple imputation 
methods if the proportion of subject dropout is greater than 15%. The SAS/STAT procedures 
PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized  with a parametric regression method used 
to make at least 20 imputations.
14.10. Procedure for Reporting Deviations from Statistical Plan
The analysis will be conducted according to that specified in above sections. There are no known reasons for which it is planned to deviate from these analysis methods. If for any reason 
CR-6481, v 3.0

a change is made, the change will  be documented in the study report along with a justification 
for the change.
15. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVING
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using the 
BioClinica EDC system. An authorized data originator will enter study data into the eCRFs 
using the EDC system. Data collected on equipment that is not captured in EDC will be
formatted to the specification of the JJVC database manager and sent to JJVC for analysis. 
External data sources for this study include: Not Applicable .
The clinical data will be recorded on dedicated eCRFs specifically designed to match the study 
procedures for each visit. Only specifically delegated staff can enter data on a CRF.  Once 
completed, the eCRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness and signed by [CONTACT_3786]. The sponsor or sponsor’s representatives will be authorized to gain access to the subject recordation for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study. 
Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trails are built into the system to ensure accurate and 
complete data collection. Data will be transmitted from the clinical site to a secure central 
database as forms are completed or updated,  ensuring information accuracy, security, and 
confidentiality. After the final database lock, the Investigator will be provided with Individual 
Patient Profiles (IPP) including the full audit trai l on electronic media in PDF format for all of 
the study data. The IPP must be retained in the st udy files as a certified copy of the source data 
for the study. 
The content and structure of the eCRFs are compliant with ISO14155:2020.

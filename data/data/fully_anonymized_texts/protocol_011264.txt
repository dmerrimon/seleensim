Protocol Title: 
 
A Phase

-Blind, Placebo 
-
Controlled Study to Evaluate The 
Efficacy and Safety 
o 
f Deucravacitinib 
in Participants

ith Moderate -To-Severe Scalp Psoriasis 
(Psoriatyk Scalp)  
Brief Title: 
Efficacy and 
safety of 
d 
eucravacitinib
 versus placebo in participants with 
moderate -to-severe 
 
scalp psoriasis
 
Rationale: 
SOTYKTU™ ( deucravacitinib ), a first 
-
in-class, oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 
 
2 
(TYK2) inhibitor  is approved in multiple countries 
for the treatment of adults with moderate
-to-
severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. 
Th
ese approvals 
were
 
based on the results of the 52- week, randomized, Phase  
3, placebo 
-
controlled studies of 
deucravacitinib [ADDRESS_330052] 30 mg twice daily (BID) (POETYK 
PSO-1 and PSO-2). 
In these  2 studies, in addition to the co 
-
primary endpoints , scalp psoriasis was assessed using the 
scalp -specific 
 Physician Global A
ssessment  (ss
-
PGA) 0 /1 and 
Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index
 
(PSSI ) 90 scores . For the purposes of the analyses in both  of these studie s, the scalp response 
assessment  only included participants 
with
 a ss
-
PGA score ≥ 3 (moderate 
-
to-severe scalp 
psoriasis) at baseline. Approximately 64% of participants in the Phase 3 studies met this criterion . 
Significantly higher ss -PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330053] arms at Week 16 in POETYK PSO -1 (70.8% vs 
17.4% vs 39.1%  respectively ) and POETYK PSO -2 (60.3% vs 17.3% vs 37.3%  respectively ). 
66.5% of participants on 
deucravacitinib 
maintained a ss 
-
PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330054] arm through Week 24 both in POETYK PSO -1 
(61.2% vs 29.1%  respectively ) and POETYK PSO -2 (48.9% vs 28.9%  respectively ).

The duration of study participation is approximately 60 
weeks and
 will be divided into the 
following periods: 
Screening
 (up to 4 weeks), I ntervention  (52 weeks), and Follow- up (4  
weeks).
 
At Week  16, all participants  regardless of their blinded intervention, will be switched to open 
-
label 
deucravacitinib 6 mg QD bottles  through Week 52. 
Participants and 
Investigator
s remain blinded 
to double-blind, placebo- controlle d period study intervention until the end of the study. 
 
 
 
 
Participants will be followed up for safety for 4 additional weeks, from Week 52 through 
Week
 56. 
Participants who discontinue study intervention early/withdraw prematurely must complete the 
End of Treatment 
visit. 
The participant will be asked to return to the clinic to complete the 28 -day 
safety follow -up visit and encouraged to report any 
s
erious adverse events 
or 
adverse events  
experienced during this time. 
Number of Participants:  
It is estimated that approximately 220 enrolled participants will be required to achieve

Study Population:  
Men and women ≥ 18 years of age diagnosed with stable plaque psoriasis ≥ 6 months (defined as 
no morphology changes or significant flares of disease activity in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] ) 
with moderate -to-severe scalp psoriasis ( ss
-
PGA ≥ 3, PSSI ≥ 12, and SSA ≥ 20% ), BSA 
 
≥ 3% , 
and who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy will be eligible to participate in the 
study. 
Intervention Groups and Duration:  
Participants in both intervention groups will take oral doses of one of the investigat ional 
[medicinal ] product (IP/IMP) 
, either 
deucravacitinib 
or placebo QD, for 16 weeks. At Week 
 16, 
all participant 
s, regardless of their blinded intervention, will be switched to open

20 The 2 primary hypotheses will be tested simultaneously with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 
(2‑sided). If either of the test results is not statistically significant (ie, at least one of null hypotheses 
is not rejected), then it is deemed that the study ob jective is not met.

Date: 23-May-2023 34 3 INTRODUCTION  
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, characterized primarily by [CONTACT_82731], that affects up to 3% of the general population. Men and women are equally affected,  and 
it can present at any age.1,[ADDRESS_330075] common form of psoriasis (58% to 97%) is plaque psoria sis 
(psoriasis vulgaris), with less common forms being guttate, pustular, inverse (flexural), and erythrodermic psoriasis. The disease can have a fluctuating relapsing course, with flares that may be induced by [CONTACT_82732], trauma, smoking, and stress.
3 Psoriasis can involve skin 
in any part of the body; particularly disabling is the involvement of specific anatomic regions, such as hands and feet (palmoplantar), face, scalp,  and nails. The scalp is the most commonly affected 
region of the body in psoriasis, involved in about 80% of psoriasis cases.
6 Scalp psoriasis 
represents one of the “ special sites,” given its difficult -to-treat nature and disproportionate impact 
on quality of life  (QoL) . Psoriasis in general has a profound impact on QoL  and can lead  to 
psychological, social , and economic consequences, especially in moderate -to-severe disease.7,[ADDRESS_330076] on 
psychosocial impairment. Effective management of scalp psoriasis is essential to improving a participant ’s QoL.

receive systemic therapy indicated for moderate -to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.6,9,10 
Intervention s include topi[INVESTIGATOR_12469] ( eg, corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, calcineurin 
inhibitors, salicylic acid, urea, and coal tar) ; phototherapy modalities, including broa d-band and 
narrow band ultraviolet B ; and systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In moderate- to-severe disease, systemic 
intervention s are usually needed and may include oral agents (retinoids, methotrexate, 
cyclosporine, and apremilast) or injectables ( eg, biologics such as tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] 
inhibitors etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) anti- interleukin  (IL)-12/23p40 antibody 
(ustekinumab), IL -17 antagonists (secukinumab, ixekizumab, and brodalumab), and anti -IL-23p19 
antibody (guselkumab, t ildrakizumab and risankizumab). Many of these intervention s are 
associated with increased risk of adverse events (A Es) such as hepatotoxicity and neutropenia 
(methotrexate);11 nephrotoxicity (cyclosporine);12 depression and weight loss (apremilast) ;13 
serious infections (cytokine inhibitors);14,15,16,17 candidiasis and Crohn’s disease (IL -17 
antagonists).17,18,19 
Although effective therapeutic options are available, undertreatment or nontreatment of psoriasis 
has been reported in up to half of surveyed participant s (based on absence of intervention  and/or 
dissatisfaction with intervention ).[ADDRESS_330078] efficacy

Background 
 
TYK2 is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase associated with  receptors for the  p40- containing cytokines 
IL-12 and IL -23, as well as the Type I interferon (IFN) receptor, and is required  for the activation 
of their downstream signaling pathways. TYK2 catalyzes 
the phosphorylation 
 
of the intracellular 
receptor domains and signal transducer and activator 
of transcription
 (STAT) proteins resulting in 
the activation of STAT -dependent transcri ption and functional  responses specific for these 
cytokines.22,23, 24 Because TYK2 -dependent cytokines ( eg, Type I IFNs, IL -12, IL -23) are distinct 
from those dependent on closely related Janus kinase (JAK)  family members JAK1/JAK3 ( 
eg
, 
IL-2, IL -15, IL -7) or JAK2 ( eg, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, 
 
GM-CSF), a TYK2 inhibitor 
would be expected to have a highly differentiated profile from  inhibitors of other JAK family 
kinases. TYK2 -dependent pathways and the cytokine networks they 
 
modulate ( 
eg
, IL-23/IL-17, 
IFNα) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple  immune -mediated diseases, 
including psoriasis, lupus, spondylarthritis, and Crohn’s disease. 
Deucravacitinib  is a potent, highly selective , oral, small molecule inhibitor of TYK2. A 
comprehensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of  deucravacitinib  has been established and  
supports the development of this compound in humans. Inhibition of TYK2 is expected to provide  
therapeutic benefit f or participant s with psoriasis for multiple reasons: 1) Many of the pathways 
in the  TYK2 signaling cascade (IL -23 and the downstream mediators IL -17 and IL -22; IFNα) have 
been  implicated in pathogenesis of psoriasis ).8 Biologic agents targeting the IL -17, IL -23p19, and 
IL-12/[ADDRESS_330083] been approved for and are highly efficacious in the 
intervention
 of 
psoriasis.  Further, it is conceivable that 
participant
s with psoriasis could sustain a durable 
therapeutic response after  repeated dosing with 
deucravacitinib
. A recent trial using only a single

response for up to 66 weeks in participant s with moderate -to-severe psoriasis.25 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of deucravacitinib  is 
provided in the  Investigator’s Brochure (IB ).26  
3.2.1 Clinical Development  
The clinical development program for deucravacitinib  consists of multiple studies in healthy 
volunteers, participant s with renal or hepatic insufficiency, and participants with psoriasis,  
alopecia areata, psoriatic  arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, Crohn’ s disease, 
and ulcerative colitis.  
In adult participant s with moderate -to-severe psoriasis, 1 Phase 2 study (IM011011) and 2 Phase 3 
studies (IM011046 and IM011047) have been completed. Study IM011011 was a 12-week, 
randomized, placebo- controlled study conducted with 5 deucravacitinib  intervention  arms ranging 
from 3  mg every other day to 12 mg QD. Studies IM011046 and IM011047 were pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double -
blind, placebo- and active -controlled 52-w eek, Phase 3 studies.  Based on these studies, 
SOTYKTU™ (deucravacitinib), a first- in-class, oral, selective, allosteric TYK2 inhibitor was 
approved in multiple countries for the treatment of adults with moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis 
who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  
There are 2  other completed Phase 3 studi es for adult participants with moderate -to-severe plaque 
psoriasis (IM011065 and IM011066) and an ongoing long- term extension study (IM011075). 
IM011065 is a double -blind, placebo- controlled, 52-w eek study conducted in China, Singapore, 
South Korea, and Taiwan; IM011066 is a single -arm, open- label study conducted in  Japan; 
IM011075 is an open- label study to evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
deucravacitinib in participant s with psoriasis who were previously enrolled in an applicable parent 
study (IM011046, IM011047, IM011065, or IM011066). 
The clinical pharmacology profile of deucravacitinib  has been characterized based on the results 
of multiple clinical pharmacology studies as well as population pharmacokinetics ( PK) and 
exposure- response analyses that incorporated data from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies in 
adult participant s with moderate -to-severe psoriasis.  
A detailed description is provided in the deucravacitinib  IB.26

Date: 23-May-2023 39 3.2.4 SARS- CoV-2 Pandemic- related Risk Assessment  
The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic has been identified as a potential risk 
to clinical trial participants in general, and it may particularly affect individuals with underlying 
chronic diseases who are on immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A t this time, Bristol- Myers Squibb 
Company (BMS) is tracking and accumulating data on COVID -19 and its potential effects on 
participants taking deucravacitinib . The data are analyzed on a regular basis. The risk of 
COVID- 19 on participants taking deucravaci tinib is still unknown due to insufficient clinical data. 
As described in the IB and the informed consent form (ICF ), deucravacitinib  is an 
immunomodulator with potential immunosuppressive effects and participants taking deucravacitinib may have a higher c hance of infections. Accordingly, the studies have exclusion 
criteria aimed at minimizing the risk for serious infection and with study visits that allow for monitoring of participants’ safety. Investigators should ensure that they are able to perform adeq uate safety assessments. The individual benefit /risk considerations remain the responsibility 
of the Investigator  using clinical judgment.  
In addition, the Sponsor has also developed guidance for Investigator s on how to manage a 
participant with a clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884], or a diagnosis of, COVID -19. This includes criteria for 
temporarily interrupting or permanently discontinuing IP ( Section  8.1.1 and Section 8.2) , and 
criteria for reinitiating IP on resolution of a COVID -19 infection (Section  8.2.1 ). In order to 
facilitate reporting of COVID -19 events that occur during the study, all AEs and serious AEs 
(SAEs ) associated with severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV- 2) or 
COVID- [ADDRESS_330084] be reported, regardless of relatedness or causality (Section  9.2.2 ). Such AEs or 
SAEs reported after randomization will also trigger additional data collection through specialized electronic case report form (eCRF) pages, which will allow the Sponsor to further evaluate these events. Testing to exclude COVID- [ADDRESS_330085] practice and requirements. 
3.2.5 Benefit Assessment  
The dose selection of deucravacitinib for this study is based on the dose (6 mg QD) used in the 
adult Phase 3 studies in moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasi s. The dose of 6 mg QD is also approved 
by [CONTACT_270700]. 
The selection of a 6 -mg QD dose in the adult Phase 3 studies was based on the results observed 
from the Phase 2 dose -ranging study in psoriasis (IM011011). There was a significant relationship 
between exposure and the PASI 75 responder rates at Week 12, with doses of deucravacitinib  3 mg 
QD, 3  mg BID, 6 mg BID, and 12 mg QD achieving significantly higher PASI 75 responses 
compared with placebo. Overall, deucravacitinib  was safe and well -tolerated in all intervention 
groups in IM011011. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double -blind, placebo - and active -controlled 
52-w eek, Phase 3 studies (IM011046 and IM011047) in adult participants with mo derate -to-severe 
psoriasis. In both studies, statistical significance was achieved for the deucravacitinib group 
compared with placebo for the co -primary endpoints at Week 16 (s -PGA 0/1 response, PASI  75 
response) and for all but the last key secondary endpoint in the statistical hierarchies versus placebo

Overall Benefit /
Risk Conclusion 
 
Taken together, the nonclinical data and clinical data in healthy participants and in those with 
psoriasis indicate an overall risk/benefit assessment that is appropriate for the investigation of 
deucravacitinib as an oral intervention for adult participants with moderate -to-severe scalp plaque 
psoriasis.

5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1
 
Overall Design 
 
This study (IM011220) 
is a
 52-w eek, Phase 3b/4, multicenter, randomized, double -blind , placebo -
controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
deucravacitinib v 
ersu
s placebo in 
participants with 
moderate
-to-severe 
 
scalp psoriasis. A total of approximately 150 qualified 
participants with moderate -to-severe scalp plaque psoriasis will be 
randomized
 (see Section  
10.2
). 
It is anticipated that 95% (n=143) of the [ADDRESS_330089] s -PGA 
 
≥
 
3 at 
baseline.  
The duration of study participation is approximately 60 
weeks and
 will be divided into the 
following periods: 
Screening
 (up to 4 weeks), 
I
ntervention  (52 weeks), and 
S
afety follow -up 
(4 
weeks).
 
Physical examination (P E), c linical 
 
laboratory evaluations , and other assessments will be done at 
select visits during the study. Participants in this study will be monitored for 
AEs
. 
5.1.1 
 
Screening Period 
  
Participants will be evaluated during the 
screening 
period (up to 4 weeks / 28 days ) to en sure they 
meet eligibility criteria. A detailed medical history will be done at this time, as well as a complete 
PE
. Psoriasis 
-
related history, which will include length of diagnosis, 
BSA 
 
involvement, scalp 
involvement, SSA involvement, and history of syst emic intervention 
, will be assessed 
at 
Screening .  An evaluation for 
TB
 
will be done based on medical history, recent chest imaging 
 
 
  
If a participant exceeds the 28 -day s creening period due to a study 
-
related procedure (eg, waiting 
for a study -related laboratory value), the participant must be reconsented. A new participant 
identification number will be assigned by 
i
nteractive response technology 
(IRT) at the time of re
-
enrollment. In this situation, the fewest number of pro cedures from the initial screening should be

45 5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This Phase 
3b 
/4 study will be conducted in a population of participants
 with stable 
moderate  -to -severe scalp plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic psoriasis therapy. The 
study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 
deucravacitinib 
to placebo in achieving ss -
PGA of 0/1 at Week 16. The ss -PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330092] measure in clinical trials of demonstrating 
efficacy of systemic psoriasis 
interventions. 
Additional analyses 
, including formal statistical 
hypothesis testing, 
 
will also be perf ormed in the participant sub -population with s -PGA ≥ 3 at 
baseline for s 
-
PGA 0/1 response at Week 16 
 
to 
. 
s
-PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330093] for 
comparison. Participants in the placebo arm will be switched to 
deucravacitinib
 at Week 16 to 
provide them  with psoriasis intervention after the endpoints are collected. Week 16 was chosen 
for the primary endpoint evaluations, as it will allow enough time for deucravacitinib to treat 
psoriasis and is the endpoint used in preceding psoriasis Phase 3 
studies
. The purpose of doing a 
52-week 
study is to demonstrate the maintenance of improvement in 
PROs
 
and clinical
 response . 
5.5
 
Justification for Dose 
 
The dose of 6 mg QD is the 
approved dose by [CONTACT_270701] -to-severe plaque ps oriasis. The recommended dose for  
deucravacitinib in the current study aims to achieve similar exposure level to that of 6 mg QD used 
in the Phase 3 studies in adult psoriasis 
participant
s, which is based on the efficacy and safety 
results from the Phase 2, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study of this compound in adult 
participant s with moderate -to-severe  plaque psoriasis (IM011011). The results from the 2 Phase 
 3
 
studies demonstrated that deucravacitinib  at 6 mg QD achieved significantly higher PASI  75 
responses compared with placebo at 
Week
 16 and significantly higher ss -PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330094] been carefully considered  to ensure: 1)  
selection of 
appropriate participant s with scalp psoriasis, 2) safety of the study 
participant
s. It is imperative 
that participants fully meet all eligibility criteria.  
All screening and randomization evaluations must be completed and review ed to confirm that 
potential participant s meet all eligibility criteria. The 
Investigator 
 
will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all 
participant
s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening 
failure, as applicable.  
Prospe ctive approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as 
protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

day screening period is permitted before 
participant 
is declared a screen failure. This is an 
effort to find all possible well 
-qualified 
participant 
s. Consultation with the Medical Monitor
 or 
designee may be needed to identify  whether repeat testing of any particular parameter would be 
clinically relevant.  
The study permits the rescreening (after the end of the initial 28 -day screening period) of a 
participant who discontinues the study as a pretreatment failure ( ie, the participant 
 
fails to meet 
eligibility criteria and has not been treated).  If re-enrolled, the participant 
must be reconsented,
 
assigned a new identification number, and a full Screening Visit must be performed again. A 
participant  can only be rescreened 1 
time (
ie, if the 
participant
 fails 1 rescreening attempt, no 
additional rescreening is allowed). Depending on the timing of rescreening, repetition of some 
assessments may not be 
required. The fewest number of procedures from the initial screening 
should be repeated to quali fy the participant , while maintaining participant safety and eligibility. 
In these cases, the site should consult with the BMS Medical Monitor (or designee). 
Similarly,
 
repeat chest imaging , if performed during screening, 
 
may not be required. Duration of existing

7.2 Method of Study Intervention Assignment  
Before the study is initiated, each user (at investigative sites) will receive log -in information and 
directions on how to access the IRT system. At the time of the 
Screening
 Visit, immediately after 
informed consent is obtained and before any study 
-
relate d procedures are performed, the 
investigative site will access the enrollment option of the IRT system for assignment of a 
participant number for all participants, including participants not subsequently randomized or 
treated. The participant number is ass igned sequentially by [CONTACT_148681]. All enrolled participants will be assigned sequential participant numbers. The participant 
number will not be used for any other participant. If a participant is rescreened, they will be  given 
a new identification number.  
At Day 1, participants who meet all criteria for enrollment at Screening and Day 1 will be centrally 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
deucravacitinib
 6 mg QD or placebo as determined by a computer -
generated randomization schedule using IRT. The randomization lists will be generated by [CONTACT_148682] a permuted block design within each stratum level.

Date: 23-May-2023 55 After all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met for a participant, the investigative site will 
access the IRT on Day 1 for the purpose of randomizing a participant. An  intervention  group will 
be assigned by [CONTACT_148683] -described randomization schedule. In addition, a unique 
kit number will be assigned to the participant corresponding to the intervention  assignment.  
Study intervention will be dispensed at study visits  as shown in the Schedule of Activities  
(Section  2). When new intervention  kits need to be provided, the investigative site will access the 
IRT to obtain the kit number to assign to the participant. 
At Week  16, all participants, regardless of their blinded intervention, will be switched to 
open- label  deucravacitinib  6 mg QD bottles through Week 52. 
7.3 Blinding 
This is a randomized, double- blind , placebo -controlled study. 
7.3.1 Maintaining the Blind  
Blinded intervention assignments will be managed using IRT. IP supply will be controlled by [CONTACT_148684].  
All tablets are identical in appearance and will be supplied in bottles with each daily dose made 
up of the appropriate combination of active and/or placebo tablets to provide the correct intervention, as shown in Table  7.1-1. Investigative site staff, Sponsor and designee personnel, and 
participant s and their families will remain blinded to intervention  assignments.  
The Sponsor and site -facing study team will be unblinded to the individual treatment assignments 
at the primary endpoint database lock after the last participant has completed  the Week 16 visit. 
The primary analysis database lock will occur after all randomized participants completed their  
Week  16 visit or discontinued prior to Week 16. The study participants and I nvestigators will 
remain blinded to the initial treatment assign ment throughout the study.  
7.3.2 Circumstances for Unblinding 
Blinding of study treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, 
in the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge 
of the IP  is critical to the participant ’s management, the blind for that participant may be broken 
by [CONTACT_737] . The participant’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment shou ld be unblinded. 
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant ’s treatment, the Investigator should 
determine that the unblinded information is necessary  (ie, that it will alter the participant ’s 
immediate management ). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to 
the IP, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_270703] . 
It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor or designee, but the Investigator always has ultimate authority for the decision 
to unblind. The actual task of unblinding can be delegated by [CONTACT_30386] a designee 
assigned the task  on the Delegation of Authority. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_270686]

Date : 23-May-2023 56 should only call in for emergency unblinding after the decision to unblind the participant  has been 
documented . 
For this study, the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT manual.  
In case of an emergency , the Investigator  has unrestricted access to randomization information via 
IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the 
Sponsor. After the unblinding, the Investigator shall notify the Medical Monitor or designee  and/or 
study director. Participant and unblinded treatment information and the reason for the bli nd being 
broken must be recorded on the appropriate study status page of the eCRF. After unblinding via 
IRT, the Investigator shall notify the Medical Monitor or designee . 
 In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_270704] , and ens ure every 
attempt is made to minimize additional dis closure and the impact of unblinding. 
Any request to unblind a participant  for nonemergency purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.  
If a participant  is unblinded for any reason, the participant  will be discontinued from treatment.  
7.4 Dosage Modification  
There is no provision for dose modification of study intervention. If a participant interrupts 
intervention  due to an AE, study intervention  can be restarted in consultation with the Medi cal 
Monitor  or designee.  
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
The IP must be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator , or designee where permitted,  to ensure that the IP is only dispensed to study 
participants. The IP  must be dispensed only from official study sites by [CONTACT_270705].  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study intervention is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study intervention arise, the study intervention  
should not be dispensed,  and BMS should be contact[CONTACT_15608].  
Study intervention  not supplied by [CONTACT_53972].  
IP documentation (whether supplied by [CONTACT_20447]) must be maintained that includes all processes 
required to ensure the drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug 
storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes ( eg, required diluents, administration sets).  
• The Investigator  or designee must confirm that the appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.

8.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation from Study Intervention  
Temporary study intervention  discontinuation is only allowed if the p articipant  develops an AE 
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], indicates that it is in the participant ’s best interest that 
the study intervention be placed on hold. Study intervention  in this situation should be stopped 
until the AE is medically tre ated and has resolved per  Investigator’s judgment. 
Temporary interruption of study treatment should be implemented in the context of clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148660] -CoV- [ADDRESS_330106] for SARS -CoV- 2. When study treatment 
is interrupted in a co nfirmed case of SARS -CoV- 2, the Investigator, in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor, should determine whether the resolution of symptoms alone ( ie, without repeat 
diagnostic testing for SARS- CoV- 2) is sufficient to resume study treatment.

• Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities  (Section  2). 
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed . 
• All immediate safety concerns must be  discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue intervention. 
• Adherence t o the study design requirements, including those specified in the S chedule o f 
Activities  (Section  2), is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria before  randomizatio n. The Investigator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for scr eening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management ( eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been 
performed within the timeframe defined in the S chedule o f Activities  (Section  2).

PGA)  
The s -PGA is a 5 -point scale of an average assessment of all psoriatic lesions based on erythema,  
scale, and induration.27 The s -PGA measure determines psoriasis severity at a single point in time  
(without taking into account the baselin 
e disease condition) as clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2),
 
moderate (3), or severe (4). All s -PGA assessments should be performed by a trained physician 
(eg, 
dermatologist) or appropriately trained 
Investigator 
who is experienced in the assessment of  
p
soriasis patients. Every effort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who
 
performed the s -PGA evaluations for a 
participant 
 
at randomization performs the s -PGA for that 
participant  
at all subsequent visits

143 subjects) would have baseline s -PGA scores ≥  3. All assumed response rates and averages 
used for the sample size calculation were derived from the Phase 3 BMS studi es IM011046 and 
IM011047 data. All sample size estimates were performed using nQuery Advisor version  7.0. 
A total sample size of 150 participants randomized in a blinded fashion in a 2:1 ratio to deucravacitinib 6 mg QD and placebo, will provide approximat ely 95% power based on a 
chi-squared test with Type I error = 0.05, to compare deucravacitinib 6 mg QD to placebo for the Key Secondary 3 ( α=0.05)

Date: 23-May-2023 77 primary endpoint, proportion of participants that achieve ss -PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330127] a 2 -point 
reduction from baseline at Week 16. Also,  a sample size of 143 (sub- population with baseline 
s-PGA ≥  3) provide s approximately 94% power with Type I error = 0.05. This power estimate 
assumes ss- PGA 0/1 response rates of 55% and 25% for deucravacitinib 6 mg QD and placebo, 
respectively.  
The assumed ss- PGA 0/1 response rates of 55% and 25% for deucravacitinib  6 mg QD and 
placebo, respectively , were derived based on a weighted average of response rates such that mild 
plaque psoriasis attributed 30% and moderate/severe plaque p soriasis attributed 70% of the 
population per the study design. The ss -PGA 0/1 response rates at Week 16 (deucravacitinib 6 mg 
QD: 65%, placebo: 20%) from the pooled P hase 3 studies (IM011047 and IM011046) were used 
for the moderate/severe plaque psoriasis  and an assumed response rate of 25% in each arm for the 
mild population. With a total of 150 randomized participants (100 deucravacitinib 6 mg QD 
participants and 50 placebo participants), the weighted ss -PGA 0/1 response rates were 
approximately 55% and 25% for deucravacitinib  6 mg QD and placebo, respectively. Given the 
uncertainty in the assumed ss- PGA 0/[ADDRESS_330128] on power 
for other possible response rates; eg, if the placebo rate was as high as 30%, there is still 83% 
power to detect a difference of 25% (OR: 2.852) between deucravacitinib 6 mg QD and placebo  
at an alpha level of 0.05.

The sample size for the study is driven primarily to ensure there is a nominal power of approximately 90% for each endpoint including the 3 key secondary endpoints on the O verall 
Population. It is anticipated that 95% (n=143) of the [ADDRESS_330129] 
s-PGA ≥  3 at baseline, and therefore the statistical power is still adequate for the sub -population.

filed with the site’s standard operating procedures and a copy provided to BMS upon request.  
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The method of disposal  (eg, incinerator, lice nsed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste -disposal 
vendor ) must be documented.  
• Accountability and disposal records are complete, up- to-date, and available for the Study 
Monitor to review throughout the clinical trial period.  
 
It is the Investigator ’s or de signee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers.  
If conditions for destruction cannot be met , the responsible Study Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study treatments provided by [CONTACT_20444] (or its vendors). Destruction of non -study 
treatments sourced by [CONTACT_779], not supplied by [CONTACT_20444], is solely the responsibility of the Investigator 
or designee.  
STUDY AND SITE START AND CLOSURE  
The Sponsor /designee reserves the right to close the study site or to terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the S ponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The Investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination . 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor or Investigator  may include , but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of the Investigator  to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local H ealth Authorities, the Sponsor ’s procedur es, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_737]  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development  
 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the Investigator s, the IECs/I RBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organization(s) 
used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_1214]. The Investigator  shall promptly inform the participant and sho uld assure 
appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up.

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse Event Definition:  
An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing 
medical condition in a clinical investigation participant  administered study treatment  that does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship wi th this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any a bnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments ( eg, electrocardiograms , radiological scans, VS 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator . Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term should be updated to be the diagnosis. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition , including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention adm inistration , even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_737] ), 
should not be reported as an AE/ serious 
SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reporte d regardless of 
sequelae and should specify “ intentional overdose”  as the verbatim term . 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE, even if serious conditions 
are met.

Date: 23-May-2023 106 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results in death . 
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe) . 
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE 
below). 
NOTE:  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148666]- Myers Squibb ( BMS ) clinical 
studies:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event). 
• Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent. 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure. 
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status ( eg, routine colonoscopy). 
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases. 
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg , lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
• Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other 
SAEs  (applies to oncology prot ocols) . 
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event [s] that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313] , based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant  or may require intervention [ eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above) . Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm  and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.8 for the definition of potential DILI.)

EVALUATING AES AND SAES  
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/ SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration, will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or product information for marketed products 
in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the S ponsor. However, it is very important that 
the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor. 
• The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
 
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported dur ing the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities. 
• Moder ate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
 
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.

 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. 
(Note:  Follow -up SAE reports must include the same Investigator  term[s] initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment  or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE  
• SAEs, whether related or not related to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form. 
− The required method for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.  
− The paper SAE Report Form is intended only as a back 
-
up option when the electronic 
data capture system is unavail able/not functioning for transmission of the eCRF to BMS

participants, refer to Section  6.1 of the protocol. Only the contraception methods as described in 
Section  6.1 are acceptable for this study.  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A wom an is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following categories are not c onsidered WOCBP:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal fe male with 1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_330155] a serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause. 
 
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels an d may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. Suggested guidelines for the duration of the washout periods for HRT types are presented below. Investigato rs 
should use their judgment in checking serum FSH levels. 
• 1-week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)  
• 4-week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8-week minimum for oral products

level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal. 
End of Relevant Systemic Exposure  
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in context of safety margins from the no -observed-adverse- effect level,  or the time required for 
5 half- lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods.  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent

Protocol Amendment 0 3 
Date: 23-May-2023 111 • Bilateral tubal occlusion.  
• Vasectomized partner  
Having a vasectomized par tner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
A vasectomy is a highly effective contraception method provided that the participant is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
• Sexual abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention . 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to  be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• Continuous abstinence must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy. 
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contrace ption when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participant chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to, calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.  
NOTES:  
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_143852]. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants in clinical studies.   
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study intervention , which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of 
hormonal contraception, refer to. Sections  6.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.7.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR 
RESTRICTED INTERVENTION S of the protocol.  
c IUSs are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug int eraction studies when hormone 
exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness. For information specific to this

Title  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section 9.2.6  
Pregnancy  The following language was deleted:  
“Any pregnancy that occurs in a female 
partner of a male study participant should be 
reported to Sponsor or designee. In order for 
Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy 
surveillance information from the female 
partner, the female partner must sign a n ICF 
for disclosure of this information. Information 
on this pregnancy will be collected on the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form.”  To align with current protocol model 
document language  
Section 9.2.6  
Pregnancy  The following French specific text was added:  
Study participants who are WOCBP will use 
urine pregnancy kits so they can conduct 
pregnancy tests at home at Weeks 36, 44, and 
48. At -home pregnancy urine hCG test testing 
(WOCBP only) must be done per protocol 
schedule. Study participants will be instructed 
to communicate the results of the pregnancy 
tests to the site, with reminders and follow -up 
from the site study team, and pregnancy test 
results will be documented by [CONTACT_270733]’ eCRFs. Sites need to obtain and 
document that the pregnancy test is negative. 
If at-home urine pregnancy test is ambiguous, 
a serum pregnancy test must be performed, 
and participants should be asked to 
immediately pause taking study intervention 
until pregnancy status is confirmed. If at -
home urine pr egnancy test is positive, the 
study participant will be discontinued from the 
study as per the protocol discontinuation 
criteria. If pregnancy testing is not done per 
protocol schedule, the Investigator must 
contact [CONTACT_270734]’s further 
participation in the study.  This French specific change is to add 
pregnancy testing collection in the 
active treatment period between 
visits

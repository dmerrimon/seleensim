2.0 TRIAL DESIGN
2.1 Trial Design
This is a phase 2 open label study of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic castrate 
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with or without DNA damage repair defects. All patients 
must have received prior secondary hormonal therapy. 
At the time of screening, subjects will undergo mandatory biopsy of primary or metastatic 
tissue to determine DNA repair gene mutation and/or MSI signature [CONTACT_41900]. Both tests are 
performed in a CLIA certified laboratory. MSI testing will be performed by [CONTACT_657254] a turn-around time of 1-2 weeks. 
Subjects will be assigned to one of two treatment groups: 
Group 1 (DNA damage repair proficient group):  Twenty-five subjects with MMR 
intact by [CONTACT_657255] 
Group 2 (DNA damage repair deficient group): Twenty-five subjects with MSI-high 
and/or DNA repair gene mutations. 
oPatients with previously identified MSI-high tumor by [CONTACT_657253], or 
homozygous deletion or deleterious germline or somatic mutation(s) in DNA 
damage repair gene(s) (such as BRCA1 , BRCA2, and ATM) identified in a 
CLIA-certified laboratory are allowed in Group 2. 
All subjects will receive pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study is radiographic progression-free 
survival (rPFS).
Because the DNA damage repair defective signature [CONTACT_657279] 
~20% of screened subjects, Group 1 is anticipated to complete enrollment before Group 2. 
To facilitate initial accrual, we will enroll the initial patients onto the clinical trial and begin 
treatment without having the full results of the DNA repair status available so long as Group 
1 has slots available (i.e. at least the initial 25 patients). Once Group 1 is fully enrolled (and 
DNA damage repair status verified for those subjects), DNA damage repair defective status 
must be confirmed before subjects can enroll to the remaining slots in Group 2. 
Approximately 125 subjects are anticipated to be screened to complete enrollment in both 
groups.
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ADDRESS_885952] of docetaxel or cabazitaxel with or without a platinum agent (e.g. carboplatin). A 
minimum of 2 cycles and a maximum of 8 cycles of chemotherapy will be given. Clinical 
response to chemotherapy is defined as PSA decrease by >50% or objective response by 
[CONTACT_393] v1.1. 
Inclusion of patients onto Group [ADDRESS_885953], while the study 
aims to elucidate whether DNA damage repair defects could be a predictive biomarker to 
PD-1 blockade, this is the hypothesis that is being tested and it is unknown whether this is the 
case. Assessing clinical response rates in the two study groups will address this question. 
Second, a key component of the protocol is to assess whether chemotherapy “rescues” non-
responders to derive benefit from anti-PD-1 blockade, regardless of whether the tumor 
harbors DNA damage repair defects. Lastly, the clinical response to pembrolizumab in 
patients with mCRPC may be more than previously anticipated. Preliminary data from 
KEYNOTE-028 showed that 3 of 23 mCRPC patients achieved partial response (Hansen A 
et al. 2016). A phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in enzalutamide-resistant mCRPC patients 
showed that 3 of 10 patients achieved partial response, one of whom harbored MMR 
deficiency (Graff JN et al. 2016).

3.0 OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHESES
3.1 Primary Objective & Hypothesis
(1) Objective: To compare the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in mCRPC 
subjects with proficient DNA damage repair (Group 1) and defective DNA damage 
repair (Group 2), using PCWG3 criteria.
Hypothesis: mCRPC patients whose tumors have defective DNA damage repair have 
improved response to pembrolizumab compared to patients whose tumors have 
proficient DNA damage repair.
3.2 Secondary Objectives & Hypotheses
(1) Objective: To compare rate of immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) and 
PFS at [ADDRESS_885954] v.1.1.
Hypothesis: Subjects whose tumors have defective DNA damage repair have longer 
irPFS and PFS than those whose tumors have proficient DNA damage repair.
(2) Objective: To compare the proportion of subjects achieving any PSA response and 
PSA decline >50% from baseline in both study groups.
Hypothesis: A higher proportion of subjects whose tumors have defective DNA repair 
will achieve PSA response than those whose tumors have proficient DNA repair.
(3) Objective: To assess the safety of pembrolizumab in both study groups by [CONTACT_3989] 
v4.0.
Hypothesis: Pembrolizumab is well tolerated in subjects with mCRPC in both study 
groups.
(4) Objective: To compare time to progression after taxane-based chemotherapy in 
subjects who initially progress on pembrolizumab, undergo taxane-based 
chemotherapy, followed by [CONTACT_657256].
Hypothesis: Taxane-based chemotherapy increases the visibility of tumor antigens 
and recaptures response to pembrolizumab in some subjects in both study groups.

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
4.1 Background
In recent years, there has been significant enthusiasm surrounding tumor immunotherapy, 
specifically with immune checkpoint antibodies targeting the immune inhibitory co-receptors 
CTLA-4 and PD-1 (Postow MA et al., 2015). However, these agents have failed to 
demonstrate significant activity in patients with advanced prostate cancer (Kwon ED et al., 
2014; Topalian SL et al., 2012). Dramatic and durable clinical responses were observed in 
approximately 10% of patients with mCRPC receiving CTLA-4 blockade (Kwek SS et al., 
2015; Fong L et al., 2009).  Furthermore, clinical responses in these trials have been shown 
to be associated with amplification of pre-existing immune responses (Kwek SS et al., 2012; 
Cha E et al., 2014).
Tumor associated mutations, which would provide a potential pool of neoantigens, have been 
shown to be associated with clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibition. Mutational 
analysis in melanoma and NSCLC showed that greater mutational burden in the tumor is 
correlated with treatment response and survival benefit from immune checkpoint blockade  
(Snyder A et al., 2014; Rizvi NA et al., 2015). Consistent with this is the recently reported 
finding that patients with mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient metastatic carcinomas have high 
rates of somatic mutations, and have improved response and survival after PD-1 blockade 
with pembrolizumab (Le DT et al., 2015). One patient with MMR deficiency in this cohort 
had metastatic prostate cancer, and achieved complete response after treatment with 
pembrolizumab (Diaz LA et al., 2016).
Primary prostate cancers generally have a low mutational landscape (Alexandrov LB et al., 
2013), which would presumably translate to a lower number of neoantigens that can 
potentially be recognized and targeted by [CONTACT_27639].  However, whole exome 
sequencing of metastatic prostate cancer indicates that the prevalence of MMR repair 
deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI) in advanced prostate cancer can be as high as 
12% (Pritchard CC et al., 2014). Furthermore, other mutations in the DNA repair pathway, 
specifically BRCA2, BRCA1 and ATM, have been reported to occur in approximately 19% 
of patients with advanced prostate cancer (Robinson D et al., 2015). 
Recently, a 44 gene expression assay (DDRD IO) has been developed by [CONTACT_657257] a 
biomarker for defects in the Fanconi’s anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway, and has been shown to 
predict response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer (Mulligan 
JM et al., 2014). Multiple genes in this signature [CONTACT_657283], including the 
immune checkpoint targets PD-L1 and IDO1 (Mulligan JM et al., 2014). Furthermore, 
positive FA/BRCA signature [CONTACT_657284]-tumor lymphocyte infiltration, increased 
PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and lymphocytes, as well as microsatellite instability 
(unpublished data), making it an attractive biomarker to study for cancer 
immunotherapeutics. 
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ADDRESS_885955] the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with 
mCRPC who had received prior secondary hormonal therapy, using mutations in DNA repair 
genes, MSI status, and/or FA/BRCA signature [CONTACT_657285]. A chemotherapy 
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-challenge option is included to explore the theory that chemotherapy may 
enhance and recapture responses to subsequent immune checkpoint blockade.
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background 
information on MK-3475.
4.1.[ADDRESS_885956] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors.
The PD-[ADDRESS_885957] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-
cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2).  
The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved.  PD-1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-[ADDRESS_885958] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and 
Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-
CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The 
ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a 
variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both 
ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the 
extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  
Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_885959] 
notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on 
antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase 2 - pembrolizumab Page 14 of 90
PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 
serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs 
express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant 
levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention.
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has been approved in the United 
Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease 
progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
More recently, Keytruda was also approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) following progression on platinum-based chemotherapy in tumors that express PD-
L1.
4.1.2 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.
4.[ADDRESS_885960] Population
Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) represents the most advanced form 
of prostate cancer. While treatment options exist—including androgen receptor (AR)-
targeted agents (abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide) and chemotherapy (docetaxel and 
cabazitaxel)—they are associated with significant toxicities, and resistance to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_657247]. 
Immunotherapy is an attractive strategy for patients with advanced prostate cancer, because it 
has the potential to lead to durable responses and is generally better tolerated. However, the 
only FDA approved immunotherapy for prostate cancer to date is sipuleucel-T, an autologous 
cellular vaccine designed to stimulate an immune response targeting PAP (prostatic acid 
phosphatase) (Kantoff PW et al., 2010). The only phase 3 randomized controlled trial of 
immune checkpoint blockade, with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_657248], failed 
to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (Kwon ED et al., 2014). Early phase studies 
of PD-1 blockade in advanced malignancies has not demonstrated clinical activity in 
advanced prostate cancer (Topalian SL et al., 2012). Therefore, a need exists to improve 
immunotherapeutic strategies in this patient population.
Tumors that have defective DNA repair mechanisms have higher rates of spontaneous 
mutations, translating to higher expression of neoantigens that may be recognized by [CONTACT_33103]. In this study, we hypothesize that patients with mCRPC who harbor MMR-
defective tumors and/or tumors that carry the 44-gene FA/BRCA expression signature 
(described in background) will have improved response to anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. 
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ADDRESS_885961] MMR and negative FA/BRCA 
signature [CONTACT_657286], a phenotype that represents the majority of prostate cancer patients. 
The remaining subjects enrolled will be selected to harbor MSI-high and/or FA/BRCA 
signature [CONTACT_657286], which is anticipated to be present in approximately 20% of the 
target patient population. Thus we will enrich from the general mCRPC population. Patients 
with previously identified MSI-high tumor by [CONTACT_657253], or homozygous deletion or 
deleterious germline or somatic mutation(s) of DNA damage repair gene(s) (such as BRCA1, 
BRCA2 , and ATM) identified in a CLIA-certified laboratory are allowed in the DNA damage 
repair defective group. All subjects will receive pembrolizumab. 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification 
An open-label Phase I trial ([COMPANY_006] Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and 
no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK-3475 showed 
evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose 
levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  Recent 
data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of 
MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical 
activity.
PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-
2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This 
early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and 
Q3W dosing schedule.  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
data from [ADDRESS_885962] a wide therapeutic 
range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed 
dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to 
remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the 
melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and 
safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 
5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no 
significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between 
the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in 
exposure between different indication settings.

Phase 2 - pembrolizumab Page 16 of 90
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at 
either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response 
relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg 
Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution 
behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption 
that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with 
tumor type.
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the 
fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient 
exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal 
efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range 
established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians 
and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity 
in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints
Clinical efficacy endpoints for the primary and secondary objectives in the study include 
progression-free survival (rPFS, irPFS, and PFS), PSA response (any PSA decline and PSA 
decline >50% from baseline), and time to progression after taxane-based chemotherapy and 
pembrolizumab re-challenge.

[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research
The primary question in this study is whether MSI-high signature [CONTACT_657287]-1 
blockade in patients with mCRPC. Correlative studies will be carried out to understand 
differential effects of these DNA damage repair biomarkers on the tumor microenvironment 
and immune response, at baseline and with treatment. Exploratory analysis will include:
1. Characterization and quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
2. Expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells and TILs
3. Quantification of TCR repertories
4. Assessment of tumoral mutational burden  
5. Characterization of peripheral immune cell subsets

5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Selection
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 – 
Background and Rationale.  
Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modification and toxicity management for immune-related AEs associated 
with pembrolizumab
Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first 
dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for 
drug-related toxicities and severe or life-threatening AEs as per Table 3 below. See Section 
5.6 for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.
Table 3: Dose Modification Guidelines for Drug-Related Adverse Events
General instructions:
1. Severe and life-threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_13215]. Other immunosuppressive treatment should 
begin if the irAEs are not controlled by [CONTACT_13216].
2.Study intervention must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10 mg/day within [ADDRESS_885985] study intervention treatment. 
3.The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_885986] 4 weeks.
4.If study intervention has been withheld, study intervention may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤ Grade 1 after corticosteroid taper.

eEvents that require discontinuation include, but are not limited to: encephalitis and other clinically important irAEs(vasculitis and sclerosing cholangitis).
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., 
elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 
3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the PI. The reason for interruption should be documented in the 
patient's study record.
5.2.2 Timing of Dose Administration
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 
6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of 
each cycle due to administrative reasons.
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. A 
window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 
min/+10 min).
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the 
pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.
5.2.3 Trial Blinding/Masking
All subjects enrolled in this study will receive pembrolizumab. Subjects will not be blinded 
to their DNA damage repair signature [CONTACT_657288]1/2, ATM, Fanconi anemia, and CHEKC2 mutations (Mateo J et al., 2015). 
5.3 Randomization or Treatment Allocation
Randomization will not be employed in this study due to the nature of the study. Subjects 
will be assigned to the appropriate study group based on DNA damage repair status (Group 1 
if DNA repair gene unmutated/MMR intact; Group 2 if MSI-high and/or DNA repair gene 
mutated). All subjects enrolled will receive pembrolizumab. Patients with previously 
identified MSI-high tumor by [CONTACT_657263], or homozygous deletion or deleterious somatic 
mutation(s) in DNA damage repair gene(s) (such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM) identified in 
a CLIA-certified laboratory are allowed in Group 2 (Figure 1).

5.4.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial:
Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy 
oException: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients are required to 
maintain castrate-level testosterone (<50 ng/dL) with a GNRH agonist or 
antagonist +/- LHRH. Patients without history of bilateral orchiectomy are 
required to remain on ADT.  
Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol
Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol
Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab
Radiation therapy 
oNote:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may 
be allowed at the investigator’s discretion.  
Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_885997] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid vaccine. 
Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  Glucocorticoids without 
significant systemic bioavailability (e.g. budesonide or joint injections) are allowed.  
The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation 
with the Sponsor.
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  
Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.

5.5 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care
5.5.1 Supportive Care Guidelines
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these 
guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms 
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made 
to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when 
the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does 
not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose 
modification. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. 
Pneumonitis: 
oFor Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.
oFor Grade 3-4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti-inflammatory measures, as needed.
oAdd prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration.
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase 2 - pembrolizumab Page 34 of 90
Diarrhea/Colitis: 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
oAll subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid

5.6 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations
5.6.1 Diet
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ADDRESS_885999] azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).  
Acceptable methods of contraception are:
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):
Intrauterine device (IUD) for subject’s partner
Vasectomy 
Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin for subject’s partner
 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):
Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide) for subject’s partner
Cervical cap with spermicide (for subject’s partner, nulliparous women only)  
Contraceptive sponge (for subject’s partner, nulliparous women only) 
Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)
Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]-
only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous 
contraceptive injection (for subject’s partner)
Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle 
and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the 
initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_886000] should 
not be entered into the study.
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ADDRESS_886001] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:
The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent.
Confirmed radiographic disease progression
Note: For unconfirmed radiographic disease progression, please see Section 5.2.2
Note: A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with 
confirmed radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved. See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements
• The subject is lost to follow-up
• Completed 24 months of uninterrupted treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 
administrations of study medication, whichever is later.
Note: [ADDRESS_886002] dose. Subjects 
who stop pembrolizumab after 24 months may be eligible for up to one year of 
additional study treatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_445651] [IP_ADDRESS]
• Administrative reasons
The End of Treatment and Follow-up visit procedures are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow 
Chart) and Section 7.1.2 (Treatment Period).  After the end of treatment, each subject will be 
followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected 
for 90 days after the end of treatment as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Subjects who 
discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post-treatment follow-up for 
disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing 
consent or becoming lost to follow-up.  After documented disease progression each subject 
will be followed by [CONTACT_80075], withdrawal of consent, or the 
end of the study, whichever occurs first.
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ADDRESS_886003] meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion 
criteria, and the trial is open.  Subjects will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at 
the time of initial discontinuation.  Additional details are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
5.[ADDRESS_886004] received any dose of 
study therapy will not be replaced. Patients removed from study for unacceptable treatment 
related adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of all treatment 
related AEs to Grade 0-[ADDRESS_886005]. However, they will not be replaced.
5.9 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]
A stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80030]-related toxicity (defined as any Grade 4 
toxicity, any recurrent Grade 3 toxicity, or any Grade 3 toxicity persisting more than 4 
weeks) is observed at a frequency of ≥33% in any study group. Because pembrolizumab is 
generally well tolerated, this safety review will occur after a total of [ADDRESS_886006] been 
accrued (either study group).
5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES
7.1 Trial Procedures
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  The study-specific assessments are detailed below (Section 7.1.1 and Section 7.1.2).  
Screening assessments must be performed within [ADDRESS_886016].  Any results falling outside of the reference ranges may be repeated 
at the discretion of the investigator. All on-study visit procedures are allowed a window of ± 
3 days unless otherwise noted.  Treatment or visit delays for public holidays or weather 
conditions do not constitute a protocol violation.
Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.

[IP_ADDRESS] Trial Compliance (Medication/Diet/Activity/Other)
A subject may be discontinued from the study for significant non-compliance with treatment 
or procedure requirements.
7.1.4 Clinical Procedures/Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new 
or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically 
indicated.  Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during 
the follow-up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Appendix 11.2).  Toxicities 
will be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action 
taken with regard to trial treatment. 
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Physical Exam

[IP_ADDRESS] Directed Physical Exam
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator 
or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to 
trial treatment administration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only.
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Appendix 11.1) at 
screening, prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of 
trial treatment as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease
Radiographic evaluations and tumor measurements will be performed at screening 
(within [ADDRESS_886030] dose of pembrolizumab), then every 12 weeks (+/- 
2 weeks) thereafter, including the off study evaluation. Weeks are in reference to 
calendar week, and should not be adjusted for pembrolizumab dosing delays. 
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast and bone scan should be performed. If 
sodium fluoride (NaF) PET/CT was initially used for staging, the same bone 
imaging modality (i.e. NaF PET/CT) should be used throughout the study. 
Immune-related response criteria (irRC) will be used to determine radiographic 
response of non-bone tissue on pembrolizumab. PCWG3 will be used to determine 
radiographic response of bone metastases on pembrolizumab; specifically the 
appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions will qualify as disease progression. For 
subjects who progress and go on to receive taxane-based chemotherapy,) RECIST 
v1.1 and/or PCWG3 will be used to determine radiographic response on 
chemotherapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling
Subjects will undergo tumor tissue biopsy at the time of screening for DNA repair defects. 
Assays that can be used for detecting this include: targeted mutation sequencing and MSI 
testing. Targeted mutation sequencing can include the UCSF 500 as well as commercial tests 
(e.g. Foundation, Strata). MSI testing will be performed at UCSF if the targeted mutation 
sequencing is equivocal. FA/BRCA signature [CONTACT_657290]

unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the 
use of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event.
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_26336] a physiologically appropriate time.

Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre-screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any 
protocol-specified procedure or intervention. The subject is first required to provide consent 
to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE 
reporting before blood draw and fresh tumor biopsy.
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed 
closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if 
clinically indicated.
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met.
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a 
non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide

Relationship to 
[COMPANY_006] Product Did [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_78031] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures 
that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the 
available information.
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between [COMPANY_006] product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):
Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?
Time Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of [COMPANY_006] product? 
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?
Likely Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors

7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations. 
Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within [ADDRESS_886056] 
administration of the study drug(s) and it is determined to be related either to the study 
drug(s) or to a study procedure, the Investigator or his/her designee must notify the DSMC 
Chair (or qualified alternate) within [ADDRESS_886057] report events meeting the UCSF IRB definition of 
“Unanticipated Problem” (UP) within 5 business days of his/her awareness of the event. 
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for 
determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is 
both serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets 
all three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction 
Unexpected 
Serious 
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report.
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days  
after the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting 
(21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA 
no later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 
CFR 312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report 
will be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).

for the subjects with proficient DNA damage repair, if 6-month rPFS rate is 45% for the 
defective DNA damage repair, we have 80% of power to claim that that subjects with 
defective DNA damage repair have increased radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) 
compared to subjects with proficient DNA damage repair at one-side alpha of 0.05.
8.2  Statistical Analysis Plan Summary: Primary Objective
8.2.1 Radiographic Progression Free Survival
Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) is defined as the time from the first day of 
study treatment with pembrolizumab to the date of documented radiographic tumor 
progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Radiographic tumor 
progression is defined according to the PCWG3 (Scher HI et al., 2016) guidelines. 
The point estimate of 6-month rPFS rate and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for 
each group, and will be compared by [CONTACT_1192]-sample binomial test. The median rPFS and its 
95% confidence interval will be obtained for each study group by [CONTACT_444783]. Log 
rank test will be used to compare rPFS between the two study groups.

interval in each study group. Log rank test will be used to compare the irPFS and PFS 
between the two groups, separately.
8.3.2 PSA Response
The proportion of subjects achieving any PSA response and PSA decline of >50% from 
baseline from the time of the first day of study treatment with pembrolizumab will be 
calculated in both study groups. The duration of PSA response related to treatment duration 
will be summarized using a radar or spi[INVESTIGATOR_203825]. The point estimate and its 95% confidence 
interval will be obtained for the proportion of PSA response separately for each study group.

8.4 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary: Exploratory Objectives
8.4.1 Immune Infiltration 
Immune cell subsets and localization will be assessed by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) in 
baseline tissue biopsy samples as well as optional tissue biopsy samples at time of 
progression. Markers will include CD3, CD8 and FoxP3. Differences in immune cell subsets 
between study groups will be analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For available paired 
samples, changes in immune cell subsets between baseline and progression will be analyzed 
using Wilcoxon Signed-rank test. In addition, within each study group, Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test will be used to assess whether there is a relationship between any of the immune cell 
subsets (both baseline and the change from baseline to progression) and objective response, 
PSA response, and PFS at 20 and 28 weeks, respectively.
8.4.2 PD-L1 staining
PD-L1 IHC will be performed by [CONTACT_80091] (CLIA-certified) on baseline and progression 
biopsy tissues (excluding bone metastases) using [COMPANY_006]’s 22C3 antibody. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to summarize PD-L1 scores between study groups and individuals 
(when paired samples are available). Moreover, within each study group, Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test will be used to assess whether there is a relationship between PD-L1 score (both baseline 
and the change from baseline to progression) with objective response, PSA response, and 
PFS at 20 and 28 weeks, respectively.

8.4.3 T Cell Receptor (TCR) Repertories
For each subject, blood will be collected at screening, every 3 weeks during treatment, and 
every 3 months during follow-up. T cell repertoire before, during and after treatment will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_11398]-generation sequencing. Besides the number of unique clonotypes and read 
depth, the TCR repertoire diversity will be assessed by [CONTACT_657271]. Repertoire overlap will be measured by [CONTACT_80093]-Urbani and Buser index, and 
changes in clonotypes counts between sequencing experiments will be measured using 
Morisita’s distance. The diversity index will be compared by [CONTACT_80094]-sum test 
between study groups first, then within each study group. Wilcoxon rank-sum test will also 
be used to assess whether the diversity index is different between responders vs. non-
responders (defined by [CONTACT_657272]), and between subjects 
who have progression at [ADDRESS_886063] not progressed in each study 
group.
8.4.4 Mutational Burden 
Whole exome sequencing (WES) will be performed in baseline biopsy tissues in a subset of 
subjects in each study group. The average number of somatic mutations per tumor will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_80094]-sum test between study groups as well as between responders vs. 
non-responders (defined by [CONTACT_657272]), and between subjects 
who have progression at [ADDRESS_886064] will also be used to assess differences 
in immune subsets in responders vs. non-responders (defined by [CONTACT_657273]), and between subjects who have progression at [ADDRESS_886065] MSI and FA/BRCA signature [CONTACT_657292], the agreement between MSI status and

11.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for a Phase 2 or 3 Institutional Study
1.         Oversight and Monitoring Plan
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and subject safety 
for all HDFCCC institutional clinical studies.  A summary of DSMC activities for this study 
includes: 
Review of patient data. 
Review of serious adverse events.
Auditing every six months (depending on study accrual).
Minimum of a yearly regulatory audit.
2. Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines
Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and patient safety and discuss each 
patient’s treatment at monthly site committee meetings.  These discussions are documented 
in the site committee meeting minutes.  The discussion will include the number of patients, 
significant toxicities in accordance with the protocol, and observed responses.  
All institutional Phase II and III studies are designated with a moderate risk assessment (see 
Appendix H).   The data is audited twice per year with twenty percent of the patients 
monitored (or at least three patients if the calculated value is less than three).  
3. Review and Oversight Requirements
3.1 Adverse Event Monitoring 
All Grade 3-5 Adverse Events (AEs), whether or not considered to be expected or 
unexpected and whether or not considered to be associated with the use of the study 
drug, will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF’s Clinical Trial Management System.  
Adverse Events are graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4.03) as developed and revised by [CONTACT_657275] (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute.  Adverse 
events are further given an assignment of attribution or relationship to treatment or 
medical procedure.  
Version date: 05-10-2024 Protocol CC#: [ZIP_CODE]
Phase 2 – pembrolizumab Page 84 of 90
Attribution categories are:
• Definite – The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s) 
or medical procedure.
• Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s) 
or medical procedure.
• Possible – The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s) or 
medical procedure.
• Unlikely – The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational 
agent(s) or medical procedure.
• Unrelated – the adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent(s) or medical procedure.
All Grade 3-5 adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a monthly 
basis at the Site Committee meetings.  The Site Committee will review and discuss 
the selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution of relationship of the 
adverse event to the administration of the study drug(s).
3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
By [CONTACT_108], an adverse event is defined as a serious adverse event (SAE) according 
to the following criteria:
• Death.
• Life-threatening (i.e. results in an immediate risk of death).
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
• Permanent or significant disability/incapacity
• Gives rise to a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer, or any experience 
that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution 
that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
• Event occurring in a gene therapy study.
• Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of a study.
• Any other event the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_657251] a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.
Serious Adverse Event reporting will be in accordance with the UCSF IRB 
Regulations and Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 312.32.  The SAE will be 
reported on a Med Watch form.

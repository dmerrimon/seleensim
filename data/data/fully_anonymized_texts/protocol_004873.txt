 [ADDRESS_401353]  
 The Prostaglandin Inhibition for Emphysema (PIE) study will determine if a 
currently available therapy, ibuprofen [ADDRESS_401354] and if this results in improvement in measures 
of lung repair function.   This is a proof -of-concept study.  The PIE study will set the 
stage for novel therapy to modify the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD).   
COPD is the thir d leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002].  No currently 
available treatment can meaningfully restore lung function that is lost in this disease.  
Emphysema is a major component to COPD and results when lung damage exceeds 
the ability of the lung to re pair.  Recent evidence indicates that the repair processes 
present in the normal lung are deficient in patients with emphysema and that this is due, 
in part, to suppression of repair by [CONTACT_324989]: prostaglandin E (PGE).  
Currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_324957], but whether this can be 
achieved in the lung in COPD is unknown.  The PIE study will answer that question.   
This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_746] a randomized, double blind, placebo -
controlled, parallel group study th at will compare a widely used and well -tolerated non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drug, ibuprofen [ADDRESS_401355] of treatment on PGD and other eicosanoids and 
assessing IL -8 and neutrophils in sputum  and BAL fluid and selected inflammatory 
biomarkers present  in serum that may be associat ed with lung function decline.  Finally, 
in an accompanying Ancillary Study, the current proposal will determine if alveolar 
macrophages over -produce PGE  and/or PGD  in COPD and will determine if the 
microRNA miR -146a plays modulates the production of these  prostaglandins , as we 
have  demonstrated for lung fibroblasts.  The Ancillary Study will also determine if 
genetic variation in a miR-146a  is related  to differential expression.   
The proposed research will, therefore, determine if inhibition of PGE produc tion 
can be achieved in the lung, if this appears to restore lung repair mechanisms and will 
help determine who would benefit from such a therapeutic approach.  This is a highly 
novel approach to the treatment of emphysema and has the potential to restore lost 
lung function, a crucial unmet medical need for a major public health problem.

 [ADDRESS_401356] exceed the capacity of the 
lung to repair.   
Several lines of evidence support the concept that compromised tissue repair 
also contributes to the pathogenesis of emphysema 10.   
 
1.2 Tissue repair and emphysema.  Inadequate tissue maintenance due to loss 
of growth factors ha s been demonstrated to lead to emphysema in animal models 11.  
Similarly, severe calorie restriction, sufficient to induce weight loss, can cause 
emphysema in animals 7,12,13 .  Emphysema has been reported in young non -smokers 
with bulimia 7,14 and in young individuals who died from starvation 7,15.  Finally, in animal 
models, inhibition of  repair mechanisms greatly worsens emphysema 16-20.  Thus, it is 
likely that impaired repair can contribute to the development of emphysema, both as a 
sole risk factor and as a co -factor potentiating the effects consequent to tissue damage.  
In addition, lung repa ir following the development of emphysema can be induced 
in animal models.  Retinoic acid, which drives the formation of alveolar septa during 
neonatal development, can induce formation of new alveolar wall in emphysema models 
in the mouse and rat 21,22.  In addition, growth factors, including hepatocyte growth 
factor (HGF) 23,24, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) 25, KGF [ADDRESS_401357] s, the major lung mesenchymal 
cells responsible for the production and mainten ance of extracellular matrix, are  
inhibited by [CONTACT_324990] E (PGE), which is produced in 
greater amounts by [CONTACT_324991][INVESTIGATOR_324958].  Inhibition of PGE production, therefore, has the 
potential to restore lung fibroblast repair functions.  This, in turn, could improve the 
  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 [ADDRESS_401358] utilized the 
technique of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which does sample the alveolar space.  
Moreover, we have use d the method of fractional BAL processing 44.  When [ADDRESS_401359] aliquot is relatively 
enriched for bronchial material, while the subsequent are enriched for alveolar material.  
By [CONTACT_324992], partial separation of alveolar and bronchial 
samples can be obtained.  With this method, we demonstrated that “bronchial” samples 
have higher PGE concentrations than “alveolar” but that for both, COPD patients have 
increased PGE compared to normals (Figure 1).  This study thus confirms the published 
results and specifically demonstrates that alve olar PGE concentrations are increased 
  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 7 compared to control.   In addition, even though the number of subjects in our study was 
also limited, we also confirmed the association of PGE level with FEV1 (p=0.0285).  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.   Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed as described 44,45 with five serial 
20 ml aliquots, which allows partial separation of the “alveolar” and “bronchial” 
contents.  Levels were four- to five -fold higher in the bronchial fractions.  BAL 
PGE concentration was greater in both alveolar and bronchial fractions in 
patients with COPD.  Note that the vertical axis is a log scale.  *p<0.05.  
 
The cellular source(s) of the increased PGE in  COPD is (are)  undetermined.  We 
have demonstrated that fibroblasts cultured from the lungs of patients with COPD 
produce more PGE than do fibroblasts from control subjects 34,46.  In addition, PGE 
production is inversely related to airflow and to the diffusion capacity, which is a 
measure of the severity of emphysema. Importantly, inhibition of PGE production in the 
COPD fibroblasts partially restores repair functions 34, confirming the role of PGE and 
suggesting that improving repair functions is a reasonable therapeutic goal.   
We also demonstrated that COPD fibroblasts under -express the microRNA miR -
146a 46.  This microRNA targets the PGE biosynthetic enzyme cyclo -oxygenase -2 (COX -
2).  We demonstrate d that under -expression of miR -146a leads to over -expression of 
COX -[ADDRESS_401360] strains (17 controls and 23 COPD patients), including 5000 bp of the 5’ 
regulatory regio n, exons 1 and 2 and 2000 bp of the 3’ untranslated region revealed that 
polymorphisms in the gene were relatively common. We found 24 polymorphisms, 23 of 
which were novel, which had a minor allele frequency greater than 5%. Importantly, 

  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 8 fibroblasts with the promoter polymorphism miR146a/ -3147AG/GG under -expressed 
miR-146a compared to cells with the AA genotype.  In a population of 280 COPD 
subjects and controls, this same promoter polymorphism was found to be associated 
with a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (p= 0.01).  Interestingly, this polymorphism affected a 
putative AP1 transcription factor binding site at miR146a/ -3147A that was disrupted with 
risk allele G.  These pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], therefore, strongly support the concept that 
polymorphisms in the miR -146a gene may be related to COPD 47.  
Both fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages are major sources of PGE in the 
lung 35,48,49 .  Whether macrophages contribute to the increased production of PGE in 
COPD patients will be addressed in the Ancillary Study (see Ancillary Study).  In 
addition, whether miR -146a modulates PGE production in alveolar macrop hages and 
whether polymorphisms in the miR -146a gene predict PGE levels in the lung and 
production by [CONTACT_324993].  Thus, the Ancillary Study 
will advance understanding of the mechanisms that underlie increased PGE levels in 
the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_324959].  In addition, the Ancillary Study will explore a 
potentially diagnostic biomarker (miR -146a gene polymorphisms) that has the potential 
to identify individuals at risk for increased PGE levels.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_401361], a phospholipase A2 cleaves 
arachidonic acid from phospholipid.  Second,  arachidonic acid is oxidized to form PGG 
then PGH by a cyclo -oxygenase (COX).  Finally, PGH is converted to PGE by a 
prostaglandin E synthase (PGES).  Several distinct enzymes can mediate each step.  In 
addition, at each step, other enzymes can produce al ternate products.  
The most commonly used inhibitors of PGE production are COX inhibitors, 
sometimes termed non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 50.    Non -selective 
agents that inhibit both COX enzymes, COX -[ADDRESS_401362] 
been developed, although none are available clinically.  Which PGE synthase (s) are 
most important in COPD, however, is as yet undetermined.  Thus, it is possible that a 
selective PGE synthase inhibitor may be of use clinically.  However, non -selective 
inhibition of PGE production provides a more robust test for the proof -of-conce pt that 
PGE can be targeted to treat emphysema.  Interestingly, while limited, several 
observational studies have related NSAID use to features of COPD, and these studies 
provide observations supporting the concept that NSAIDs may reduce the severity of 
COPD in general and emphysema specifically.  
McKeever and colleagues reviewed the NHANES dataset and observed that 
users of the non -selective NSAID ibuprofen had significantly better lung function, i.e. 
higher FEV1, than did non -users 51.  Improved lung function was observed among 
occasional users of ibuprofen.  No clear dose response effect was observ ed in this trial, 
in part because there were relatively few daily users.  Observational studies with a 
  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 9 therapy will be substantially confounded by [CONTACT_203622]: those using NSAIDs on a 
regular basis are likely to differ in a number of respects from those  who use 
occasionally or not at all. Nevertheless, the observation that ibuprofen  use is associated 
with better lung function provides suggestive information supporting the premise of the 
current proposal.  
The improved lung function associated with ibupro fen observed by [CONTACT_324994] 51.   While acetaminophen is also 
a non -selective COX inhibitor, it does not have a marked anti -inflammatory effect.  This 
is thought to be due to blockade of its COX inhibitory effect by [CONTACT_324995] 50.  Since persistent inflammation is a 
characteristic feature of the lung in COPD, it is likely that acetaminophen would be less 
effective than ibuprofen.  
The ECLIPSE study is an observational study that included [ADDRESS_401363] -bronchodilator FEV1 
(p=0.09).  Because CT scans were done, it was possible to assess emphysema.  
Patients with COPD had greater emphysema than controls, as reflected by [CONTACT_324996] (data not shown).  Emphysema in COPD patients was more marked in the 
upper lobes, as woul d be expected (Figure 2).  Data from ECLIPSE also suggest that 
NSAID use may ameliorate the development of emphysema.  Specifically, NSAID users 
had significantly greater lung density suggesting less emphysema bilaterally in the lower 
lobes (Figure 2).   
 
Figure 2.  Use of NSAIDs is associated with reduced lower lobe emphysema.

significantly greater density (less emphysema) in t he lower lobes than those not 
using NSAIDs (grey bars).  * p < 0.05.  
 
The mean age of COPD subjects of all severities in ECLIPSE was about [ADDRESS_401365] activity.  Inhibition of PGE production would be predicted to increase collagen 
production and generation of procollagen pe ptides.  To demonstrate the feasibility of 
this approach, we quantified one of the procollagen peptides, pro -collagen I C -terminal 
peptide in the alveolar fraction of BAL from COPD patients and controls.  This study not 
only confirms the ability to quantif y pro -collagen peptide in BAL fluid of COPD patients, 
but levels in COPD patients were significantly reduced compared to controls, consistent 
with the concept of inhibited repair (Figure 3).

control, although there was considerable overlap.  Values were undetectable in a 
substantial number of subjects (this does not affect the rank order non -

 [ADDRESS_401366] 3.  Associated with these cells, several chemotactic factors, including 
interleukin -8 (IL-8), are also increased in COPD 69,70. PGE is an inflammatory mediator 
that is i ncreased in COPD.  Interestingly, we have observed that PGE levels are 
significantly related to IL -8 levels in both the bronchial and alveolar portions of BAL fluid 
(Figure 4).   
 
Figure 4.  Bronchoalveolar lavage PGE and IL -[ADDRESS_401367] demonstrated 
that PGE can stimulate IL -8 production from fibroblasts (Figure 5).

lung fibroblasts (HFL -1) were cultured to confluence in vitro  and stimulated with 
PGE for [ADDRESS_401368] ion.  Similar results were obtained with adult lung 
fibroblasts.  *p<0.05; **p<0.01.   
 
While the current study will focus on restoration of repair functions, reduction in 
inflammation could also be beneficial in COPD, and its demonstration would be a 
meas ure of a pharmacodynamic drug effect.  Moreover, reduced inflammation can 
provide an independent measure of proof -of-concept that PGE inhibition could be 
beneficial in emphysema.  
1.7  Other prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins other that PGE may also play a rol e 
in COPD.  Prostaglandin D2 (PGD) is present in the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_324960] 71,72.  IBlockade of the D -prostaglandin (DP) receptor reduced inflammation 
in smoke exposed mice 73.  PGD also has the potential to modulate fibroblast -mediated 
repair responses 74,75.  Whether PGD or other prostanoids  might also contribute to 
altered repair in emphysema is unknown. Montuschi et al. o bserved no difference in 
PGD levels in exhaled breath condensate  in contrast to the increased levels of PGE that 
were observed 76.  The current study will determine if PGD and other prostanoid levels 
are altered in the lungs of COPD patients using  BAL and induced sputum . 
 

  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 [ADDRESS_401369] of 
conventional do ses of ibuprofen has been assessed on BAL levels of PGE; in contrast, 
to our knowledge, there are no data on the effect of naproxen in the lung.  For these 
reasons, ibuprofen has been selected for use in the current short -term, proof -of-concept 
trial. 
 Dose.  Like most NSAIDs, ibuprofen is a competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid 
oxidation 50.  As such, at clinical doses, NSAIDs do not completely prevent the formation 
of eicosanoids, and their degree of inhibition is concentration dependent.  After single 
doses of 400 and 600 mg, ibuprofen resulted in a 10 and 15% reduction in the blood 
level of the PGE metabolite 13,14 -dihydro -15-keto-PGE 2 (PGEM) 84.  The effects may 
be greater with chronic dosing or with assessments over longer time frames.  McAnulty 
and colleagues assessed marathon runners who were chronic users of ibuprofen 
compared to non -users85.  Although chronic dosing was not controlled, users took 600 
mg the evening before and 200 mg the morning of a race and then 200 mg every four 
hours.   Urinary levels of PGEM were about 50% of the levels observed in non -users 
both before a nd after running (treatment effect p=0.016) 85.   
Pulmonary effects.  Effects of ibuprofen may be greater in the lung.  Hazucha 
and colleagues measured PGE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid before and 
after exercise in normal men while breathing ozone 86.  Pretreatment with 800 mg 
ibuprofen followed by 200 mg during the exercise reduced PGE levels by 60% 
(p<0.05) 86.   Similarly, in a COPD population, Montuschi et al. reported a 77% reduction 
(p<0.0001) in exhaled breath condensate PGE following treatment with [ADDRESS_401370], ibupr ofen has been tested in patients with 
cystic fibrosis.  Reduction in the rate of decline of FEV1 has been observed in two 
placebo -controlled trials 82,83.  Both studies employed relatively high doses of ibuprofen 
(20-30 mg/kg), but the drug was administered twice daily.  Konstan and colleagues 
have also demonstrated a relationship between neutrophil recruitment in vivo  and blood 
levels 81.  With twice daily administration, reduction in neutrop hil recruitment was 
observed in both normal volunteers and cystic fibrosis patients, but only when the Cmax 
exceeded 50 ug/ml.  None of these studies quantified eicosanoid production.  
 Rationale for current study design.  The current study is a proof -of-concept 
study to demonstrate inhibition of PGE production and associated biological effects in 
the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352].  Because ibuprofen is a competitive inhibitor, at conventional 
doses, it only partially inhibits PGE production.  Nevertheless, at dos es that are within 
usual clinical practice, reduction in lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_324961] 
50% seems a reasonable target 85-87.  In addition, at these doses, ibuprofen has been 
observed  to reduce the rate of lung function loss in cystic fibrosis.  It is likely that the 
effect in cystic fibrosis is due to an effect on airways inflammation.  While not the 
primary goal of the present trial, this provides evidence that is helpful in confirmi ng the 
choice of dose and in establishing tolerability for treatment in patients with lung disease 
and provides support for an important secondary outcome measure.   
Based on this prior experience, the current trial will use ibuprofen at a dose of

with placebo treated subjects and is essential to demonstrate prior use of PGE inhibition 
strategie s as therapy to slow disease progression or to restore lung function in 
emphysema.  Several secondary questions will also be pursued.

 24 3.  Study design  
 
3.1 Overview.  The Prostaglandin Inhibition for Emphysema (PIE) trial is a proof -
of-concept trial designed to determine if a conventional dose of a well -tolerated NSAID 
can reduce PGE  levels in the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_324962].  The 
study is a randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group study that will compare 
ibuprofen, [ADDRESS_401376] -treatment in the placebo group.   
One hundre d forty emphysema subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio (70 
subjects in each group).  This based on a sample size estimate based on preliminary 
data from our center and from the literature that 52 subjects with paired BAL samples in 
each group would p rovide 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in PGE levels at a 
significance level of 0.05, estimates that we believe are conservative.  To have 52 
evaluable subjects with paired BAL samples in each group, 70 randomized subjects in 
each group, 140 total subj ects, will be required if there is a 25% drop -out rate, an 
estimate we believe conservative.  
The secondary objective is to determine if ibuprofen [ADDRESS_401377] a 69% power to detect a 
standardized effect size of 0.485 (which was the difference observed in pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]), 
comparing the effect of treatment to that of placebo and a 92% power to detect a 
difference of treatment before to after within the treated group.    
Additional objectives are to determine if treatment with ibuprofen alters PGE 
concentration in induced sputum, if there are changes in other eicosanoids , in particular 
PGD,  and eicosanoid metabolites in BAL, sputum, blood and urine and, by [CONTACT_325004], if PGE , other eicosanoid and 
measures of inflammation  levels are related to the rate of em physema progression.  
Control sub jects will also be assessed on one occasion so that levels in the emphysema 
subjects before and after treatment can be compared to control.  Control subjects will 
not receive treatment with ibuprofen.    Finally, the primary goals will be achieved by 
[CONTACT_325005] [ADDRESS_401378] three  clinical centers including : Temple 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Philadelphia, National Jewish Health, Denver and Harbor/UCLA  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Los Angeles.  All three  centers were participants in COPDGene.  The 
University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) will serve as the Data Coordinating 
Center (DCC).  Samples will be shipped to the DCC where they will be banked and 
where the bioche mical and cellular study -specific analyses will be performed.  Clinical 
tests required for subject enrollment and to assure safety for bronchoscopy will be 
performed at the study sites.  National Jewish Health (NJH), which served as the 
radiology reading c enter for COPDGene, will serve as the radiology reading center.

 [ADDRESS_401391] PGE levels compared to placebo.  The primary outcome 
will be  PGE levels in the alveolar portion of BAL fluid.   
The primary measure will be difference from beginning to end of treatment 
comparing treated vs. placebo groups on an intention -to-treat basis.  The secondary 
outcome will be procollagen peptides measured in the alveolar portion of the BAL 
analyzed by [CONTACT_325008]. All three pro -collagen peptides will be assessed and 
evaluated separately. Levels in BAL fluid will be compared to levels determined in a set 
of smoking, ex -smoking and non -smoking controls.   
Additional analyses will include PGE in the bronchial portion of the BAL fluid and 
induced sputum, other eicosanoids and metabolites in  BAL fluid, blood and urine and 
inflammatory markers, including IL -8 and neutrophils measured in BAL and sputum.  
Ibuprof en levels will be measured, and a secondary analysis based on blood levels will 
be performed.   
An exploratory analysis relating the change in emphysema over time to BAL 
levels of PGE will be performed.  This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_325009].  
 
4.2  Sample size considerations. The primary question is:  Will ibuprofen 
treatment reduce lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_324967]?   The question will be tested by 
[CONTACT_325010] L fraction in the 
treated group to the difference in the placebo group after three months of treatment.  
Based on preliminary data, the observed standardized effect size for the difference in 
PGE concentration between COPD and controls was 1.3 (COPD mean=1 3.13, SD=9.2; 
Control mean=4.39, SD=1.9). Using a 0.[ADDRESS_401392] a 90% power to detect an effect half this size 
(0.65). This difference in effect size equates to a 33% reduction in me an PGE (13.13 to 
8.76).  Based on the literature, we believe this is a conservative effect size, as inhibition 
of PGE of 60% or greater has been reported.  In prior studies, we have had less than 
10% drop -out in studies requiring multiple bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_324968] 89-92.  Using a conservative estimate of 25% drop -outs, we intend to 
enroll a total of [ADDRESS_401393] 69% 
power to detect a standardized e ffect size of 0.485 (as observed in pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]) for the 
difference between groups using a 0.[ADDRESS_401394] if 
inhibition of PGE corrects the pro -collagen I peptide levels to that of normal subjects.  
There is over 92% power  to detect an improvement of this size within the treatment 
group using a 0.[ADDRESS_401395] 80% power to detect an effect of 0.55 (slightly larger than in pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]) between 
groups and 0.396 (s lightly smaller than in pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]) within group at the 0.[ADDRESS_401396], Stephen I.  
 33 The same power estimates described above apply to the analyses of PGE in 
sputum samples.  However, we anticipate obtaining satisfactory sputum samples in 
75% (39) of subjects.  As a res ult, we will have 80% power to detect the same effect 
size in the sputum specimens, as there will be fewer subjects with paired sputums than 
with paired BALs.  However, we feel our estimates are conservative, as they are based 
on a 50% reduction in PGE con centration, which was readily achieved in prior studies.  
Preliminary data do not exist to estimate the rate of change of emphysema 
quantified by [CONTACT_325011].  As a result, we do not have a basis to estimate the 
conditional power for the exploratory analysis.   The analysis planned, however, should 
provide a basis for estimating sample sizes for follow -on studies that would use CT -
quantified emphysema as an outcome measure.  
For the Ancillary Study, the primary outcome is macrophage PGE production by 
[CONTACT_325012]. Data from all evaluable subjects will be 
used.  Each subject will be considered as a single data point.  The number of data 
points, therefore, is determined by [CONTACT_325013].  We anticipate obtaining samples from 140 COPD subjects and 60 
controls.  Based on the mean (SD) from preliminary studies for PGE production by 
[CONTACT_234594], which is 641 (409) ng/10 5 cells/day for COPD subjects and 260 (161) for 
controls, and estimati ng adequate samples from 80% of subjects, a conservative 
estimate, and assuming the variance is the same and the difference in production of 
PGE is half that we observed in COPD fibroblasts, we will have greater than 93% power 
to detect a difference at the  0.05 level between COPD and control groups.  
For the secondary aim of the Ancillary Study evaluating miR -146a levels in 
COPD subjects vs. controls, again using as pi[INVESTIGATOR_324969](SD) of miR -146a expression fol lowing stimulation to be 392(177) for 
COPD and 681(456) for controls, we will have 80% power to detect a standardized 
effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_401397] size in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_324970] 0.868.  For assessing the 
functional role of miR -146a in modulating macrophage COX -2 mRNA, we used a similar 
analysis based on prior results with fibroblasts that sh ows the observed means(SD) are 
for COX -2 mRNA expression in fibroblasts following an miR -146a mimic were 60(25) 
treated and 130(25) untreated. With the conservative estimate that the role of miR -146a 
in alveolar macrophages will be 50% that in fibroblasts,  samples from eight subjects will 
have 90% power to detect differences in COX -[ADDRESS_401398], Stephen I.  
 34  
The final aim of the Ancillary Study is to relate genetic variants in the miR -146a 
gene to COPD.  Conditional power for this aim was estimated for 200 subjects (140 
COPD, 60 controls) based on the binomial distribution. Table [ADDRESS_401399] twice in the study sample (frequenc y ≥ 0.5%).  
Power to detect association between SNPs of allele frequency ≥1% and miR -146a 
expression levels was calculated using Quanto software 93, at α=0.05 (no multiple testing 
correction) and at α=0.[ADDRESS_401400] for 50 SNPs tested (Table 3).   
 
  
 4.[ADDRESS_401401] (DSMB) will be constituted.  It will consist of four members, two pulmonologists, 
one cardiologist and a statistician, who will review the progress of the study on a 
quarterly basis.  The status of each subject after bron choscopy and the results of the 
monthly gastritis monitoring will be reported monthly in summary reports to the DSMB 
members.  In addition, the DSMB will receive reports of all Serious Adverse Events 
within 24 hours of their being reported to the DCC.  
Because this trial involves an invasive procedure (bronchoscopy), formal interim 
analyses and formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_324971]. Formal interim analysis of outcomes will be performed 
once, when approximately 50% of patients have completed the post -treatment 
bronchoscopy. We will use an O’Brien -Fleming monitoring boundary  94 (truncated at 
three standard deviations) to assess whether the interim results are sufficient to 
conclude that ibuprofen is effective at re ducing PGE. We will also apply a futility

(either t -test or Chi -square test) comparing the two treatment groups is significant at the 
0.[ADDRESS_401405]. This m ethod will allow for the evaluation of differences within group (pre - to 
post-treatment change in PGE) as well as the difference between groups post treatment. 
The effects of treatment and time point, as well as any variables found to be significant 
in the  univariate analysis, will be included in the model. Finally, a secondary analysis 
will be performed using blood levels of ibuprofen as a covariate.   
In order to place the magnitude of any reduction observed into perspective, BAL 
PGE levels in the COPD pa tients before and after treatment will be compared with the 
levels present in normals.  This comparison will be made estimating mean BAL PGE 
levels for each group and calculating their associated 95% confidence intervals. As the 
treatment is expected to lo wer PGE levels, the post -treatment is expected to be closer 
to controls.  
For the secondary outcome, change in alveolar fraction pro -collagen peptide 
concentration, we will use the same modeling and analysis approach described above.  
Pro-collagen peptides , pro-collagen I C -terminal and N -terminal peptides and pro -
collagen III N -terminal peptide will be quantified in BAL fluid. The change in each pro -
collagen peptide level following ibuprofen treatment will be compared to the change in 
placebo -treated subje cts. 
 A number of additional analyses are planned.  The alveolar fraction of the BAL 
will be assessed for COX -derived eicosanoids in addition to PGE: PGD, TXB2 (a 
metabolite of thromboxane A2) and 6kPGF1a (a metabolite of prostacyclin) by [CONTACT_29864] -
MS/MS. These m etabolites will be quantified under the same chromatographic and 
  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 36 sample preparation conditions used for PGE analysis and using the same LC -MS/MS 
method. This will confirm the effect of COX inhibition of products other than PGE.  In 
addition, urea will be u sed to estimate concentrations of PGE in alveolar ELF.  Finally, 
we will assess PGE concentration in the bronchial portion of the BAL fluid and in 
induced sputum.  While these latter two measures will not assess alveolar PGE, they 
will provide independent measures of the effect of ibuprofen on PGE in the lung.  
Similarly, quantification of PGEM in blood and urine will provide an independent 
assessment of the effect on total body PGE production.  The same analysis plans 
described above for the analysis of PG E in the BAL fluid will be used for these 
secondary analyses.  
 Use of legacy data from COPDGene will allow us to relate measures made to 
progression of COPD and emphysema.  To accomplish this, we  will determine  the 
difference between the legacy  COPDGene CT-scan compared to that obtained upon 
PIE study entry.  Correction will be made for change in achieved lung volume 95. Dividing 
by [CONTACT_325015] (3 -6 years) will estimate a rate of progression of 
emphysema.  Th e rate of change in emphysema for the entire population will then be 
related to PGE concentration in the BAL fluid on the initial (without treatment) BAL.  This 
will allow us to determine if PGE is related to the rate of progression of emphysema.  A 
simila r analysis will be performed estimating the relationship with the rate of change in 
FEV1.  
 We will also assess clinical measures after [ADDRESS_401406] inhibition of 
PGE , will be adequately powered to rigorously assess disease progression.  The 
sample size of 52 per group will provide 80% power to detect a standardized effect size 
for the mean change in lung volume of 0.57 between groups (a medium effect as 
defined by [CONTACT_325016]) and 0.4 within group (slightly smaller than a medium effect). The 
standardized effect sizes represent a difference between groups 57% as large as the 
standard deviation and change within group 40% as large as the standard deviation.  
We expect the chan ge observed during this study to be smaller.  However, the results 
from this trial will be used as assessment of the likely effect size and variance and will 
be important is the design of future Phase [ADDRESS_401407] scans wi ll be acquired at end inspi[INVESTIGATOR_324972] -detector 
scanners ( ≥ 64 detector rows) using the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_324973]. Phantom scans will 
be acquired on a monthly basis at each site, to assure scanner stability. Phantom scans 
will be analyzed as in the COPD Gene and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_324974]. Any deviations from 
recommended phantom parameters will be communicated immediately to the sites, and 
further scans will be suspended until the deviation is corrected. To perform quantitative 
emphysema analysis, de -identified D ICOM images will be segmented using the Apollo 
image analysis system (VIDA Diagnostics, http://www.vidadiagnostics.com) 98. The 
software will divide each lung into lobes as well as three craniocaudal zones of equal z -
  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 37 axis lengths.  The following analyses will be performed on the segmented inspi [INVESTIGATOR_324975]: total inspi[INVESTIGATOR_324976], mean lung attenuation, relative lung 
volumes (for the whole lung, each lung lobe, and api[INVESTIGATOR_324977]) falling 
below attenuation coefficients of  -950, -910, and 856 HU. The 15th percentile p oint of 
the lung density histogram (PERC15) will also be calculated.  Additionally, to evaluate 
emphysematous “hole size”, the alpha value (the negative of the slope from the log -log 
relationship of hole size versus number of holes) will be measured for th e entire lung 
and for the upper and lower lobes 99. 
We will also assess FEV 1, DLCO and SGRQ as these additional clinical 
parameters that can also contribute to the design of phase [ADDRESS_401408] aim of the Ancillary Study is, do alveolar macrophages from COPD 
subjects produce more PGE than from controls?  Because the data distribution cannot 
be assumed  to be normal, generalized linear modeling will be used.  Generalized linear 
modeling is a regression technique that allows for non -normally distributed outcome 
variables. In addition, a modeling approach will allow us to adjust for important 
covariates, a s well as smoking status and disease severity. Secondary analyses will be 
performed similarly, evaluating current and former smoking COPD subjects separately.  
Each subject will be considered as a single data point.   
The second aim of the Ancillary Study will determine if miR -146a levels differ 
between COPD subjects and controls.  This will be approached with the same plan 
described above.  To determine if miR -146a levels are related to BAL fluid PGE and 
alveolar macrophage COX -2 mRNA, protein levels and P GE production, we will use 
Spearman’s correlation.  Similar analyses will be performed with macrophages following 
culture with and without IL -1ß/TNF - stimulation.  For analyses of functional 
macrophage studies using miR -146a mimics and inhibitors, each su bject will be a single 
data point, and differences in the paired values will be analyzed using a non -parametric 
Wilcoxon signed ranks test.   
In the third aim of the Ancillary Study, we will test for association between miR -
146a polymorphisms and the BAL P GE levels (determined in the Clinical Study) and the 
immediate ex-vivo miR-146a and COX -2 expression in alveolar macrophages.  For 
common variants (allele frequency ≥ 1%), we will use linear regression in all subjects 
and in COPD cases only, adjusting for smoking status, if that is found to be relevant. 
For rare variants (<1%), we will employ one of several current methods that can be 
applied to quantitative traits, such as the Variable Threshold test [ADDRESS_401409] 101.  We will adapt these methods for analysis of exome/genome 
sequencing data to the candidate gene analysis, by [CONTACT_325017] (e.g. promoter, exon, 3’ UTR) and weighting by [CONTACT_325018], such as SNPs that alter transcription factor binding sites.  Methods for 
rare variant analysis are constantly evolving, and we will adopt best practices as they 
emerge.  In addition, we predict that polymorphisms in miR -146a related to AP -[ADDRESS_401410], Stephen I.  
 38 regulatory sites will specifically modulate response to IL-1ß/TNF -, and this will be 
ascertained by [CONTACT_325019] -146a polymorphisms to the results of the stimulation of 
PGE production by [CONTACT_8668] -1ß/TNF -, using the analysis methods above.   
In addition to PGE, alveolar macrophages produce PGD.  Our analytical me thod 
is able to quantify  PGD and, but including an additional internal standard in the LC -
MS/MS runs, both PGE and PGD can be accurately determined with little increase in 
total cost 102.

 5.1  Data Coordinating Center.  The DCC will be located at the University of 
Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).  The DCC will have the primary responsibility to 
assure that all study sites are fully equipped and trained to execute the study, will 
monitor the progress of the study and its co mpliance with protocol and regulatory 
requirements, will house all samples, will coordinate sample analyses, will have the 
responsibility for maintaining the study database and will perform statistical analyses.  In 
addition, the DCC will prepare the Study  Procedures Manual and will oversee data entry 
and quality control.   
 
 5.[ADDRESS_401412] three clinical  sites will participate: Temple University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], National Jewish Health, and Harbor/UCLA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  All centers are previous 
COPDGene centers.  Study procedures will be harmonized with prior COPDGene 
procedures.  Each center will have a site Principal Investigator, a Study Coordinator and 
a Laboratory Technician, all of whom will complete formal training for study procedures.  
The study will be approved by [CONTACT_325020].  
 
 5.3  Radiology  reading center.  National Jewish Health (NJH)  will serve as the 
Radiology Reading Center.  To perform quantitative emphysema analysis, de -identified 
DICOM images will be sent to NJH for analysis.  Data will then be transferred to the 
DCC.  
 
 5.[ADDRESS_401413] scans .  The COPDGene Data Center (NJH) will be notified 
of subjects entered in the study using the COPDGene Study code, which is de -identified. 
The COPDGene Data Center will then transfer the data needed for the PIE study to the 
DCC at UNMC using o nly the COPDGene Study Code.  Neither the COPDGene Data 
Center nor the PIE DCC at UNMC will have access to subject identifiers.  Healthy non -
smoking control subjects will be recruited at the study sites and de -identified data sent 
to the DCC at UNMC.  
 
 
  Rennard, Stephen I.  
 41 6.  Regulatory Issues  
  
 6.1  IRB approvals.  The study will be approved by [CONTACT_325021] (Institutional Review Board, IRB) at all study sites.  In addition, approval will 
be obtained from the IRBs at UNMC and at NJH (the COPDGene Data Center a nd the 
PIE Radiology Reading Center).  Final approval of the protocol will also be obtained 
from the COPDGene Steering Committee.  Preliminary interviews with the IRB at 
UNMC have indicated that the limited analysis of the miR -146a gene does not constitute  
genetic testing, and no separate genetics consent will be requested.  This question, 
however, will be revisited with all study site IRBs prior to study initiation.   
 
 6.2  FDA approval.  Pre-IND consultation with the FDA will be requested.  The 
medicatio n to be used, ibuprofen, is already approved and usage will be within currently 
approved dosing.  However, the indication in the current proposal is significantly 
different from approved indications, interstate transport of the drug and placebo will be 
required and the study involves more than minimal risk.  Thus an investigator 
Investigational New Drug (IND) Approval may be required.  If so, an investigator IND will 
be submitted to the FDA.  It is anticipated that this process will be compl eted prior to th e 
scheduled date  for funding approval.

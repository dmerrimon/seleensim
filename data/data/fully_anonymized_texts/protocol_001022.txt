1.1 SYNOPSIS       
Title:  Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic 
comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on -demand, digital 
behavioral treatments for chronic pain  
Study Description:  This study will compare two available, evidence -based, digital pain 
treatment programs that patients can use at home. The goal is to see if 
one approach is better than the other, and whether certain patients 
respond to one more than the other.  Study participants  will be 
randomized to receive one of two treatment programs: Skills-Based VR  or 
PainTRAINER . Study devices will be delivered to the participant’s  home 
with instructions for use via FedEx; participants will receive remote 
technical support. They will be followed for 8 weeks  and complete Patient 
Reported Outcome ( PRO)  questionnaires to assess functional status, pain 
levels, and use of pain medications (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ).  Participants will 
also be asked to provide consent/authorization to access medical records 
from their treating facility .

limits. Therefore, we can help support them with other techniques. Beyond video visits, there are home-based programs that patients can self -administer to help manage their pain. These proven programs can 
overcome staffing shortfalls, be used across long distance to reach anyone in the world , and can be used 
at the time and place of the patients' choosing.  
 
In this study, we will compare two available, evidence -based, digital treatment programs that patients

The COVID -19 pandemic presents unique environmental, social, and physical barriers to patients with 
chronic pain. Data reveal that the global pandemic can worsen physical pain and trigger anxiety,

during this period, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control data.[ADDRESS_1056355] -delivered treatments.
12 Moreover,  barriers to pain care access, combined with 
exacerbated psychosocial distress caused by [CONTACT_769986], dually serve to amplify pain in this 
vulnerable patient population.12 The CDC recognizes that the COVID -19 pandemic is triggering emotional 
distress in people with preexisting chronic diseases, a phenomenon labeled by [CONTACT_769987] a “global storm of stress -related psychopathological symptoms.”
15 The CDC established public -facing 
guidance to help citizens navigate troubling emotions,16 and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) launched a National Distress Helpline for people struggling to cope 
with pandemic stress.[ADDRESS_1056356] decide how to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_769934] a geographically widespread and increasingly isolated populace; there is no time to wait for 
expansion of the mental health workforce . There is an immediate need to deploy self -administered, 
remote, evidence- based treatments that leverage the time- tested science of cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT), long considered the gold -standard beha vioral medicine for reducing pain -specific distress, 
anxiety, and depression in chronic pain.19 Several meta- analyses demonstrate that fully -contained, self -
administered CBT computer programs are feasible and effective for home -based management of 
chronic pain.20-23 Moreover, these self -contained programs can overcome geographic, staffing, and 
timing barriers of traditional video and in -person visits, particularly in vulnerable rural communities. For 
these reasons, an international COVID -19 consensus panel recently concluded that whenever possible, 
online self -management programs should be considered to help care for patients with pain during the 
pandemic.24 However, because traditional CBT typi[INVESTIGATOR_286081] 8 -12 sessions with a trained provider, 
even in the limited places where CBT is available, attrition rates exceed 30% in clinical practice.25 Poor 
access to CBT, particularly in underserved rural communities and now magnified by [CONTACT_25963] -19 
pandemic, amplifies psychological distress and promotes the use of less effective but readily accessible modalities such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].

consequences of the pandemic.26 As a result, rural communities are uniquely susceptible to the 
negative health impacts of COVID -19 and are considered highly vulnerable according to the CDC’s 
Social Vulnerability Index (SVI).  
 
Telemedicine offers an important approach for delivering healthcare to remote and vulnerable populations with diminished access to healthcare, particularly for mental health services such as chronic 
pain management. Even before the pandemic emerged, data r evealed rapid growth in mental health 
telemedicine use among rural Medicare beneficiaries
27 enabled by [CONTACT_769988], with roughly two -thirds of rural Americans now having access to broadband networks.28 
Although telemedicine has increased dramatically in the era of COVID -19,27 there is still a marked 
shortfall in the availability of mental health and pain practitioners throughout the U.S, particularly in 
rural communities;[ADDRESS_1056358] of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_769936],30 now considered to be an

now it is even more pressing to strengthen delivery of pain -related mental health services, particularly in 
rural communities, as a consequence of the pandemic’s unequal forces on rural vs. non -rural regions.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
This study poses minimal risk to participants. Immediate  risks may include minor psychological distress 
from questionnaire  item s asking about  health and employment status . There is also a small32 short -term 
risk of transient risk of VR -related “cybersickness”  for those allocated to the VR arm of this study.  
Cybersickness is transient vertigo, nausea, or headache . It results  from sensory mismatch between the 
visual and vestibular systems33-[ADDRESS_1056359] of study participant confidentiality safeguards:

release  of identifiable  PHI may  occur,  it will be reported  to the Cedars -
Sinai IRB and the Cedars -Sinai Privacy  Office  for adjudication and 
corrective  actions.   
 
 
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Potential immediate benefits include reduction of pain and general improvement in psychological 
health. Potential long -term benefits include improved functionality, reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and 
improve ment s in overall physical and psychological  health.  This research will contribute to societal 
knowledge about the safety and efficacy of therapeutic VR  and will provide information about the use of 
digital health pain reduction programs in rural popluations.  
 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056360] found general satisfaction with devices among participants. The incidence and severity 
of VR -related side effects are low, and symptoms generally subside within minutes of taking off the 
headset. There is little discernable risk for PainTRAINER, as it is a program that will be accessed online 
from a computer or mobile device that the participant is already using. Still, some individuals may  
experience emotional and/or mental discomfort associated with learning ways to modify one’s behavior and the decisions around whether and how to implement these strategies.  
 Participation in the study may alleviate pain among individuals who have previously relied on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], potentially enabling them to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_769939] . Sustained pain relief also may 
allow individuals to return to work faster, improve physical mobility, and enhance biopsychosocial health. As a result, the short-  and long- term anticipated benefits  of participation  outweigh the minimal 
short -term risks.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056365] among  a geographically diverse group of patients with mixed -etiology 
chronic pain. Using a random number generator, patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio at the site level  
between two self -administered, remotely deployed CBT delivery platforms : (1) a 2D mHealth app called 
PainTRAINER; and (2) 3D VR app called EaseVRx. The primary analysis will compare changes in pain 
intensity over 8 weeks  upon completion of the standardized 8 -week digital CBT protocols. Secondary 
outcomes will include pain catastrophizing, pain interference, self- efficacy, anxiety, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] .  
Patient blinding is not possible in VR versus non -VR studies ; we will explain the purpose of our study is 
to determine if one of two self -taught pain -management skills  programs is more effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_769946], alongside current  treatment.   If so,  how much more effective is it and which patients does 
the program help  the most?  Both programs have been proven effective; in other words, both programs 
have  been studied and results for both showed improvement in  patients’ ability to manage 
their  pain.   To do this, participants will be randomly assigned to  test either a virtual reality (VR)  program 
called  EaseVRx  or an online/mobile program called  painTRAINER .  Because it is important  for 
researchers to exhibit equipoise when describing the competing interventions, we will prepare a  
script that uses neutral language regarding the two interventions, as per previous VR research. In addition, data analysts will be blinded to patient allocation.

the app teaches evidence- based pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_769947] a self- administered, home -based software 
program. The system delivers eight sessions via any web -connected platform, including Android or iOS 
smartphones, tablets, or personal computers.  The digital curriculum covers progressive muscle 
relaxation, activity/rest cycling, pleasant activity scheduling, recognizing negative automatic thoughts, pleasant imagery/distraction, problem solving, and monitoring for maintenance. Patients complete one session per week in a pre -determined order. The program can be completed in  a somewhat flexible 
manner to accommodate life and medical events  but the [ADDRESS_1056367] be completed within 66

questionnaire that is emailed on Week 8 , as shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), Section 1.3. The 
end of the study is defined as [ADDRESS_1056369] meet all of the following criteria:  
 
1. have chronic pain, from any underlying condition, using as examples but not limited to the 
administrative definition of ICD -10 code series G89.X or one or more of 134 chronic overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_769948], as previously standardized and validated by [CONTACT_496179]  (see Tables 2 
and 3)  
2. have experienced average pain intensity of >3 out of 10 within the previous week;  
3. are >13 years of age;  
4. are able to read/write English;  
5. have either a personal computer , tablet,  or smartphone;  
6. live in a designated rural zip code as defined by [CONTACT_672861] (FORHP) 
data  (RUCA Codes 4 -10). 
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
1. have a condition that interferes with use of the intervention (e.g., significant visual or auditory 
impairment , any history of seizure );  
2. are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057];  
3. are receiving active cancer treatment;  
4. are receiving end -of-life care;  
5. have cognitive impairment that affects participation.  
6. have previously used the EaseVRx+ or painTRAINER programs  
 
We will we will collect data on key patient characteristics , including type of pain condition, sex, age, 
race, ethnicity, State and zip code, Rural -Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (a composite measure of 
population density, urbanization, and daily commuting), pain severity, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], comorbidities, social 
supp ort, and COVID -19 impacts (unemployment, financial hardship, family or personal COVID -19 
diagnosis).  
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 Women who are currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant will not be excluded from the study

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
All aspects of this study are conducted remotely, including the participants’ use of the digital 
intervention at home and collection of all PROs  via survey questionnaires administered electronically. In 
addition, the VR headset has independent value. To ascertain their willingness and ability to respond to 
survey questionnaires delivered by [CONTACT_6968], potential participants are required to respond to daily , 
electronic, one-item “Pain Journal ” question s and complete other  baseline survey questionnaires over 
the course of a “Screening Week,” following informed consent but prior to randomization. A screen 
failure is defined as a participant who completes  fewer than  7 daily “pain journal ” surveys . 
Participants are required to complete each survey within  14 days of the or iginal send date , as these  
surveys will expi[INVESTIGATOR_352743] 14 days . Age, socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity are some of the 
information that will be collected  for all participants even if they fail to complete any Screening Week 
surveys . Individuals who inform investigators during the Screening Week that they are no longer able or 
willing to participate in the study for any reason or who are discovered to meet any of the exclusion 
criteria will be recorded  and withdrawn from consideration . Individuals who satisfactorily complete all 7 
pain journals  and baseline survey questionnaires contained therein will be enrolled and randomized.    
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION    
The target sample size is 3 00. The population impacted by [CONTACT_769994], including somatic, musculoskeletal, 
neuropathic, and visceral pain.  Using data from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy ( FORHP ), rural 
Louisiana has a high prevalence of nearly 32% non -Hispanic Black, rural [LOCATION_004] has 2.5%, and 
Alabama 22.7%. We will oversample with a target  of 20% for non-Hispanic Black s in this study. We will 
have a monitoring plan to ensure that we maintain our 20% goal throughout conduct of the study. Rural 
[LOCATION_004] is 30% Hispanic, while Alabama and Louisiana have fewer than 2% Hispanic  rural populations . 
The mean across states is 11.2%. The national mean of rural Hispanic  population s is 6.6%. Because we 
will likely receive more patients from Alabama and Louisiana than from [LOCATION_004] (because there are 
two sites in the Deep South vs. one in urban [LOCATION_004]), we anticipate a weighted mean of closer to 8% 
Hispanic and will therefore target this value for our study.  
All four clinical sites have patient cohort search engines that will be used to identify patients with 
chronic pain. The informatics department at each site will pull zip code data for each potential 
participant, which will be matched with year [ADDRESS_1056370] to enrich enrollment as needed throughout the study to maintain the 20% 
target for the overall sample (across all three States).  
Across the four recruitment sites (Cedars -Sinai, Ochsner, UAB, Bend care) over 10,[ADDRESS_1056371]. Curtis from University of Alabama is associated 
with Bend care and the UAB coordinator will serve the same role for patients identified from Bend care. 
Recruitment for the proposed trial will be maximized using several strategies:  
• Patients will be screened over a period of [ADDRESS_1056372] implemented and proved to be effective in our previous VR trials, will supplement in -person recruitment to ensure that we can reach the ta rget enrollment goal.

demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version 5 
Protocol  February 24, 2025 
  17 • Identification : The prospective participants will be identified through existing registries , provider 
recommendation,  and via automated EHR review using queries / clinical trial search programs  / 
cohort builders  (e.g. Deep6, Slicer Dicer , i2b2 ) at partner sites.  
• Recruitment : No in -person visits are required to be recruited for this trial.   
o Main Method : All eligible participants  with a valid email in the medical record  will be 
contact[CONTACT_426] a research coordinator by [CONTACT_769995] -portal using an IRB 
approved recruitment letter to explain the study. An informational brochure will be 
attached to the email communication.  
o Alternative  Method : If no valid email is available but a phone number is available, the 
study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_769996] . 
At that time, the coordinator will also collect the potential participant’s email (if 
available and the potentia l subject expresses interest in receiving additional 
information via email) . An informational brochure will be attached to a future  email 
communication.  
Justification for the alternate method : Our study was funded to address healthcare 
disparities for underserved and vulnerable populations (rural participants, in this case), and we are concerned that our study is excluding individuals who would otherwise qualify but have inadequate contact [CONTACT_769997], to the 
detriment of the study. For example, our inclusion criteria specifically target populations who are unlikely to be in close proximity to the participating academic health systems, and th is condition naturally hinders opportunity to collect some/all 
personal information due to the infrequency of these (often all -day when travel time 
is included) visits. Especially with this specific study, the recruitment letter requirement may be biasing our study sample to reflect a population of higher tech literacy, closer proximity to the health center, etc. Further, we are underperforming the recruitment targets of Black and Hispanic individuals set by [CONTACT_769998], and all sites  have pati ents from these cohorts without valid email addresses.  
o All patients will be able to opt -out of the study  via email or by [CONTACT_648] . We request 
removal of an official wait time between sending the email/letter and  contact[CONTACT_769999]. Our justification  is that, t o date,  in the rural chronic pain study 
alone, [ADDRESS_1056373] contact[CONTACT_770000] 7 -day period, and of the 33 
individuals who were sent a recruitment lett er and later declined, o nly two declined 
by [CONTACT_6968]. 98.7% of recruitment letters have not obviated the need for a follow -up 
recruitment call, and this response rate compares to our other trials.  Most individuals 
do not recall seeing or reading the letter when finally reached by [CONTACT_200255].   
o If contact[CONTACT_30697] a patient by [CONTACT_648], study coordinators will ensure the identity of the 
person on the phone call is indeed the prospective participant that was intended to 
be called.  
• Consent : An IRB -approved script will explain the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the 
study and rights as research participants. REDCap will be used to email the IRB approved electronic consent form to the patient. Participants will have the opportunity  to carefully review 
the electronic consent form and ask questions prior to signing. Study staff may reach out to participants who have been sent a consent form but have not yet signed to assist with the 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056374], a slong as the participant has not 
indicated a reason for not signing the form. Participants will complete their consent forms 
electronically using the 21 CFR 11 -compliant online REDCap platform. The informed consent will 
be signed by [CONTACT_770001] -specific proce dures. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by 
[CONTACT_770002].  
• Post -Consent : A copy of the informed consent documents will be provided to the participants for 
their records via email, and via postal service if no email is available. Participants will consent 
remotely and those  randomized to the VR arm will receive their study equipment through a secure 
FedEx package. Study participants will receive their study equipment or documentation through  
secure  FedEx  package delivery . Retention to the 12 -week  study will be managed using 
protocolized reminder calls, emails, and/or SMS text mes sages  to complete the study surveys. . 
Study coordinators will contact  [CONTACT_770003] -completion of a survey if >[ADDRESS_1056375] decisions.  
• Participants who complete the consent form will be required to finish the baseline questionnaires 
in order to be randomized and have the study equipment shipped to them as described above.  
Participants will be emailed tracking information and, if randomized into the VR arm, videos 
describing use of the intervention . 
• Participants will be called for study  onboarding once the VR device or painTRAINER workbook  is 
delivered to their home . During this call, patients will be asked if they reviewed the startup 
instructions  that w ere provided in the intervention tracking information email, and coordinators 
will answer any remaining questions and guide participants through the device or program  if 
necessary . If participants are unreachable by [CONTACT_648], study staff will seek to schedule a phone call 
or confirm  the participant’s understanding of study procedure by [CONTACT_6968] , or by [CONTACT_770004]. Contact [CONTACT_770005]’s study enrollment.  
This protocol is not high risk for subject attrition; the intervention itself is considered low risk by [CONTACT_55295].  
Strategies for retention include the following:  
• During the recruitment process, subjects will be educated about the importance of their role in contributing to research, to increase the likelihood that they will complete the patient reported 
outcome measures even if they stop using the intervention.  
• Participants will be educated on how to use PainTRAINER or VR via educational videos , talking 
with study staff, and referring to any applicable documentation .  
• The subject burden is low. Several data will be acquired passively, through patients using the 
PainTRAINER (2D mHealth intervention) or EaseVRx (3D VR intervention). There are no visits to their  medical provider  required by [CONTACT_316923].  
• Subjects will be compensated for participation in this study (see budget).  
• Retention to the [ADDRESS_1056376]  the participant following non -completion of a survey if >1 week has elapsed since the 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056377] that provides compliance 
information to the individual patient using a program called tableau (Mountain View, [LOCATION_004]).  
• Participants may be contact[CONTACT_770006] -portal when allowed by [CONTACT_17652].  
• Participants in the VR arm will be required to return the device after completing the surveys on 
the 8th week to be eligible for the honorarium.  
As health services researchers working in highly diverse populations, we recognize that racial and ethnic 
minorities are underrepresented in clinical research for a wide range of important historical and cultural reasons. We also recognize that there are many strategies that can help overcome barriers and obstacles to participation in clinical trials. Considering the large target populations of Black and Hispanic populations in our rural populations, we will engage in several recru itment strategies designed to increase targeted 
recruitment, as follows:  
• Clarify the agenda behind the research in all written and oral communications.  
• Provide clear information about the clinical trial that avoids medical jargon.  
• Make recruitment/retention a top priority for research staff.  
• Provide regular feedback to referral sources about the status of trial recruitment.  
• Speak informally to colleagues to promote protocol awareness and interest.  
• Speak at professional and community meetings about trial protocols , and request referrals .  
• Highlight our team members who are Black and Hispanic researchers.  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
The two active interventions evaluated in this study are EasVRx and PainTRAINER. EaseVRx is delivered via a commercially available VR headset. PainTRAINER  consists of 2 -D visualizations delivered via 
smartphone or computer .  
Skills -Based VR: EaseVRx  
EaseVRx  was developed by [CONTACT_770007], PhD, Associate 
Professor of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine at Stanford University and an NIH-  and 
PCORI -funded investigator in the use of VR for pain management.  EaseVRx  incorporates the evidence-
based principles of CBT, mindful meditation, and physiologic biofeedback therapy using embedded 
biometric sensors. It combines psychoeducation, pain education, breathing training, relaxation 
exercises, and executive functioning games to provide a mind -body approach toward living better with 
chronic pain. The standardized, prescriptive, and reproducible [ADDRESS_1056378] access to the full library of content. Each VR experience lasts between 2-16 minutes, with an average duration of 6 minutes. The VR treatment modules are designed to 
minimize triggers of emotional distress or cybersickness. There are 5 types of modules:  
 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version 5 
Protocol  February 24, 2025 
  20 ● Interoceptive:  These modules are designed to help the user understand and perceive what  is 
happening inside the body. They provide a biofeedback -like platform in which the changes in the 
observed environment reflect a progressively enhanced state of relaxation.  
● Education: Help the user understand why the VR exercises are relevant to their pain, as well as 
teaching specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_769949] , including the neurobiology of pain, the 
role of mood and stress in pain, pain catastrophizing, activity pacing and setting goals. The goal 
is for the user to create self -management steps and a toolkit of strategies they can use to 
manage their response to pain.  
● 360-degree video s: High- quality 360 videos with voiceovers, music, and sound effects that are 
designed to maximize relaxation and engagement of users . 
● Game  modules : Games are designed to maximize distraction and engagement, increasing the 
cognitive load on patients , and decreasing their perception of pain.  
● Dynamic breathing: These modules are based on evidence -based biofeedback training designed 
to enhance awareness of one’s physiological response to pain and to self -regulate that 
response. In a virtual world, the user experiences a gamified biofeedback session in which  they 
are introduced to awareness of their  breath via visualization in the form of air bubbles. In 
multiple sessions, the user receives increasingly challenging tasks to practice diaphragmatic breathing while interacting with the virtual enviro nment. The user is also asked to pace their 
breath according to an expanding and contracting ring in the environment to slow the breath and create physiological changes associated with relaxation. The user’s exhale is measured by [CONTACT_770008] , offering biodata- enabled immersive therapeutics.  
 
The EaseVRx  program  has been authorized by [CONTACT_770009] 18 years and older 
diagnosed with chronic lower back pain.   
 
PainTRAINER  (2D mHealth intervention)  
PainTRAINER is among the most widely -validated mHealth interventions for pain management.47-54 
Originally developed by [CONTACT_770010], 
the app teaches evidence -based pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_769947] a self- administered, home -based software 
program. The system delivers eight sessions via any web -connected platform, including Android or iOS 
smartphones, tablets, or personal computers. The digital curriculum covers progressive muscle relaxation, 
activity/rest cycling, pleasant activity scheduling, recognizing negative automatic thoughts, pleasant image ry/distraction, problem solving, and monitoring for maintenance. Patients complete one session per 
week in a pre -determined order. The program can be completed in a flexible manner to accommodate 
life and medical events. For example, patients can close a s ession before completing it and later resume 
where they left off. Training is led by a computerized virtual coach and content is provided in audio to minimize reading and facilitate program completion for sick or low literacy patients . Important 
informatio n is highlighted on screen with brief, large -font text, with photos, graphics, animations, and 
interactive exercises to reinforce learning.  
PainTRAINER  includes eight 35 -45 minute sessions; each teaches an evidence- based pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_104285]. 
Users complete one session per week in a predetermined order and can close a session before completing it and later resume where they left off. They can also review co mpleted sessions (e.g., an audio recording 
of a skill practice, or instructions on how to use a skill). The program uses an adaptive, mobile responsive 
mHealth platform : Users can access it with any Internet -enabled tablet, personal computer, or  
smartphone.  Smartphone access is important; these devices are increasingly the main platform used to 
access the Internet, including in underserved populations.  During development of PainTRAINER , patients 
clearly advocated for access to program content and resources through smartphones. Training is led by a 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-

Protocol  February 24, 2025 
  21 computerized virtual coach who speaks to users. Content is provided in audio to minimize reading and 
facilitate program completion for sick or low literacy patients . Important information is highlighted on 
screen with brief, large -font text, with photos, graphics, animations, and interactive exercises to reinforce 
learning. We also added other features to enhance learning and mastery of skills, guided by [CONTACT_770011]  (e.g., social modeling), adult learning theory  (e.g., tying skills to personal g oals and 
experiences), principles of multimedia instruction (interactive exercises, graphics to reinforce 
explanations), and behavior change theory  (e.g., behavior tracking, reminders).  
The program includes: (i) the Home Page  
(customized to users’ progress and status by [CONTACT_770012]); (ii) Training Sessions ; and (iii) the 
Expert System  (a knowledge database and 
programmed decision rules or “algorithms” that customize users’ experience based on their progress in the program). A login screen takes users to the 
home page  where they access the current week’s 
session, which is highlighted. From there , users 
access program sessions and features that allow 
them to manage reminders and goals,  log practices, 
and review progress in easy -to-read graphs. The 
interface applies accepted principles of user -
centered design to enhance usability in diverse populations (e.g., screen layout consistent with major websites; use of audio to minimize reading; simple 
menus placed predictably on -screen; clear and consistent navigation aids; direct access to important 
screens and help). Screen elements are designed for a diverse population (e.g., easy -to-read type, plain

Written content follows federal guidelines for plain language to ensure it is easy to read, understand, and use. The program’s back -end database  tracks program use meta -data, including sessions experienced, 
time spent on session, and time of day the session was reviewed. These meta -data allow for secondary 
“dose -response” analyses. Figure 1 shows the home page.  
PainTRAINER has been validated in clinical trials, including multiple RCTs . Bennell et al. studied the 
program in a participant -blinded trial of patients with chronic pain and found greater increases in function, 
pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and global improvement than a control condition after eight weeks; benefits persisted at 52 weeks and 91 % of participants (older adults, largely from rural, low income areas, consistent with the 
current study population) completed all [ADDRESS_1056379] once a day and as needed throughout the 
the 8 week study period . Thereafter,  the participant  can use the program  as needed.  Section 4.3 
provides the justification of dose.  PainTRAINER delivers eight sessions via any web -connected platform,

Prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a  VR headset to a study participant, the headset battery will be checked to make sure it 
is fully charged. Any headsets that are handled by [CONTACT_770014], the plastic housing using Sani -Wipes, and the glass lenses using alcohol -based lens cleaner.   
The group that gets the PainTRAINER  program will be mailed a user’s guide .  
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING   
We will allocate study participants using a random number generator to assign every -other patient to 
blocks of 2 , 5, or 6 to ensure there is an equal distribution in the EaseVRx skills -based group and  
PainTRAINER  group. Participants, their clinical providers, and study statisticians will be blinded to the 
study arm. The groups will be labeled as 1  or 0 at random. Datasets will be provided to the statistician 
using these group labels. A clinical research coordinator will ship VR headset  containers to participant s 
in the EaseVRx group  and enter the label into the log of enrolled participants ; the research coordinator 
who maintains the list of randomization assignments will not call participants on the telephone.  Because 
the intervention is conducted in p articipant s’ homes and the data are collected remotely,  the 
participants will not encounter each other  and thus will be less likely to guess their study arm 
assignment . We anticipate there will be no circumstances during the study that require unblinding of an 
individual participant or a whole group because we do not expect any related SAEs to occur with this low risk intervention.

the surveys , they will be sent a reminder prompt.  
Primary Outcome  
The change from study baseline to Week [ADDRESS_1056387] 11 -
point numeric rating scale (NRS)  scale is the primary endpoint. Consistent with NIH Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_769953]-  Term (HEAL) guidance, we will measure daily pain with NRS for 7 -days during baseline 
week 0, and again during the final week of the study (week 8). The minimally clinically importance 
difference (MCID) on the pain NRS is [ADDRESS_1056388] deviation (SD). Scoring of the instrument wil l occur in a 
SAS/ R/STATA environment in which study statisticians are blinded to the study arm.  
The change from baseline to Week 8  in pain catastrophizing as measured by [CONTACT_941] 4 -item short pain 
catastrophizing scale is a secondary endpoint. The Pain Catastrophizing scale (PCS) short form measures 
rates of high catastrophizing as defined by a score of ≥7. Scoring of the instrument will occur in a 
SAS/ R/STATA environment in which study statisticians are blinded to the study arm.  
The change from study baseline to Week 8  in anxiety as measured by [CONTACT_770017] a 
secondary endpoint. The scale is rendered using a T -statistic, where a score of 50 represents the 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056389] deviation (SD). Scoring of the instrument will occur in a 
SAS/ R/STATA environment in which study statisticians are blinded to the study arm.  
The change from study baseline to week 8  in pain interference  as measured by [CONTACT_941] 8-item PROMIS Pain 
Interference scale is a secondary endpoint. The pain interference scale measures the consequences of 
pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. The scale is rendered using  a T-statistic, 
where a score of [ADDRESS_1056390] deviation (SD).  
The change from study baseline to week 8  in pain self- efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_112913] -item Pain Self-
Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ -2) is a secondary endpoint. It is a two -item instrument designed to assess 
the extent to which people in pain believe they are presently able to work and live a norma l life despi[INVESTIGATOR_769954] (work includes housework and paid and unpaid work). There is strong evidence for the validity and reliability of the PSEQ -2, its sensitivity to change, and suitability in clinical and research set tings.  
The change from baseline to Week 8  in 7-day average of daily maximum milligrams morphine equivalent 
(MME). Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_769955]- report and  calculation of the 7 -day

8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER PROCEDURES     
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_770018] (AE), assessment of adherence, monitoring of biometric information , and questionnaires by [CONTACT_581342].  
 
8.2.1  PROCEDURES   
Virtual Reality Headset data 
Data from the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] G2 4K device will be aggregated by [CONTACT_637399]’s cloud -based software solution that 
implements robust industry standards to maintain secure databases and keep data private. The 
AppliedVR cloud server is a HIPAA compliant platform. The device account that corresponds with each 
device will be created using a clinical trial number that is only linked to the patient via our office list of 
patients enrolled in the study. AppliedVR does not collect personally identifiable information and does 
not collect IP addresses from synced participant devices in our database. Data will be stored and 
indexed in the AppliedVR server database whenever devices upload batches of analytic events, and the 
analytic events are timestamped. The data collected by [CONTACT_941] d evice will include time of use, date of use, 
and the module selected. Our database servers are IP firewalled and whitelisted such that they refuse 
any connection from IP addresses not preprogrammed by [CONTACT_2296].   
 
PAINTRAINER  
 
PainTRAINER ® metadata will be downloaded and provided monthly by [CONTACT_770019]. These 
records will feature a user- ID unique to each patient. A linking lis t containing study -IDs and user -IDs will 
be stored on a secure server behind the Cedars -Sinai firewall, and only associated with other study data 
following database lock. In order to monitor weekly adherence, study -staff will access a subset of the 
metadata limited to study -ID and timestamps of usage. These data will be subjected to QC procedures in 
a SAS/STATA /R environment.

Patients will be provided with onboarding material as well as emails with a link to our lab’s  website. The 
website was  developed  based on experience from previous remote VR therapy clinical trial and 
feedback from patients within it. On the website we have instructional videos as well an extensive FAQ 
page.  
REDCap survey data will also be monitored. We will assign two technical support staff members to 
monitor patients in  both  arms. Patients will receive a telephone number and email to contact [CONTACT_770020].  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS   
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An a dverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  Short -term 
AEs associated with the study include “cybersickness,”[ADDRESS_1056391] of all potential cybersickness  symptoms can be 
found below:  
• Nausea  
• Fatigue  
• Eyestrain  
• Blurred vision  
• Difficulty focusing  
• Dizziness  
• Vertigo (a sensation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_321033], as though the room or surrounding environment is 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_334])  
• Headache  
• Fullness of the head  
• Difficulty concentrating  
• Postural instability  
 In very rare instances, materials used in VR headsets have caused a mild rash which resolves when the 
VR headset is discontinued. P articipants may also experience neck pain if using the device.  No AEs 
are expected with PainTRAINER.  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
A serious  adverse event ( SAE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11636], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. Important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769956] -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056392] any serious adverse events with the EaseVRx  or PainTRAINER 
intervention.  
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VEN  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
Research staff will call the patient if an event is noted in event assessment that is sent on a biweekly 
basis . Nothing more than mild  to moderate  side effects are  expected.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product mus t always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  
Research staff will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected or 
unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention .  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT 
ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during review  of biweekly event assessments  by a study team member  as well as on 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version 5 
Protocol  February 24, 2025 
  28 Day 1.  We will employ  a general question to allow the patient to provide an event description without 
bias by [CONTACT_770021], as follows:  
 
1) During the past [ADDRESS_1056393] you experienced anything uncomfortable, distressing or upsetting 
as a result of using the  technology ?  
a. Yes 
b. No 
2) If Yes please describe what happened . A research staff member will follow -up up with you as 
soon as possible to learn more.  
a. [open text]  
 A designated CRC will review the REDCap dashboard for completed AE assessments on a daily basis 
throughout the work week. Once they find a completed event assessment form,  they will follow -up with 
a phone call. The following information be obtained from the patient during the call: onset of potential 
adverse event, event description, when they last used the technology , how long they used the headset , 
when they stopped using the headset , severity of the potential AE, outcome  of the potential AE  (see 
categories, below) , time until resolution/stabilization of event, the perceived relationship of the event to 
the study  intervention, whether or not the event was expected (Y/N), whether it was  serious.  
 
The outcome can be labeled using one of the following  categories :  
• Recovered, without treatment  
• Recovered, with treatment  
• Still Present, no treatment  
• Still Present, being treated  
• Residual effect(s) present- no treatment  
• Residual effect(s) present- being treated  
 Research staff will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study 
participation.  
 
 
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   
 
Cedars -Sinai IRB  
If a mild or moderate event occurs it does not need to be submitted to the Reportable New Information (RNI). If the event is an unexpected (not usually associated VR side effects) or severe event (requiring 
treatment), an AE will be submitted to the IRB  as soon as possible but within at least 10 working days.  
 
 
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S REPORTING  
SAE will be submitted to the Cedars -Sinai IRB via RNI as soon as possible by [CONTACT_95002], but no 
later than 10 business days from the Principal Investigator’s or study team’s awareness of the event, incident, information or outcome.

8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 This definition could include an unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously iden tified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
Study coordinators will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the Cedars -Sinai IRB as a RNI submission 
as soon as possible by [CONTACT_95002], but no later than 10 business days from the Principal Investigator’s or study team’s awareness of the event, incident, information or outcome. UPs include 
SAEs and AEs, which are both unexpected and possibly related to the research as well as SAEs and AEs 
that meet the definition of a Research -Related Subject Injury (RRSI) –  a medical condition that is caused 
by [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or directly related to the research study (i.e., the condition would not have existed “but for” the 
subject’s participation in the study), and requires diagnosis or treatment.    
The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP;

variables  will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum  as appropriate ). Categorical variables will be summarized using the number and 
percentage of patients in each category. Data will be summarized with respect to patient demographic 
and baseline characteristics both across the study and by [CONTACT_3449] -arm. The efficacy endpoint s, safety 
assessments, and other outcome results for each treatment group will be summarized descriptively 
unless otherwise indicated. In addition, statistical model estimates of least squares means, treatment 
differences,  p-values and 95% confidence intervals will also be provided where relevant. The fit of 
general linear models will be assessed using residual plots and/or other diagnostic plots as appropriate. The fit of logistic models will be assessed using Hosmer- Lemes how goodness -of-fit and/or receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves as appropriate. All statistical tests will be 2 -sided and performed at 
the 0.05 level of significance unless stated otherwise.  
 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity: The family -wise type I error rate (FWER) for the statistical tests of 
the primary and secondary endpoints will be controlled at 0.05. To strongly control the FWER at this 
level, a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_769958] . A closed testing procedure will be employed to control the 
FWER. Any hypothesis tests conducted for model building purposes will be conducted outside of any 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 Missing Data: We anticipate two sources of missing data: the failure of patients to complete 
assessments and loss of patients to follow -up. Data patterns of baseline covariates with missing values 
will be examined using the method of Little and in case the data is not missing completely at random, 
missing values will be imputed using fully conditional specification with the multivariate imputation by [CONTACT_3006] (MICE) algorithm under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. Fifty or so datasets will b e generated and analyzed separately, and the results combined using the formula in Carmichael et 
al. Similar considerations will be applied to missing data on the dependent variable in a repeated measure mixed model by [CONTACT_770028] . 
 Sex as a Biological Variable: The effect of sex on each intervention will be assessed by [CONTACT_770029]. In each model, the dependent 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-

9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Pain Intensity -  The goal of this analysis is to test the effectiveness of PainTRAINER vs. EaseVRx in 
decreasing reported pain intensity. The trial will be a success if there is statistical evidence that either 
PainTRAINER or EaseVRx is more effective in reducing pain intensity. The primary outcome will be the baseline vs. week [ADDRESS_1056399].  
 Additionally, we will use  a logistic regression  to determine whether the odds of achiving the 
MCID of 2  is different between the two groups after accounting for  baseline -scores by [CONTACT_770030] s. 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 Pain Interference, Pain Catastrophizing, Coronavirus -Related Anxiety, and Self -Efficacy  
The goal of these analyses is to test the difference in the effectiveness of PainTRAINER vs. EaseVRx in 
decreasing pain interference , pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and self- efficacy. While the concepts 
measured are different, and the tests of change distinct, the analysis approach will be similar for all PROs. Independently for each PRO, a two -sample t -test will be used to compare differences -in-
differences between the a rms. Additionally, we will use an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to 
determine whether the average gain is different between the two groups after controlling for baseline -
scores by [CONTACT_770031]. If assumptions of ANCOVA are not met, we will consider 
generalized linear models, including ordered logistic regressions to determine whether the proportional odds of average gain in the scale are different between the two groups after controlling for baseline -
scores by [CONTACT_770031].  
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_326690] -  The goal of this analysis is to test the effectiveness of PainTRAINER vs. EaseVRx in 
decreasing weekly average milligrams morphine equivalent (MME) of prescribed medication between the baseline week and the week before week 8. Weekly average MME will be c alculated as a 7 -day 
average of daily maximum MME as prescribed. Analysis of this endpoint will proceed via ANCOVA, adjusting for subjects’ baseline MME. We will assess the assumptions underpi[INVESTIGATOR_769959]. If no suitable transformations can be found, bootstrapped confidence intervals for 
the between -group differences in weekly MME will be produced.  
Both adjusted and unadjusted between -group comparisons will be presented with 95% confidence 
intervals.  
 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
All safety analyses will be descriptive. No statistical testing will be performed.

demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056400] deviation or median and interquartile range for the continuous variables, and 
frequency and percentage for the categorical variables .  Any time -to-event counts will be measured 
from the day of randomization. Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated according to: BMI=weight 
(kg)/(height (m))2. Age will be calculated according to: Age=(date of event -birth date+1)/365.25. Weekly 
average o pi[INVESTIGATOR_769960] a 7 -day average of daily maximum milligrams morphine 
equivalent (MME) as prescribed. Zip code will be matched to median income using census data as an 
aggregate measure of socio -economic status .

differential response to the same treatment due to individual traits) on pain intensity by [CONTACT_770032]. The results will enable the research team to work with patient partners to make 
recommen dations for optimizing deployment of home -based digital behavioral treatment across a 
diverse populace. We will investigate the predictive value of key patient characteristics, including type of 
pain c ondition, sex, age, race, ethnicity, State and zip code, Rural - Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes 
(a composite measure of population density, urbanization, and daily commuting), pain severity, opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942], comorbidities, social support, and COVID -19 impacts  (unemployment, financial hardship, family or 
personal COVID -19 diagnosis). The analysis for each covariate will consist of an unadjusted test of 
interaction with treatment group in a multivariate logistic regression model with responder status 
(subject ac hieved MCID difference or did not) as the dependent variable. These models will include fixed 
categorical effects for treatment, covariate, and treatment -by-covariate interaction. Interaction terms 
with a significance level of less than .10 will be include d in full model testing. The p -values of interaction 
terms will be presented, as will the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals by [CONTACT_770033]. If multiple interaction terms demonstrate a significance level of less than .10, we will use a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach to variable selection. We will also use 
multivariable logit modeling with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to measure the accuracy of the resulting model in predicting achievement of an MCID response as measured by [CONTACT_770034] c -statistic.

to such records as needed.  
Data in the study are  collected in three ways: in real- time, at infrequent intervals throughout the study, 
and through medical record queries. Real -time data, including survey data delivered via mobile device, 
will be stored on secure servers hosted by [CONTACT_770037] a unique identifier 
for each participant. Virtual reality adherence data will also be tracked in real- time and hosted on secure 
servers by [CONTACT_637399]; a separate unique ID will be assigned to each participant. Data collected at 
infrequent intervals throughout the study, such as entry, 1 4-day interval assessments , and exit 
questionnaires will be stored on secure CSMC servers with unique ID's for each participant. Data collected from medical record numbers  will reside on secure CSMC servers and an ID will be assigned to 
each individual in order to abstract PHI/PII and the medical record number. Each dataset will utilize 
different unique ID's and a list linking each unique ID to each participant will be stored internally on the 
secured CSMC network. The linking list allows a researcher with access to the secured files to merge all data using statistical software, while maintaining data confidentiality.  
To minimize risk of breaches in confidentiality associated with the access and recording of protected 
health information, study staff will be assigned unique passwords and usernames to access secure 
servers. Additionally, identifiable information for participants will be obfuscated using unique ID numbers and a linking list will be held in a secure location.

Protocol  February 24, 2025 
  41 Purpose:  
The primary goals of the reviewing IRB are as follows:  
1. To monitor and advise on scientific and ethical issues related to the study implementation for 
the protection of human subjects  
2. To review and approve the protocol and subsequently conduct annual reviews to determine 
whether participant safety has been adequately safeguarded  
3. To review procedures and decisions regarding the adequate protection of specific participants 
when investigators break protocol because of adverse events or clinical deterioration  
4. To review progress to see that enrollment goals have been met  
5. To monitor and advise on ethical issues related to adverse events  
6. To oversee the confidentiality of data, and quality of data collection, management, and analysis  
7. To recommend, if necessary, discontinuation, modification, or termination of the study based 
upon emerging data (in the study and literature) and evaluation of risk/benefit ratio,  
 
 
10.1.6 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Schedule and Meetings:  
The Reviewing IRB will be called upon whenever possible to render judgments in the advent of serious 
adverse event or clinical deterioration. The Reviewing IRB will meet once per year, or as needed. For each meeting, the Reviewing IRB will first meet in an open session attended by [CONTACT_458]. The IRB will first review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring. 
The IRB will review any problems in implementing the safety plan and for suggesting any necessary 
modifications to the safety plan. The reviewing IRB will then meet in a closed session for the purpose of reviewing emerging trial data at subsequent meetings.  
1.4 Protection of Participants:  
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_570560].  
2.1 Monitoring and Recommendations:  
After the meeting, the Reviewing IRB will make recommendations to the PI. The Reviewing IRB will make recommendations concerning the continuation or conclusion of the study. The Reviewing IRB will monitor both safety and outcome data as part of the yearly review. No interim analysis is planned. Safety evaluations sent before the annual meeting will include review of adverse events for each participant. The Reviewing IRB will further consider external factors such as scientific and therapeutic 
developments that may impact the safety or the ethics of the study. The investigators will ensure that 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_770041].  
 
10.1.7 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
Our quality assurance (QA) and control (QC) procedures are designed to support adherence to the protocol, obtain complete follow -up data for all participants enrolled, and establish and maintain high 
Transcending COVID -19 barriers to pain care in rural America: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of evidence -based, on-
demand, digital behavioral treatments for chronic pain  Version [ADDRESS_1056410] occurred during data capture and/or processing. Whi le much of the QA effort occurs ahead of study 
launch, both efforts will require real- time and periodic tasks conducted through the duration of the 
study to ensure consistent checks of data integrity, completeness, and correctness.  
QA via error prevention will focus largely on the REDCap system. Before data is entered into REDCap, study personnel will:  
• Indicate units in question stems and use field validation whenever possible;  
• Define and enforce range minimum/maximum where applicable;  
• Ensure uniformity in date formatting across all REDCap date fields;  
• Program pre -defined multiple -choice fields whenever possible (as opposed to free text);  
• Indicate specific, standardized choices to identify data as intentionally missing (e.g “Not Applicable,” “Don’t Know”) as opposed to blank fields;  
• Enforce skip/no -skip logic where appropriate;  
• Standardize assignment of raw values. (i.e. if “Yes” is coded as a ‘1’ in one field, it should be coded as ‘1’ in all other project fields); and  
• Use case and punctuation consistently across all field labels.  
Each aspect of the REDCap data collection system will be tested before actual study data is collected. Study personnel will enter mock data into REDCap forms, serving as the “User” for acceptance testing. We will document the success or failure of a) the u ser interface for data entry, b) the on -line univariate 
and range data validation checks, and c) custom functions and coding. This mock data will be exported as SAS/ R/STATA datasets by [CONTACT_770042].  
Our fundamental QC approach prioritizes error detection. Automated QC will occur in a SAS/ R/STATA 
programming environment and will be tested/iterated on mock data before being employed monthly to 
exported datasets from both REDCap and the EHR. These QC programs will target potential data 
anomalies including:  
• Missing data or forms;  
• Out-of-range or erroneous data;  
• Inconsistent, improperly formatted, or out -of-range dates; and  
• Fields on a "completed form" not completed.  
Once the study begins, routine QC reports will be prepared monthly by [CONTACT_6301]. These 
reports will describe target and actual enrollment, eligible  participant s screened with reasons for screen 
failure, and participant disposition (enrolled; active, completed, discontinued treatment, and lost to 
follow -up). These reports will also provide proportions of forms completed/missing, as well as 
summaries of problems identified by [CONTACT_770043]. Changes to QC programming will be documented 
and re -tested for accuracy.  
Finally, daily monitoring for data completeness will be undertaken by [CONTACT_540460] a QA effort. Patients will initially be sent a reminder email when they have not submitted data after [ADDRESS_1056411] the 
patient up to 3 times in one week.

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Study staff will develop, test, and maintain the data capture system using a web -based data collection 
system, REDCap, as the primary source of data entry and storage. Developed by [CONTACT_50222], 
REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodolog y for electronic collection and management of 
research and clinical trial data. The REDCap system provides a secure, web -based application that is 
flexible and provides: 1) an intuitive interface for users to enter data and have real time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of entry; 2) HIPAA compliant audit trails for 
tracking page views, data manipulation and export procedures; 3) record locking and electronic 
signature [CONTACT_297079]; 4) control over user rights to view an d manipulate data; 5) a report builder capable 
of querying patient records; and 6) automated export procedures for SAS/ R/STATA datasets.  
The REDCap system complies with all applicable guidelines to ensure patient confidentiality, data 
integrity, and reliability. Quality assurance and control procedures will be applied to ensure the completeness, validity, and accuracy of the study database.  The MOOP  describes data collection 
processes, database development procedures, quality control processes, and reporting in greater detail.  
EHR data will be retrieved by [CONTACT_770044] (RISCC) at Cedars -
Sinai, which facilitates interaction between the research community and the Epic data warehouse and production environment. We will collaborate with RISC C to design queries for portions of participants’ 
records as defined in the data dictionary. The data extracts issuing from these queries will be delivered 
monthly as CSV files via Box  and/or  OneDrive , HIPAA -compliant cloud content management system s. 
Thes e will then be converted to SAS /R/STATA data sets and subjected to QC procedures in a 
SAS/ R/STATA environment.  
VR device metadata will be provided monthly by [CONTACT_770045]. These records will feature a device -ID unique to each 
patient. A linking list containing study -IDs and device -IDs will be stored on a secure server behind the 
Cedars -Sinai firewall, an d only associated with other study data following database lock. In order to 
monitor weekly adherence, study -staff will access a subset of the metadata limited to study -ID and 
timestamps of usage. These data will be subjected to QC procedures in a SAS /R/STATA environment.  
PainTRAINER  metadata will be provided monthly by [CONTACT_770046]. These records will feature a user -ID unique to each patient. A linking list containing study -IDs and user -IDs will be stored on a secure 
server behind the Cedars -Sinai firewall, and only associated with other study data following database 
lock. In order to monitor weekly adherence, study -staff will access a subset of the metadata limited  to 
study -ID and timestamps of usage. These data will be subjected to QC procedures in a SAS/ R/STATA 
environment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION

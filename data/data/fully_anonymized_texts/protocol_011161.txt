A small subset of the HIV-infected population achieve durable control of HIV virus in the absence of ART. These individuals, termed elite controllers (ECs), remain ART naïve, have stable CD4 T cell counts for many years and have no history of opportunistic infections. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_245019], recent evidence suggests ECs may exhibit heightened immune activation that may contribute to a potentially increased risk for non-infectious complications, similar to successfully treated progressors.  In the current 2 group, randomized, open label trial, we intend to study the effects of a lipid lowering agent vs aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA) on immune activation in HIV-[ADDRESS_298266] no history of ART or opportunistic infections (OIs) and have stable CD4 T cell counts for greater than 3 years. The second group will enroll HIV-1 infected Treated Progressors (henceforth referred to as ART <50) who have maintained HIV-RNA below the limit of detection in commercially available assays (<40, <48, or <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) for greater than 3 years on ART (treatment duration greater than 4 years). Up to 2 months after the screening and enrollment visit, each group will enter a 3 month observation period (to establish baseline values for biomarkers/cellular markers). After 3 months, participants from each group will be randomized to either ASA, 81 mg PO daily, or atorvastatin (ATV), 40 mg (dose adjusted for subjects on antiretroviral regimens with significant interactions, see Section 5.3.1), and will be treated for 9 months, followed by 3 months of a wash out period (see Figure 1). The primary end point will be change of sCD14 after 9 months of study intervention from Month 3 to Month 12 in each treatment arm, with groups combined (EC and ART <50). Secondary objectives will be to compare changes in soluble biomarkers (sCD14, IL-6, D-dimer, hsCRP, sTF, sCD163 and other relevant markers of inflammation and coagulation) and cellular activation markers between study groups and treatment arms (ASA vs statin and EC vs ART<50 and with groups combined), to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) disease prevalence in EC vs ART <50 by [CONTACT_245134], to determine MR measurements and correlations with biomarkers and cellular activation markers, and to investigate changes in plasma viremia as measured by [CONTACT_245135].

Page 13 of 83 2  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 2.1 Background Information 2.1.1 Immune Activation in HIV-infected Persons HIV-infected individuals are currently at increased risk for non-infectious complications, including cardiovascular, renal and hepatic disease, bone loss and neurocognitive impairment, despi[INVESTIGATOR_245020] [1, 2]. Biomarkers linked to non-AIDS complications (venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease and renal disease) including D-dimer, soluble (s) tissue factor (TF), sCD14, C-reactive protein (CRP), and proinflammatory cytokines have been observed at higher levels in HIV seropositive compared to seronegative persons [3-7]. Furthermore, elevated levels of biomarkers associated with inflammation, coagulation and monocyte activation (D-dimer, CRP, IL-6, and sCD14) have been found to be independent predictors of all-cause mortality and increased risk of AIDS [8-10]. Even in the presence of ART-induced viral suppression, HIV-infected individuals remain at a heightened risk of atherosclerotic disease and increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and show increased inflammation and monocyte activation [11, 12] [13]. In HIV-negative subjects, the CD14++CD16+ activated monocyte phenotype independently predicts cardiovascular disease [14]. Monocytes are known to migrate to developi[INVESTIGATOR_245021]. Macrophage activation leads to the production of oxygen radicals, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, ultimately causing  deleterious tissue damage and increased inflammation [15]. 2.1.2 Immune Activation in Elite Controllers A small subset of the HIV-infected population (<0.5 percent) are able to maintain stable CD4 T cell counts and suppressed HIV RNA below the limit of detection in the absence of ART for decades [16-18]. Now termed elite controllers (ECs), these individuals are thought to control HIV replication through protective class I HLA haplotypes [19-21] and strong HIV-specific CD8 T cell responses [22-24]. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_245022], ECs have higher rates of immune activation as measured by [CONTACT_245136] D-dimer, IL-6, CRP, and markers of monocyte activation including soluble (s) CD163 and TF (tissue factor) [25-28] compared to healthy controls. In some cases, ECs have been noted to have higher levels of immune activation than those observed in HIV-infected progressors on effective ART (D-dimer and sTF) [29] and may possibly be at increased risk for cardiovascular complications [27].  2.1.[ADDRESS_298267] been used to quantify the degree of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis through evaluation of IMT, lumen diameter, and the presence of plaques in the coronary and carotid arteries [30, 31] [32]. Imaging studies initially utilizing B-mode ultrasonography, established an association between carotid IMT and cardiovascular events, namely increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction [33-35]. Increasingly, carotid IMT has been used as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis and has been shown to be a predictor of future cardiac events [32, 36]. Given the rising cost of health care in the [LOCATION_002], carotid ultrasonography is now being ultilized to determine 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 14 of 83 the degree of atherosclerosis in populations at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (HIV-seropostive, diabetics, autoimmune connective tissue diseases, etc) [13, 37, 38]. Consistent with previous findings that HIV-infected individuals have increased levels of biomarkers and inflammation linked to cardiovascular disease (see Section 2.1.2), HIV-infected subjects also have a greater mean carotid IMT compared to HIV-negative controls [13]. Furthermore, HIV infection has been shown to be an independent risk factor of carotid IMT [13]. These findings have been extended to ECs, who have also been shown to have higher levels of carotid IMT than HIV-seronegative controls [28] and increased coronary atherosclerosis (determined by [CONTACT_4654]) [27]. Recently, the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to measure atherosclerosis has been explored and compared to carotid ultrasonography [39]. MR imaging offers high spatial resolution and has been established as accurate and sensitive for measuring plaque size and carotid IMT [40-42]. 2.1.[ADDRESS_298268]-line treatment for reduction of low-denisty lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [43] and have been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction and stroke in both patients with established cardiovascular disease and subclinical disease [44, 45]. Statins greatly decrease all-cause mortality and act to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C reactive protein, known independent predictors of cardiovascular events [46-50]. Studies have also focused on the ability of statins to impede or reverse progression of cardiovascular disease, measured by [CONTACT_245137]. Among the statins currently available on the market, atorvastatin (ATV) has emerged as a statin of choice in studying the effects of statins on cardiovascular disease regression, given it’s availability as a generic medication, the widespread familiarity with its use, and well-characterized safety profile [51, 52]. While atorvastatin is a CYP3A substrate, less potent drug interactions have been observed with CYP3A inhibitors than with other statins metabolized through this pathway [53]). ATV has been shown to have a comparable ability to lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol compared with other statins and has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events [53-57]. In a study of atorvastatin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, regression of carotid IMT was noted that correlated with changes in inflammation, thrombosis and endothelial activation profiles [58] and atorvastatin has been associated with reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including CRP [59] and sCD14 [60] in high risk patients. 2.1.5 Platelet Aggregation and HIV Platelets aggregate and adhere to the site of vascular injury and secrete products such as adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and thromboxane A2 that mediate clot formation and amplify the platelet response [61]. While platelets play a critical role in the maintenance of the endothelium and homeostasis through plug formation, exhuberant platelet activation is associated with increased carotid IMT [62, 63] and ultimately increased arterial and venous thromboembolic events [64, 65]. Increased thromboxane metabolites, a secretion product of activated platelets, have been linked to accelerated atherogenesis and acute coronary syndromes [66-68]. Increased platelet aggregation is also associated independently with mortality and cardiovascular events [69]. Given that HIV-infected individuals have increased risk of thrombotic and cardiovascular events, it is not surprising that they exhibit heightened platelet activation. Specifically, HIV-infected 
EC and Immune Activation, V [ADDRESS_298269] increased expression of P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation that is critical in the recuirment and adhesion of pro-inflammatory leukocytes to the site of endothelial injury [70]. In a case control matched study, we found that soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), a biomarker upregulated by [CONTACT_245138], was significantly elevated in HIV-infected individuals preceding an incident cardiovascular event compared to HIV-infected controls [7]. Furthermore, HIV-infected individuals have increased circulating platelet-monocyte complexes, an additional marker of platelet activation [71, 72]. 2.1.[ADDRESS_298270] of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_245023] (ASA) is a potent COX-1 inhibitor that prevents the formation of prostaglandin H2 and thus thromboxane A2, a vasoconstrictor important in recruitment of circulating platelets and granule secretion [73]. In HIV-uninfected individuals, ASA has been used for decades to prevent cardiovascular disease, including incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [73-75]. Numerous placebo-controlled trials with doses ranging from [ADDRESS_298271] confirmed the antithrombotic properties of ASA [76], with [ADDRESS_298272] commonly prescribed doses in the [LOCATION_002]. However, ASA usage (even 100 mg on alternate days) is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding [75, 77]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_245024], it has a favorable safety profile at low doses and remains one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide [74, 78]. 2.1.7 Targeting Cardiovascular Disease in HIV-infected Persons A new study proposed by [CONTACT_245139] (ACTG) is designed to target immune activation in ECs through treatment with ART (A5308, NCT 01777997), with a primary endpoint looking at co-expression of HLA-DR and CD38 on CD8 T cells at [ADDRESS_298273] shown a trend towards decreased mortality with HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (or statin) therapy [79] and decreased markers of immune activation, as measured by [CONTACT_245140]14, with ASA [80] and with statin therapy in HIV positive individuals [81]. In a substudy of the SATURN-HIV trial (a randomized, double-blind trial of ATV in HIV positive individuals, targeting subclinical cardiovascular disease), significant reductions were observed in soluble and cellular markers of monocyte activation after as little as 6 months (24 weeks) on therapy [81], and in a subanalysis of the SMART study, sCD14 was associated with mortality [10]. Additionally, it has been recently reported in a preliminary study that statin use (predominately rosuvastatin and pravastatin) reduces the risk of cancer in HIV-infected persons [82]. We propose to target immune activation with low-dose ASA or ATV therapy in both ECs and ART-treated HIV+ patients with suppressed viremia (ART <50), with change from month 3 in sCD14 as a primary outcome after 9 months of intervention (ASA vs ATV).  2.1.8 Gut microbiome and inflammation in HIV infected persons 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 16 of 83 The gut microbiome in HIV infected people may be playing a role in inflammatory responses (STM McCune) and to investigate this we will study stool microbiome at baseline [86].   2.2 Rationale It is well-established that HIV-seropositive persons are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Within the HIV-infected population, there exists a unique subset of HIV-infected individuals, termed ECs, who maintain stable CD4 T cells counts and suppressed plasma HIV-RNA in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_245025], recent studies have demonstrated heightened immune activation and atherosclerosis in ECs compared to HIV-uninfected individuals [27, 28]. While ART is known to decrease immune activation in HIV-infected persons, it is costly, poses some risk of adverse effects, and may decrease HIV-specific immune responses in this group. In addition, as ART-treated persons still maintain higher levels of biomarkers that are linked to all cause mortality and have excess cardiovascular risk, it is feasible that ART alone in EC will not reverse the small decrease of inflammation and may necessitate treatment with both ART and an additional anti-inflammatory intervention. ATV and ASA are 2 well-studied and well-tolerated drugs known to decrease immune activation and prevent cardiovascular events with minimal side effects.  We propose to study the effects of ATV and ASA on biomarkers and cellular markers of immune activation and carotid-intima thickness. ECs and HIV-infected persons with suppressed HIV-RNA on ART (Treated Progressors) will be randomized to either a ATV or ASA open-labeled study arm. Because ATV bioavailability is increased when co-administered with certain antiretrovirals [53] the study dose would be adjusted in subjects on antiretroviral regimens with significant interactions (see Section 5.3.1). ASA will be dosed at [ADDRESS_298274] of 9 months of ATV or ASA therapy will be assessed through changes in biomarkers and cellular markers of activation, with the primary endpoint set as a change in sCD14, which has been linked to all-cause mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Additional biomarkers will include high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), soluble Tissue Factor (sTF), IL-[ADDRESS_298275] of therapy on cardiovascular disease progression through MR imaging of the carotid arteries. This study is utilzing MR imaging over carotid ultrasonography as it offers increased resolution, is free of radiation and provides similar results to ultrasonography. A washout period is included to elucidate if changes in biomarkers and cellular markers can be attributed to either ATV or ASA.   3 STUDY OBJECTIVES

Page 19 of 83 3.4 Study Endpoints 3.4.1 Primary Endpoint The primary end point will be change of sCD14 from Month 3 to Month 12 in the 2 groups combined (EC and ART <50). 3.4.2 Secondary Endpoints • To evaluate changes in soluble biomarkers (sCD14, IL-6, D-dimer, hsCRP, sCD163, sTF as well as other relevant markers of inflammation and coagulation) in EC and ART <50 groups treated with ASA or ATV, independently within each group and arm and with groups combined, at 6, 9, and 12 months. • To evaluate changes in T cell activation (measured by [CONTACT_44688]-DR/CD38 co-expression), monocyte immune activation (measured by [CONTACT_245131]14++CD16+ and CD14varCD16+ and markers of activation, CCR5 and TF, and migration, CCR2 and CX3CR1), at 6, 9, 12 months of study. • To investigate differences in HLA type, which has been implicated as a mechanism of viremic control in ECs, between groups and treatment arms, as it relates to treatment response. • Assess if a wash out period following 9 months of therapy results in biomarker and cellular activation changes after 3 months (Month 15). • To compare changes of biomarkers and cellular markers between EC and ART <50 groups after adjusting for smoking, CD4 counts and age. • To compare changes of biomarkers and cellular markers between ATV and ASA arms of each group and in both groups combined. • To evaluate changes in plasma viral load, as measured by [CONTACT_245132] <50 groups treated with ASA or ATV at baseline, 3 and 12 months. • Assess toxicity profile of ASA versus ATV in the study population. • Assess prevalent atherosclerotic disease in EC vs ART<50 by [CONTACT_245134]. • Assess changes in MR imaging of carotids after 9 months of statin or ASA in each group and both groups combined. • Correlate MR vascular imaging with soluble and cellular biomarkers of inflammation. 3.4.[ADDRESS_298276] Selection Selection criteria for ECs were created based on the well-established definition that EC/Long-term Non-progressors are HIV-1 infected subjects with a suppressed viral load of <40 (or <48 or <50) copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL (depending on the assay used) in the absence of ART. Additionally, they have no history of opportunistic infections and stable CD4 T cells counts [83]. Selection criteria for Treated Progressors (ART <50) are based on the 
EC and Immune Activation, V [ADDRESS_298277] a HIV-RNA level of <40 (or <48 or <50) copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  Since this study is seeking to establish the biomarker, cellular and cardiovascular effects of treatment with ATV and ASA, participants must not have received statin or ASA therapy for [ADDRESS_298278] received any immunomodulating therapy, systemic corticosteroids or chronic daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use unless discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1704]. 4.2 Recruitment Plan  Subjects will be recruited from the NIH Clinical Center, particularly from the NIH CCMD/NIAID OP8 Clinic, and from University of Minnesota Hennepin County Medical Center. The study may also be advertised through web based campaign as study visits are infrequent and we may need to recruit from outside the local area.   Subjects recruited from University of Minnesota, Hennepin County will sign consents at this site and all screeining procedures including initial history and physical Assesments, lab work to determine eligibility will be done before sending them to NIH clinical Center OP8 clinic. These subjects will continue into month [ADDRESS_298279] (IRB) approvals. Health care providers and research personnel at participating institutions will identify potentially eligible subjects. Once a subject for study entry is identified and expresses interest in learning about the study, the subject will be approached by [CONTACT_245143]. If the subject remains interested, study details and the informed consent form (ICF) will be reviewed with the candidate by [CONTACT_9154]/designee. If the subject is willing to participate in the study, he or she will be provided with a copy of the informed consent to review. If a subject requires more time to consider the study, the staff member will give them a copy of the informed consent along with the staff member’s contact [CONTACT_3031], so that subjects may take the documents home for further review. After questions related to the study and the informed consent has been answered to the subject’s satisfaction, subjects will be asked to sign the IRB-approved consent form.  4.[ADDRESS_298280] Inclusion Criteria EC Arm 1.

ASA has been listed as a pregnancy category D drug by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) due to the potential for known teratogenic or abortifacient effects on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. Subjects must agree not to become pregnant. Females of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test before initiating the study agent and at each study visit. Because of the risk involved, sexually active subjects and their partners must use [ADDRESS_298283] continue to use both methods until the end of study visit (Month 15). The methods of birth control may be selected from the list included below:  • Hormonal contraception  • Male or female condoms with or without a spermicide • Diaphragm or cervical cap with a spermicide  • Intrauterine device (IUD) 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 22 of 83 • Male partner with a vasectomy If pregnancy is suspected or should occur, subjects must notify the study staff immediately.  4.[ADDRESS_298284] Exclusion Criteria 1. Diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >.190 mg/dL). 2.

Any chronic inflammatory condition either requiring anti-inflammatory medication (systemic corticosteroids, daily NSAID use,immunomodulating medications) which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], confound the interpretation of soluble inflammatory biomarkers.  While on study, short term (less than 5 days) NSAID use will be allowed at the discretion of the investigator.   6. Active drug use or alcohol abuse that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may interfere with the ability of the subject to participate in the study or that may unacceptably increase the risk of the study intervention.. 7. Safety laboratory cut offs: coagulation (INR >2 upper limit of normal [ULN], PLT<75K), renal function (GFR<60), liver function (ALT or Alkaline phosphatase or direct bilirubin >2x ULN), aldolase <1.[ADDRESS_298285] and anemia (Hg <9 mg/dL). 8. Antiretroviral therapy with tipranivir, or any therapy which combines non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with protease inhibitors. 9. Chronic hepatitis C co-infection.  However, if a subject has more than 24 weeks of sustained virologic response (SVR), the subject can be considered for eligibility. 10. If either MR or apheresis is contraindicated, subject may still participate without this procedure. In the case of missed apheresis, a 30 mL research blood draw will be substituted (see Appendices B and C). 11. If statin initiation is indicated per current guidelines, subject will be counseled to consult with their PMD. If the  subject then chooses to take part in the study, we will provide their PMD with all pertinent lab results during the course of the study, if requested.  Co-enrollment Guidelines: Co-enrollment in other trials will be restricted, other than enrollment on observational studies. Study staff should be notified of co-enrollment as it may require the approval of the Investigator. 4.6 Justification for Exclusion of Women and Children (Special Populations)  4.6.1 Exclusion of Women  • Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there are known adverse effects of ATV, a pregnancy category X drug, on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081]. 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 23 of 83 ASA has been listed as a pregnancy category D drug by [CONTACT_245147][INVESTIGATOR_16103]. • Breast-feeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ATV, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother will be treated with ATV. There is a known risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ASA, therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother will be treated with ASA. 4.6.2 Exclusion of Children  Because there are insufficient data regarding dosing or AEs available in HIV-infected adults to judge the potential risk in HIV-infected children, children are excluded from this study.   5 STUDY AGENT/INTERVENTIONS  5.[ADDRESS_298286] pharmacy procedures. 5.1.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling Each bottle will be individually labeled with the participant ID number, dosing instructions, recommended storage conditions, the name [CONTACT_4547], randomization number, and that the agent should be kept out of reach of children. 5.2 Study Agent Storage and Stability Both ATV and ASA should be stored at room temperature, 20-25°C (68-77°F). 5.3 Preparation, Administration, and Dosage of Study Agent/Intervention(s) 5.3.1 Study Agent : atorvastatin Description Dosing and Administration: 40 mg tablet, daily. In subjects on certain antiretroviral medications, ATV dosing will be adjusted in accordance with DHHS guidelines [84]. See Table [ADDRESS_298287] of antiretroviral agents requiring adjustment. Briefly, in subjects on cobicistat -or ritonavir- boosted protease inhibitor or elvitegravir-based regimens, the atorvastatin AUC can increase  by 3-6 fold [87].  In subjects on protease inhibitor (other than tipranavir) or elvitegravir-based regimens, the atorvastatin dose will be decreased to 20mg daily.  In subjects on efavirenz or etravirine-based regimens, atorvastatin AUC can decrease from 32 to 43%.  Therefore, in subjects on efavirenz or etravirine-based regimens, the dose of atorvastatin will be increased to 80mg daily. Dosing of ATV with other ART regimens will also be made in accordance with DHHS guidelines [84].

For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician.  Medications to be reported in CRIMSON are concomitant prescription medications, over-the-counter medications and non-prescription medications taken at the time of AEs (all grades except grade 1). 5.7 Prohibited Medications and Procedures Treatment with immunomodulating agents, systemic corticosteroids and daily NSAIDs will not be permitted unless discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_1704]. Subjects treated with a statin or ASA daily up to 6 months prior to the screening visit will also be excluded. Treatment with tipranavir will be prohibited because ATV is contraindicated in these patients. Treatment with any ART regimen combining a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with a protease inhibitor will be prohibited because of the lack of data concerning drug interactions with ATV. 6 STUDY SCHEDULE  For the purposes of this study, a month is a calendar month.  A window of up to ± 2 weeks will be acceptable for all visits after the baseline visit. Visits that include procedures (MRI or pheresis) may be completed in more than one day. 6.1 Screening  Subjects will be screened at either the NIH Clinical Center or Hennepin County Medical Center and undergo the following procedures subsequent to signing informed consent: • Review patient eligibility  • Physical examination, medical history and medication history (including herbal supplements) • HIV RNA, CD4 • Pregnancy testing (urine or serum) in women of child-bearing potential • Safety labs (Hematology, PT/PTT, Chemistry, Liver Function Tests, Urinalysis, Creatine Kinase, Aldolase)

Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy,, defined as muscle aches or weakness in conjunction with increases in CPK values >[ADDRESS_298296].The comcomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin  with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors  (e.g. clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rahbdomyolysis.  • Liver Dysfunction: Persistent elevations (<[ADDRESS_298297] occurring on 2 or more occasions in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium tablets in clinical trails. • Endocrine Effects: “Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,” including ATV.    
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 31 of 83 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: According to the ASA package insert (Appendix E),  the following warnings and precautions should be considered in patients with the following morbidities: • Alcohol Warning: Increased bleeding risks may occur in patients who consume 3 or more alcoholic drinks a day. • Coagulation Abnormalities: “Even low doses of ASA can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time. This can adversely affect patients with inherited (hemophilia) or acquired (liver disease or vitamin K deficiency) bleeding disorders.” • GI Side Effects: “GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding.” • Peptic Ulcer Disease: ASA can cause gastric mucosal irriation and bleeding so patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease should avoid use. • Renal Failure: Patients with glomerular filtration rates less that 10 mL/minute should avoid use. • Hepatic Insufficiency: Avoid use in patients with hepatic insufficiency. • Sodium Restricted Diet: The high sodium content in buffered ASA preparations should be avoided in patients with sodium retaining states (ie congestive heart failure or renal failure). Phlebotomy  The risks associated with phlebotomy include discomfort, bruising, local hematoma formation and, on rare occasions, infections, lightheadedness, and fainting. The amount of blood drawn for research purposes will be within the limits allowed for adult subjects at the NIH Clinical Center (Medical Administrative Policy 95-9: Guidelines for Limits of Blood Drawn for Research Purposes in the Clinical Center: http://cc-internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/PDF/M95-9.pdf).  Apheresis The potential risks associated with apheresis include lightheadedness, dizziness, possible fainting, tingling around the mouth and in the fingers and toes, nausea, chills, vomiting, mild muscle cramps, loss of <[ADDRESS_298298] 10 years at the NIH.    Magnetic Resonance Imaging Patients with pacemakers, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including heart valves and cochlear implants), or shrapnel fragments in critical sites, such as the orbit or the brain are at risk of injury from MR imaging. Welders and metal workers are also at risk for injury because of possible metallic foreign bodies in

Currently, no treatment exists that addresses increased immune activation and cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected individuals; therefore this study may benefit future populations of HIV-infected persons with risk of cardiovascular events.  9 RESEARCH USE OF STORED HUMAN SAMPLES, SPECIMENS, OR DATA  • Intended Use: Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to study biomarkers and cellular markers of activation or other immune measurements that are relevant to HIV infection or similar immunodeficiencies as well as cardiovascular disease. Any other research or experimental treatments will be done under this or other protocols for which separate signed informed consent documents will be obtained. • Storage:  Access to stored samples will be limited using either a locked room or a locked freezer. Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_473]. Data will be kept in password-protected computers. Only investigators will have access to the samples and data.  • Tracking: Samples will be tracked utilizing the NCI at Frederick Central repository operated by [CONTACT_10069], Inc. Data will be stored and maintained in the CRIMSON database.  • Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol:  o In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to study these samples and/or data. In that case, IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples and/or data.  Any clinical information shared about the sample would similarly require prior IRB approval.  o At the completion of the protocol (termination), samples and data will either be destroyed, or after IRB approval, transferred to another existing protocol.   • Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB: Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples (for example, due to freezer malfunction) or data (for example, misplacing a printout of data with identifiers) that meets the definition of a Protocol Deviation, Unanticipated Problem, and/or compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study, will be reported to the NIAID IRB.

Compensation for time inconvenience will be provided for participants who attempt or complete leukapheresis procedures ($150); carotid MRI ($150); dietary questionnaire ($70), rectal swab ($30); phlebotomy $40 and clinic visit $[ADDRESS_298300] does not qualify for leukapheresis, an additional research blood draw of 30 mL will be added (see Appendix C), and in that case, compensation for time and inconvenience will be provided for this procedure ($40). If a subject completes all study visits, the subject  will receive a study completion compensation of $200 at the end of the study for their time and inconvenience.     11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 11.1 Toxicity Scale  The DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Toxicity (Version 1.0 - December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009)) will be used to grade each AE:  http://rsc.tech-res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/gradingtables.aspx All AEs will be recorded regardless of grade. Only grade 2 and above AEs will be reported.  11.2 Specification of Safety Parameters Atorvastatin: The following most common adverse reactions have been reported with ATV use, according to the package insert: • Nasopharyngitis (8.3%) • Arthralgia (6.9%) • Diarrhea (6.8%) • Pain in extremity (6.0%) • Urinary tract infection (5.7%)  These events, should they occur, would constitute expected adverse events.    
EC and Immune Activation, V [ADDRESS_298301] been associated with ASA use: • “Elevated hepatic enzymes, blood nitrogen, urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and prolonged bleeding time.” The following adverse reactions have been noted to occur with ASA use (note that these adverse reactions are usually dose related and more frequently occur at higher doses compared to the 81 mg dose used in this study): • “Body as a Whole: Fever, hypothermia, thirst. • Cardiovascular: Dysrhythmias, hypotension, tachycardia. • Central Nervous System: Agitation, cerebral edema, coma, confusion, dizziness, headache, subdural or intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, seizures. • Fluid and Electrolyte: Dehydration, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, repi[INVESTIGATOR_245034]. • Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, GI bleeding, ulceration and perforation, nausea, vomiting, transient elevations of hepatic enzymes, hepatitis, Reye’s syndrome, pancreatitis. • Hematologic: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia. • Hypersensitivity: Acute anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, urticarial. • Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis. • Metabolism: Hypoglycemia (in children), hyperglycemia. • Reproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding. • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]: Hyperpnea, pulmonary edema, tachypnea. • Special Senses: Hearing loss, tinnitus. Patients with higher frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism.  • Urogential: Interstitial nephritis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_59395], proteinuria, renal insufficiency and failure.” These events, should they occur, would constitute expected adverse events.   11.3 Recording/Documentation At each contact [CONTACT_1155], information regarding adverse events will be elicited by [CONTACT_245151].  All events, both expected/unexpected and related/unrelated  will be recorded on a source document. Source documents will include: progress notes, laboratory reports, consult notes, phone call summaries, survey tools and 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 35 of 83 data collection tools. Source documents will be reviewed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_5051]. All reportable adverse events  that are identified will be recorded in CRIMSON. The start date, the stop date, the severity of each reportable event, and the PI’s judgment of the AEs relationship and expectedness to the study agent/intervention will also be recorded in CRIMSON. 11.4 Definitions   Adverse Event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, that includes any abnormal sign symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the research.  Serious adverse event: Any AE that • results in death; • is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); • results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; • results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or • based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse)  Protocol Deviation: Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved study procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non-serious and further characterized as 1. Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the protocol. 2. Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented. 3. Those that are discovered after they occur  Serious Protocol Deviation: A deviation that meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  Non-compliance: The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects. Non-compliance is further characterized as 1. Serious: Non-compliance that a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants b. Decreases potential benefits to participants c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH-HRPP d. Invalidates the study data 2. Continuing: Non-compliance that is recurring 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 36 of 83 3. Minor: Non-compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.   Unanticipated Problem: (UP)Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of the following criteria would be considered a serious UP:  1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or other study documents; and b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 2. related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  Unanticipated problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE): An unanticipated problem that does not fit the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve risk to the subject, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data.  Such events would be considered a non-serious UP. For example, we will report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for study drug.  11.5 Reporting Procedures  11.5.1 Expedited Reporting to the NIAID IRB  Serious and non-serious Unanticipated Problems, deaths, serious deviations, and serious or continuing non-compliance will be reported within 7 calendar days of investigator awareness. Serious Adverse Events that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the research will be reported to the NIAID IRB within 7 calendar days of investigator’s awareness, regardless of expectedness.  11.5.2 Annual Reporting to the NIAID IRB  The following items will be reported to the NIAID IRB in summary at the time of Continuing Review:  - Serious and non-serious unanticipated  - Expected SAEs that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the research - SAEs that are not related to the research - All adverse events, except expected AEs and deaths granted a waiver of reporting - Serious and non-serious protocol deviations - Serious, continuing, and minor non-compliance - Any trends or events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_52567] - Grade 1 AEs will not be reported.

Page 37 of 83 11.6 Reporting of Pregnancy  Pregnancy itself is not an AE. Pregnancies and complications of pregnancies will be reported as information items and in summary at the time of CR. 11.7 Type and Duration of the Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events • The participant will be withdrawn from the study if the AE occurs before drug administration, at the discretion of the principal investigator. • The study drug (both ATV and ASA) will be discontinued immediately if the AE occurs during the treatment phase at the discretion of the investigator. The participant will be followed as necessary throughout the remainder of the study period for safety assessments and labs.  11.8 Modification of Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s) for a Subject If a participant is unable to tolerate ATV or ASA, they  will discontinue study drug and will be withdrawn from study. No dose adjustment will occur during the course of this study. See 11.[ADDRESS_298302]/Cohort A study subject will be discontinued from further Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s) administration for: • Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, other medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject. • Development of any exclusion criteria may be cause for discontinuation. • Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions to the study drug, including myalgia, abdominal pain, and nausea. • Grade 3 elevation of hepatic transaminases that is confirmed by [CONTACT_245152]. • New pregnancy (see Section 6.9). • Development of allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug. • Request by [CONTACT_245153]. • Development of a medical condition that requires administration of the following prohibited concomittent medications: o Systemic corticosteroids o Daily NSAIDs 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 38 of 83 o Immunomodulating medication • Subject is judged to be at risk of failing to adhere to the study provisions to such a degree that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the integrity of the study results might become compromised. For all subjects withdrawn from study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245035]-up visits that include safety laboratory tests. 11.[ADDRESS_298303] of statins and ASA on the biomarkers related to inflammation, the coagulation cascade and on cellular markers of activation, we hypothesize that both EC and ART <50 will exhibit reductions in biomarkers and cellular markers of activation and could be grouped for the purposes of the primary end point analysis.  13.2 Sample Size Justification   Those who died in the SMART study had a baseline median sCD14 level of 2.47 µg/mL (IQR 2.19 – 2.91), while matched controls had lower levels at 2.23 µg/mL (IQR 2.01 -2.63).  We powered our study to exhibit a similar effect size.   Assuming a mean of 2.45 µg/mL and a standard deviation of 0.45 µg/mL observed in ART treated subjects in the SMART study (personal communication [CONTACT_245174]) and a correlation coefficient of 0.71 (personal communication [CONTACT_245174] and [CONTACT_245175]), a trial with a total of 40 patients (per treatment arm) has a power of 95% (with type I error of 0.[ADDRESS_298304], two-sided) for detecting a 0.20 difference in sCD14 levels between Month 3 and Month 12 visits. This power reduces to 
EC and Immune Activation, V 15 SEPTEMBER 21, 2018  
Page 39 of 83 74% when N = 20 and we consider each randomization arm within each group separately (a secondary end point). 13.3 Safety Analysis  Descriptive statistics with a summary of AEs will be completed at the end of study. 13.4 Planned Interim Analyses  There will be no interim analysis. 13.5   Efficacy Analysis The primary endpoint will be set as a change in sCD14 after 9 months of treatment with ASA or ATV, in ECs and in Treated Progressors (ART <50) combined. Assuming 40 patients enroll in each treatment arm, with a mean sCD14 of 2.45 µg/mL and a standard deviation of 0.45 µg/mL, the study has 95% power to detect a reduction of 0.20 in sCD14 levels (See Section 13.2) after 9 months of treatment. The significance of paired differences within each group will be evaluated using two-sided nonparametric (one-sample signed rank) test. As discussed above, this power decreases to 74% when treatment arms are compared individually within each group (as a secondary endpoint, see below). Adjustment for differences in CD4, age and smoking status will be done in any between group (EC vs ART<50) comparisons. Secondary endpoints, including group comparisons (ASA vs statin and EC vs ART<50) of changes in biomarkers and T cell activation, cardiovascular disease prevalence, and changes in plasma viremia will be evaluated  using  two-sided nonparametric (Wilcoxon rank-sum) tests. Exploratory analyses comparing paired differences of carotid IMT thickness at Month 0 and Month 12 within each group will be assessed by [CONTACT_1192]-sided nonparametric (one-sample signed rank) tests. Associations between continuous variables (MR measurements and biomarks and cellular activation markers ) will be assessed using Spearman rank order correlation coefficients. Linear regression models will be used to control for factors such as age, smoking, and inflammatory biomarkers.  For all evaluations, type I error will be set at 0.05. 14 ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 14.[ADDRESS_298305]'s involvement in the research.

Patients who require a large reduction inLDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 to 80 mg oncedaily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting doseand maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal oftherapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levelsshould be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age)The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (dosesgreater than [ADDRESS_298325] not been studied in this patient population).

In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence ofteratogenicity. ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM TABLETS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARINGAGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TQ CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THEPOTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, atorvastatin calcium tablets should be discontinuedimmediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].4.4 Nursing mothersIt is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk; however a small amount of another drug in this class does pass intobreast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require atorvastatincalcium tablets treatment should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)J.[ADDRESS_298330] been reported with atorvastatincalcium tablets and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development ofrhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction withincreases in creative phosphokinase (CPK) values > [ADDRESS_298331]. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certaindrugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increasesthe risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statinuse. IMNM is characterized by: [CONTACT_245159], which persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_245050]; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement withimmunosuppressive agents.Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation ofCPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by[CONTACT_245160]. Atorvastatin therapy shouldbe discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fabric acidderivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors,including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, andfosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin and fabric acidderivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], darunavir plus ritonavir,fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh thepotential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness,particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting andmaintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see DrugInteractions (7)). Periodic creative phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is noassurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [see also Dosage and Administration (2. ~, DrugInteractions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolationwere seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 1 l weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day.The l20 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0-24hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each. of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 1 l times (mouse) and 8 to 16times (rat) the human AUC (0-24) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day.CNS vascular lesions, characterized by [CONTACT_245161], edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces,have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class.

The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke wassimilar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatalhemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%).

The incidence of non-fatalhemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebogroup (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased riskfor hemorrhagic stroke [7 (16%) atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 2 (4%) placebo].There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 216 (9.1%) in the atorvastatin calciumtablets 80 mg/day group vs. 211 (8.9%) in the placebo group. The proporkions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death werenumerically smaller in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (4.1%).

Because these reactionsare reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish acausal relationship to drug exposure.Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless ofcausality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme,Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]), rhabdomyolysis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepaticfailure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis.There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions(S.1)].There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment,confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious,and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of3 weeks).6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 10-17 years)Ina 26-week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n=140, 31%female; 92% Caucasians, 1.6%Blacks, 1.6%Asians,4.8%other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo[see Clinical Studies (14.6) and Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4)].7 DRUG INTERACTIONSThe risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, anditraconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4: Atorvastatin is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4. Concomitant administration ofatorvastatin calcium tablets with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Theextent of interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4.Clarithromycin: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets. alone [see ClinicalPharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20mg [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (S. 1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)j.Combination of Protease Inhibitors: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration ofatorvastatin calcium tablets with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitortelaprevir, compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, in patients takingthe HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of atorvastatincalcium tablets should be avoided. Inpatients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], caution should be usedwhen prescribing atorvastatin calcium tablets and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV proteaseinhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose ofatorvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see Warnings and Precautions, SkeletalMuscle (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Inpatients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis Cprotease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring isrecommended.

Page 62 of 83   ltraconazole: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets 40mg and itraconazole 200 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, in patients taking itraconazole, caution should beused when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (S. 1) and Dosage andAdministration (2.6)].7.2 Grapefruit Juice: Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations ofatorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (>1.21iters per day).7.3 Cyclosporine: Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATPI[INVESTIGATOR_245052]. Inhibitors of the OATPI[CONTACT_35978](e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitantadministration of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tabletsalone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with cyclosporine should be avoided[see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (S.1)].7.4 Gemfibrozil: Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are co-administeredwith gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see Warnings andPrecautions (5.1)].7.5 Other Fibrates: Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors isincreased with concurrent administration of other fibrates, atorvastatin calcium tablets should be administered with caution when usedconcomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].7.6 Niacin: The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when atorvastatin calcium tablets are used in combination withniacin; a reduction in atorvastatin calciwn tablets dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions (S.1)].7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets withinducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with rifampin isrecommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significantreduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.7.8 Digoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxinconcentrations increased by [CONTACT_3450] 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.7.9 Oral Contraceptives: Co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values fornorethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral.contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.7.10 Warfarin: Atorvastatin calcium tablets had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time when administered to patientsreceiving chronic warfarin treatment.7.11 Colchicine: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered withcolchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine.[ADDRESS_298341] been rare reports of congenital.anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposedto other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed the rateexpected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude athree-to-four-fold increased risk of congenitalanomalies over background incidence. In 89% of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the firsttrimester when pregnancy was identified.

Page 63 of 83   Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma. Atorvastatin was notteratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses resulted in multiples of about30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mg/mz) [see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3)J.In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg/day, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreasedpup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mg/kg/day. Body weight was decreased ondays 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mg/kg/day; pub body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 9l at 225mg/kg/day. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mg/kg/day and acoustic startle at 225 mg/kg/day; pi[INVESTIGATOR_245053]-opening at 225 mg/kg/day). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mg/kg) and 22 times (225 mg/kg) the humanAUC at 80 mg/day.Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be administered to womenof childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. Ifthe woman becomes pregnant while taking atorvastatin, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to thepotential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.8.3 Nursing MothersIt is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk, but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breastmilk. Nursing rat pups had plasma and liver drug levels of 50% and 40%, respectively, of that in their mother's milk. Animal breastmilk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk andbecause statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring atorvastatin treatment should beadvised not to nurse their infants [see Contraindications (4)].8.[ADDRESS_298342] been evaluated in acontrolled clinical trial of 6 months' duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, andother reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greatersensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (>_65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy,atorvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the elderly.8.6 Hepatic ImpairmentAtorvastatin calcium tablets are contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistentelevations in hepatic transaminase levels [see Contraindications (4) and Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].10 OVERDOSAGEThere is no specific treatment for atorvastatin overdosage. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically,and supportive measures instituted as required. Due to extensive drug binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected tosignificantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.11 DESCRIPTION

Page 64 of 83  Atorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A(HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step incholesterol biosynthesis.Atorvastatin calcium is [R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-f3, S-dihydroxy-5-(1-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-1H-pyrrole-l-heptanoic acid, calcium salt (2:1) trihydrate.

C`O~~~82~• 3F{z02Atorvastatin calcium is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatincalcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile; slightly soluble in ethanol; and freelysoluble in methanol.Atorvastatin calcium tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following inactive ingredients:calcium carbonate, USP; candelilla wax, FCC; croscarmellose sodium, NF; hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF; lactose monohydrate, NF;magnesium stearate, NF; microcrystalline cellulose, NF; Opadry White YS-1-7040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titaniumdioxide); polysorbate 80, NF; simethicone emulsion.12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY12.1 Mechanism of ActionAtorvastatin calcium is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in thebloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (high-density lipoprotein),IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) fractions.Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheraltissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the high-affinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologicstudies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (apo B)promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_245055], while increased levels of HDL-C areassociated with a decreased cardiovascular risk.In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by [CONTACT_245163]-CoA reductase and cholesterol.synthesis in the liver and by [CONTACT_245164]; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. Atorvastatin reduces LDL-C in some patients withhomozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipid-lowering medication(s).A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, LDL-C, and apo B (a membrane complex for LDL-C)promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with thedevelopment of atherosclerosis. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_245056]-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial forms ofhypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. Atarvastatin also reduces VLDL-C and TG and produces variable increases in HDL-Cand apolipoprotein A-1. Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and increases HDL-C inpatients with isolated hypeririglyceridemia. Atorvastatin reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) in patients withdysbetalipoproteinem ia.Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and remnants,can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDLparticles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not

The liver is the primary site of actionand the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlatesbetter with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see Dosage andAdministration (2)].12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorption: Atorvastatin calcium tablets are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89385]; maximum. plasma concentrations occur within1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin calcium dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin(parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism.Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by [CONTACT_3450] 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_245165], LDL-C reduction is similar whether atorvastatin calcium tablets are given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatinconcentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning.However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration [see Dosage and Administration (2)].Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is >98%bound to plasma proteins.A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats,atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk [see Contraindications, Nursing Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations,Nursing Mothers (8.3)].Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products.In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by [CONTACT_245166]- and parahydroxylated metaboBtes is equivalent to that of atorvastatin.Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studiessuggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations ofatorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions(7.1)]. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism;however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humansis approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution. ofactive metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is recovered in urine following oral administration.Specific PopulationsGeriatric: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cm~ and 30% for AUC) in healthy elderlysubjects (age >65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of drug in theelderly patient population compared to younger adults [see Use in Speciftc Populations, Geriatric Use (8. S)].Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.Gender: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in women differ from those in men (approximately 20%higher for Cmax and 10%lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with atorvastatin between men and women.Renal Impairment: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, doseadjusrinent in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Dosage and Administration, Dosage in Patients with RenalImpairment (2.5), Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (S.1)].Hemodialysis: While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected tosignificantly enhance clearance of atorvastatin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.Hepatic Impairment: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased.Cmax and AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16-fold and 11-foldincreased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Contraindications (4.1)].TABLE 3.

This dose represents a plasma AUC (0-24)value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose.A 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day resulted in a significant increase in liver adenomas in high-dose males and liver carcinomas in high-dose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (0-24) values of approximately 6times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose.In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation: the Ames test withSalmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and thechromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mg/kg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasiaand aspermia in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_245057] 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC atthe 80 mg dose); testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mg/kg and epi[INVESTIGATOR_245058] 100 mg/kg. Malerats given 100 mg/kg/day for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increasedabnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs givendoses of 10, 40, or 120 mg/kg for two years.14 CLINICAL STUDIES14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular DiseaseIn the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of atorvastatin on fatal and non-fatal. coronary heart diseasewas assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 40-80 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction andwith TC levels <251 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L). Additionally, all patients had ~t least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors: malegender (81.1%), age >55 years (84.5%), smoking (33.2%), diabetes (24.3%), history of CHD in afirst-degree relative (26%), TC:HDL>6 (14.3%), peripheral vascular disease (5.1%), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4%), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8%), specificECG abnormality (143%), proteinuria/albuminuria (62.4%). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated withanti-hypertensive therapy (Goal BP <140/90 mm Hg for non-diabetic patients; <130/80 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated toeither atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=5168) or placebo (n=5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took intoaccount the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of thosecharacteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.[ADDRESS_298353] of 10 mg/day of atorvastatin calcium tablets on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials.Atorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of coronary events [either fata.} coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs.40 events in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group) or non-fatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the atorvastatincalcium tablets goup)] with a relative risk reduction of 36% [(based on incidences of 1.9% for atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 3.0%for placebo), p=0.0005 (see Figure 1)]. The risk reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence ofrenal dysfunction. The effect of atorvastatin was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results forwomen. were inconclusive.

Although the reduction of fatal andnon-fatal strokes did not reach apre-defined significance level (p=0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26%relative riskreduction (incidences of 1.7% for atorvastatin calcium tablets and 2.3%for placebo). There was no significant difference between thetreatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p=0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p=0.17).In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of atorvastatin on cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints wasassessed in 2838 subjects (94% white, 68%male), ages 40-75 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history ofcardiovascular disease and with LDL < 160 mg/dL and TG <_ 600 mg/dL. In addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of thefollowing risk factors: current smoking (23%), hypertension (80%), retinopathy (30%), or microalbutninuria (9%) ormacroalbuminuria (3%). No subjects on hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blindclinical trial, subjects were randomly allocated to either atorvastatin calcium tablets l0 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 1:1ratio and were followed for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the majorcardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primaryanalysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint.Baseline characteristics of subjects were: mean age of 62 years, mean HbA,~ 7.7%; median LDL-C 120 mg/dL; median TC207 mg/dL; median TG 151 mg/dL; median HDL-C 52 mg/dL.The effect of atorvastatin 10 mg/day on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials.Atorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the atorvastatincalcium tablets group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37%, HR 0.63, 95% CI (0.48, 0.83)(p=0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of atorvastatin calcium tablets was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels.Atorvastatin significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48% (21 events in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group vs. 39 events in theplacebo group), HR 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.89) (p=0.016) and reduced the risk of Mi by 42% (38 events in the atorvastatin calcium.tablets group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1 % CI (0.39, 0.86) (p=0.007). There was no significant differencebetween the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death.There were 6] deaths in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p=0.059).

The mean LDL-C reduction in this study was 18%. Twenty-five patients with a reductionin LDL-C had a mean response of 20% (range of 7% to 53%, median of 24%); the remaining 4 patients had 7% to 24% increases inLDL-C. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDL-receptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had nosignificant reduction in LDL-C. The remaining 3receptor-negative patients had a mean LDL-C reduction of 22%.14.6 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric PatientsIn adouble-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by [CONTACT_3440]-label phase, l87 boys and postmenarchal girls 10-17 years of age(mean age 1.4.1. years) with heterorygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized toatorvastatin calcium tablets (n=140) or placebo (n=47) for 26 weeks and then all received atorvastatin calcium tablets for 26 weeks.Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDL-C level >_ 190 mg/dL or 2) a baseline LDL-C level >_ 160 mg/dL and positive familyhistory of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or second-degree relative. The mean baseline LDL-C valuewas 218.6 mg/dL (range: 138.5-385.0 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group compared to 230A mg/dL (range: 160.4-324.5mg/dL) in the placebo group. The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets (once daily) was [ADDRESS_298358] 4 weeks and uptitrated to20 mg if the LDL-C level was > 130 mg/dL. The number of atorvastatin calcium tablets-treated patients who required uptitration to 20mg after Week 4 during the double-blind phase was 80 (57.1%).Atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of total-C, LDI.-C, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26-week double-blind phase (see Table ] 0).TABLE 10.

4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
4.1 Disease/Condition
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a field-based therapy with well-documented clinical 
efficacy in the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and its precursor 
lesions, i.e., actinic keratosis (AK) and Bowen’s disease (BD) [1-3]. There are three 
major components of PDT: a photosensitizer (PS), a light source, and oxygen. 
Individually each component is not toxic, but combined they initiate a photochemical 
reaction which generates singlet oxygen. In turn, this reactive oxygen species can 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_841466] [4].
IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/06/2017IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
Version 4.0 – 10/12/2017 84.2 Investigational Intervention
There are two types of PSs employed in PDT, systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [5]. In dermatology, 
PDT is primarily delivered through the use of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_841467] 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 
or its methylated ester, methyl aminolevulinate (MAL). Only ALA is currently available in 
the [LOCATION_003] and FDA approved, while MAL is used in Europe and Canada. Both ALA and 
MAL are precursors in the heme biosynthesis and act as prodrugs in the skin, and get 
converted into photoactivatable porphyrins, including protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) [1]. The 
excitability of these molecules coupled with their tumor-localizing properties 
underscores their utility as PS agents [6]. Importantly, none of the clinically approved 
PDs accumulate in cell nuclei, limiting their carcinogenic potential [4].
In terms of light sources, there are two types: lasers and non-laser. Non-laser light 
sources include light-emitting diode (LED) arrays and blue light fluorescent tubes which 
are widely commercially available for PDT.  Only blue light is currently FDA approved 
for use with PDT. 
4.3 Preclinical Experience
PDT in Organ Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (OTR)
Clinical applications for the use of PDT that have shown successful outcomes include 
actinic keratosis (AK), Bowen’s disease (BD), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). OTRs 
are at significant risk for the development of NMSC. They have between a 65- and 200-
fold increased risk for the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and a 10-
fold increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_841468] [7-10]. These 
patients are also at increased risk for the development of precancerous lesions 
including AK and BD, with AKs demonstrating a greater propensity toward malignant 
transformation into invasive SCC [9, 11]. Overall, NMSC and its precursor lesions tend 
to be more numerous, diffusely located, recurrent, and aggressive in OTRs compared to 
immunocompetent patients [12-17]. Not surprisingly, cutaneous malignancy is therefore 
the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this immunosuppressed patient 
population. Given this significant disease burden, a great deal of interest has focused 
on the treatment and prevention of NMSC in OTRs. As a convenient and economical 
field-based therapy capable of treating large areas or multiple lesions simultaneously 
with excellent cosmetic outcomes, the use PDT has been explored as both a primary 
modality for and in prevention of NMSC, and its precursors, in the OTR population.
Prevention of NMSC and Precursors
The multiplicity and widespread involvement of NMSC and precursor lesions seen in 
OTRs have spawned a great deal of interest in exploring the effectiveness of PDT for 
prevention of premalignant and malignant lesions in OTRs. Preclinical studies have 
substantiated this interest, with PDT demonstrating a significant preventative effect in 
UV-related photocarcinogenesis when delivered to accepted murine models for both 
SCC and BCC development [18-21].

Version 4.0 – 10/12/2017 94.4 Clinical Experience
Wulf and colleagues showed in their intra patient randomized study, a single session of 
MAL-PDT was delivered to 27 renal transplant patients with AKs and other skin lesions 
and subsequently compared to an untreated contralateral control area of similar size. 
Overall, the average time to occurrence for new lesions was significantly longer in the 
treated areas with a larger percentage of these areas remaining lesion-free after 12 
months compared to untreated [22]. A similar, proof-of-concept, study examining the 
use of PDT in cancer prevention was also conducted in immunocompetent patients by 
[CONTACT_841508]. Utilizing a split-face, placebo- controlled study evaluating a PDT 
field treatment of facial AKs, they were also able to show a significant delay in the 
appearance of new AK lesions in PDT-treated regions after 6 months [23, 24].
Continued use of PDT for prevention of NMSC and precursors in OTR has been 
documented with some success in small case series and randomized trials with varied 
protocols. De Graaf and colleagues were the first to examine the effect of PDT on the 
development of new SCCs with a large randomized intra patient controlled trial. In this 
study, 1–2 sessions of blue light ALA-PDT were given to a randomly selected forearm 
and hand of 40 OTRs, and SCC occurrence was subsequently compared to the 
contralateral untreated forearm and hand [25]. After 1 year of follow-up, there was a 
trend in favor of PDT reducing the occurrence of SCC; however, no significant 
difference was observed at 2 years. No debulking of lesions was performed prior to 
PDT. In a similarly structured study, Wennberg et al. delivered two sessions of MAL-
PDT with red light over 2 weeks at study inception with single treatment follow-ups at 3, 
9, and 15 months to 81 OTRs [26]. At 3 months, MAL-PDT was shown to significantly 
reduce the occurrence of new skin lesions, primarily AKs; however, the significance of 
this effect was again lost at [ADDRESS_1169092] recently, Willey and colleagues treated 12 OTRs with cyclic ALA-PDT every 4–8 
weeks for 2 years [27]. They found a 79% decrease in new SCC/BD at 12 months and a 
95% decrease compared to baseline at 24 months. Of note, baseline occurrence in this 
study was defined as the number of SCCs developed during the previous 12–[ADDRESS_1169093]-Bo et al [28] found that repeated PDT sessions in renal transplant patients 
could serve as primary prevention for skin dysplasia. In their randomized controlled trial, 
15 patients with clinically normal skin received PDT red light at inclusion and at 6 month 
intervals. PDT significantly delayed the onset of AK compared to untreated areas. They 
observed AK in 63% of patients in untreated skin compared to 28% in PDT treated skin 
at 3 years. 
These findings are further supported by [CONTACT_644558], which mirror the clinical 
response, showing that PDT can reverse or reduce field cancerization but that one 
single dose is not sufficient to achieve these results [29,30]. For example, 
Bagazgoitia and colleagues have shown that two or more treatments of PDT can

Version 4.0 – 10/12/2017 10delay the appearance of AKs, reduce histological features of actinic damage, and 
decrease expression of early markers of carcinogenesis such as K1-67 and p53 
[29]. Sun-damaged skin has a higher baseline expression level of p53 than non-sun-
damaged skin, and p53 and p53 family members may be important mediators of cell 
death signaling in photodynamic therapy of cancer [32].  This again underscores the 
need for repeated PDT sessions with vigilant follow-up when using this field therapy 
for cancer prevention. In addition, karyometric analysis has been used successfully 
to detect nuclear changes from sun-damaged skin to actinic keratosis to squamous 
cell carcinoma, and to provide sensitive, quantitative method to assess the efficacy 
of prevention interventions [33-36].
Associated Risks
Pain is by [CONTACT_24691], and limiting, adverse event associated with PDT. Pain 
most often occurs early during illumination. Standard methods to decrease pain include 
the use of fans and the use of non-contact [CONTACT_841509].  
Given the larger size, number, and involvement of lesions, pain is often significantly 
greater in the OTR population, especially in field cancerization areas such as the head 
and scalp [10, 31]. Several, well-studied, pain-relieving techniques are available to 
complement the delivery of PDT including use of cooling fans, intra lesional anesthetics, 
nerve blocks, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and modified irradiance 
treatment. In addition, if the cooling alone is not sufficient and pain is moderate to 
severe (VAS>6-7), very brief interruption in illumination can be done.  Daylight PDT has 
also been reported to have little to no treatment related pain. 
SORT are especially at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_841469], aggressive or metastatic SCC, with 
an associated high morbidity and mortality rate.  Prevention studies have typi[INVESTIGATOR_841470]. The current 
protocol involves early prevention of SCC development with field therapy in high risk 
patients who have only recently been transplanted. The proposed intervention would be 
an essential benefit that could be implemented in the early overall management of these 
patients, and may contribute to an improved long term quality of life.

11.4 Process to implement study closure when significant risks or benefits are 
identified
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_841488]. 
11.5 Description of adverse events and reporting procedures
ADVERSE EVENTS: An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product. 
Any and all adverse events will be recorded on the UACC adverse events record form 
and reviewed by [CONTACT_079].
All adverse events will be classified using either the MedDRA term or NCI Common 
CTCAE version 4.02 and will address:
Grade
Relationship to study drug (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definitely) 
Causality other than study drug (disease related, concomitant medication related, 
intercurrent illness, other)  
Date of onset, date of resolution
Frequency of event (single, intermittent, continuous)
Event outcome (resolved, ongoing, death)
Action taken (none, held, dose reduced, discontinued, medication given)
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at 
any dose: 
1) Results in death; 
2) Is life-threatening;
3) Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89019]; 
4) Results in disability persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or:
5) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/06/2017IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
Version 4.0 – 10/12/2017 19Note: A SAE may also be an important medical event, in the view of the investigator 
that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above.
All serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported 
within 24 hours of notification of the event to the sponsor and DSMB Coordinator. All 
serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported within 
5 days of notification of the event to the University of Arizona Human Subjects 
Protection Program. 
All serious adverse events will be processed by [CONTACT_841513]. The DSMB 
coordinator will review the SAE reporting process to confirm reporting requirements are 
met.
11.6 Plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance
Routine study activity and safety information will be reported to the DSMB every six 
months, or more frequently if requested. These reports will include:
Study activity, cumulative and for the period under review;
Safety (narrative description on non-serious and serious adverse events, protocol 
pre-determined early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109595]-emergent adverse 
events);
Predetermined protocol early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89020]/futility; 
Status of study in relationship to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004];  
Current dose level of study agent; 
Routine monitoring and protocol compliance (describe the monitoring process and 
identify the status of the monitoring);
Comments; 
Attachments (AE data reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_89021], SAE letters and 
reports, results of any review(s), applicable correspondence with the IRB or other 
regulatory agencies.
Data, safety and study progress will be reported to:
Human Subjects Protection Program (IRB) at least annually;
Sponsor (if applicable) at least every six months.
11.7 Identification of the sponsor or funding agency, as applicable
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_89022]; in writing, the funding agency, if applicable, any action 
resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of the study.  A copy of this 
correspondence will also be forwarded to the DSMB and the SRC.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/06/2017IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
Version 4.0 – 10/12/2017 20Not Applicable.
13. QUALITY ASSURANCE MEASURES
Per the UACC DSMB Charter, Internal Ad Hoc audits may be performed on any UACC 
clinical trial if identified for audit, the audit will be conducted by [CONTACT_841514]. A QA/QC representative will coordinate the audit team 
functions and a written audit report will be provided to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_392294].
14. RECIST CRITERIA
Not Applicable.
15. REMOVAL OF SUBJECTS
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. If this 
occurs, the investigator, or designee, is to discuss with the subject the safe and 
appropriate processes for discontinuation from the investigational treatment.
The investigator or designee must document the change in status of the subject’s 
participation in the study and as applicable, the level of follow up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_1560] (i.e. agrees to follow up exams, adverse event review, but not to further 
treatment and/or procedures). 
Subject withdrawal of consent for a study indicates that the subject does not wish to 
receive further protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882], and the subject does not wish 
to, or is unable to continue further study participation. Subject data only up to the time 
when consent is withdrawn will be included in the analysis of the study. 
The study is expected to close after all patients have been treated for [ADDRESS_1169107] statistics, 
including frequency, proportion and 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval (CI) for 
the proportion for categorical variables, median, and range for continuous variables. 
Evaluable subjects for safety outcome measures will be those who complete any study 
visits or those who discontinue the study treatments due to adverse events (AE). 
Evaluable subjects for efficacy outcome measures will be those who complete all study 
visits.  At least 15-16 evaluable subjects for each of these analyses are expected. 
Primary efficacy outcome measure will be the difference in the total number of 
AK/NMSC in the treatment areas compared to the control areas.  All unique AK/NMSC 
IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/06/2017IRB NUMBER: PHXB-16-0142-80-15
Version 4.0 – 10/12/[ADDRESS_1169108].
 
Secondary safety and efficacy measure:  Time to the occurrence of the first AK/NMSC 
in the control versus treated areas will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate.  
Changes in the p53 staining from baseline to end of treatment will be evaluated using 
McNemar’s Test. Mean pain scores (VAS) and photo damage scale global scores of the 
study population will be compared with each respectively using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank 
Test. 
Sample Size Determination: Safety will be evaluated using a one-sided confidence 
interval (as the lower bound is not of interest).  At least fourteen patients will be 
evaluable for safety.  If none of the patients have an adverse primary safety outcome, 
the upper bound of a 95% one-sided confidence interval is < 20%.   
17. ANALYSIS
17.1 Safety Analysis
The primary safety outcome measures will be estimated with 95% Clopper-Pearson CI: 
The proportion of evaluable study participants who had a grade 3 or higher AE or any 
serious adverse event that's determined to be at least possibly or probably related to 
study treatment, or any AE which is at least possibly or probably related to study 
treatment that causes permanent study discontinuation. AE’s will be documented and 
kept in the study regulatory binder and in OnCore.
Pain will be assessed on the 10 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), as mild (0-3), 
moderate (4-7) or severe (8-10). Patients will be asked to rate the pain at the beginning, 
midway point (approximately 8 minutes later), and at the end of each PDT session.
17.2 Efficacy Analysis 
Number of AK/NMSC will be counted for each site using the photographs of the 
treatment and the control areas.  AKs will be graded by [CONTACT_841515] I-III: I = mild, slightly 
palpable, II = moderate, easily felt, III= severe, very thick. NMSC, including basal cell 
carcinoma, Bowen’s disease and squamous cell carcinoma, will be diagnosis and 
confirmed histologically by [CONTACT_9256]. 
Photo damage in the treatment and control fields will be assessed by [CONTACT_841516]:  absent, mild, moderate, and severe. The scale includes 4 points: fine 
wrinkling, coarse wrinkling, abnormal pi[INVESTIGATOR_841489] (0-10). Ratings for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_841490] p53 staining of skin 
biopsies in the treatment areas at baseline and after the last treatment.

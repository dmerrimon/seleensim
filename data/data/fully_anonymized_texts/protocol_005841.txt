An observational pi[INVESTIGATOR_251053]: March 27, 2025  
 
  Background & Rationale  
Population -based studies from a range of countries show that a majority of adults will experience 
a traumatic event at some point in their life (Benjet et al., 2016; Burri & Maercker, 2014) and many of 
these experiences – such as sexual assault, combat exp erience, or actual or threatened injury – are known 
triggers for post -traumatic stress disorder (Kessler et al., 2017). PTSD is defined by a cluster of 
phenomena that include alterations in brain -body patterns of arousal and reactivity which can manifest i n 
irritability and aggression, hypervigilance, which may be caused or maintained by [CONTACT_251064] -responsive 
tuning of the autonomic nervous system (Kolacz, Kovacic, & Porges, 2019). The Safe and Sound 
Protocol (SSP) is a passive acoustic intervention that is des igned as a “neural exercise” to promote 
efficient regulation of autonomic state. Prior research has shown that the SSP can improve autonomic 
function, auditory hypersensitivities, and emotion regulation in individuals with Autism Spectrum 
Disorders (Porges  et al., 2013; 2014). Though used by [CONTACT_251065][INVESTIGATOR_251054], there are 
currently no published studies to document its efficacy for PTSD symptoms or comorbidities. This 
current observational pi[INVESTIGATOR_251055] d trial to test the utility of the SSP for trauma treatment.  
Study Procedures  
All participants, regardless of study arm, will be recruited from the pool of Spencer Psychology clients 
who are actively receiving psychotherapy. Participants will continue to receive weekly or bi -weekly 
psychotherapy during the course of the study. In both arms, participants complete surveys that assess 
PTSD symptoms  (PCL -5), anxiety symptoms  (GAD -7), and, autonomic symptoms  (BPQ)  over the course 
of 4 timepoints . 
 
 
Psychotherapy + SSP Arm  
After having received an email from the potential subject indicating interest in participation, 
subjects will be screened online via email to ensure they meet eligibility criteria for the study. If 
client meets eligibility criteria for study, they will be contact[CONTACT_426] a research assistant to schedule 
their first visit prior to beginning the SSP. Participants will be given an option of either 
scheduling a session at an Indiana University laboratory building or at Spencer Psychology, 
where they receive therap y.  
When the participant arrives, they will complete a standard COVID -[ADDRESS_305300] the participant read the consent on their own, and answer any questions. If 
client consents, data collection will begin.  
The participant will complete a set of surveys self -reporting demographics, comorbidities, and 
psychological well being via Qualtrics on a laptop provided by [CONTACT_3021] (~15 minutes). The 
RA will then guide the participant through physiological data co llection using the iom2  ear clip . 
Participants will be given instructions on how to put on the earlobe sensor, which attaches via an 
 
 ear clip. To stabilize the iom2 cable, an additional clip may be used to attach the iom2 to clothing, 
waist, or it would be secured on a lab -provided shoulder holster. Once sensor is in place, a 
researcher will connect the iom2 device to a laptop and begin  recording.  
The participant will then be cued by a video to move into 3 postures for 3 minutes each: lying 
down on a cot, sitting up, and standing. After the final posture, the participant will be instructed 
to remove the measurement device. The device, the cot, and t he chair will be sterilized after use 
with soap and water or other cleaner.  
At completion of the first visit, participants will be provided the first $[ADDRESS_305301] 1 week after their final 
listening session. If start date is unknown, the participant will be contact[CONTACT_99017] 3 weeks about 
scheduling visit 2.  
SSP Sessions  and Data Collection   
The Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) will be delivered with 5 hours of increasing frequency 
modulation over time, as used in prior studies (Porges et al., 2013; 2014), using a phone -based 
app. Participants will have a choice of 2 music playlists, one that fea tured popular adult 
contemporary music and one that primarily featured music from children’s movies. Frequency 
filtering will be applied to playlists using the Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) using an algorithm 
to alternate narrowing and expanding the range of acoustic frequencies over time, with the 
alternations intensifying in frequency range over the course of the music tracks. The filtering is 
optimized for the frequency response of adult human hearing and intended to mimic the 
expression of the human voi ce around a central set of frequencies of 800 -1200 Hz. The results of 
the filtering method are similar to adjusting the treble and bass settings on a stereo system while 
music is playing; the melody and instruments can still be heard, but the highest and l owest pi[INVESTIGATOR_251056]. Music listening will be conducted with high -fidelity, closed -back, over -
the-ear headphones while seated. The headphones had a flat frequency response to accurately 
reproduce music frequencies.  The sessions will aim for [ADDRESS_305302] a 
distraction -free space and/or over -the-ear headphones at hom e 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_251057]. Spencer Psychology will provide these portions of the 
session notes to the research team. Researchers will not hav e access to any additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_251058].  
Visit 2.  The week after the client completes their 5th hour of SSP, a second assessment will be 
scheduled. As part of this assessment, the client will complete the survey post assessment on the 
laptop (~10 minutes) and pulse data collection using the iom2 during supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting, and standing 
postures. Upon co mpletion, the participant will schedule their [ADDRESS_305303] appointment. They 
will then receive their second $[ADDRESS_305304] assessment on the laptop (~10 minutes) and pulse data 
 
 collection using the iom2 during a supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -sit-stand challenge using the same procedures as 
previous visits. They will then receive their third $[ADDRESS_305305], and another $[ADDRESS_305306] if they’ve completed all three assessments.  
Data collection from Spencer Psychology medical records.  
The study team will receive medical records from Spencer Psychology. Spencer Psychology has a 
secure, internal database that Spencer Psychology staff will program to output required 
information. Unique study IDs will be assigned to participants and medical  records will be 
exported and stored with these IDs, not with the names of the participants. We will collect the 
following information from medical records:  Gender , Birth date , Intake and treatment 
information (date, diagnosis, therapy goals, medication us e), session information during SSP 
administration information  (length of use during session) , mood and cognitive features during the 
visit, Changes in treatment objectives, goals, and diagnosis , Clinician comments on visit . 
 
Treatment as Usual (Psychotherapy Only)  
 
If they are interested in participation, they will contact [CONTACT_251066]. The study team will send out a link to a screener survey that contains the 
PCL-[ADDRESS_305307] survey, which will ask about  demographic information ; 
email address for follow up surveys ; caffeine, alcohol, nicotine use ; medication use ; therapy 
history ; PTSD, anxiety, and autonomic symptoms. The survey will close with a statement 
describing the timing of their next assessments when they will receive the email invitation to 
complete their next survey, who to contact [CONTACT_251067], and that they will 
receive their digital gif t card code via the em ail address they provided in the survey.  
 
After subjects have consented and completed the first survey, the study team will receive the 
following information from Spencer Psychology: gender, intake date , diagnosis , client therapy 
goals . The study team will also receive the following information from session notes for the 
duration of the study: mood and cognitive features during visits , changes in treatment objectives, 
goals, and diagnosis , clinician comments on visits.  
 
Questionnaires that assess PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and, autonomic symptoms  will 
be used for measuring main outcomes.  The timeline of surveys was based on average length of 
SSP listening completion from the SSP+Psychotherapy arm : 
1. Survey 1 (10 -15 minutes)  
2. Survey 2 (5 -10 minutes, 45 days after survey 1)  
3. Survey 3 (5 -10 minutes, 45 days after survey 2)  
4. Survey 4 (5 -10 minutes, 30 days after survey 3)  
  
 
 
 Incentives  
Participants in the music listening group were compensated up to a total of $125: a $[ADDRESS_305308] for each 
lab visit and corresponding survey, and an additional $[ADDRESS_305309] for completing all the assessments. 
Participants in the treatment as usual group were compensated up to $50: a $[ADDRESS_305310] for each of the 4 
surveys they completed, with an additional $[ADDRESS_305311] exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_251059] a large randomized study in the future. 
Due to the novel nature of the research question there is no prior data to inform power analysis. Results 
from this small study will be used for po wer estimates for the upcoming planned randomized study. All 
efforts will be made to avoid missing data. Research assistants will track potential reasons for missing 
data in order to strengthen procedures in the follow up study and reduce missing values. Quality 
assurance steps for data collection will include: Monthly meetings with RAs to visualize and review 
incoming data, automated range checks, and comparing redundant items that are included in both medical 
records and self -reports for convergence (e.g. , age). Change over time will be modeled using mixed 
effects modeling with maximum likelihood, which uses all available data on predictors even when some 
values are missing.  Support for non -zero parameters will be  indicated by 95% confidence intervals 
excluding zero. In the SSP+psychotherapy group, earlobe pulse data will be used to quantify inter -beat 
intervals  using automated peak detection with manual  checks for accuracy . These will be analyzed for 
mean heart period and respi[INVESTIGATOR_251060] ( Porges, 1985;

4.1 Introduction
This is a protocol for a human research study. Th is study is being conducted according to US and 
international standards of Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) (Food & Drug Administration [FDA] Title 
21 Part 312 and International Conference on Ha rmonisation [ICH] guidelines), applicable 
government regulations, and Instituti onal research policies and procedures.

(AEDs) are still commonly used, even though they can produce a diversity of serious adverse 
events (SAEs). New AEDs approved since the ear ly 1990s have shown an improved tolerability 
profile. Nonetheless, approximately 30% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_723993], particularly those with partial seizures, 
are refractory to treatment. Many of these patien ts are taking multiple antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006]. It is 
important to understand any interaction that occurs between them as well as the long term safety 
profile of YKP3089 when given as adjunctive therapy.
Choice of add-on (adjunctive) design. The initial evaluation of a new antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_353233] a determination of its efficacy in reduci ng the frequency of seizures in adults who are 
refractory to treatment with other AEDs.2,3,4Because of the risk of exacerbation of seizure severity 
and frequency upon withdrawal of long-term AED therapy, even in the refractory population, the 
new AED under study is added to the existing therapy instead of being used as monotherapy.
Because partial seizures represent the most co mmon type in both adults and children and claim a 
disproportionate share of medically refractory cases, they have been the most frequently selected 
seizure type in the investigation of new AEDs.

4.3.1 YKP3089 Structure
YKP3089 is (R)-(+)-1-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-tetraz ol-2-yl-ethyl ester, which has the chemical 
formula C 10H10Cl N 5.YKP3089 is being provided in tablets that contain 50 or 100 mg of the 
active ingredient. It is a novel small molecule of molecular weight 267.68. Its structure is shown 
inFigure 1.
Figure 1. Structure of YKP3089
YKP3089 is a novel small molecule with open IN Ds for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (76,809), neuropathic pain (IND 
108,178), and anxiety (IND 72,741). It is currently in Phase [ADDRESS_988510] shown that YKP3089 does not show significant activity at any of the 
classical receptor types (eg, adrenergic, GABA ergic) or pharmacologic receptors. However, in 
vitro electrophysiology assays showed YKP3089 to be an inhibitor of the slow inactivated state of 
sodium channels. YKP3089 may also increase inhibito ry synaptic transmission by [CONTACT_724010].

administration of YKP3089 by 67% (C max) and 84% (AUC) and plasma YKP3089 exposure (C max,
AUC) decreased with co-administration of phenyto in by 27 - 28%. Preliminary results of a drug

phenobarbital by 10-15% based on historical controls.
4.4.2 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicity Studies
YKP3089 has been assessed in a large number of safety pharmacology and toxicology studies 
including single-dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity, cardiotoxicity, genetic toxicity, and 
reproductive toxicity studies in animals. Safety ph armacology studies showed that the doses that 
produced beneficial central nervous system (CNS) effects of YKP3089 in animal models do not 
result in obvious negative effect s on the CNS. No evidence of cardiovascular effects was observed 
by [CONTACT_49866]. 
Details of the preclinical safety and toxicit y studies of YKP3089 can be found in the Investigator’s
Brochure. The most common AEs in preclinical studies of YKP3089 involved the central nervous 
system (CNS).
Reproductive toxicity studies showed adverse effects on reproductive performance when the 
dosage of YKP3089 was high enough to induce maternal toxicity, as evidenced by [CONTACT_724011]. However, there was no evidence of teratogenicity.
The results of standard genotoxicity studies of Y KP3089 were negative. There is no evidence of 
carcinogenicity in standard testing of two rodent species.
4.4.[ADDRESS_988511] completed double-blind, ra ndomized, placebo-controlled trial in subjects 
with partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_723994] 200 mg of YKP3089 produced a highly 
statistically significant reduction in the frequenc y of partial onset seizures (Table 2) and seizure 
free rates (Table 3). YKP3089 was generally well-tolerated.  The rate of adverse event withdrawals 
was similar between the YKP3089 a nd placebo groups.  No life threatening serious adverse events 
were identified among YKP3089-treated subj ects. The most common central nervous system 
adverse events in the YKP3089 group were somno lence, dizziness, fatigue, and gait disorder.
The second randomized, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled, dose response trial with a 18 week 
treatment period enrolled a total of 437 subjects , 108 in a 100 mg YKP3089 group, 110 in a 200 
mg YKP3089 group, 111 in a 400 mg YKP3089 group and 109 in a placebo group. The trial 
confirmed that treatment with 200 mg/day and 400mg/day of YKP3089 produces a highly 
statistically significant reduction in the frequency of partial onset seizures in patients with partial 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Table 2) and high seizure free rates (Table 4).

xWhen YKP3089 dosing was increased weekly or faster, the rate of rash/hypersensitivity 
reactions was approximately 5%.  When YK P3089 was increased by 50 mg increments 
every 2 weeks, only one case (0.8%) of hypersensitivity reactions was observed.  
Two cases DRESS occurred when the first dose of YKP3089 was 100 mg (epi[INVESTIGATOR_207204]) or 
200 mg (healthy volunteer) followed by [CONTACT_724012].  The third case, in a healthy volunteer, 
occurred in a study where the initial dose of YKP3089 was 50 mg/day for 1 week followed by 50 
mg weekly increments. 
4.5 Rationale
4.5.1 Study Rationale
Approximately 30% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_353232], particularly those with partial seizures, are refractory to 
treatment. Many of these patients are taking mu ltiple antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006]. It is important to 
understand any interaction that occurs between them  as well as the long term safety profile of 
YKP3089 when given as adjunctive therapy. 
Based on healthy volunteer studies with pheny toin and phenobarbital, YK P3089 increases plasma 
levels of phenobarbital and phenytoin levels. A portion of this open label safety and 
pharmacokinetic study is designed to understan d the impact of adding YKP3089 to an AED 
regimen including either phenytoin or phe nobarbital in subjects with partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].
In addition this open label and pharmacokinetic study will enroll subjects taking concomitant 
AEDs other than phenytoin or phenobarbital to study long term safety and obtain population 
pharmacokinetic data.
A review of the YKP3089 safety  database confirmed three cases of DRESS syndrome among the 
953 subjects exposed to the drug. 
In order to further characterize the safety prof ile of YKP3089 while minimizing risk to patients, 
the following plan was developed:
1. Low starting dose (12.5 mg) and slower titration (dose increase every two weeks) 
2. Close monitoring (visits every two weeks) duri ng the first 4 months of treatment to allow 
early detection of suspected cases of hypersensitivity reaction  
3. Evaluation of suspected cases of hypersensitivity reaction to facilitate accurate diagnosis 
4. Care of subjects with hypersensitivity reactions to minimize consequences

Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 75 of 1354.5.2 Dose Justification
The target dose of 200 mg/day is based on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of YKP3089 in 
previously completed and ongoing studies.  
Initiating treatment with YKP3089 at 12.5 mg and th en increasing the dose every two weeks is 
likely to further reduce the risk of many side ef fects including hypersensitivity reactions. Slowing 
the titration rates of pharmaceuticals is a we ll-known procedure for mitigating risk of adverse 
reactions. Reducing the initial dose and slowin g the titration can reduce many central nervous 
system or gastrointestinal side effects.   It has b een demonstrated that lowe ring the initial dose and 
slowing the titration rate can mitiga te the occurrence of rash and possibly the rate of more serious 
and potentially life threatening adverse cutaneous reactions (Zaccara G, 2007). 
After initiating treatment with  YKP3089 for two weeks at 12.[ADDRESS_988514] at a rate 
of 50mg every other week to a target dose of 200mg/ day. This titration is appropriate for this 
portion of the study because of the known inte ractions between YKP3089 200mg and phenytoin 
and phenobarbital. Titrating by 50mg of YKP3089 ev ery other week to steady state will allow 
better understanding of the clinical impact of an y interaction and allow for dosage adjustment of 
phenytoin or phenobarbital.
Subjects taking concomitant AEDs other than ph enytoin or phenobarbital will titrate YKP3089 
upward at the same rate to a target dose of 200mg/day.
After reaching a target dose of 200mg, all subjects will be allowed to titrate up to a maximum dose 
of 400mg/day of YKP3089. A maximum dose of 400mg/day is justified by [CONTACT_724013] 400mg/day in the completed dose response study. Seizure free 
rate effect size in this group approached 20% during the maintenance phase.  
4.[ADDRESS_988515] been exposed to  YKP3089 in a total of 14 Phase 1 and 3 Phase 2 
clinical studies.
The potential risks in this study includes,
1. Phenytoin dose related toxicity
2. Risk of phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome
3. Phenobarbital dose related toxicity 
4. Rash / hypersensitivity related to YKP3089 exposure
5. DRESS syndrome related to YKP3089 exposure
6. YKP3089 dose related toxicities
Uncontrolled partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_24571] a life threatening disease with significant morbidity and elevated 
standard mortality rates.
The early signs and symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reaction that may progress to 
DRESS are readily identifiable by [CONTACT_139551]. When detected and adequately 
managed, progression to DRESS can be prevented or reversed.   The potential benefits of
YKP3089 include significant partial seizure freq uency reduction and substantial seizure free 
rates (~18%) in patients who continue to suff er seizures despi[INVESTIGATOR_723995]. The current benefit/risk profile in conjunction with the risk minimization 
measures support the enrollment of partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_723996]-label study to assess 
the profile of YKP3089 as a potential antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551]
5 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objective is to evaluate the safety a nd pharmacokinetics of YKP3089 and concomitant AEDs 
when administered as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial seizures. The evaluations will 
include:
1. Phenytoin-YKP3089 interaction
2. Phenobarbital-YKP3089 interaction 
3. Long term safety of YKP3089 as adjunctive therapy in subjects with partial onset seizures 
4. Population pharmacokinetics of YKP3089 and concomitant AEDs

YKP3089 will be packaged in high density polye thylene (HDPE) bottles each containing 30 tablets 
of either 12.5mg or 25mg or 100 tablets of either 50 mg or 100 mg.
8.1.2 Supply, Storage, Accountability, and Disposition of Study Medication
The Sponsor’s manufacturing facility will ship a suf ficient supply of study medication to each 
study site directly or from a local depot. The clinical investigator has the responsibility for 
confirming that all study drug treatment supplies recei ved by [CONTACT_724018]. A drug receipt log is to  be filled out and signed by [CONTACT_724019]. It is important that the designated study staff count and verify that the shipment 
contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory. Any damaged or unusable study drug in a 
given shipment will be documented in the study  files. The investigator must notify the study 
Sponsor of any damaged or unusable study treatments that were supplied to the investigator ’s site.
Subjects or their legal representatives must be told to return all original containers (empty or 
containing study drug), which will be stored and disposed of according to Sponsor's instructions. 
Subjects or their legal representatives must also  be told to keep study drugs in their original 
containers and not to combine the contents of different containers.
All study medication must be kept in a secure, locked area or lock ed cabinet with access restricted 
to designated study personnel. The tablets will  be stored at room temperature in a dry area,
protected from light.
Study personnel will keep accurate records of the st udy medication dispensed to and used by [CONTACT_724020]'s site monitor during on-site monitoring 
visits. The site monitor will periodically check the supplies of study medication held at the site to 
ensure accountability of all study medication used throughout the study.
At the conclusion of the study, a final inventory will be performed. Any discrepancies will be 
investigated, resolved, and documented prior to return to the Sponsor for destruction of study drug 
that has not been dispensed and study drug that has been dispensed and returned.
8.2 Screening and Study Drug Distribution
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Number
The subject will be assigned a screening numbe r by [CONTACT_724021].
The screening number will be an 8-digit number in which the first [ADDRESS_988532] details (eg, subject’s year of birth). The IWRS will identify open label
bottles of tablets to be dispense d. Returned bottles may be re-dispensed to the same subject after 
drug accountability is performed.
Prior to dispensing, the investigator will record on each open label bottle label the subject number,
date dispensed, site number, phone contact, and investigator name.
In addition, the investigator will review the elec tronic case report form (eCRF) to make sure the
medication number printed on each bottle dispensed is populated in the system correctly.
At each visit, the investigator will record the ex act dates and exact doses taken since the last visit 
in the case report form (eCRF). All dosing changes should be recorded in details.

investigator or the subject feels it is necessa ry. All information, including reason for visit/phone 
call, AEs, and any procedures performed should be collected in the source documents and recorded 
in the appropriate section of the eCRF.
9.3 Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_724025], frequency, and severity of treatment-emergent spontaneously 
reported AEs, dropouts due to AEs, overall dropout ra tes, and changes from base line in vital signs, 
physical and neurologic exams, clinical laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECGs, and Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
Study subjects will receive the following Hypersen sitivity information on a laminated card to carry 
with them:    
xRash may occur and may progress to Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS).
xRash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, and 
swelling) may herald a serious medical even t and that the patient should report any such 
occurrence to the investigative site immediately.
xInstructions on whom and where to call in the event a symptom arises and information that 
can be provided to an emergency room in the ev ent the subject cannot reach the investigator 
site.
xReminder to check skin daily for evidence of rash for the first four months of therapy
If a subject reports a rash by [CONTACT_756], an unsch eduled visit should be performed promptly. Any 
patient with a rash or manifestation of hypersensiti vity reaction such as lymphadenopathy, fever, 
facial swelling must be seen immediately at the study site. If it can definitely be determined that 
the rash or other symptoms are unrelated to study drug, then the subject can be maintained on 
YKP3809.  If the cause of the rash or other symptoms cannot be definitely determined 
immediately, then YKP3089 must be discontinued immediately. 
The initial physical/rash assessment for hypersensitivity reaction at the investigative site will 
include the following:
xMeasure body temperature

Time and date of each blood draw and dosing re cords (time/date/dose) of YKP3089 and AEDs 
prior to each blood draw will be record ed on the eCRF and other appropriate forms.
Plasma samples will be assaye d for YKP3089 and AEDs at a specified bioanalytical laboratory 
using previously validated methods. Assay methodol ogy will be detailed in separate assay 
protocols.
For subject taking phenytoin or phenobarbital
These samples will be obtained from subjects takin g phenobarbital or phenytoin at any global sites.
At Visit 2, a single trough level of phenytoin or phe nobarbital will be obtained. At Visits , 4, 5, 6, 
7 and 8, two blood samples will be collected for the determination of phenobarbital or phenytoin 
plasma levels: For the subjects taking phenytoin or phenobarbital in the morning and coming into 
the visits in the morning, the first blood draw will be collected upon subjects’ arrival to the study 
unit; the second blood draw should be collected wi thin 30 minutes to 2 hours after the medication 
is taken. At Visits 8 and 9, two blood samples will be collected for YKP3089 depending on stability 
of dosing (stable dose all AEDs including YKP3089 for prior 2 weeks).                                                                 
For subject taking concomitant AEDs ot her than phenytoin or phenobarbital
These samples will be obtained from subjects tak ing concomitant AEDs other than phenobarbital 
or phenytoin at US sites only.
At Visit 2, a single blood sample will be drawn to  determine trough level if the subject is taking 
one of the followings, oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], lamotrigine, lacosamide, clobazam, perampanel 
and levetiracetam. At Visit 8 and/or 9, two blood samp les will be drawn from the same subjects to
determine plasma levels of YKP3089, oxcarbazepi [INVESTIGATOR_050], topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], lamotrigine, lacosamide, 
clobazam, perampanel and levetiracetam.  Collect  at visit 8 and/ or 9 depending on stability of 
dosing (stable dose all AEDs including YKP3089 for prior 2 weeks). At Visit [ADDRESS_988559] blood draw will be collected upon subjects’ arrival to the study unit; the second 
blood draw should be collected within 30 minutes  to 2 hours after the medication is taken. For 
patients that are taking concomitant AEDs in the af ternoon and/or coming into the visits in the 
afternoon, the first blood draw will be collected upon subjects’ arri val to the study unit; the second 
blood draw should be collected within [ADDRESS_988560] blood draw with timing 
of the dose, blood draws and strength of previous dose clearly documented.
The collection schedule is summarized in Table 11 below.

10 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, il lness, or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent  illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs.
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality:
SK Life Science Inc CONFIDENTIAL
Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment 5 June 20, 2019 
Page 111 of 135xResults in study withdrawal
xIs associated with an SAE
xIs associated with clinical signs or symptoms
xLeads to additional treatment or  to further diagnostic tests
xIs considered by [CONTACT_1372]
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
AEs are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that is:
xFatal
xLife-threatening
xRequires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_723999]. They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted  above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].
10.1.3 Suspected Adverse Reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
cause the AE. For the purpose of investigational new drug (IND) safety reporting, “reasonabl e
possibility” means there is evidence to su ggest a causal relationship between the drug and AE.
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degre e of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for seriousness should be regarded as non-serious 
AEs.
10.1.[ADDRESS_988561] be report ed is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures (Visit 1) to th e end of the study treatment follow-up. For this 
study, the AE reporting period is defined as [ADDRESS_988562] 
administration of study treatment.
10.1.5 Preexisting Condition
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, in tensity, or the character of the condition worsens 
during the study period.
At Visit 1 any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At
the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition 
of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE.
Post-study Adverse Events
All unresolved AEs should be followed by [CONTACT_724026], the subject
is lost to follow-up, or the AE is otherwise explain ed. At the last scheduled visit, the investigator
should instruct each subject to re port any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject ’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.
The investigator should notify the study Sponsor of  any death or AE occurrin g at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study partic ipation that may reasonably be related to this 
study. The Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the 
development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a 
subject who has participated in this study.
Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE if any one of the following
conditions is met:
SK Life Science Inc CONFIDENTIAL
Protocol YKP3089C021, Amendment [ADDRESS_988563] to confirm the abnormality.
xThe abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity.
xThe abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (eg, change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205271] d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_724000] a serious AE unless specifically instru cted otherwise in this protocol. Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented as an  AE if the condition meets the criteria for an 
AE.
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances:
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] d iagnostic or elective surgical procedures for 
a preexisting condition. Surgery should notbe reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_201728].
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequenc y of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28690].
xAn Emergency Room visit is not considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
10.2 Adverse Event Recording and Assessing
All AEs occurring during this clinical trial will be recorded. The investigator will review each 
event and assess its relationship to drug tr eatment (unrelated, remote, possible, probable, or
definite). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on a 3-point severity scale (mild, 
moderate, or severe), and the date of onset, time of onset, and outcome of each event will be noted.
The relationship of each AE to study drug will be assessed using the following definitions:
Definite xDistinct temporal relationship with drug treatment
xKnown reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_724027] ’s clinical state or other factors
Probable xReasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment
xLikely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by 
[CONTACT_724028] ’s clinical state or other factors
Possible xReasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment
xEvent could be explained by [CONTACT_1130] ’s clinical state or other factors
Remote xPoor temporal relationship with drug treatment
xEvent easily explained by [CONTACT_1130] ’s clinical state or other factors
Unrelated xEvent occurring before dosing
xEvent or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than drug treatment
The following definitions for rating severity will be used:
xMild : The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity.
xModerate : The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function.
xSevere : The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention.

12.2 Analysis Data Sets
Enrolled subjects : All subjects who successfully meet th eir entry criteria and who have given 
informed consent to participate in this st udy will be considered enrolled subjects.
Safety evaluable subjects (SE) : All subjects enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of 
study drug medication will be consid ered safety evaluable subjects. 
Three safety evaluable subgroups of subjects will be defined: 
oSubjects taking phenytoin and YKP3089
oSubjects taking Phenobarbital and YKP3089
oSubjects taking concomitant AEDs other than phenytoin or Phenobarbital and 
YKP3089
12.3 Baseline Characteristics
All demographic measurements (age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, and we ight) and all baseline 
safety measurements (medical and seizure history, MRI, CAT, ECGs, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory values, physical and brief neurologic ex am, and C-SSRS) will be summarized for all 
enrolled subjects, for all safety evaluable subjec ts and by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_988572] one dose of study drug medication will be evaluable for

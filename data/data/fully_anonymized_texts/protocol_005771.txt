5. BACKGROUND  
 
Endometrial cancer is a surgically staged disease. Staging involves remova l of the            
uterus, tubes and ovaries as well as lymph nodes in the pelvic and aortic regions. In 
women with cancer that does not invade the uterine muscle or is of low grade and 
invades less than 50% of the muscle, removal of the lymph nodes is no t mandatory. 
Intraoperative evaluation of the depth of invasion of the cancer is critical, therefore, in 
determining which patients require lymphadenectomy. Gross visualization is highly 
inaccurate. It is more sensitive to obtain a pathological frozen sect ion on the uterus to 
accurately diagnose depth of invasion. However, frozen section increases the 
operative time and incurs an additional expense for the procedure. A rapid and 
accurate intraoperative assessment of invasion which could be performed in the 
operating room would reduce the time and expense of a frozen section. We propose to 
utilize fluorescein dye given intravenously prior to the hysterectomy to aid in visually 
determining the depth of invasion. If this assessment correlates well with the path ologic 
depth of invasion, then this could represent a valuable intraoperative tool to determine 
which patients require lymphadenectomy.  
 
Fluorescein  is approved by [CONTACT_491894]. There are 
many  procedures that utilize fluor escein  beyond its FDA indication. It is commonly 
used during surgery to assess the vascular viability of tissue, most particularly the 
viability of the intestines when there is concern. In this situation, fluorescein is injected 
intravenously and the intes tines are examined using a Woods lamp to detect the areas 
of fluorescence. Areas of poor vascularity will not fluoresce. It is also commonly used 
to detect the boundaries of skin lesions. For example, in assessment of vulvar Paget's 
disease fluorescein inj ection and visualization of the vulva with Woods lamp can detect 
the extent of the lesion that would otherwise not be detectable by [CONTACT_170396].

9. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
a. On-Study Evaluation:   
 After signing the IRB -approved informed consent form, research participants will  be 
regist ered by a clinical research associate (CRA) in the Cance r Clinical Trials Office (CCTO) .  
Upon registration, surgery will be scheduled at the next available surgery time slot.  All 
research participants will receive fluorescein injection through their existing intravenous line 
during their operative procedure  for endometrial cancer staging.  This will consist of one 
ampule (5 cc) injected intravenously prior to ligation of the uterine arteries. After the uterus is 
removed it will be sent to surgi cal pathology for evaluation as per routine care . The 
pathologist will open the uterus and evaluate the endometrium. He or she will then cut into 
the myometrium in an area most suspi[INVESTIGATOR_241126]. The cross section of the 
myometrium and endometrium wi ll be photographed while exposed to a Woods lamp. The 
normal myometrium will have a yellow fluorescent appearance under the Woods lamp. The 
cancerous tissue will have minimal fluorescence. The measurement will be taken estimating 
the depth of invasion of t he cancer into the myometrium on the basis of its physical 
appearance under the Woods lamp.   Cross -sectioning of the uterus is routine procedure by 
[CONTACT_491898] -operative evaluation of endometrial cancer.  This information routinely 
is provided in order to determine if lymph node staging is necessary.  
 
 The area that was measured and photographed will then be prepared for a frozen section to 
document depth of invasion. This is the standard procedure performed during an endometrial 
staging. The de pth of invasion on the frozen section will be recorded. This same area will 
undergo histologic confirmation by [CONTACT_491899].   The 
frozen section is part of routine standard of care in evaluation of endometrial cancer.  
 
 Subjects will be informed prior to participation in this study that they will have a bright yellow 
discoloration of their urine and possibly a mild yellow discoloration of their skin for up to 24 
hours after the procedure.  
 
b. Dose Assignment:    This is a s ingle arm study.  A single dose of Fluorescein will be 
administered to all subjects in this study.  
c. Specimen Handling :  The uterus will be sent to pathology immediately after its removal from 
the patient. The study pathologist  will be informed when to expec t a subject specimen and 
will prepare the lab for Woods lamp evaluation, measurement and photography. The 
remainder of the specimens from the procedure will be processed in the usual manner for  
routine  pathology evaluations .

11. RISKS AND TOXICITIES TO BE MONITORED  
 
Potential Toxicities, Risks and Precautions  
 
a. G.I. Nausea can occur in up to 10% of patients however vomiting is unco mmon and 
abdominal pain is ra re. 
b. Nervous system.  Syncope has been reported between 1 and 10% of patients. There have 
been very rare reports of convulsions.  
c. Allergic reaction.  Hypersensitivity reactions can occur after injection and may be as severe 
as anaphylaxis. Fatal anaphyla ctic reaction is reported in 1 of 220,000 angiographies.  
d.  Skin. Urticaria and pruitis can frequently occur after injection.  
The above side effects will be unlikely to occur given that the injection is done while the patient is 
under general anesthesia .  If there is any evidence of hypersensitivity, the  anesthesiologists can 
utilize antihistamine agents to reduce the duration and severity of the hypersensitivity.

standard pathology evaluation. There wi ll not be a study -specific specimen retained. 
Photographs of the stained endometrial cancer and myometrium will be retained for purposes of 
comparison in this study.  
 
14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
a. Sample Size  and Study Dura tion: 100 subjects will be ent ered into this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. It is 
estimated that this study will be completed in less than one year.  
 
IRB #202459  
Version 4 
6/28/ 2016  
Page 10 of 17 
 
b. Study Endpoints:   Invasion depth as determined using each of three methods: Systemic 
Fluorescein Injection (SFI), Frozen Section (FS), and Permanent Se ction (PS).     
 
c. Data Analysis Plan : The primary objective is basically to determine whether the SFI method 
works.  Provided that it works, the analysis plan in support of the Secondary Objective is as 
follows:  For each study subject, the paired differ ence in invasion depths determined using 
the SFI versus FS methods will be calculated and expressed as a percentage of the FS -
based invasion depth.  Likewise, the paired difference in invasion depths determined using 
the SFI versus PS methods will be calcu lated and expressed as a percentage of the PS -
based invasion depth.  Each type of paired difference will be summarized as the mean and 
standard deviation.  Because PS is considered the definitive “gold standard” of determining 
invasion depth, the mean of t he paired differences between SFI and PS methods will be 
compared against equivalence limits of –25% and +25% via theTwo One -Sided Tests 
(TOST) procedure using an alpha=0.10 significance level.  If this mean is significantly “in 
between” both equivalence l imits, then this will indicate that the discrepancy in invasion 
depths between SFI and PS is significantly less than 25%, and we will accordingly consider 
further investigation of the SFI method of determining invasion depth.   
 
Sample Size and Power :  When two methods are equivalent, the mean of their paired 
difference will be 0%.  The power of the TOST procedure to declare that a mean of 0% is 
significantly “in between” equivalence limits of –25% and +25% depends heavily on the 
standard deviation of the p aired difference when the sample size is fixed at [ADDRESS_632680] procedure >90% power at 10% alpha to declare a mean of 0% to be 
significantly “in b etween” the above -stated equivalence limits provided that the standard 
deviation of the paired differences is less than 37%.  This power calculation shows that, if SFI 
agrees well with PS, then [ADDRESS_632681].       
 
d. Missing, Unused and Spurious Dat a: Missing data will be treated as missing, and will not 
be imputed.  Spurious data will be corrected at the source document.  Any data documented 
as spurious that is unable to be corrected a t the source will be treated as missing.   
15. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The following must be observed to comply with FDA regulations for the conduct and monitoring 
of clinical investigations. The following also rep resents sound research prac tice. All study 
personnel must have completed training in good clinical practice (GCP) and protection of human 
subjects.  
 
a. Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Patients with endometrial cancer  will be identified in

IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 10 of 60 29Apr 2018  2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease  
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancers in humans worldw ide with an 
estimated 77% increase over the past two decades (Mohan and Chang, 2014) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_571896] 2 million new cases per year in the [LOCATION_002], BCCs 
are understudied in large part because they are not included in the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_571897] (Mohan and Chang, 2014) .   
The first -line therapy for BCCs is excision, however the five -year recurrence rate for BCC is 3% 
(Jarkowski , et al, 2014; Mohan and Chang, 2014) .  About 1% of BCCs a re unresectable, with 
28,000 cases yearly of locally advanced or metastatic disease (Mohan and Chang, 2014).  
Effective therapy for unresectable BCC is a current unmet medical need .  For patients with 
unresectable BCC, the prognosis is poor, despi[INVESTIGATOR_571898] 
(Sekulic , et al, 2012), with >50% of patients unresponsive to Smoothened inhibitor treatment 
and >20% recurrence within 1 year (Chang and Oro, 2012) .  These patients are often referred to 
academic centers such as Stanford for c are.   
Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy open a much -needed window of opportunity to gain 
traction for treating unresectable BCCs .  In particular, checkpoint blockade utilizing antibodies 
that impede immune inhibitory pathways, such as PD1/PD -L1, rep resent a novel strategy .  The 
important role of the immune system in suppressing BCCs can be inferred from 
immunosuppressed patients who develop high rates of these cancers .  One rapi[INVESTIGATOR_571899]1/PDL1 interaction between tumor and T cells .  New emerging lines 
of evidence suggest that this adaptive immunotherapy for BCCs is highly likely to be effective: 
(1) PDL1 (also known as B7H1) overexpr ession in keratinocytes, which are derived from basal 
cells, accelerates carcinogenesis in a mouse model of CSCC (Cao , et al, 2011) (2) monoclonal 
antibodies that block PDL1 can reverse the anergic state of tumor -specific T cells leading to 
enhanced antitu mor immunity (Lyford -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], et al, 2013) and (4) data presented at European 
Society for Medical Oncology 2014 revealed that an anti -PDL1 antibody (MEDI4736) for head 
and neck SCC (HNSCC) led to a 20% overall response rate (ORR), with a 46% response rate in 
PDL1 positive tumors versus 11.4% in PD -L1 negative tumors, using a cut point of 1% staining 
of tumor cells or stroma (Fury , et al, 2014; Segal , et al, 2014) .  Indeed, we have recently found 
that about 20 -30% of advanced basal cell carcinomas stain positiv e for PDL1 (unpublished 
results), suggesting potential response of BCCs to PD1 inhibitors.  
Pembrolizumab has demonstrated efficacy in melanoma and small cell lung cancer (Garon , et al, 
2015), two cancers that are the result of environmental carcinogens, le ading to a high mutational 
load.  Similarly, BCC has been shown to be among the most mutated of human cancers, 
suggesting favorable response of these cancers to immunotherapy with pembrolizumab 
(Jayaraman , et al, 2014 ).  This study is noncomparative, but t here will be [ADDRESS_750994] of care for advanced BCC is vismodegib, a 
Smoothened inhibitor, despi[INVESTIGATOR_571900] <  50% (Sekulic,  et al, 2012), one of the arms 
in this study will be patients on vismodegib  plus pembrolizumab to assess if overall response can 
be improved with combination therapy.  In fact,  in the melanoma literature, emerging data 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 11 of 60 29Apr 2018  suggests that combination chemotherapy results in improved outcomes compared to each alone 
(Larkin,  et al, 2015 ). 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background information 
on pembrolizumab  (Keytruda, MK-3475 ). 
2.[ADDRESS_750995] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades .  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_750996] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207] .  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions .  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of murine PD -1 has been 
resolved .  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules .  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 
2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhi bition motif  (ITIM) 
and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM) .  Following T -cell stimulation, 
PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its 
cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector  molecules such as CD3ζ ;  PKCθ ;  
and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade .  The mechanism by [CONTACT_113777]-[ADDRESS_750997] from that of CTLA -4 as both 
molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_110495] .  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural 
Killer cells .  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -CD8 - (double 
negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells .  The ligands for PD -1 
(PD-L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors .  Both ligands ar e type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs .  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_750998] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammat ory environments .  PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted 
T-cell function in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor .  PD-1 
has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma 
(MEL) .  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion  and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 12 of 60 29Apr 2018  Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its lig ands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United 
Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease 
progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BR AF inhibitor.  
For clinicaltrials.gov compliance  
Pembrolizumab is FDA -approved for metastatic melanoma .  This study  requires an 
Investigational New Drug application (IND) .   
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
2.3 Rationa le  
Effective therapy for unresectable BCC is a current unmet medical need .  For patients with 
unresectable BCC, the prognosis is poor, despi[INVESTIGATOR_571898] 
(Sekulic , et al, 2012), with >50% of patients unresponsive to Smoothened inh ibitor treatment 
and >20% recurrence within 1 year (Chang and Oro, 2012) .  These patients are often referred to 
academic centers such as Stanford for care .   
Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy open a much -needed window of opportunity to gain 
traction for treating unresectable NMSCs.  
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent MK -3475 (pembrolizumab) .  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1  mg/kg, 3  mg/kg, and 10  mg/kg, administered every 2  week s 
(Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors .  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed .  This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evidence 
of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1  mg/kg, 
3 mg/kg and 10  mg/kg Q2W) .  No MTD has been identified to date .  10 mg/kg Q2W, the highest 
dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this 
protocol to test for initial tumor activity .  Recent data from other clinical studies within the 
MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be 
sufficient for target engagement and clinical activi ty.   
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB) .  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 
release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable  (> 21 days) .  This early PK 
and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing 
schedule .   
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from [ADDRESS_750999] a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication .  The differences in exposure for a 200  mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 
2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the esta blished 
exposure margins of 0.5  to 5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication .  The exposure margins 
are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at  10 mg/kg Q3W vs .  the 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 13 of 60 29Apr 2018  proposed dose regimen of 2  mg/kg Q3W (ie, 5 -fold higher dose and exposure) .  The population 
PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure .  In 
addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC  and melanoma indications .  Therefore, there 
are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings .   
The rationale for further exploration of 2  mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on:  1)  similar eff icacy and safety of pembr olizumab when dosed at either 
2 mg/kg or 10  mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2)  the flat exposure -response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2  mg/kg Q3W to 10  mg/kg 
Q3W, 3)  the lack of  effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the 
dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type .   
The choice of the 200  mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed 
dose of 200  mg every 3  week s will provide exposures that 1)  are optimally consisten t with those 
obtained with the 2  mg/kg dose every 3  week s, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in 
the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 
3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exp osure range established in melanoma that 
are well tolerated and safe .   
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and 
to reduce potential for dosing errors .  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity  in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
The primary endpoint will consist of evaluation of the Overall Response Rate (ORR ) of all 
evaluable patients with unresectable or metastatic BCC including those in the pembrolizumab 
monot herapy group and  pembrolizumab plus vismodegib combination therapy   group .   
Primary efficacy endpoints:

This is an exploratory open label, two -arm study of efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in 
unresectable and/or metastatic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs .  One arm will comprise individuals 
with unresectable or metastatic BCC who a re intolerant of Smo inhibitor due to side effects, 
cannot use Smo inhibitor for medical cause or decline to use smoothened inhibitor monotherapy 
such as vismodegib .  These patients  will be treated with pembrolizumab until disease progression 
or intolerabl e toxicity .  The second arm will comprise individuals with unresectable or metastatic 
BCC who are willing and able to take vismodegib together with pembrolizumab ; these 
individuals will be treated with pembrolizumab plus vismodegib until disease progressio n or 
intolerable toxicity .  Each arm will be analyzed separately.  
Primary Outcome :  “Overall Response Rate (ORR) ” as the o verall response rate  (ORR) of all 
evaluable unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab, assessed as the p ercentage 
of pa tients with partial or complete response after 9 and 18 weeks  of treatment .  This represents 
3 and 6 cycles of treatment, with a cycle considered to be 3  weeks (21  days) .  
Secondary Outcome  1:  “Overall Response Rate (ORR) ” as the o verall response rate  (ORR) of 
unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to A) pembrolizumab  monotherapy and B) 
pembrolizumab  in combination with vismodegib, assessed as the p ercentage of patients with 
partial or complete response after 9 and 18  weeks of treatment .  
Secondary Outcom e 2:  “Incidence of Adverse Events” as the p ercentage of treated patients  by 
[CONTACT_571917], or related adverse events Grade  3 or 
higher, in each of the two study arms  
Secondary Outcome  3:  “Duration of Response  (DOR)” as the d uration of response  (DUR)  to 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with vismodegib, assessed as the median 
value ( with 1st and 3rd quartiles ) for subjects who complete 9  and 18 weeks of treatment .  
2.5 Correlative Studies Background  
Biomarkers explored will include PDL -1 levels and be performed by  [CONTACT_571918] (Santa Barbara, 
CA), using formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue and subjected to immunohistochemistry .   
Correlatives assessed include:  
 intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration pre and post treatment in each arm, including CD8+ cell 
density  
 PDL -[ADDRESS_751001] treatment for each arm  
 PDL -1 immunostaining levels and correlation with treatment response for each arm  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 15 of 60 29Apr 2018  Preliminary Results:  
For unresectable or metastati c BCC, there are currently no clinical trials of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors .  However, the likely response of BCCs to checkpoint inhibitors is derived from 
patients whose BCCs have been incidentally exposed to checkpoint inhibitors while getting 
treatmen t for metastatic melanoma .  We have a patient in our clinical practice with metastatic 
melanoma whose advanced BCC (bracket) shrank while on a checkpoint inhibitor, but his 
melanoma did not (data not shown) .  Figure  1 shows histology of a BCC with an immun e 
infiltrate staining  for PDL1 (arrow), courtesy of J  Taube) .  We also have unpublished results 
demonstrating that advanced BCCs (n  = 25) show 20  to 30% positivity for PDL1 
immunostaining .  Correlation of this marker with clinical outcomes is currently und er 
investigation.

*until disease progression or intolerable toxicity .   
Dose selection is as described above .  In the case of an adverse event deemed related to the study 
drug that is Grade  3 or 4, study drug may be  held for up to 6  week s; if the subject had been 
deriving clinical benefit from the study agent, that is, stable, partial or complete response, the 
subject may be allowed to resume study drug after adverse event returns to Grade  1, with 
reduction in dosage  by 50% or as recommended by [CONTACT_456] .   
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section  4.0 Background 
and Rationale .   
Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab are provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual .   
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section  6.0).  Trial treatment may be 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 23 of 60 29Apr 2018  administered up to 3  days before or after the scheduled Day 1 o f each cycle due to administrative 
reasons.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Pembrolizumab 200  mg will be administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion every 3  week s.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to b e as close to 30  minute s as possible .  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minute s and 
+10 minute s is permitted (ie,  infusion time is 30  minute s: -5 minute /+10 minute ). 
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific in structions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
4.1 General Concomitant Medicati on and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial .  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required .  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with 
the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests w ith 
the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician .   
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_571901] e.  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and 
fluids .  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, fr equency, route, 
and date may also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_751029] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and 
ECIs.  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse ) of this trial:  
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
 Radiation therapy   
o Note:  Radiation therap y to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed 
at the investigator’s discretion .   
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 24 of 60 29Apr 2018   Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_751030] dose of trial treatment and while participating 
in the trial .  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine .  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology .  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
 Intraarticular, inhaled , topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] , and intralesional steroid treatments are allowed.  A pulse 
steroid dose prior to and after imaging to prevent contrast allergy in patients with known 
allergy to contrast is allowed.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial .  Subjects may rec eive 
other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
There are no r escue medications for this study .  Supportive care is as outlined as follows .  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017] .  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events 
with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in the ECI guidance 
document .  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment 
with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflamma tory agents if symptoms do not improve 
with administration of corticosteroids .  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased .  For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule ou t other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require additional supportive care .  The treatment guidelines are intended 
to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab .   
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is 
instructed to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment 
guidance (as outlined in the ECI guidance document) .  Refer to Section  5.2.1 for dose 
modification .   
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event .  Suggested conditional procedures, as 
appropriate, can be found in the ECI guidance do cument.  
 Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade  2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids .  When symptoms improve to 
Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4  week s. 
o For Grade  3 or 4 events , immediately treat with intravenous s teroids .  Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid 
administration . 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 25 of 60 29Apr 2018   Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and sympto ms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such 
as peritoneal signs and ileus) .   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantiti es 
of clear fluids .  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should 
be substituted via IV infusion .  For Grade  2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation 
and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade  2 diarrhea /colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids .   
o For Grade  3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1  week , treat with intravenous steroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018] .   
o When symptoms improve to Grade  1 or less, steroi d taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4  week s. 
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grade  3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3-4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for 
Grade  3 or 4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria .   
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide .   
 Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade  2 events, treat with corticosteroids .  When symptoms improve to Grade  1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4  week s.  
Replacement of appropriate hormones m ay be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade  3 or 4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78019] .  When symptoms improve to Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should 
be started and continued over no less  than 4  week s.  Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment .  Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the star t of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade  2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade  2 to 4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g .  propranolol) are suggested as 
initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade  3 or 4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV c orticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019] .  When 
symptoms improve to Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 26 of 60 29Apr 2018  over no less than 4  week s.  Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as 
the steroid dose is tapered.  
 Hepatic : 
o For Grade  2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider  week ly). 
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade  3 to 4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48  hours.   
o When symptom s improve to Grade  1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4  week s. 
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade  2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade  3 to 4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms  improve to Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4  week s.   
 Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24  hours of completion of 
infusion .  Table  3 below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab.

Subject is permanently discontinued from further 
trial treatment administration.  No subsequent dosing  
Appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available in the room and a physician readily available during the 
period of drug administration.  
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such 
as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in ute ro.  Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has  transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm .  Non-pregnant, 
non-breast -feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control 
or are considered highly unlikely to  conceive .  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 
1) surgically sterilized, or 2)  postmeno pausal (a woman who is ≥  45 years of age and has not had 
menses for greater than 1  year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3)  not heterosexually 
active for the duration of the study .  The two birth control methods can be either [ADDRESS_751032] 
dose of study therapy .   
The following are considered adequate barrier method s of contraception: diaphragm, condom 
(by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide .  Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progesterone  agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular 
agents).  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study .  In order to participat e in the 
study they must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of  the 
study and during the  follow -up period .  If there is any question that a subject will not reliably 
comply with the requirements for contraception, tha t subject should not be entered into the study.  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the subject 
will immediately be removed from the study .  The site will contact [CONTACT_571921]-[ADDRESS_751033]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated .  The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 
24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working  days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a seriou s adverse 
experience (eg,  death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening 
complication to the mother or newborn) .  
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and rep ort the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor .  If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and 
the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006].   
It is unknown whether pembroli zumab is excreted in human milk .  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing 
infant, subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.   
4.[ADDRESS_751034] may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_571922] i nto the trial is inappropriate, the trial 
plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons .  A subject must be 
discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
 The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal g uardian) withdraws consent.  
 Confirmed radiographic disease progression  
Note : A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved . 
 Unacceptable adverse experience s  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
 Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
 The subject is lost to follow -up 
 Completed 24  month s of uninterrupted treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 administrations 
of study medication, whichever is later.  
Note: [ADDRESS_751035] dose .  Subjects who stop 
pembrolizum ab after 24  month s may be eligible for up to 1 year of additional study treatment if 
they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_571903]  
 Administrative reasons  
After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30  days for adverse event 
monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 90  days after the end of treatment ).  
Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post -treatment 
follow -up for disease status until disease pro gression, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, 
withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow -up.  After documented disease progression each 
 
IRB-[ADDRESS_751036] meets 
the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is open .  Subjects 
will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial disc ontinuation .   
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements  
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reacti on in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug  
5. There are 2 or more responders in one arm  
     AND  
There are  no responders in the other arm (after 10 patients ha ve been enrolled in 
this latter arm).  
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.  
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation .  Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in 
accordance with the safety r equirements outlined in Section  7.2 Assessing and Recording 
Adverse Events .  Subjects who a) attain a CR or b) complete 24  month s of treatment with 
pembrolizumab may discontinue treatment with the option of restarting treatment if they meet 
the criteria sp ecified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  After discontinuing treatment following assessment of 
CR, these subjects should return to the site for a Safety Follow -up Visit (described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1) and then proceed to the Follow -Up Period of the study (described i n 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).

7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Known  or potential risks associated with pembrolizumab include immune mediated adverse 
reactions, including pneumonitis, diarrhea/colitis .  Reported adverse reactions in 20% or greater 
of patients included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite constipation, 
arthralgia and diarrhea .  Additional details of the adverse reactions are as follows:  
Immune -Mediated Pne umonitis  
Pneum onitis occurr ed in 12 (2.9%) of 411 mela noma patients, inc luding  Grade  2 or 3 cas es in 
8 (1.9%) and 1  (0.2%) patients, r espectively, rece iving pembrolizumab in Trial 1.  The medi an 
time to developm ent of pneu monitis  was 5 month s (range 0.3  week s to 9.9 month s).  The  median 
duration w as 4.9  month s (range 1  week  to 14.4 month s).  Five  of eight patients with Grade  2 and 
the one patient wi th Grade  3 pneumonit is requ ired initial treatment w ith high -dose system ic 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40  mg Prednisone or equivalent per day) foll owed by a 
corticosteroid tap er.  The median  initial dose of high -dose cort icosteroid  treatment w as 
63.4 mg/day of prednis one or equivalent with a m edian d uration  of treatment of 3  days (range 
1 to 34) foll owed by a cor ticosteroid taper.  Pneum onitis led to discontinuati on of 
pembroli zumab in 3  (0.7%) patients.  Pneu monitis comple tely resolved in seven of the nine 
patients with Grade  [ADDRESS_751045] eroids for  Grade  2 or greater 
pneum onitis.  Withhold pembrolizumab for moderate  (Grade  2) pneumonitis,  and permanently 
disconti nue pembrolizumab for severe  (Grade  3) or life-threateni ng (Grade  4) pneum onitis 
[see Dosage and Ad ministr ation (2.2) and Adverse Rea ctions  (6.1)]. 
Immune -Mediated  Colitis  
Colitis ( including micr oscopic colitis) occurred in 4  (1%) of 411 pa tients, inc luding Grade  2 or 3 
cases in 1 (0.2%) and 2  (0.5%) patient s, respectively, re ceiving pembrolizumab in Trial  1.  The 
median time to on set of colitis  was 6.5  month s (range 2.3  to .8).  The med ian duration  was 
2.6 month s (range 0.6 week s to 3.6 month s).  All three patien ts with Grade  2 or 3 colitis were 
treated with hig h-dose cort icosteroids (greater than or eq ual to 40  mg predn isone or e quivalent 
per day) with a medi an initia l dose of 70  mg/day of pre dnisone or equivalent; the median 
duration of initial treatment w as 7 days (range 4 to 41), follow ed by a cort icosteroid tap er.  
One patient (0.2%) re quired per manent disconti nuation of pembrolizumab due to colit is.  All 
[ADDRESS_751046] er corticosteroids for Grade  2 or 
great er colitis .  Withhold pembrolizumab for moderate ( Grade  2) or severe ( Grade  3) colitis, and 
permanently dis continue pembrolizumab  for life -threatening ( Grade  4) colitis  [see Dos age and 
Administration  (2.2) and Ad verse Rea ctions (6.1)].  
Immune -Mediated  Hepatitis 
Hepatitis (i ncluding autoimmune h epatitis) occurred in  2 (0.5%) of 411 patien ts, incl uding a 
Grade  4 case in 1  (0.2%) patient, re ceiving pembrolizumab  in Trial 1 .  The time to on set was 
22 days for the  case of Grade  4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1  month s.  The patient  with Grade  4 
hepatitis p ermanently discontinu ed pembrolizumab and was treated with high -dose (greater than 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 33 of 60 29Apr 2018  or equal  to 40  mg prednisone or equivalent per day) s ystemic cort icosteroids foll owed by a 
corticosteroid tap er.  Both patients wi th hepatitis e xperienced comp lete resolutio n of the event.  
Monitor patients for chan ges in liver fu nction.  Administer  corticosteroids for Grade  2 or greater 
hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzy me elevations, wi thhold or  discontinue  
pembrolizumab . 
Immune -Mediated  Hypophysitis 
Hypo physitis  occurr ed in 2 (0.5%) of 411  patients, c onsisting of one  Grade  2 and  one Grade  4 
case (0.2% ea ch), in patients re ceiving pembrolizumab  in Trial 1 .  The time to onset was 
1.7 month s for the patient with Grade  4 hypoph ysitis and 1.3  month s for the patient wi th Grade  2 
hypoph ysitis.  Both patients were treated with high-dose ( greater than or equal to 40  mg 
predn isone or equival ent per day)  corticosteroi ds follow ed by a cort icosteroid  taper and  remained 
on a physio logic replacement d ose. 
Monitor for  signs and symptoms of hy pophysit is.  Administ er corticosteroids for Grade  2 or 
greater hypoph ysitis.  Withho ld pembrolizumab  for moderate  (Grade  2) hypophy sitis, withhold 
or discontinue pembrolizumab  for severe  (Grade  3) hypophysitis, and permanently d iscontinue 
pemb rolizumab  for life- threaten ing (Grade  4) hy pophysit is  
Renal Failu re and Immune -Mediated Nephr itis 
Nephritis occurred in 3  (0.7%) patien ts, consisting of one case of Grade  2 auto immune 
nephritis (0.2%) and two  cases of interstitial nephrit is with  renal fa ilure (0.5%), one Grade  [ADDRESS_751047] d ose of 
pembrolizumab  ([ADDRESS_751048] d ose) and lasted 3.2  month s; this patient did  not have a 
biopsy.  Acute int erstitial ne phritis was confirmed by  [CONTACT_571924] b iopsy in 2 patien ts with Grade  3 to 4 
renal fai lure.  All three  patients fully recovered  renal fu nction with treatm ent with high -dose 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40  mg prednisone or equivalent per day) foll owed by a 
corticosteroid tap er. 
Monitor patients for chan ges in r enal function .  Admi nister corticosteroids for Grade  2 or greater 
nephritis.  Withho ld pembrolizumab  for moderate  (Grade  2) nephr itis, and per manently 
discontinue pembrolizumab  for severe  (Grade  3), or life -threaten ing (Grade  4) nephritis  
Immune -Mediated  Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism  
Hyperth yroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of  411 pati ents, incl uding Grade  2 or 3  cases in 2  (0.5%) 
and 1 (0.2%) patient s, respectively,  receiving pembrolizumab  in Trial  1.  The median time to 
onset was 1.5 month s (range 0. 5 to 2.1).  The median  durati on was 2.8 month s (range 0 .9 to 6 .1).  
One of two patients with Grade  2 and the o ne patient with Grade  3 hyp erthyroidism re quired 
initial tr eatment with high-dose cort icosteroids (greater than or eq ual to 40  mg predn isone or 
equivalent per day) followed by a cort icosteroid taper .  One patient  (0.2%)  required permanent 
discontinua tion of  pembrolizumab  due to hyperthyroid ism.  All five patients with 
hyperthyro idism  experi enced comp lete resoluti on of the event.  
Hypothyro idism occurred in  34 (8.3%)  of 411 pati ents, incl uding a Grade  3 case in 1 (0.2%) 
patient, receiving pembrolizumab  in Trial 1 .  The median time  to onset of hypo thyroi dism was 
3.5 month s (range  0.7 week s to 19 mont hs).  All but two of the patients with  hypothyroid ism 
were treat ed with lon g-term thyroid hor mone rep lacement therapy .  The other two patien ts only 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 34 of 60 29Apr 2018  required short-term t hyroid h ormone replacement therapy .  No patient  received cort icosteroids or 
discontinued pembrolizumab  for management of  hypothyroid ism..   
Thyroid d isorders c an occur at any time during trea tment.  Monitor patients for  chan ges in 
thyroid fu nction (at the start of treatment, period ically d uring tr eatment, and as ind icated based 
on clin ical evaluatio n) and for clin ical signs and symp toms of thyro id dis orders. 
Administer corticosteroids for  Grade  3 or greater hyperthyroid ism, withho ld pembrolizumab  for 
severe  (Grade  3) hyperthyroid ism, and pe rmanently discont inue pembrolizumab  for 
life-threaten ing (Grade  4) hyperthyroid ism.  Isolat ed hypothyroid ism may be m anaged with 
replacement t herapy wit hout treatment interruption and with out corticosteroids.   
Other Immune -Mediated Ad verse Re actions  
Other  clinical ly important immun e-mediated adverse  reactions can occur.  
The follow ing clinically sig nificant, imm une-mediat ed adverse re actions occurred in less th an 
1% of patients treated with pembrolizumab  in Trial 1: exfoliative  dermatiti s, uveiti s, arthriti s, 
myositis, pan creatiti s, hemolytic a nemia, partial  seizures arising in a pati ent with inflammatory 
foci in brain p arenchyma, and adr enal insufficie ncy. 
Across clin ical studies with  pembrolizumab  in approximately 2000 pat ients, the following 
additional clin ically signif icant, immun e-mediated adverse  reactio ns were  reported in l ess than 
1% of patients: myasth enic syndrome, o ptic neurit is, and rh abdomyolysis.  
For susp ected immun e-mediated adv erse re actions, ens ure adequate evaluation  to confirm 
etiology or exclu de other ca uses.  Based on the severity of the ad verse  reaction, withhold 
pembrolizumab  and admin ister corticosteroids.  Upon improvement to Grade  [ADDRESS_751049] ion re mains at Grade  1 or les s.  Permanently discont inue pembrolizumab  for any 
severe or Grade  3 immune -mediated adverse reaction that recurs a nd for any life -threat ening 
immune-mediated adverse  reaction   
Emb ryofetal Toxici ty 
Based on its mechan ism of action, pembrolizumab  may cause f etal harm when administered to  a 
pregnant wom an.  Animal mode ls link the PD -1/PDL -[ADDRESS_751050] a causal relationship with this treatment .  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
protocol -specified procedure, whethe r or not considered related to the medicinal product or 
protocol -specified procedure .  Any worsening (ie,  any clinically significant adverse change in 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 35 of 60 29Apr 2018  frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use 
of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events .  Examples of 
this may include, but are not  limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_482566] a physiologically appropriate time.  
[COMPANY_006] product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent 
or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_80085].  
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] produc t in clinical trials or 
within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline period as 
a result of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unl ess it is considered 
to be drug related by [CONTACT_093].  
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30  days 
following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksh eets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000  mg 
or greater (≥  5-fold the indicated dose) .  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of pembrolizumab .  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated .  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity .  
Appropri ate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness crite ria are 
met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a 
non-serious Event of Clinical Interest  (ECI), using the te rminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24  hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working  days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety .  (Attn: Worldwide Product 
Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220)  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously 
reported to them), including the pregna ncy of a male subject's female partner that occurs during 
the trial or within [ADDRESS_751051] be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy .  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed 
abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine  death, miscarriage 
and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events) .  If the pregnancy

 Grade  4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade  [ADDRESS_751054] that:  
  Results in dea th; or 
  Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused deat h.); or  
  Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
  Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266171], regardless of length of stay, even if the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation .  (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096]] for a 
preexisting condition which has not worsened doe s not constitute a serious adverse event.); or  
  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
  Is a new cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study)  or 
  Is an overdose  (whether acc idental or intentional) .  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event .  An overdose that is 
not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within 24  hours. 
  Other important medical events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse eve nt 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and m ay require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event .  If less than [ADDRESS_751055] to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician .  The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done .  This init ialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame .  The 
criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event 
based upon  the available information .   
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more like ly the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance  assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9650], diary, etc), expected pharmacologic effect,  or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with  investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental 
factors  
 
IRB-[ADDRESS_751056] drug and the AE: (continued)  
to [COMPANY_006] 
product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the [COMPANY_006] product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive decha llenge .  If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improve d despi[INVESTIGATOR_110510]; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug  trial); or (4) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge .  If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a  single -dose drug trial); or 
(3) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVEN T WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN 
CAUSED BY [CONTACT_80086], OR IF REEXPOSURE TO THE MERCK PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL 
SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_64918] U.S .  CLINICAL 
MONITOR AS PER  DOSE MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL.  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the [COMPANY_006] product or drug cl ass pharmacology 
or toxicology?  
The asse ssment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, including 
consideration of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the fo llowing scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a [COMPANY_006] product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006] product 
relationship.  There is evidence of exposure to the [COMPANY_006] product .  The tempo ral sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the [COMPANY_006] product 
is reasonable .  The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_80087].  
No, there is not a reasonable 
possibility [COMPANY_006] product 
relationship  Subject did n ot receive the [COMPANY_006] product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the [COMPANY_006] product is not 
reasonable OR there is another obvious cause of the AE .  (Also entered for a subject with overdose without an associated AE.)  
All Adve rse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in accordance with all applicable global 
laws and regulations .

IRB-[ADDRESS_751060] Clinical Trials Directory compliance   
10.1  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring   
The investigato r or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated .  
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and duri ng the follow -up period 
according to NCI CTCAE version  4.0 (see Section  11.2) .  Toxicities will be characterized in terms 
regarding seriousness ;  causality ;  toxicity grading ;  and action taken with regard to trial treatment .   
For subjects receiving treat ment with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated with 
pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest 
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, o r irAEs) .   
Please refer to Section  7.2 for detailed information regarding the ass essment and recording of AEs .   
10.1.2   Full Physical Exam  
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening 
period .  Clinical ly significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history .  A full physical 
exam should be performed during screening,  
10.1.3   Directed Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigat or or 
qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial treatment 
administration.  
10.1.4   Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of 
each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section  6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight and blood 
pressure .  Height will be measured at screening only.  
10.1.5   Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section  11.1) at screening, prior to 
the administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart .   
10.1.[ADDRESS_751061] or MRI scanning according to the study calendar .  In cases where 
the disease is superficial and the investigator deems clinical exa mination is adequate to follow the 
NMSC, no imaging will be performed.  
10.1.7  Tumor Tissue Collection  
Archival specimens will be used when tumor is not accessible for biopsy prior to enrollment.  
Otherwise, tumor biopsy will be performed prior to enrollme nt, while on treatment (at Cycle 4), as well 
as at the end of treatment time point. However, based on investigator discretion and clinical judgement, 
the required biopsy time point at Cycle 4 can be completed prior to Cycle 4 depending upon tumor 
regressio n pattern(s) during the first few treatments.

12.6  Sample Size  
As this is an exploratory non -comparative study, statistics between the two groups was 
not performed. However, for practical purposes, prospective statistical design was based on a 
minimum ORR of 10% for all evaluable patients,  defined as the minimum clinically meaningful 
rate given potential risks of pembrolizumab exposure. Based on an estimated ORR of 30%, with 
two-sided alpha =0.05 (p<0.05) and power=0.84, the pre -determined sample size was [ADDRESS_751069] of mouth or 
paper advertisements.  
12.6.2  Sample size justification  
Consultation with Alex  McMillan,  PhD and Shufeng  Li, MS, both biostatisticians led to the 
following:  
This is a proof -of-concept study, phase  1b.  Because advanced basal cells carcinoma is a rare 
disease, this is a non -comparativ e study.  The primary and secondary endpoints are descriptive 
and the arms will not be compared.  The data from this study will be used to power future multi -
center studies.  
12.6.[ADDRESS_751070] size analysis.  
12.7 Criteria for future studies  
Success will be defined as 20% response rate for pembrolizumab monotherapy arm .  Currently, 
for patients with advanced BCC refractory or resistant to Smoothened monotherapy, there is no 
good treatment a nd all patients experience disease progress ion.

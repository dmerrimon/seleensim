Protocol Synopsis  
Title:  
Phase 2 Study of the Anti -Angiogenesis Agent Axitinib  (AG -013736) in Patients with Stage III Malignant Melanoma  
Rationale:  
Stage III malignant melanoma is defined by [CONTACT_532310] a local basin (TNM staging: Any T; N1,2 or 3; M0) and ha s a 
5 year survival rate of from 27 to 68%, indicating that is can often be an incurable and fatal disease for a significant proporti on of 
patients.  Surgical resection of the primary lesion and affected lymph nodes is the current standard of care. Although it would be of 
value to have an effective adjuvant therapy for this stage of disease, to date no treatment has led to significantly improved overall survival. While interferon has been applied with some benefit and can result in a significant prolongation in dis ease free survival, no 
overall survival benefit has been substantiated.  IFN and its pegylated version are both approved by [CONTACT_532311], but 
enthusiasm for their use is tempered by [CONTACT_532312].  Like IFN, chemotherapy has not  been demonstrated to prolong 
survival for stage III melanoma. New agents are required in order to improve the survival of patients with stage III melanoma .  
However, because large -scale clinical trials are often necessary to demonstrate the safety and eff ectiveness of a drug, it is desirable 
determine if new agents provide some measure of effectiveness of these new agents prior to investing in such studies.  Becaus e of the 
poor prognosis of patients with stage III melanoma and indications that anti -angioge nesis compounds might have clinically 
meaningful activity in this disease, a Phase  2 trial of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (VEGFR TK) 
inhibitor AG -013736 is warranted to determine its activity and tolerability for Stage I II melanoma.  
Indication:  
Stage III melanoma  
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is:  
• determine the response rate of axitinib in patients with Stage III melanoma as measured by [CONTACT_532313] T 
during the lead in phase. A response will also be considered to have occurred if there is a >/= 25% reduction in the involved nodal basin specific uptake value (SUV) on PET/CT (see Appendix C). 
Secondary objectives with are to:

Protocol: 03/21/16  
• determine progression -free survival (PFS)  
• determine the safety profile of axitinib  
• determine duration of response  
• determine overall survival  
• obtain blood samples for population pharmacokinetic analyses  
• explore relationships between clinical response and plasma soluble proteins  
• explore relationships between clinical response with tumor and host genomics  
 
Number of Subjects/Sites:  
Eighteen patients will be entered into the first stage of a 2 -stage Simon Minimax design.  If there is ≥ 1 response, 14 additional patients 
will be entered.  For a total of up to 32  may be treated in order to gain additional safety and activity information should the initial 
2-stage trial be positive at the end of Stage 2.   
Study Country Location:  
[LOCATION_002]  
Study Population:  
In order to be eligible for this study, patients must meet all eligibility criteria and have no exclusion criteria.  Major eligibility criteria include:  
• Histologically documented stage III melanoma with measurable lymph node involvement. 
• No more than prior  systemic therapy for Stage III melanoma.  (Prior adjuvant therapy with interferon for Stage II does not 
count as a prior therapy)  
• At least [ADDRESS_691134], that has not been irradiated.  
• Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal functi on documented within 14 days prior to treatment.  
• Age ≥ 18 years.

1. INTRODUCTION  
The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 68,720 new cases  of melanoma 
(29,900 in men and 25,200 in women) annually in the [LOCATION_002], and about 8,[ADDRESS_691147] a better prognosis.  Melanom as are often vascular, and a decrease in the number of 
blood vessels that supply the tumor may starve it of needed nutrients.  An approach to blocking 
the growth of blood vessels that supply the tumor is to inhibit the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase 
(VEGFR TK) signaling pathway.  Axitinib (AG -013736) is a VEGFR TK inhibitor.  Besides 
having potential anti -angiogenesis properties through VEGFR TK inhibition, it also has 
additional potential antitumor through platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) TK 
inhibition.  
Prior to development of a VEGFR TK inhibitor as a systemic treatment for melanoma, it is necessary to determine if this compound has sufficient antitumor activity to warrant large clinical trials to demonstrate clinical safety and efficacy.  Th is study is designed to provide clinical 
information on the VEGFR TK inhibitor AG -[ADDRESS_691148] arise 
in the skin.  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has designated staging by [CONTACT_20150] -
lymph node -metastasis (TNM) classification.3  Metastases may occur to lymph nodes and are 
designated N1 -N3, depe nding upon extent of disease.  Stage III disease is defined by [CONTACT_532316] a basin that drains the site of the primary 
tumor. Stage III has A,B and C subsets. Stage IIIA  is defined as T1a- 4a, N1a or N2a, M0:  The 
melanoma is not ulcerated. It has spread to 1 -3 lymph nodes near the affected skin area, but the 
nodes are not enlarged and the melanoma is found in lymph nodes only when they are viewed under the microscope. There is no distant spread. The thickness of the  melanoma is not a factor, 
although it is usually thick in people with stage III melanoma. Stage IIIB is defined by [CONTACT_532317]: 1. T1b -4b, N1a or N2a, M0: The melanoma is ulcerated. It has spread to 1 -3 lymph 
nodes near the affected skin area, but th e nodes are not enlarged and the melanoma is found only 
when they are viewed under the microscope. There is no distant spread. 2. T1a- 4a, N1b or N2b, 
M0: The melanoma is not ulcerated. It has spread to 1- 3 lymph nodes near the affected skin area. 
The nodes  are enlarged because of the melanoma. There is no distant spread.  3. T1a/b -4a/b, 
N2c, M0:  The melanoma can be ulcerated or not. It has spread to small areas of nearby [CONTACT_532318], but the nodes do not contain mela noma. There is 
no distant spread.  
Stage IIIC is defined in two categories: 1. T1b -4b, N1b or N2b, M0:  The melanoma is 
ulcerated. It has spread to 1 to 3 lymph nodes near the affected skin area. The nodes are enlarged 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 11 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
because of the melanoma. There is no d istant spread. 2. Any T, N3, M0:  The melanoma can be 
ulcerated or not. It has spread to 4 or more nearby [CONTACT_532319], OR to nearby [CONTACT_532320], OR it has spread to nearby [CONTACT_532321]. The nodes are enlarged because of the melanoma. There is no distant spread.  
Stage IV disease is defined by [CONTACT_532322] (M1) including to skin, subcutaneous tissues or distant lymph nodes (M1a); to the lung (M1b); or to other vi sceral sites or distant metastases to 
any site associated with an elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (M1c).  
1.2. Background on Axitinib, AG -[ADDRESS_691149] mediated by 
[CONTACT_453138]  2 (VEGFR -2; KDR) kinase 
activity.  AG -013736 is also a potent inhibitor of platelet -derived growth factor receptor beta 
(PDGFRβ), VEGFR -1 (flt -1), VEGFR -3, and c -kit. 
The AG -013736 dose for Phase 2 studies in solid tumors has been determined to be 5 mg twice 
daily (BID) given orally on an e mpty stomach based on results of the Phase [ADDRESS_691150].  (Kelly RJ , Rixe O . Axitinib -a selective inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) receptor.  Target Oncol.  [ADDRESS_691151] 30. [Epub ahead of print]). 
In phase I studies, the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) was hypertension, which was responsive to 
medications and was reversible with drug cessation. None of the patients receiving [ADDRESS_691152] antihypertensive medications. In ongoing 
clinical programs, subjects receive a starting dose of 5  mg bid with home monitoring of blood 
pressure (before each dose) and in -clinic monitoring at the time of schedu led visits. Patients who 
tolerate AG -[ADDRESS_691153] their dose increased by 20% unless the patient is 
responding to therapy. Bleeding events that have occurred among the phase I studies have 
included [ADDRESS_691154] 
hemorrhage, hematochezia, rectal hemorrhage, and vaginal hemorrhage. Asymptomatic proteinuria was seen in early studies and consequently, the phase I protocol was amended to exclude subjects with proteinuria at baseline (>500  mg/24  h) and to require dose modifications of 
axitinib on the basis of proteinuria. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as a 5 mg bid starting dose.  
In the phase II study conducted in m etastatic renal cell carcinoma (Rixe O, Bukowski RM, 
Michaelson MD et al (2007) Axitinib treatment in patients with cytokine -refractory metastatic 
renal -cell cancer: a phase II study. Lancet Oncol 8:975 –984), axitinib was gi ven as a single agent 
and toxicities are reported in Table  1
.

Protocol: 03/21/16  
 All grades (number of patients)  Grades 3 –4, (number of patients)  
Diarrhea  [ADDRESS_691155] commonly reported treatment related adverse events of severity grade 3 or higher were hypertension (14%), fatigue (10%), diarrhea (4%), palmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome 
(3%), hypertension aggravated (2%), and stomatitis (2%). Laboratory abnormalities for subjects with solid tumors who received single -agent axitinib were grade 3/4 hyperglycemia in 5.5%, 
hyponatremia or elevation in creatinine in 4.6%, elevations in AST in 4.0%, and proteinuria in 0.8%. Hematological abnormalities were grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 0.8% and thrombocytopenia in 1.0%. Grade 3/4 lymphopenia was reported in 19%. Preliminary evidence suggests that axitinib is safe and has a side- effect pr ofile that gives an advantage over other antiangiogenic 
drugs. The continuous administration and the constant dose appear to be safe, and compatible with long -term administration. In the phase II RCC study, patients have received axitinib for 
more than 3 years, with the absence of cumulative toxicity [Rixe O, Bukowski RM, Michaelson 
MD et al (2007) Axitinib treatment in patients with cytokine -refractory metastatic renal -cell 
cancer: a phase II study. Lancet Oncol 8:975 –984].

Protocol: 03/21/[ADDRESS_691156] clinically meaningful 
activity
11-13, a Phase 2 trial of the VEGFR TK inhibitor AG -013736 (axitinib) is warranted.  
Part of this study is to explore the relationship between tumor biomarkers before and after therapy as a predictor of t umor response.  Patients will be required to have undergone a 
diagnostic biopsy of a melanoma lesion before receiving AG -013736 and at the time of 
enrolment be amenable to providing pathologic material obtained after initial therapy at the time of lymph node resection.   
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the activity of AG -013736 in metastatic 
melanoma as measured by [CONTACT_532323] (CR) and partial response (PR) by [CONTACT_393]. A response wil l also be considered to have occurred if there is a >/= 25% reduction in the involved 
nodal basin specific uptake value (SUV) on PET/CT (see Appendix C). Secondary objectives are to: 
• Progression free survival  
• determine the safety profile of AG -013736  
• deter mine duration of response  
• determine overall survival  
• obtain blood samples for population pharmacokinetic analyses  
• explore relationships between clinical response and plasma soluble proteins  
• explore relationships between clinical response with host and tumor genomics  
3. METHODs  
3.1. Study Design  
This will be a 2 -stage Minimax, Phase 2, open- label study of the investigational anti-
angiogenesis agent AG -013736 in patients with locally metastatic stage III melanoma.  
Patients will be consented at the time of diagnosis of stage III disease based on clinical or biopsy results. After obtaining a baseline PET/CT, patients will undergo 2 months of therapy with axitinib. Response will be determined by [CONTACT_532324] /CT after two months of initial therapy.

changes of >25% in the target lesion is considered progression, an SUV change less than 25% higher or less than 25% lower will be considered stable  disease, while a decrease in the SUV

The reason for a patient’s discontinuation from treatment will be documented in the CRF. 
Patients who do not receive drug after registration or who have the incorrect histological cancer 
type will be replaced.  Patients who discontinue the study prematurely will not be replaced.  All efforts should be made to continue to follow a patient to document disease progression and survival if he/she withdrew from study treatment for reasons other than progr essive disease or 
death.  
3.4. Life Style Guidelines  
During the study female patients of childbearing potential must take precautions to prevent pregnancy since the effects on the fetus are unknown.  Male patients with partners of childbearing potential must take precautions to prevent pregnancy of the partner since the effects 
of these drugs on sperm are unknown.  These restrictions should remain in force for [ADDRESS_691167] information for study personnel is provided in Appendix E. 
3.5.1.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination including the assessment of all body systems, the measurement of body weight, height, pulse, temperature, and assessment of ECOG performance status (see Appendix D) will be performed prior to the first  dose.  After the initial complete examination, 
targeted examinations based on signs and symptoms may be performed.  All examinations must be performed by [CONTACT_532327].  Findings of all physical examinations should be recorded in the  source documents, and any change from baseline considered by [CONTACT_532328].

Protocol: 03/21/16  
3.5.3.  Hematology  
The following hematology tests will be performed at the intervals described in the Schedule of 
Tests and Procedures Table:  hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), white blood cell count with differential (WBC w/diff), an d platelets.  Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time 
(PTT) will be done at baseline and then as clinically indicated.  
3.5.4.  Clinical Chemistry  
The following clinical chemistry tests will be performed at the intervals d escribed in the 
Schedule of Tests and Procedure Table:  blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, sodium (Na+), 
potassium  (K+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO 3-) or CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, or SG PT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST, or SGOT), total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, glucose, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3 and T4, spot urine protein and spot urine creatinine.  
3.5.5.  Urinalysis  
The following urinalysis w ill be performed by [CONTACT_532329]:  protein, glucose, and blood.  Patients with ≥ 2+ 
proteinuria will have protein quantitated by 24- hour urine protein determination.  As cli nically 
indicated, microscopic examination of the urinary sediment should be performed. 
3.5.6.  Blood Sample for Soluble Proteins  
Plasma samples will be collected according to the schedule in the Table of Tests and Procedures to assess levels of soluble proteins in order to explore correlations with efficacy and biologic activity.  Instructions for collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_532301]  F. 
3.5.7.  Tumor Biopsies and Blood Sample for Gene Profilin g 
Lymph node biopsies are requested for pharmacogenomic analysis as it may relate to the clinical response. Expression of genes in the tumor may change as a result of the treatment and these changes may reflect the characteristics of tumors that respond to  treatment with AG -013736.  
Lymph node resection will be performed following the completion of neoadjuvant therapy.  The whole blood sample is used to explore the relationship between clinical response (tumor regression and/or toxicity) and individual gene tics.  This sample is requested of all patients, but 
not required as part of patient eligibility.  These samples will be anonymized and will be disposed of after study analyses are completed.  The tumor and peripheral blood samples will be used to analyze expression of RNA as they may relate to clinical response (tumor regression 
and/or toxicity) to AG -013736.  No other studies will be performed with these samples.   
The samples will not be made available to anyone not associated with this study or external  
investigators.  All materials will be destroyed immediately after analysis.  No genetic material will be stored.  The samples will be identified by [CONTACT_532330], date of birth or other information will not be used on sample tube.

at the same imaging site for consistency.   Transfer of tumor assessment images will be done electronically whenever possible.  The tumor assessments will be formally evaluated within 2 weeks of receipt by [CONTACT_55899].  As part of tum or assessments, exploratory studies of volumetric 
determinations of individual lesions and other methods of measuring tumor size may be performed.  
 
3.5.9.  Timing of Procedures  
The minimum required prestudy, on study, and follow up eva luations are summarized in the 
Schedule of Tests and Procedures Table.  Other parameters and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed depending on the findings during the study.  Assessments should be performed on schedule , but a window of +/ -4 days is permitted for 
holidays, vacations, and other administrative reasons. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Screening Procedures  
All patients being considered for the study and eligible for screening must sign an informed consent for t he study prior to any study -specific procedures. Subjects should be screened to 
determine if they are healthy enough to go back on the investigational agent. Following completion of the pretreatment assessments and confirmation of eligibility by [CONTACT_532331], patients may be treated.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  On-study Procedures  
Patients will receive dosing of AG -013736 as outpatients.  Clinic visits will be performed, and 
hematology, clinical chemistry and other safety laboratory tests will be done as shown in the Schedule of Tests and Procedures Table.  If significant toxicity (CTC Grade ≥3) is encountered, subsequent assessments may be performed as necessary to evaluate the specific toxicity until it resolves to baseline or CTC Grade  ≤1.  Addi tional clinic visits may be required at the discretion 
of the investigator.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  End of Study Procedures  
The primary reason for a patient’s discontinuation of the test drug will be clearly documented on the CRF.  Assessments should be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Tests and Procedures Table.

Each serious adverse event (SAE) must be reported to [COMPANY_007] using the contact [CONTACT_532332] A.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Follow -Up 
If the participant, or their partner, become pregnant during the study or within 90 days (180 days for males) after they have stopped taking the study drug, they will be asked to  inform the Lead Researcher immediately.   They will also be requested to  inform the doctor who will be taking 
care of them or their partner during the pregnancy that they or their partner  took part in this study.   The study doctor will ask if they, or their partner or their pregnancy doctor would be 
willing to provide updates on the progress of the pregnancy and its outcome.  If they/their 
partner/their pregnancy doctor agree, this information will be provided to the study sponsor for safety monitoring follow -up. 
 
 
3.6. Study Completion  
The study will be complete when all patients have discontinued study medication and have been 
followed to progression, death, withdrawal, or have been lost to follow -up or [ADDRESS_691172].  All patients should be followed for progression and survival until the study is complete.  Patients who are still being treated at the completion of the study and are deriving benefit may continue treatment under a separate continuat ion protocol. 
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue d evelopment of AG -[ADDRESS_691173] be documented.  
In terminating the study, the investigators will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interest.

4.2.6.  Dose Interruptions and Modification  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Interruption and Reduction  
Adverse events and other symptoms will be graded according to the current Common Terminology for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAEv4) (se e URL:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
).  This section contains management of adverse events 
except hypertension, hemoptysis and proteinuria that are discussed in subsequent sections.  
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a treatment -related CTC Grade 2 adverse event that is subjectively 
intolerable (except alopecia) and cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_532334] -started at the same dose after resolution to CT C Grade ≤ 1 or 
baseline.  If resolution does not occur within 4 weeks, the patient should be removed from the 
study.  
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a treatment -related Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse event (except for 
alopecia) that cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_532335].  
Patients with a treatment- related Grade [ADDRESS_691177] treatment interrupted.  Appropriate follow -up assessments 
will be done until recovery to less than or equal to CTC Grade 1 or baseline occurs.  Upon adequate recovery, treatment can be resumed at a 20% lower dose, rounded down to accommodate dosage form availability.   If resolution does not occur within [ADDRESS_691178] 2 separate occasions, despi[INVESTIGATOR_44782], will resume dosing  at a 20% lower dose once adequate recovery is achieved.  
If any patient requires more than [ADDRESS_691179] the sponsor for discussion prior to removing the patient from the study.  Patients removed from treatment for intolerable toxicity should still be followed for disease progression and survival. 
The criteria for dose modification for study drug related adverse events is summarized in the 
table below:

CTC Grade ≤ 1 or baseline  
CTC Grade ≥3 nonhematologic  toxicity that is

not controlled by [CONTACT_532339]; re -start at 20% lower dose after resolution 
to CTC Grade ≤ 1 or baseline  
 
Guidelines for dose reductions f or specific adverse events are provided in the following sections. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  AG-013736 Dose Reduction for Hypertension  
Patients treated with AG -013736 will be followed every two weeks in the clinic to monitor blood 
pressure. Patients wil l also be instructed to measure their blood pressure (BP) at home when 
feasible.  All blood pressure measurements will be recorded in a diary and brought to the nurse 
or study coordinator at each clinic visit.  Patients will be counseled by [CONTACT_532340] (eg, headache, visual disturbance).  
New or additional antihypertensive therapy  (see Section 4.3, Concomitant Medication(s) for 
guidance) should be started if [ADDRESS_691180] 1 hour, show the following: 2 systolic blood pressure readings greater than 150 or 2 diastolic blood pressure readings greater than 100 mm Hg.  Alternately, the dose of existing antihypertensive 
medication(s) may be increased.  Furthermore, the early initiation of antihypertensive agents for Grade 1 and Grade  2 hypertension in order to minimize the occurrence of more severe or 
persistent hypertension while undergoing treatment with AG -013736 will not constitute a 
Grade 3 toxicity.  
Patients on maximal antihypertensive treatment (eg, 4 antihypertensive medications given for 2 weeks) who have [ADDRESS_691181] treatment with AG -013736 held.  (Note:  if study drug is held, patients receiving 
antihypertensive medications shoul d be monitored closely for hypotension.)   Blood pressure

Protocol: 03/21/16  
measurements used for AG -013736- discontinuation decision- making should be done in the 
clinic.  Treatment with AG -013736 may be restarted at approximately 20% lower dose, rounded 
down to accommodate d osage form availability, after the systolic blood pressure reduces to less 
than [ADDRESS_691182] treatment with AG -013736 held.  (Note:  if study drug is held, patients receiving 
antihypertensive medications should be monitored closely for hypotension.)  Blood pressure 
measurements used for AG -013736- interruption decision- making should be done in the clinic.  
Treatment with AG -013736 may be restarted at the previous dose after the systolic blood 
pressure reduces to less than 150 and the diastolic blood pressure reduces to less than 100. 
Guidance on dose interruption and reduction for hypertension is summarized in the table below.

[IP_ADDRESS].  AG-013736 Dose Reduction for Hemoptysis  
Bleeding from the lungs will be graded according to the Hemorrhage category of CTC. 
Treatment with AG -013736 will be discontinued for hemoptysis of Grade 1 or greater.  If 
Grade 1 hemoptysis resolves within 1 week, treatment with AG -013736 may continue at the 
current dose level.  Patients who experience Grade 1 hemoptysis that does not resolve within 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 25 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
1 week or who experience Grade 2 or greater hemoptysis at any time should be taken off study 
and not receive further AG -013736.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  AG-013736 Dose Reduction for Proteinuria  
At documentation of ≥ 2+ proteinuria by [CONTACT_5230], patients should have a 24 -hour urine collection 
for total protein.  Alternatively, the urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) will be evaluated to determine if it is >2. AG -[ADDRESS_691187] re sults.  
If <2 g proteinuria/24 hours is reported, or the UPCR is </= 2, patients may continue AG -013736 
treatment without dose reduction. 
If proteinuria > 2g/24 hours but ≤ 3.5 g/24 hours or a UPC between 2 and 3.5 is reported, 
treatment with AG -013736 may c ontinue at a 20% lower dose, rounded down to accommodate 
dosage form availability.  A 24- hour urine collection for total protein and creatinine clearance 
must be performed every 4 weeks to monitor the degree of proteinuria until it has decreased to 
<2 g/24 hours.  Once the urinary protein is below 2 g/24 hours, urine dipstick determinations may be used.  
If UPC is >3.5 or the 24 hour urine shows >3.5 g proteinuria/24 hours is reported, treatment with AG-013736 should be suspended.  Twenty -four hour urine col lection for total protein and 
creatinine clearance should be done weekly until results show <2 g proteinuria/24 hours, or a UPC <2, at which time treatment with AG -013736 may be restarted at a 20% lower dose, 
rounded down to accommodate dosage form availability.  Patients, once restarted on AG -
013736, will have weekly monitoring for proteinuria by [CONTACT_325270] (eg, dipstick) as long as the proteinuria reading is 2+ or higher, or, alternatively, by [CONTACT_532341] > 1 g/24 hours.  The 24- hour urine collection to monitor the degree of proteinuria 
should be repeated every 4 weeks until it has decreased to <500 mg/24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Escalation  
Patients who tolerate AG -[ADDRESS_691188] their dose increased by 20% unless the 
patient is responding to therapy.  
Once a patient has a dose reduction for study drug related toxicity, the dose normally will not be re-escalated.  However, patients who tolerate the lower dose without toxicities above Grade [ADDRESS_691189] 8 weeks may be considered for re- escalation.  The investigator and sponsor’s medical 
monitor will discuss the case and decide if re -escalation is appropriate.  
Dose escalation to a maximum of 10 mg BID will be considered for patients without an elevation of diastolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg in Cycle 1 or other significant drug- related 
toxicities.

Protocol: 03/21/16  
4.3. Concomitant Medicat ion(s) 
Palliative and supportive care for disease -related symptoms will be offered to all patients on this 
trial.  Low -dose oral steroids (defined as <5 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) or topi[INVESTIGATOR_532304].  No other chemotherapy, hormonal 
therapy, radiotherapy, or experimental anticancer medications will be permitted while the patient 
is on study.  Any disease progression requiring other forms of specific anticancer therapy will be cause for disconti nuation from study treatment.  
In vitro studies with human liver microenzymes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes  indicated 
that AG -013736 metabolism was primarily mediated by [CONTACT_33641] -metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, 
and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2.  Additionally, t he drug also undergoes N -glucuronidation in 
liver microsomes of some species.  Clinically, there is likelihood that AG -013736 plasma 
concentrations may be increased in the presence of co -administered potent inhibitors of the 
CYP3A and glucuronosyltransfera se enzymes.  The potential exists for drug- drug interactions 
with CYP3A inhibitors such as grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, verapamil, ergot derivatives, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, 
nelfinavir, l opi[INVESTIGATOR_054], and delavirdine.  Caution should be exercised in patients receiving 
AG-013736 in combination with these and other potent CYP3A inhibitors until appropriate 
clinical drug interaction studies are performed.  
AG-013736 metabolism may be induced in pa tients taking CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inducers 
(carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, and St John’s wort) and this may reduce AG -013736 plasma concentrations.  
Patients who require concomita nt treatment with CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inducers are not eligible 
for the study.  Since CYP1A2 is also known to be induced in chronic smokers, there is likelihood 
that AG -013736 plasma concentrations may be reduced in these individuals. 
The ability of AG -013736 to increase concentrations of coadministered drugs was also 
investigated in studies with human liver microsomes.  At expected therapeutic plasma 
concentrations (0.01 to 1.0 μg/mL), AG -[ADDRESS_691190] likely to inhibit the drug 
metabolizing enzymes CYP 1A2 and CYP2C8, 2 enzymes not frequently observed as 
predominant drug metabolizing enzymes.  Paclitaxel, theophylline, and tacrine are among the few drugs whose plasma concentrations are likely to be increased by [CONTACT_147248] -013736. 
AG-013736 is highly bound to proteins in human plasma (99.5% bound at concentrations of 
0.2 to 20 μg/mL).  Therefore, drug interactions with other agents that are also highly bound to 
plasma proteins are a possibility.  
Patients who need to be on chronic antacid therapy with histamine H
2 antagonists (eg, cimetidine 
[Tagamet®], famotidine [Pepcid®], nizatidine [Axid®], ranitidine [Zantac®]), proton- pump 
inhibitors (eg, lansoprazole [Prevacid®], rabeprazole [Aciphex®], pantoprazole [Protonix®], and 
esomeprazole [Nexium®]), or locally acting antacids (eg, Maalox®, Milk of Magnesia®, 
Amphojel®) should stagger the timing of their AG -013736 and antacid dosing.  Patients should 
avoid use of antacids for 2 hours before through 2 hours after taking AG -013736 tablets.  Note, 
however, that patients ta king the proton- pump inhibitor omeprazole (Prilosec®) are not eligible

All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as interventions (eg, analgesic use or paracentesis) received by [CONTACT_532342]. 
4.4. Salvage Therapy  
Patients who progress or who cannot tolerate therapy should be considered for other therapy as appropriate.  
5. Safety reporting  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be evaluable for safety.  Investigators and all appropriate staff should review and have access to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, published May 28, 2009  by [CONTACT_205749] (NCI), which can be downloaded from the NCI website <http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
>. The reported AE term and CTC severity grade 
should correspond to the term and severity grade included in the relevant source document/clinic chart.  The investigator must endeavor to obtain sufficient information to determine the causality of the adverse event (i.e., study drug, other illness, progressive malignancy , etc.) and must 
provide his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_532305].  
5.1. Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of suspected causal relationship to the investigation al product(s) will be recorded on the adverse event page(s) of the case report form 
(CRF).  
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 28 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
designated representative (see Section 5.4).  For all adverse events, sufficient information should 
be obtained by [CONTACT_532343].  The investigator 
is required to assess causality and indicate that assessment on the CRF.  Follow -up of the adverse 
event, after the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the adverse event or its sequelae persist.  Follow -up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level 
acceptable to the investigator and the [COMPANY_007] medical monitor. 
5.2. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical  occurrence in a clinical investigation subject  
administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not limited to:   
• Abnormal test fin dings;  
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs; 
• Changes in physical examination findings;  
• Hypersensitivity;  
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease;  
• Lack of effect.  
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  
• Drug overdose;  
• Drug withdrawal; 
• Drug abuse;  
• Drug misuse;  
• Drug interactions; 
• Drug dependency;  
• Exposure  in utero. 
Lack of or insufficient clinical response, benefit, efficacy, or therapeutic effect should not be 
recorded as an adverse event.  Progression of the malignancy under study should not be reported as an adverse event.  However, if the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the trial or within the safety reporting period, then disease progression must be recorded as an adverse event (and an SAE with CTC grade 5 (see S ection 5.6, Severity Assessment).  
5.3. Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal  objective test finding should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows:  
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 29 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or  other therapy, and/or  
• Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_4687]. 
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that i s determined to be an error does not 
require reporting as an adverse event.  
5.4. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening; 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised  in determining whether an event is an 
important medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening 
and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject and may r equire intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
5.5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_532306].  Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility meets this criteria.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:  
• Rehabilitation facilities; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 30 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);  
• Skilled nursing fa cilities; 
• Nursing homes;  
• Routine emergency room admissions;  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
adverse event is not in itself a S erious Adverse Event.  Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development 
of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for work- up 
of persistent pre -treatment lab abnorm ality);  
• Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);  
• Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam); 
• Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_234150]); 
• Optional admission not associa ted with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (eg, for 
elective cosmetic surgery);  
• Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject;  
• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should b e reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the adverse event.  
5.6. Severity Assessment  
As required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the following definitions of Severity in accordance with Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 3.0, December 12, 2003) to describe the 
maximum intensity of the adverse event.  If the event is serious, the CTC grade reported in the adverse event CRF must be consistent with the description of CTC grade included in the narrative section of the serious adverse event report.  
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 31 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
GRADE  Clinical Description of Severity  
0  No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not 
included in the Version 3.0 document but may be used in certain circumstances.)  
1 MILD AE  
2 MODERATE AE  
3 SEVERE AE 
4 LIFE -THREATENING OR DISABLING AE  
5 DEATH RELATED TO AE  
 
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.  
5.7. Exposure In Utero  
An exposure  in-utero  (EIU) occ urs if a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while 
receiving or having been exposed to (eg, environmental) an investigational medication or product, or the female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational medication or product. 
If any trial subject becomes or is found to be pregnant while receiving an investigational 
medication/product, the investigator must submit this information to [COMPANY_007] medical monitor on an Exposure in Utero For m.  This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has 
occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to induced terminat ion 
of pregnancy).  
The investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy or until pregnancy termination (ie, induced abortion) and then notify [COMPANY_007] medical monitor of the outcome.  The investigator will provide this information as a  follow up to the initial Exposure in Utero Form.  
The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  An EIU report is not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable.  Rather, an SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious adverse event (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events. 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 32 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (ie, 
no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an Exposure in 
Utero Form can be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_4692], unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  
Additional  information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as serious adverse events 
follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_691194] 
to caus ality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month that 
the investigator assesses as possibly related to the in utero exposure to the investigational 
medication should be reported. 
•  
5.8. Discontinuations (See also Subject Withdrawal, Section 3.3) 
The reason for a subject discontinuing from the trial will be recorded in the CRF.  A discontinuation occurs when an enrolled subject ceases participation in the study, regardless of the circumstances, prior to completion of the protocol.  The investigator must determine the primary reason for discontinuation.  Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response, according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate adverse event CRF page.   
When a discontinuation is due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.  
5.9. Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_167334].  In addition, each trial subject will be questioned about adverse events at each clini c visit following initiation of treatment.  The question asked 
will be “Since your last clinic visit you began taking the investigational medication have you had any health problems?”  
5.10.  Reporting Requirements (Serious and Nonserious)  
Each adverse event is to be classified by [CONTACT_532344].  This classification determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and internat ional regulations, as appropriate.  
SAEs are reportable from the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s participation in the clinical trial, ie, prior to undergoing any trial- related 
procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_691195].  Any serious adverse event occurring at any 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 33 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/[ADDRESS_691196] be promptly reported if a causal relationship to 
study drug is suspected.  
If a serious adverse event occurs, the [COMPANY_007] centralized SAE reporting system (see Appendix A) is to be notified within [ADDRESS_691197] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on 
previously forwarded serious adverse event reports. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient trial subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.  
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the [COMPANY_007] cen tralized SAE reporting system in accordance with the timeframes for reporting 
specified above.  In addition, an investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_532345] -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information may be more detailed than that captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and ind ependent determination of possible causality.  
Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided.  In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must 
be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided.  An investigator’s c ausality 
assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigationa l product caused or contributed to an adverse event.  If the investigator’s final 
determination of causality is unknown and the investigator does not know whether or not study drug caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to study drug”  for reporting 
purposes.  If the investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to study drug", 
this should be clearly documented on study records.  In addition, if the investigator determines the adverse event is associated with trial pro cedures, the investigator must record this causal 
relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable.   
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  It should be noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of serious adverse event information. 
Nonserious adverse events are to be reported on the adverse event CRFs, which are to be 
submitted to [COMPANY_007] as specified in the adverse event report submission procedure for this protocol.

Protocol: 03/21/[ADDRESS_691198], irrespective of any intervening treatment.  
5.11.  Abnormal Physical Examination Findings  
Clinically significant changes, in the judgment of the investigator, in physical examination findings (abnormalities) will be recorded as adverse events.  
6. DAT A ANALYSIS/ST ATISTICAL METHODS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will 
be documented in an Analysis Plan, which will be dated and maintained by [CONTACT_456].  This documentation may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; howeve r, any major modifications 
of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
6.1. Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations  
6.1.1.  Sample Size  
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.  This information would then be used to recommend further study of AG -013736 in 
this indication if favorable results occur.  Implicit in this objective is the need to minimize the number of patients exposed to AG -013736 when unfavorable results occur.  
These objectives are met through the use of a 2 -stage Minimax design for Phase  2 protocols as 
discussed by [CONTACT_52254].
11  The 2 -stage design is used for testing hypotheses about the true response 
rate P.  For each indication, we define p 0, a response rate at which or below we consider 
AG-013736 to be ineffective or clinically unimportant, and p 1, a minimum response rate that 
would merit further clinical development.  The null hypothesis, H o, is P  ≤po.  The alternate 
hypothesis, H 1, is P ≥ p1. 
The indication being studied in this protocol responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy.  
Therefore, p 0 and p 1 are set at low response rates of 5% and 20%, respectively.  The α and β  error 
rates are set at 0.10  and 0.10, respectively.  These criteria result in a sample size for each stage of 
18 and 14 patients (based on PASS 2002 software). 
If enrolment to this study is stopped and AG -013736 is rejected at any stage because of la ck of 
efficacy, the probability of falsely rejecting it is <0.10  when the true response rate is ≥ 20%.  At 
the end of Stage 2, if AG -[ADDRESS_691199] the agent is <0.10  when the true response rate  is ≤5%.  If the true response probability is 
≤5%, there is approximately a 40% probability of terminating patient enrolment during Stage 1. 
However, if the true response probability is ≥20%, then there is only a 1.8% probability that a drug will be discar ded erroneously in Stage 1.  
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 35 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
Up to 28 additional patients (for a total of up to 32) may be treated in order to gain additional 
safety and activity information  should the trial be positive at the end of Stage 2.  Their safety 
and efficacy data will be summar ized with all other patients at the end of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Stage 1  
Initially, 18  patients with the indication and treated with AG -013736 will be evaluated for 
response (CR or PR).  Once [ADDRESS_691200] been started on treatment, enrolment will be temporarily suspended to allow for treatment and evaluation of these patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Stage 2  
In Stage 2, 14 additional patients will be enrolled and treated, to a total sample size of 32  treated 
patients.  If 4 or more responses (CR or PR) are documented among these [ADDRESS_691201] 
1 of the following conditions is met:  
• If 4 or more confirmed responses (CR or PR) are documented among the first [ADDRESS_691202] patient enrolled.  The final analysis will occur sooner if the study is discontinued due to lack of cli nical response;  
• If the study is expanded to derive further information on safety and activity to be used to 
aid in the design of additional studies with AG -[ADDRESS_691203] patient enrolled.  
• The study is complete as defined in Section 3.6.  
6.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The primary efficacy parameter is the overall r esponse rate.  All patients who receive at least 
[ADDRESS_691204] a baseline assessment of disease will be included in the analysis.  
Patients who were inadvertently enrolled (eg, patients who are determined to have the incorrect 
histological c ancer type after receiving a dose of medication, based on their screening disease 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 36 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
assessment) will be excluded from analyses and will be replaced.  The overall response rate is 
defined to be the percentage of patients with a confirmed CR or PR.  Patients w ho die, progress, 
or drop out for any reason after receiving a dose of AG -[ADDRESS_691205] party will be considered the primary data.  Additionally, the primary analyses 
for these endpoints will be based on the data collected from the disease assessment method(s) used starting at baseline to follow a patient’s lesions.  If PET s cans or ultrasound is used on some 
patients during study who are believed to have central tumor necrosis or intratumor bleeding, these data and any subsequently collected lesion assessment data will not be used in the primary analyses but may be used in ex ploratory analyses of response rate, duration of response and 
progression- free survival.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Analyses  
The response rate (CR or PR) will be provided with an exact 95% 2- sided confidence interval 
calculated using a method bas ed on the F  distribution.  For the definition of the response 
categories, see Appendix C.  
6.2.2.  Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
The secondary efficacy parameters are:  
The progression free survival.  
After discontinuing the study medica tion, patients may  be treated with additional therapy.  Data 
collected after patients have been treated with additional therapy will not be used for efficacy 
analyses except for survival.

categories, see Appendix C.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Progression -free survival (PFS)  
All patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_691206] a baseline assessment of disease 
will be included in the analysis.  Patients who were inadvertently enrolled (eg, patients who are

based on their screening disease assessment) will be excluded from analyses.  
PFS is defined as the difference in days between the first date that criteria for pr ogression were 
met or the patient died and the date of first dose of AG -013736.  Since the day of first dose and 
the day criteria for progression were met (or the patient died) are each counted as a full day, [ADDRESS_691208] study date that objective tumor assessments 
verified lack of disease progression.

will include: description of the event, duration, whether the AE was serious, intensity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and clinical outcome.  Intensity (severity) of the AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE v4.0.  Emphasis in the analysis will be placed on AEs 
classified as treatment emergent.  
Summary tables will present the number of patients observed with AEs and corresponding percentages.  The denominator used to calculate incidence percentages consists of  patients 
receiving at least 1 dose of study medication.  Within each table, the AEs will be categorized by [CONTACT_532347].  Additional subcategories will be based on event intensity and relationship to study drug.  
Individual patient  listings will be prepared for all AE data.  Summary tables for extent of 
exposure to study medication will also be provided. 
6.2.5.  Clinical Laboratory Analysis  
Listing tables will be prepared for each laboratory measure, and will be  structured to permit 
review of the data by [CONTACT_532348].  
Summary tables will be prepared to examine the distribution of laboratory measures over time.  Shift tables may be provided to examine the distribution of laboratory toxicit ies. 
6.2.6.  Analysis of Soluble Proteins  
Plasma soluble protein will be assessed using 1 or more methods available at the time of the analyses.  Possible technologies that are currently being explored include proprietary antibody coated analysis chips and laser excited mass spectroscopy.  Plasma levels of soluble proteins (including but not limited to VEGF, placental growth factor [PlGF], and soluble VEGFR2 [sVEGFR2], and Thrombospondin- 1) may be associated with angiogenesis or tum or physiology 
and may correlate with efficacy or biological activity.  However, other unidentified proteins may also correlate.  While samples will be taken on all patients, assays may only be performed if stage [ADDRESS_691212] for clinical response.

6.2.7.  Gene Profil ing 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Tumor Samples  
Tumor biopsy samples will be obtained when possible in order to develop primary tumor cell 
lines for studies directed at the identification of sensitive and resistant biomarkers. Gene profiles will be generated on cell lines using microarrays that have about 25,[ADDRESS_691213] responded (or at least regressed) and those that remained stable or progressed.  The set of genes that may be associated with the clinical response will be further confirmed by [CONTACT_937] -PCR method. In vitro cell cultures will also be tested for 
response to antiangiogenesis agents in vitro.  
7. OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES  
A UC Irvine data safety monitoring board will review safety data consisting of the reported adverse events, discontinuations and mortality that occur during the course of the protocol.  The DSMB will evaluate the safety of the program using available data from the clinical and SAE databases on a 6 month basis, or more frequently if a safety issue arises.  Based on the data review, the  committee will make recommendations as to whether any modifications of the trial 
are warranted.

Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 43 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/[ADDRESS_691215] of an audit by a regulatory agency (eg, FDA) within the local 
government.  The subject’s identity will re main protected except as required for legal or 
regulatory inquiries.  
2.4. Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) Review and Approval of the Study  
An IRB/EC, that is organized and operates according to GCP and appl icable laws and 
regulations, should safeguard the rights, safety, and well -being of all trial subjects.  No subject 
should be admitted to a trial before the IRB/EC issues its written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_124686].  
The investigator is responsible for:  
• Promptly reporting to the IRB/EC all changes in the research activity and all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others;  
• Submitting a progress report describing the status of the clinical investigation to the IRB/EC at appropr iate intervals not exceeding 1  year.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_532307]; 
• Submitting a final progress report to the IRB/EC (if requested) following completion, termination, or discontinuation of the study.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_532308]; 
• Handling all communications with the IRB/EC regarding the study of a [COMPANY_007]  Inc drug;  
• Providing a copy of all communications from the IRB/EC to the investigator regarding its 
review of and initial approval of the study and its reapprovals to the [COMPANY_007]  Inc Site 
Monitor; and 
• Documenting and retaining in the institution the identification codes, names, and 
randomization numbers (where applicable) for all trial participants.  
2.5. Clinical Evaluations  Not Specified in the Protocol  
Procedures not specified in the protocol can be conducted only if required for the successful 
management of a subject.  Additional procedures not related to management of safety parameters must be approved by [CONTACT_532352] C linical/Medical Colleague . 
2.6. Monitoring, Verification of Data, Audit, and Inspection  
The Lead Investigator is to ensure that the trial participants are aware of and consent that personal information may be reviewed during the data verification process as part of monitoring/auditing by [CONTACT_532353].  In addition, participation and personal information is treated as confidential to the extent the applicable law permits and not publicly available.  The audit or

Protocol: 03/21/[ADDRESS_691216] been met.  
If the lead investigator leaves the institution at which the study has been conducted, he/she or 
current representative must contact [CONTACT_532354], including a copy of the master subject log, are retained as specified above and to provide for the continuing acces s to the records by [CONTACT_532355].  
3.2. Guidelines for Recording Data in the Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The completed CRF is a legal document as it is intended for submission to a regulatory agency as part of a regulatory submission.  
In compliance with Good Clinical Practice; the medical records/medical notes, etc, should be clearly marked and permit easy identification of participation by [CONTACT_532356].  In some cases, data may be recorded directly onto a CRF instead of medical 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 45 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
records/medical notes and will be considered source documentation.  The sponsor will 
communicate to the investigator any CRFs that will serve as source documentation for the study.  
The investigator is to record all data with respect to protocol procedures, drug administration, laboratory data, safety data, and efficacy ratings using CRFs or other data collection methods designed by [CONTACT_4618].  The investigator’s signature [CONTACT_532361].  All electronic records and electronic signatures must comply with applicable laws and regulations governing electronic data systems (eg, FDA  21CFR11). 
All corrections on a CRF and on source documents must be made in a way that does not obscure the original entry.  The correct data must be inserted, dated, and initialed/authorized by [CONTACT_26271].  
4. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
All amendments to the protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_532357], [COMPANY_007]  Inc, and the 
IRB/EC of the investigator’s institution.  The investigator is responsible for submitting any proposed change in the approved protocol in writing to the IRB/EC for review and approval and for sending a copy of the approval to Pf izer Inc.   
With the exception of amendments immediately implemented for safety reasons, the amendment will apply to all subjects entered into the study (or all subjects in affected sites for a country or site amendment) after it has gone through the appli cable procedure described above and been 
approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.   
If the amendment eliminates an apparent immediate safety hazard to the subject (urgent protocol amendment), it may be implemented immediately.  The lead investigator will notify his/her IRB/EC of the change in writing within 5  working days of its implementation.

Protocol: 03/21/[ADDRESS_691217] Criteria  
At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized as measurable or nonmeasurable (defined below).  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as clos e as possible to the first day of study 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before starting therapy.  
Measurable Lesions  
• Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥2.0 cm with conventional techniques or ≥1.[ADDRESS_691218] scan. 
• A tumor lesion that is situated in a previously irradiated area is eligible for measurable 
disease provided: 1) there has been documented disease progression in this site; 2) the criteria for measurability as outlined ab ove are met; 3) this is not the only site of 
measurable disease.  
• All measurements should be determined using a ruler, calipers or digital technology, and 
recorded on the CRF in metric notation. 
Nonmeasurable Lesions  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <2.0 cm with conventional 
techniques or <1.[ADDRESS_691219]) and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  Truly nonmeasurable lesions include bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or per icardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis or pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218], and cystic lesions.  
Documentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a max imum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded at baseline.  Target lesions (measurable) should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions wi th the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements 
(either by [CONTACT_14217].  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baselin e sum LD will be 
used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and these l esions should be followed as 
present or absent.  
Techniques for Assessing Measurable Disease  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at screening and during follow -up.  Imaging- based evaluation is 
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 47 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_2085] (physical) examination when both met hods have been used to 
assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
Accepted methods of tumor assessment include:  
Clinical examination:  clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable l ymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
recommended.  
CT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currently available and most reproducible methods of measuring target le sions selected for response assessment.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_36894] 
a </= 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  
PET/CT Scan: A PET scan will be done to assess the FDG uptake of the nodes involved by [CONTACT_532358]. Specific uptake values will be recorded for 
each nodal area of interest. A registration CT will be done to confirm anatomic location. SUV values >2.5 will be considered positive and assessable for response, which will be defined as a 30% reduction in SUV values.  
Tumor markers:  tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered a complete clinical response.  
Cytology and histology:  the cytologica l confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
Response Criteria  
The following RECIST criteria will be the primary method utilized in addition to PET scan results for the assessment and reporting of tumor response data.  
Complete Response (CR): Di sappearance of all target and nontarget lesions, normalization of 
tumor marker levels, and no appearance of new lesions indicates complete response  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LDs of target lesions (taking 
as reference the baseline sum), without progression of nontarget lesions and no appearance of new lesions indicates partial response.   
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither PR or PD criteria are met.  Patients who have stable disease (SD) 
as their only response will be categor ized as stable disease if stable disease is documented after 
the initial 2 month treatment lead in.   
Axitinib (AG -013736) Neoadjuvant Melanoma Protocol               Page 48 of 53  
Protocol: 03/21/16  
Progressive Disease (PD):  ≥20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as 
references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment start ed, unequivocal progression of 
existing nontarget lesions, or the appearance of [ADDRESS_691220] Overall Response:  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease 
progression/r ecurrence (taking as reference the for PD the smallest measurements recorded since 
treatment started).  For CR and PR the best response assignment will depend on the achievement measurement criteria.  Stable disease rate will be defined as the percentage o f patients with stable 
disease based on the total number of patients evaluable for response.  
Determination of best overall response is summarized in the following table:

APPENDIX F  BLOOD SAMPLES for Soluble protein 
assessments: Procedures for Sampling, Handling, 
Storage, and Shipment  
Plasma samples for analysis of soluble proteins will be obtained at the time points 
designated in the protocol Schedule of Tests and Procedures Table.  
1. An indelible marker should be used to record the patient initials, ID number, collection date, and cycle day on the collection tube prior to collection.  
2. Collect 10.0 mL of blood into a sodium heparin tube (green top) at the designated times.  
3. After collection, gently invert the tube (15 times) to completely mix blood and anticoagulant.  
4. Once the sample has been mixed, it should be placed immediately into an ice bath 
ensuring that the tube is immersed so that the temperature is kept at 2° C to 8°C 
during all processing steps. 
5. Centrifuge at 3500 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes. 
6. Transfe r upper layer using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_173565] 4 Nalgene (2 brown capped, and 2 orange 
capped) cryovials; split approximately a quarter of the sample into each of the vials. 
7. Store tubes at –70°C to –80°C. 
8. One brown and one orange capped cryovial (primary sample, large r 3.6 mL tubes) 
should be shipped on the day of collection and one tube each (back -up sample, 
smaller 1.8 mL tubes) should be retained at the site in a –70°C or –80°C freezer.

Protocol: 03/21/16  
APPENDIX G  PROCESSING OF SAMPLES FOR GENOMICS 
ANALYSIS  
Pharmacogenomic analysis of tumor samples:  
After the patient grants informed consent for the biopsy, at least a [ADDRESS_691222] portion of the tissue will be placed in lactated Ringer’s solution and refrigerated at 4°C for up to 3 days. The remainder of the  4 mm cube should be snap frozen in liquid 
nitrogen within one hour and stored at - 70°C to - 80°C.  After the patient signs informed 
consent for peripheral blood s ample collection, a blood sample (5 mL) will be collected 
in purple cap EDTA tubes and stored at - [ADDRESS_691223] of [COMPANY_007], samples should 
be shipped to the analysis laboratory in dry ice according to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_532309].  The samples will be 
stored in a secure environment until the analysis has been completed.  
The tumor and peripheral blood samples will be used to analyze expression of RNA as they may relate to clinical response (tumor  regression and/or toxicity) to AG -013736.  No 
other studies will be performed with these samples.   
Tumor RNA will be extracted and prepared by [CONTACT_532359]. 
From total RNA, cDNA will be generated by [CONTACT_4465].  Th e cDNA will be 
then fluorescently labeled and hybridized on Affymetrix Gene chips (microarrays) according to instructions provided by [CONTACT_3455].  These microarrays contain oligonucleotides representing about 25,[ADDRESS_691224] responded (or at least regressed) and those that remained stable or progressed.  The set of genes that may be associated with the clinical response will be further confirmed by [CONTACT_937]-PCR method.  
The sample analysis will be anonymized and will be carried out specifically for the purposes of evaluating correlation of RNA patterns with clinical response.  The samples will not be made available to anyone not associated with this study or external investigators.  All materials (RNA) will be destroyed immediately after analysis.  No genetic material will b e stored.  The samples will be identified by [CONTACT_532360], date of birth or other information will not be used on sample tube.

1. Background/Significance:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_564385] 1999 in ‘To Err is Human’ as a central facet of patient safety,1 
diagnostic errors (missed, delayed or incorrect diagnoses) remain understudied,2 cause 
appreciable patient harm,3 and their reduction lags behind advances in other patient safety 
areas.4,5. Limited pediatric -focused research on diagnostic errors highlights the significance 
of this problem in children: 54% of pediatricians report making diagnostic errors at least 
monthly and 45% report making harmful diagnostic errors at least annually.6 In ambulatory 
pediatrics, evidence of harmful diagnostic errors is emerging: children experience a median 
delay of 3 years before receiving an asthma diagnosis,7 and 23% of children diagnosed with 
retinoblastoma have a diagnostic delay of more than [ADDRESS_741286] existing 
studies focus on adults, lack rigorous process and outcome measures, suffer from non -
experimental or quasi experimental designs, and/or were limited to a single institution.10 
Evidence for reducing pediatric  diagnostic errors is rare and often not current: the 
implementation of a pediatric trauma team reduced delayed and missed diagnoses of major 
injuries from 4.3% to 0.46%.11  Computer aided differential diagnoses reduced mean time to 
diagnosis of all pediatric inpatients from 2.8 days to 1.9 days in 1975.12 Research on 
interventions to prevent pediatric diagnostic errors is needed.  
The proposal will focus on 3 specific, high- risk, pediatric ambulatory diagnostic errors 
each representing a unique dimension of diagnostic assessment: evaluation of symptoms, 
evaluation of signs and follow -up of diagnostic tests. Adolescent depression (i.e. symptoms) 
affects nearly 10% of teenagers,13-[ADDRESS_741287] 75% of adolescents17 and 
causes significant morbidity.18 Pediatric elevated blood pressure (signs) is misdiagnosed in 
74-87% of patien ts,19,20 often due to inaccurate application of blood pressure parameters that 
change based on age, gender and height. Actionable pediatric laboratory values (diagnostic  
tests) are potentially delayed up to 26% of the time in preliminary investigations  and 7 -65% 
in adults ,21,[ADDRESS_741288] a multisite, prospective, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial 
testing a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) intervention within the American Academy 
of Pediatrics’ Quality Improvement Innovation Networks (QuIIN) to reduce the incidence of 
pediatric primary care diagnostic errors. QuIIN is a national network of over [ADDRESS_741289] .  The AAP’s IRB will cover each individual pediatric clinic, the data collection 
and the conduct of the study.  
 
2. Study Design:  
Objectives:  
Version 4, 7/21/16   3 
 Primary  
• To determine whether a QIC  consisting of evidence- based best -practice 
methodologies, mini -root cause analyses, data sharing, and behavior change  
techniques, is associated with a reduction in 3 specific diagnostic error rates in a 
national group of pediatric primary care practices.  
o Hypothesis 1:  Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 40% reduction in missed 
diagnosis of adolescent depression.  
o Hypothesis 2: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 30% reduction in missed 
diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood pressure.  
o Hypothesis 3: Imp lementation of a QIC  will lead to a 45% reduction in 
delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results.  
 
Secondary  
• To determine if a QIC’s effect changes for wave [ADDRESS_741290] year of the collaborative.  
• To further investigate the epi[INVESTIGATOR_564386]:  missed diagnosis of adolescent depression, missed diagnosis of pediatric 
elevated blood pressure, and delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results .  
• To evaluate patient outcomes related to these diagnoses including outcomes after 
positive depression screening, missed elevated blood pressure screening and 
delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory values.  
 
Methods:  
This proposal aims to identify system s solutions for reducing harmful pediatric diagnostic 
errors. We will perform a prospective, stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to test 
the hypothesis that QIC strategies can reduce three specific diagnostic errors in a national 
group of ambulatory pediatric primary care practices.  These data will inform future diagnostic 
error prevention efforts and provide data on QIC efforts aimed at pediatric diagnostic errors. 
Baseline data from the QIC will identify incidence data for errors in 3 separate stages of the 
diagnostic process: symptoms (missed diagnosis of adolescent depression), signs (missed 
diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood pressure) and diagnostic tests (delayed diagnosis of 
actionable laboratory results). Each of these diagnostic err ors represents missed opportunities 
to recognize abnormal diagnostic findings.26-28 Human subjects’ protection will be completed at 
the CHAM to cover the researchers and data analysis and at the American Academy of 
Pediatrics to cover all practices, as completed for prior QuIIN projects.29 
The goal of this proposal  is to reduce diagnostic errors by [CONTACT_564398] (outcomes measures) and reliably performing best practices for diagnosing adolescent 
depression, pediatric elevated blood pressure and actionable laboratory result s (process 
measures). In order to reduce overall data collection burden on practices and to increase 
engagement of practices that would have been in the control group, we have changed the study 
design. These changes do not affect t he statistical power of  the study. The intervention will 
consist of implementing QIC methodology in all practices to assist teams in reliably performing 
the processes that will reduce the diagnostic error outcomes via evidence- based tools.30-[ADDRESS_741291] diagnostic error.  In the final 8 months of the QIC, all three groups will  intervene on all 
three diagnostic errors.   
Version 4, 7/21/[ADDRESS_741292], all practices 
will submit baseline data on one of 
the three diagnostic errors (defined 
below) and this will provide data for 
an initial manuscript on the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_564387]. Following baseline data 
collection, we will apply 
multivariate matching before 
randomization, which has been 
shown to provide more accurate 
effect est imates, creating an

 equivalent of 7% increase in sample size.33 Practices will be matched based on key 
demographics related to diagnostic errors including 1) patient volume per practitioner +/ - 100 
patients, 2) university affiliation  and 3) prior work reducing these diagnostic errors. After 
matching, randomization wil l occur via computerized random number generation and one -third 
of practices will be assigned to each of the three QIC intervention groups . 
The QIC intervention components are described in Table [ADDRESS_741293] 
led to the error,  and spreading systematic lessons learned to prevent future errors .42,43 These 
factors could include 1) patient factors of age, gender, reason for visit, patient comorbidities, 
language barriers, acute illness, agitation of patient/family, social issues, etc . , 2) provider 
factors of type of provider, provider level of training, provider fatigue/impairment, personal  
stressors of providers, provider disagreements, provider knowledge, provider beliefs about the 
project or the patient, etc.  and 3) systems factors of time of visit, clinic milieu during visit (chaotic 
vs. calm), increased workload, staffing concerns, verbal/written communication, computer 
software or hardware, non- computer equipment, etc .. These  deidentifed factors will be 
submitted to the QIC  monthly  in order to aggregate causes of these errors . No protected health 
information (PHI) will be collected in t he aggregate entered data for these min- root cause 
analyses. One of the novel approaches of this collaborative is the use of an interactive webinar 
format for learning sessions.  
All practices will participate in the QIC  for the full [ADDRESS_741294] , increase their understanding of diagnostic errors and these errors in 
particular, and create systems for standardized data collection and data entry. P ractices will 
submit monthly data on their intervention and control diagnostic errors but only receive 
centralized data feedback, coaching or collaborative involvement  regarding their intervention 
error . (Figure 1) We acknowledge that error measurement in the baseline and intervention 
periods may introduce an intervention effect, but we have no reason to believe this effect will be 
different for the intervention and control practices. As noted above, after [ADDRESS_741295] diagnostic error. Including the control group in the QIC ensures that 
harm is prevented in the maximum number of patients and that clinical equipoise is met, as we 
believe this intervention will reduce errors. This stepped wedge design with two steps allows for 
the primary outcome comparison (diagnostic errors in intervention versus control ) and 
secondary outcome comparisons: 1) diagnostic error rates in second wave participants), 2) 
Sustainabilit y after first eight months  and 3) collaborative effect for second wave practices. 
These secondary outcome comparisons will shed light on the effectiveness and sustainability of 
QICs and inform future collaborative designs.  
Given concerns about practice at trition, we will additionally recruit a second wave of 
practices to join the collaborative.  The three phase quality improvement research model lends 
itself to simply on- boarding a new group of practices and integrating them into the project in 
Phase [ADDRESS_741296] 2 practices would be recruited 
Version 4, 7/21/[ADDRESS_741297] 2 participants.

Target Diagnostic Error Outcome Measures:  
All outcome metrics are described in detail in Table 2 and the Data Collection section 
below .  
The missed diagnosis of adolescent depression primary outcome measure is defined as 
the incidence of depression in adolescents > 11 years old compared i n intervention versus 
control practices. This outcome measure was chosen because prior research suggested up to 
75% of adolescent cases are missed by [CONTACT_564399],17,44 allowing incidence to serve as a 
proxy for missed diagnoses. The research team strongly considered using documented 
depressive symptoms (e.g. poor school performance, interrupted s leep patterns, increased 
disruptive behaviors, etc.) without appropriate provider identification or referral to mental health 
evaluation as the missed diagnosis of adolescent depression primary outcome. This metric was 
not chosen because preliminary data s uggested the number of adolescents with symptoms 
suggestive of depression documented prior to a mental health referral was extremely small. This 
finding echoes research that pediatricians’ use of adolescent and parental chief complaints to 
identify depress ive risk factors consistently under identifies  adolescent depression.44,45 The 
process measure for t his diagnostic error will be the percent of adolescents screened for 
depression, a practice recommended for all adolescents by [CONTACT_406065],46 and feasible and 
acceptable to primary care pediatricians.47-49

QuIIN will take responsibility for data security. QuIIN’s project manager has experiencing 
ensuring accurate and timely data submission for primary care pediatric practices from prior 
QuIIN QICs.  
Practices will collect 
the primary outcome data by 
[CONTACT_564405] -based 
methods depending on 
abilities and interest of local 
EHRs. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_564389]. These tools will

tools will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_564391] a 
minimum of 2 Expert Group members ( always including the QI Advisor).  As described below , 
data will be check ed for outliers or abnormal values and feedback given to practices to ensure 
consistency across practices. Additional data on providers’ abilities to recognize abnormal 
results, either in mental health, blood pressure or laboratory values, will also be collected as this 
is an important first step in the diagnostic process.  These data are described further in the Data 
collection section below. QIC leadership will use QIDA entered data to disseminate monthly 
feedback reports with full transparency and QIC benchmarking to intervention practices. 
Consented core QI team members from each practice will be able to access their team’s data. 
All practices will report demographic data annually, including patient volume, number and 
training level of physician or physician assistant -level providers, number of nursing and office 
staff, university -affiliation, EHR availability, presence of trainees,  estimated length of time 
providers take with patients,  and prior self -reported work aiming to improve these diagnostic

 sections of visit notes or if medic ations are prescribed. Intervention practices will also report 
process outcomes ( Table 2).  
Finally, in order to better investigate if reducing these diagnostic error s leads to 
improved patient outcomes, we will ask practices one time during the [ADDRESS_741306] 
intervened on a given error will track 50 patient charts with one of the following  metrics: 1) time 
between positive mental health screen and diagnosis of depression or depression diagnosis 
ruled out, 2)  the number of days between blood pressure elevation in the medical record and 
notification of the family, or 3) time between abnormal  laboratory result received and notification 
of family.  Additionally, we will ask practices to evaluate [ADDRESS_741307] 30 primary care pediatric practices which are part of 
QuIIN. We are confident that we can obtain this minimum number given that 45 of the 51 QuIIN 
practices (88%) participating in the pre- survey were interested in partic ipating in a diagnostic 
error project, and over [ADDRESS_741308] 2.  Interested 
practices reported seeing between 3,000 and 80,000 pediatric patients per practice annually 
(median 12,000). No practices will be excluded based on size as even the smallest practices 
have sufficient patient panels  to collect the data described above. Each practice- based team will 
be multidisciplinary, consisting of at least one physician, nurse and offi ce practice associate 
allowing for microsystem issues to be transmitted to practice leadership and QI skill to be 
disseminated across key groups.39 
 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
We will include 30 primary care pediatric practices that  are part of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics’ QuIIN organization.  Our second wave will recruit [ADDRESS_741309] a waiver of consent to look at patients’ protected health information submitted by 
[CONTACT_564407] . Patient Protected Health Information (PHI) will not be collected in QIDA.  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
 We will not exclude any practices  based on gender, race or ethnicity  of its providers or 
patients .  
 
4. Participant Recruitment:  
Version 4, 7/21/16   11 
 Upon IRB approval, primary care clinical teams will be recruited from the membership of 
the AAP’s Quality Improvement Innovation Networks (QuIIN) as well as other A AP listservs. In 
addition, Expert Group members will assist in recruiting potential practices.  
Practices will be enrolled via email and phone solicitation from the [ADDRESS_741310] and provide specific responsibilities of the practice/individual team 
members and a link to the applicati on to be completed via Survey Monkey . The application will 
ask for basic practice information and patient and practice demographics. QuIIN members and 
others will be notified of the opportunity to participate via email. The application packet includes 
details about an informational call to be held during recruitment so any interested individual can 
learn more about the project before completing an application. This informational call will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_564408], AAP QuIIN Staff, and the QI Advisor.   This same 
recruitment format will be applied to the Wave 2 practices.  
 
5. Informed Consent:  
The core improvement team ( physician, nurse and office associate health care 
providers ) across the [ADDRESS_741311] 1 practices  (25 retained) and [ADDRESS_741312] 2 practi ces, enrolled via 
the AAP’s Quality Improvement and Innovation Networks (QuIIN) will be the primary human 
subjects for this proposal. Each practice will consent for participation via a standardized and 
previously used QuIIN consent form .  Over [ADDRESS_741313] between 1 and 80 providers in each practice. Interested practices reported seeing 
between 3,000 and 80,000 pediatric patients per practice per year (median 12,000). As the 
proposal is geared toward improving prov iders’ actions  and behaviors  to be consistent with 
best-practice care to diagnose the [ADDRESS_741314] been granted on prior QuIIN projects via the AAP’s IRB . 
 
6. Risk/Benefit:  
Risks:  
The physician, nurse and office associate health care providers at each of the QuIIN 
practices will be the primary human subjects for this work.  As the proposal is geared toward 
improving providers’ actions to be consistent with best -practice care, the risk t o providers is 
minimal. No individual provider compliance data or diagnostic error  data will be  recorded.  Only 
aggregated data at the practice level is recorded.  There will be no additional medical risks in 
implementing these procedures as they are all s tandard of care and we are only working to 
ensure reliable implementation.  Providers may feel discouragement if they are unable to 
reliably perform certain best -practices.  In order to minimize this risk, we will provide constant 
encouragement, utilizing systems focused, blame neutral coaching methodology.  Parents and 
patients will be free to decline any aspect of care as occurs normally in care.  As such, no 
additional risk is posed to the clinic patients.  
There are no foreseeable financial risks to pat ients as a result of this study. Providers 
could experience a potential decrease in patient volume and therefore financial revenue if their 
Version 4, 7/21/[ADDRESS_741315] to instill this 
understanding of confidentiality into the collaborative. On the contrary, practices could 
experience an increase in revenue if patients appreciate improved care and better diagnostic 
accuracy in their clinics. The financial risks to providers and practices are low.  
 
 
Benefits:  
The potential benefits of this study to the providers include timely  and actionable feedback, 
and alerts to help providers better recognize aspects of diagnostic performance in need of 
improvement. Teams will have the opportunity to test strategies for improving care that will 
become a national model, to work with colleagues from around the country, to learn from 
national experts in decreasing the incidence of diagnostic errors, utilize tools to screen for 
adolescent depression, high blood pressure and appropriate follow -up with actionable labs , to 
access practical tools and effective strategies for how to deliver better care, and receive 
ongoing support for improvement. If improvements in care are ac hieved, the benefits to parents 
and children are also likely to be significant. Teams will also have the opportunity to receive 
coaching from experts in the fields of quality improvement, medical informatics, health IT 
solutions, pediatric hypertension, pediatric mental health and diagnostic errors . Pending 
approval, pediatrician participants may have the opportunity to receive Part 4 Maintenance of 
Certification (MOC) credit  if they meet the minimum eligibility criteria.  
Although the subjects are the prov iders, pediatric patients may benefit from this study by 
[CONTACT_564409] a diagnostic error.  
 
 
7. Data Collection:  
As with any study, we will take significant steps to safeguard all personal health 
information collected.  We will only collect the minimal amount of personal health information 
required as described above. All files will be deindentified and disassociated from practice 
identifiers as soon as the study is complete.  All records will be kept in locked offices, on 
password protected computers and in password protected files.  Finally, all data submitted to the 
QuIIN QIDA  national collaborative will be deidentified to the extent described above. QuIIN, 
using the QIDA software, has performed these activities on multiple prior QIC projects without 
any breaches of confidentiality.  The QIDA system is web- based and HIPAA compliant, and 
QuIIN will take responsibility for data security. Only the research team will have access to the  
raw QIDA data, and all data will be kept on password protected computers in locked offices. No 
patient identifiable information is stored in the QIDA database. Project data will be stored for [ADDRESS_741316] access to 
the data.  As such the risk of a breach of confidentiality is minimal and the legal risks associated 
with a breach of confidentiality are also be minimal.  
 There w ill be 6 sets of data submitted to the QuIIN Quality Improvement Data 
Aggregator (QIDA) program.  First, all practices will report demographic data annually, including 
patient volume, number and training level of physician or physician assistant -level prov iders, 
number of nursing and office staff, university -affiliation, EHR availability, presence of trainees, 
and prior self -reported work aiming to improve these diagnostic errors. This demographic 
practice- level data will not include any PHI, aside from the contact [CONTACT_564410].  The project application will serve as the first set of practice -
based demographic data and it will be requested [ADDRESS_741317] data on 1) incidence of adolescent depression 
(number of adolescents diagnosed with depression or subsyndromal depression as defined by 
[CONTACT_15261] 4, 7/21/[ADDRESS_741318] or patient notes per 100 adolescent visits), 2) missed diagnosis of pediatric 
elevated blood pressure (elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure for age, gender and 
height without provider recognition per 100 elevated blood pressures measured) and 3) delayed 
diagnosis of actionable laboratory results  (number of delayed actions, as defined in Table 2, per 
100 abnormal laboratory evaluations received). All of this data will originate from paper or 
electronic patient charts.  For each of the charts screened, the following demographic data will 
also be recorded: age, gender  and insurance status . These data will be entered into QIDA 
without patient names or birthdates.   No PHI will be recorded as part of this dataset that will be 
collected monthly .  
 The third set of data submitted will be process measure data for each of the three 
diagnostic errors described in the grant.  These data will be submitted by [CONTACT_564411] (i.e. for [ADDRESS_741319] process measure data on 
screening for adolescent depression) .  The three process measures will be 1) the percent of 
adolescents screened for depression, 2) the percent of children > 3 years old receiving blood 
pressure measurement at triage, and 3) the percent of providers with laboratory results unread 
or unacknowledged in their EHR inbox for more than [ADDRESS_741320] led to 
the specific diagnostic errors identified in this grant. These factors could include 1) patient 
factors of age, gender, reason for visit, patient comorbidities, language barriers, acute illness, 
agitation of patient/family, social issues, etc . , 2) provider factors of type of provider, provider 
level of training, provider fatigue/impai rment, personal stressors of providers, provider 
disagreements, provider knowledge, provider beliefs about the project or the patient, etc.  and 3) 
systems factors of time of visit, clinic milieu during visit (chaotic vs. calm), increased workload, 
staffing  concerns, verbal/written communication, computer software or hardware, non- computer 
equipment, etc .. These mini -root cause analyses factors will be collected on paper based forms, 
deidentified and entered into SurveyMonkey . Practices will be encouraged to identify and 
spread lessons learned to all providers in their practices to prevent future errors.  
The fifth set of data collected will be related to providers’ abilities to recognize abnormal 
findings that could relate to the diagnostic errors of interest.  As recognition of abnormal findings 
is key to ultimately making a correct diagnosis, it is important for practices to track and 
understand if their clinicians are appropriately recognizing abnormal results.  These data will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_564412] 10- 17 charts per month as the 
primary outcome measures noted above.  They will include: 1) Percent of charts with 
documentation of patient’s systolic and diastolic blood pressure percentiles  documented in the 
record, 2) Percent of charts with documentation of mental health concerns or exclusion of 
mental health concerns in patient record or 3) Percent of charts with abnormal actionable 
laboratory results noted as “abnormal” in the patient rec ord.  Clinics will only collect these data 
when they are the intervention or control group for a given measure.   
The final set of data will be aggregate data of patients one time during the [ADDRESS_741321] intervened on a given error will track 50 patient charts with one of the following metrics: 1) 
time between positive mental  health screen and diagnosis of depression or depression 
diagnosis ruled out, 2)  the number of days between blood pressure elevation in the medical 
record and notification of the family, or 3) time between abnormal laboratory result received and 
notificat ion of family. , Additionally, we will ask practices to identify, in the same 50 patients with 
Version 4, 7/21/[ADDRESS_741322]. No patients or practice staff will be identified in any report or publication about thi s 
study. Practice names will only be used in the acknowledgement section of any potential 
publication.  
 
Statistical Models : The primary independent variable will be assignment to the control or QIC 
group and the 3 primary dependent variables will be the adolescent depression rate (number of 
adolescents diagnosed with depression per 100 adolescent v isits), the missed pediatric 
elevated blood pressure rate (elevated blood pressure not  recognized by [CONTACT_564413] 100 
elevated blood pressures m easured) and the delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory result s 
rate (delayed action s on laboratory results per 100 abnormal laboratory results r eceived). Since 
the individual -level outcome will be binary (missed/delayed diagnosis  or not ), we will apply 
mixed -effects logistic models for testing the three primary hypotheses during the first study year 
and for testing secondary hy potheses. T he clinic-specific intercept will be considered random to 
take into account potential correlations of outcomes from the subjects within the clinics. We will 
test each of the three main effect s using a mixed -effects model. All primary and secondary 
analyses wil l be controlled for potential confounding effects including factors such as baseline 
diagnostic error rates, patient volume, number and training of physician or physician assistant -
level providers,  number of nursing and office staff, university -affiliat ion, EHR availability, 
presence of trainees , and prior work improving these  diagnostic errors.  
 
Power A nalysis : Assuming a two sided alpha level of 0.05 and >80% power , we calculated the 
effect size we could detect for each of the 3 diagnostic error primary outcome measures, 
comparing the 10 -20 intervention practices , given the stepped wedge design,  to the 10- 20 
control practices using the above models, and the QIC methodology and preliminary data. 1) 
Missed diagnosis of depression: If each practice screens [ADDRESS_741323] size of 2.4% or a reduction in the diagnostic error rate as small as 33% 
(intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.005). 2) Missed diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood 
pressure: If each practi ce screens [ADDRESS_741324] size of 12% or a reduction in the diagnostic error rate as small as 
13% (ICC=0.1). 3) Delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results : If each practice collects 
[ADDRESS_741325] size 
of 13%, or a reduction in the diagnostic error rate as small as 15% (ICC=0.1). Although we are 
testing three outcomes, we do not correct the alpha level for multiple testing since the study 
subjects will most likely be different across the three outcome comparisons.  
 
 
8. Data Quality Control and Database Management:  
 We will make every effort to minimize data recording errors by [CONTACT_564414]. If noted, we will  
Version 4, 7/21/[ADDRESS_741326] 
sensitivity analyse s applying a full conditional specification multiple imputation method which 
can apply to missing not at random data. We will compare results between available data 
analysis and multiple imputations data analysis.

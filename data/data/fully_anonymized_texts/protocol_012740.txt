THE ROLE OF OREXIN  IN HUMAN PANIC DISORDER  
 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Orex ins  
Hypocretins (orexins), a more recently identified class of pro -arousal neuropeptides, are synthesized 
by [CONTACT_450491].1 The main described orexins, orexin A (ORX A)  
and orexin B  (ORX B) , are both cleaved from a common precursor peptide, prepro -orexin.[ADDRESS_574147] been implicated in anxiogenesis in some animal fear models.  For example,  central (icv) 
injection of orexin A in mice induced anxiety -like responses in the light -dark exploration test and 
elevated plus maze.   
Using an established, γ-aminobutyr ic acid (GABA) -deficit, rodent model of panic -vulnerability,5,6 our 
Indiana University preclinical anxiety collaborators provoked a panic -like response in rodents with an 
anxiogenic sodium lactate (NaLac) infusion, which response was blunted following either site -specific 
orexin (ORX) gene silencing or systemic pretreatment with an ORX1 antagonist.7  
In addition, ORX neurons (peptidergic neurons in the lateral h ypothalamus) were shown, in turn, to 
stimulate discrete efferent sites within an emotional network (e.g., bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) 
to elicit specific behavioral components of the panic -response following sodium lactate. Taken 
together,  these results support the concept that ORX hypersecretion or ORX neuronal overactivity 
could also be present in human PD.   
            
Orexins’ Emerging R ole in Human Anxiogenesis / P anicogenesis   
Similar to the NaLac  model animals, humans with PD have been reported to have cortical and 
subcortical GABA deficits .8-[ADDRESS_574148] recently generated human pi[INVESTIGATOR_450470], studying the effects of a 
well-documented anxiogenic stimulus (35% CO 2 inhalation) on behavioral, physiological, and 
biochemical (plasma ORX A; assayed by a standard RIA kit) measures, in 1 PD patient and 2 healthy 
volunteers (see Table 1 , below). In this paradigm, the PD patient had a mild panic epi[INVESTIGATOR_450471] 
3 
 with marked early elevati ons in plasma ORX levels, relative to the volunteers who had minimal 
anxiety, consistent with a role for ORX in the initiation or elaboration of the human panic res ponse.

Vol. #[ADDRESS_574149] to human subjects without any axis I psychiatric disorder or 
with depression alone without panic, only subjects who had high panic scores but no depression had 
significantly elevated CSF ORX levels7 (see Fi gure 1, below).

The ORX hyperactivity hypothesis of panic that has been evinced from this work is highly innovative, 
and promises to broaden our understanding of the neurobiology of human panic disorder (PD), as 
well as provide new treatment directions.  
 
While there are limitations with using plasma ORX A as a measure of CNS ORX funct ion, one 
research group has recently published human data indicating that resting state CSF and plasma ORX 
A levels are highly correlated.[ADDRESS_574150] based on it, is as follows:  PD is a human anxiety disorder associated with specific cortical and 
subcortical GABA deficits that result in disruption of normal inhibitory regulati on of pro -arousal ORX 
neurons. This disruption promotes excessive ORX release, sympathetic activation,13 and vulnerability 
to spontaneous or chemically induced panic.  Pretreatment with an ORX1 receptor antagonist14,15 prior 
to chemical challenge, as proposed in this submission, is therefore expected to block the evoked 
panic response.  
 
 
Rationale for the Use of CO 2  Inhalation  
 
The 35% CO [ADDRESS_574151] reli ability ,18 and may be used to monitor 
improvement in clinical status following the administration of antipanic medications .19  
 
Approximately 70% of PD patients will have a panic attack in resp onse to this challenge , which 
close ly resembles a real -life panic .20  Therefore, in addition to resting/baseline measurement of 
plasma  ORX A, we also will examine CO 2-evoked levels of plasma ORX A in PD patients, and we will 
correlate these responses wi th other behavioral and physiological pa rameters recorded during the 
CO [ADDRESS_574152].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450472] d considerable experience us ing PD challenge paradigms in clinical research 
contexts, and  he is very familiar  with the application of the 35% CO [ADDRESS_574153] -in-
class, FDA -approved insomnia agent, suvorexant,14,23 a mixed ORX1/[ADDRESS_574154], will block 
35% CO 2-induced panic symptoms in panic disorder (PD) patients, via amelioration of central ORX 
neuronal hyper activity (as reflected in blunted plasma ORX responses to CO 2 challenge).   
 
To address  Specific Aim 1,  we will use a prospective, parallel -group, repeated -measures design to 
compare behavioral, physiological , and biochemical (plasma ORX) responses in 2 independent, 
unmedicated groups of PD outpatients (n=6 in each group) at baseline/resting state and after panic 
provocation due to brief (1 minute) inhalation of a 35%  CO 2 / 65% O 2 gas mixture.  PD patients will be 
randomized, in a double -blind manner, to receive either a single, oral dose of the mixed ORX1/[ADDRESS_574155], suvorexant (10 mg dose), or identical placebo, 120 minutes before CO 2 
challenge.   
Exploratory a im:  To acquire DNA samples for future c andidate gene/DNA analysis. Genes of 
interest with respect to ORX metabolism are the preproORX gene and genes that code for the 
receptors ORX1 and ORX2.          
  
5 
 Expected results:   It is expected that, compared to placebo, suvorexant pretreatment  will bl unt 
behavioral, physiological , and biochemical (plasma ORX) responses to 35%  CO [ADDRESS_574156] sizes generated from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_450473] a larger -scale study, t o definitively address S pecific Aim 1. 
 
 
INNOVATION  
The current work promises to determine the human applicability of a novel pathophysiologic concept 
generated from preclinical science, in this instance the ORX hyperactivity hypothesis of panic/anxiety.  
Our proposed st udy will perform rapid clinical testing of the ORX hypothesis with a view to identifying 
a new class of anxiolytic agents (ORX1 antagonists) .[ADDRESS_574157] to  the 
pathogenesis of panic symptoms that occur in a variety of psychiatric syndromes ( e.g., other anxiety 
disor ders, trauma -related disorders)  and in medical disorders with panic as a component , such as 
chronic obstructive pulmonar y disease and chronic asthma.    
              
Public Health Impact  of the Project  
PD is a common psychiatric condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 4% in the general 
community.25,[ADDRESS_574158] functioning and quality of li fe; is often associated with serious 
co-morbidity (particularly with MDD, other anxiety disorders, and substance abuse) ;28,29 and 
predisposes to suicide attempt s.30,31 It is clear that  new, more potent  antipanic treatments are 
urgently needed.     
 
 
STUDY PROCEDURES (see Table 2)   
 
Rationale for the Proposed Design  
Our design adopts a “fast -fail” experimental medicine approach to testing our treatment hypothesis , 
there by [CONTACT_450492]-long clinical trial design with  the prospect of exposing patients 
to an extended period of  placebo and adverse events  (e.g., fatigue, somnolence) .  A single , standard 
10 mg dose of suvorexant has documented CNS/soporific effects ,32,33 is highly bioavailable , and  
6 
 takes 120 minutes to achie ve peak plasma concentration .  Though suvorexant  is a mixed ORX1/[ADDRESS_574159]  (the ORX1 receptor has generally been more linke d to fear behaviors ),34,[ADDRESS_574160],  and it  closely reproduces naturalistic panic .18,20,36 In addition,  ORX 
neurons are known to be chemosensitive ,37 and animal work  has recently demonstrated ORX 
neuronal excitability in parallel with  CO 2-evoked anxiety .35   
 
Recruitment  and Clinical Care  
Patient recru itment , the screening visit (study visit 1), and the follow -up (study exit) visit will be 
conducted at the  UCSF Fresno Clinical Research Center (CRC) .  The study intervention visit (study 
visit 2)  will be co nducted in an exam room in East Medical Plaza (University Neurology Associates) . 
Patients will be referred from a variety of sources including local physicians , psychiatrists  and 
psychologists;  paid advertisements appearing in local newspapers ; free advertisements in the local 
Craigslist “volunteers” section ; and from internal medical center clinics (the UPA and ACC outpatient

Note s regarding the urine toxicology tests and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_450474]:  The purpose 
of the urine screening is twofold: (1)  study validity ( patients are excluded if the screening 
reveals use of certain substances, when by [CONTACT_450494]); ( 2) patient 
safety ( the sedative effects of the study drug  and a controlled substance, such as a 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_450475], could be additive). Substances screen ed for include 
cannabanoids, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodia zepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], a mphetamines, cocaine, and  metabolites.  
 
If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_450476] a “borderline case” for inclusion / exclusion, he will discuss the 
issue with the Safety Monitor or the patient’s primary care doctor, as appropriate.

(#VT -6450) which contain EDTA (lavender top). The tubes will be shaken gently several times 
immediately after collection to promote anti -coagulation. Blood will then be transferred to centrifuge 
tubes and centr ifuged at 1,0 00 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C. 1 mL plasma samples will be removed, and 
stored in a -80°C freezer located in the CRC.[ADDRESS_574176] provided their 
(additional informed consent to allow a blood sample to be collected for future DNA analysis, a 
sample of this centrifuged blood (after the plasma has been removed) will be banked in a -80°C 
freezer located in t he CRC  for future candidate gene/DNA analysis. Genes of interest with respect to 
ORX metabolism are the preproORX gene  and genes that code for the receptors, ORX1 and ORX2.       
 
          
 
 
Suvorexant /Placebo Medication , and Rescue Medication  
 
The pharmacotherapy will be supervised by [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_450502], who is very experienced in the 
treatment of patients participating in clinical trials.   
 
Suvorexant: 10mg  tablets  will be used. Patients who receive suvorexant vs placebo will receive a 
total of one 10mg dose . Tablets will be formulated into capsules by [CONTACT_450496], Clovis, CA, 
in order to be identi cal in appearance to placebo. It is acceptable to CRMC pharmacy that Script Life 
Pharmacy compound the study drug.  
 
Matching placebo  capsules : These will be prepared by [CONTACT_450496], Clovis, CA, to appear 
identical to the suvorexant  caps mentioned above.  It is acceptable to CRMC pharmacy that Script 
Life Pharmacy compound the placebo.  
12 
  
Lorazepam:  0.5 tablets will be used. (As explained below, b ased on the PI’s clinical interaction with 
and observations of the patient, lorazepam 0.[ADDRESS_574177] a pronounced or prolonged CO2 panic response following CO2 administration .) 
These will be purchased from Script Life Pharmacy, Clovis, CA .  It is acceptable to CRMC pharmacy 
that Script Life Pharmacy provide the lorazepam . 
 
Drug safety  data:  A summary of drug safety  data for suvorexant can be found i n the FDA -approved 
package  insert .[ADDRESS_574178] common 
adverse reaction reported was somnolence, 2%, compared to <1% for placebo.  
 
Storage  and d ispensing : All investigation/study products will be stored at and dispensed by  [CONTACT_450497] .  
 
Accountability:  The study drug , placebos , and lorazepam  must only be used as directed in the 
protocol. Records of overall dispensing will be maintained separately from the cas e report forms 
recording the medication  dispensed to each patient.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450477].  Per the CRMC 
Pharmacy, unused medications are to be returned to the Pharmacy and their destruction  will be  
verified by  2 pharmacists.  
 
Methods for ensuring blinding : The CRC study coordinator will inte ract with the CRMC pharmacist 
to obtain appropriate medication f or each patient, according to the randomization schedule. Two sets 
of study blinds/codes will be kept in sealed envelopes inside a small box in a locked cabinet : one 
within the UCSF -F CRC , and  one within the UPA clinic.   
 
 
Methods for unblinding the study:  The treatment code must not be broken except in medical 
emergencies when the appropriate management of the subject necessitates knowledge of the 
treatment randomization. In the event of such a patient emergency, the medication blind will be revealed 
to the appropriate emergency medical staff by [CONTACT_450498]. Treatment codes will not be broken 
for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data fro m each individual 
subject have been made and documented.  
 
Follow -up Contacts  
 
After subjects complete their participation in study visit 2, and as an extra measure to ensure their 
ongoing well -being, we will  
 Make a follow -up phone  call to subjects the day after  study visit 2 , to ask them how they are 
doing, and to verbally verify that a family member stayed with them the appropriate amount of 
time after study visit 2.  
 Complete one follow -up visit  with each subject and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a s ub-I at the CRC  to ensure that 
subjects have returned to baseline . 
13 
  
From time of enrollment through return to baseline, subjects will be enrolled in the study 
approximately two weeks.  
 
Because subjects’ participation in the study does not provide any trea tment for their condition, after 
subjects complete their participation in the study, they will be offered the opportunity to receive up to 
four treatment visits from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a sub -I for their panic disorder, after which they will be referred 
back to thei r primary care provider. If subjects choose not to accept the treatment visits, they will be 
referred back to their primary care provider after the follow -up visit (described above).  
 
Adverse Events/Safety Monitoring  
 
Side effects will be assessed clinically at the patient’s  study visit by [CONTACT_978] , via serial vital sign 
monitoring and behavioral monitoring .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450478] a 6 -monthly report  of study progress to the 
UCSF -Fresno/CRMC IRB . This will facilitate recognition of any patterns of advers e events, and 
provide feedback on managing these better as the study progresses.   
 
Based on the PI’s clinical interaction w ith and observations of the patient, l orazepam  0.5 mg po will 
be available for use as a rescue med ication if patients ha ve a pronounced or prolonged CO 2 panic  
response following CO 2 administration.  There is evidence in psychiatric patients that acute 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_450479]/overdose may not greatly alter CS F ORX levels ,[ADDRESS_574179] a plan to be accompanied by a family member, friend or caregiver, and 
that this individual will be in the subjects’ company for the remainder of [ADDRESS_574180] ensure their transport home and report any adverse events to the 
investigator at (559) 320 -0580.  
In the unlikely event of an adverse reaction requiring medical or psychiatric care, p atien t coverage will 
be available 24/7  through the UCSF -Fresno psychiatry on -call schedule , who will be informed that the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_450480] . On-call activities and interaction 
are not charged in Psychiatry. In the unlikely event of additional ED or urgent care treatment, this will 
be covered by [CONTACT_25999] , depending on a number of factors .  
 
 
All adverse events that qualify as Unanticipated Problems will be reported to the IRB within 10 days; 
any subject deaths will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_574181] to Wee Kiat (David) Lee, MD , the Safety Monitor,  for an initial review 
shortly  after IRB approval .  Thereafter, 3 monthly monitoring reviews will be conducted with the PI 
[CONTACT_1601] a brief synopsis of adverse events, reasons for drop -out, and study progress.  If there is 
a serious adverse event (e.g. patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450481], or a patient death), an emergency meeting with the Safety Monitor will be convened.   
   
[ADDRESS_574182] copy research data will be 
kept in locked file cabinets  in the study manager’s office .  Only the PI , sub -Is study coordinator will 
have access to these files, ensuring the security of the hard copy records.  Each subject will be given 
a unique alphanumeric code and this will serve as the only connection between the locked files, the 
hard-copy forms, and the e lectronic database.  All forms to be used in the study will only contain this 
alphanumeric code to protect personal health information and maintain HIPAA compliance.  
Additionally, other procedures to ensure confidentiality will follow the regulations and policies of 
UCSF Fresno and CMC.  
Data will be collected on hard -copy forms and then verified by [CONTACT_9137], who will be 
trained to search for potential errors. Any questionable or illegible entries will be brought to the PI’s 
attention in a regu larly recurring research meeting (used to monitor recruitment, data collection, and 
protocol compliance).  A full review of new data acquired in the previous week will be performed and 
those subjects passing the final verification will have their forms pla ced into the secure file cabinets. 
The forms not passing verification will be addressed immediately.  
The electronic database used to house these data until analyses are needed will be a Microsoft 
Access database created uniquely for this project  and kept on the UCSF server .  The database will 
be password protected and only certain users will be given access to the folder containing the 
database. All data will be de -identified and the key will be kept in a locked drawer in the study 
manager’s offi ce. This will protect the electronic data against any unauthorized persons from entering 
the dataset and jeopardizing the integrity of the data.  All versions of the forms in the Microsoft 
Access database will have interfaces nearly identical to the hard c opy forms for ease and efficiency of 
entry. This will substantially limit the number of typographical errors by [CONTACT_450499]. As this project  matures 
into the d ata analysis stage, data will be queried and exported to statistical software for data analysis.  
All data anal yses will be performed using SPSS  version 22 . Continuous variables will be summarized 
separately in the two PD patient  groups  using descriptive statistics, in cluding mean, SD , minimum 
and maximum values. Categorical variables  (e.g., presence/ absence of a CO 2-panic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ) will be 
summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Ba seline demographic data  will be compared 
betwe en the two groups . Dichotomous and ordinal  variables w ill be examined using Fisher’ s exact 
tests , and continuous  measures (e.g. , peak change  from baseline  in CO 2-evoked VAS  anxiety,  and 
peak change  from baseline  in plasma ORX) with Wilcoxon  rank sum  tests . Effect sizes will be 
generated to facilitate planning of a definitive  study.    
 
Since our current pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] ( see p. 3) are so limited, the data generated t hrough this study  will enable 
us to est imate power requirements for a  larger study,  and to fine-tune the protocol .  A speculative 
power estimate for the larger study, b ased on our current plasma ORX/CO 2 findings , is as follows:  
 
If we assume  a mean±SD  peak change value  of 50±25 pg/ml for the PD/p lacebo gro up, and 30±25 
pg/ml for the PD/s uvorex ant group,  we would have 80% power to detect this difference , with =0.05, 
utilizing a [ADDRESS_574183], with 25 patients in each group.

The pi[INVESTIGATOR_450482]: 3 months  to start up and obtain  IRB approval; an 8-month  
enrollment  period, recruiting 1-2 patients  per mon th; and a  final month for analysis, poste r 
development, and development of a grant application  to fund a definitive study of the research 
questions being addressed by [CONTACT_177612][INVESTIGATOR_20732] .

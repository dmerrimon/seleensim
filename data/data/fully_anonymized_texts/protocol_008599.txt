2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
Oral ART has been highly successful in the management of human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV -1) infection, achieving dramatic viral suppression in most infected 
persons maintaining access to care. However, ART does not eradicate HIV -[ADDRESS_1194501] protective epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] [ 1].  
 
Thus, the approach taken here was to develop protective immunogens [ 1-3] that direct 
immune t argeting to conserved regions of viral proteins  while excluding variable 
immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], thereby [CONTACT_857421] T 
cell responses to ‘‘decoy’’ epi[INVESTIGATOR_857385] [1,4]. The 
immunogen  designs were based on selection of epi[INVESTIGATOR_857386]-1 sequences and are associated with virologic control in HIV -1 infected individuals 
[1-3, 5-13]. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against conserved viral epi[INVESTIGATOR_857387] -term non -progressors [ 3, 14]. Furthermore, 
mutations affecting the conserved regions of HIV -1 proteins often impair viral fitness [ 15-
 15 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
20]. 
There is substantial evidence that Gag -specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses corr elate 
with control of viremia [ 3,21-24], including reduced viremia after infection in the Step 
preventive vaccine trial [ 25]. The pDNA vaccine to be studied here encodes  seven CEs 
of HIV-1 p24Gag that were selected by [CONTACT_857422]/CTL 
response data. These protein sequences are typi[INVESTIGATOR_274867] >98% of the HIV -1 Group 
M viruses worldwide and represent 54% of the p24Gag protein [ 9].  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1194502] HIV infection, and this vaccine regimen 
induces potent CTL responses targeting th e presumed Achilles’ heel  of the virus.  
 
The study will use p24CE and p55gag plasmids  in a pDNA prime -pDNA boost vaccine 
regimen comprising p24CE prime followed by p24CE+p55gag booster vaccination. This 
vaccine regimen has been selected for the clinical tr ial HVTN [ADDRESS_1194503] safety and 
immunogenicity in HIV -naïve persons.  
 
As noted above, HIV sequence diversity and potential “decoy” epi[INVESTIGATOR_857388]. To target immune responses towards 
critical viral epi[INVESTIGATOR_857389], we engineered immunogens encoding CE s of HIV -[ADDRESS_1194504] HLA -coverage, and 
association with viral control [ 1, 26, 27]. We engineered a pDNA vaccine targetin g seven 
CEs within the HIV -1 p24Gag protein and demonstrated that this vaccine is able to 
induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses in mice and macaques [ 9, 10, 
28]. CE-specific T cells are polyfunctional and highly cytotoxic. We further developed a 
novel , improved vaccine regimen that includes priming with HIV p24CE pDNA, critical to 
induce immune responses to subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and p24CE pDNA together with a 
plasmid expressing the full -length immunogen p55Gag as a boost. We found this  to be 
the most effective protocol to induce CE -targeted responses with the greatest breadth, 
magnitude , and cytotoxic capability in macaques [ 29]. Thus, this vaccine regimen alters 
the immunodominance hierarchy  and induces robust immune responses to subdo minant  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. In contrast, this result could not be achieved by [CONTACT_857423] 
p55gag pDNA, which induced few and mostly monofunctional responses recognizing CE, 
these responses being found in only 50% of the vaccinated animals and having limited 
breadth [ 9, 10, 28]. The combination of pDNA vaccines expressing CE and full -length 
immunogen provides a novel strategy to maximize the breadth and magnitude of cellular 
and humoral immunity targeting the subdominant , highly conserved region s of HIV.

p24CE pDNA vaccine  
The p24CE vaccine is composed of two gene segments (p24CE1 and p24CE2) on one 
plasmid, referred to as p24CE1/[ADDRESS_1194505] abundant protein in HIV virions ( Figure 2.2-1). 
p24Gag was chosen because of its availability as an immune target during infection, and 
because CTL responses to Gag, and in particular the p24Gag component of Gag, have 
been associated with greater control of HIV viremia in numerous studies [ 20-23, 30-37]. 
The sequences expressed by p24CE1/2 pDNA correspond to the portions of p24Gag 
found in nearly every HIV -1 (M group) strain observed to date throughout the world; 
while they elicit immune responses in HIV -infected individual s, these responses are 
subdominant to the more variable segments of Gag. Unlike most of the HIV -[ADDRESS_1194506] rarely, if at all, been observed to mutate (for the most 
part they are composed of amino acids [AA] conserved in 98 -100% of all HIV -1 M- group

Figure 2.2 -1. Alignment of p24CE1, p24CE2, and p24Gag proteins. The schematic 
representation at the top of the  shows the p55Gag and its proteolytic processing 
products including p24Gag protein. Below is the alignment of the amino acid (AA) 
sequences of the majority consensus p24Gag sequences of different HIV -1 clades 
and of the seven CE encoded by [CONTACT_941] p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine. The AA sequences of 
the p24Gag of different HIV -1 clades (A, B, C), group M consensus, COT -M, and of 
the p24CE1 and p24CE2 proteins are shown (Note that consensu s agreement, 
indicated by “.”, does not necessarily indicate strong sequence conservation at that 
site). The CE1 to CE7 sequences with the single AA change per CE are indicated.  
 
 
The p24CE1/2 pDNA is a dual promoter plasmid ( Figure 2.2-2) generated to express the 
p24CE1 gene from the human cytomegalovirus (CMV ) promoter and the p24CE2 gene 
from the s imian CMV promoter in the opposite transcriptional orientation. There are 7 CE 
segments of 13, 18, 24, 20, 20, 14 , and 18 AA in each of the p24CE constructs [ 1]. One 
“toggled” amino acid is included in each of the 7 CE segments, resulting in two protein 
coding elements (p24CE1 and p24CE2) differing by a total of 7 codons, each sharing 
127 amino acids with p24Gag. Codi ng sequences were optimized to enhance 
expression in human cells [ 38-41]. The p24CE sequences represent 54% of p24Gag, 
including most extended coiled regions of the protein. CE regions are enriched for AA at 
p24Gag hexamer interfaces [4 2], which provides a  structural rationale for their

common AA at that site in the HIV database, would result in noninfectious virus [ 27, 42]. 
The plasmid also contains two polyadenylation si gnals (bovine growth hormone polyA 
signal for p24CE1 and the simian virus 40 polyA signal for p24CE2).  
 
The CE segments are separated by [CONTACT_857426] 0 -3 AA in length composed of Alanine, or 
Alanine and Lysine, or Alanine and Glycine. The total length of the  proteins spans 157 
AA, including 17 AA of the GM -CSF signal peptide and 13 AA of linker sequences. The 
linker sequences  are designed for efficient proteolytic cleavage [ 9]. The length and 
sequence of the linker sequences were therefore set based on the existing knowledge of 
cleavage specificities [4 3], as well as to avoid fortuitous junctional homologies with HIV 
and the human proteome, the latter determined by [CONTACT_857427] [4 4]. 
 
Figure 2.2 -2: Schematic of the p24CE1/2 pDNA (plasmid code 306H): p24CE1/2 
pDNA uses a plasmid backbone derived from pVR1012 [45], which has been used in 
previous DNA vaccine studies. p24CE1/2 pDNA was manuf actured and produced at 
a concentration of 4 mg/mL, in 30 mM citrate buffer pH 6.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 
0.01% EDTA and 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] -HCl by [CONTACT_350783], San Diego, CA.  
p24CE pDNA has been tested in macaques monitored for >2 years without any 
adverse effects.  
 
 
p55gag pDNA  
The p55gag pDNA (plasmid 114H) contains an expression -optimized full -length HIV -1 
p55gag gene from the HIV -1 molecular clone HXB2 (Genbank NP_057850) cloned into 
the pCMVkan plasmid between the human CMV promoter and the bovine growth 
hormone polyA signal (Figure 2.2-3). Related plasmids expressing HIV p55Gag have 
been tested in several clinical trials, including HVTN 060, 063, 070, 080, and 087, and 
no significant adverse effects related to vaccine were reported.

Preclinical immunogenicity studies of p24CE pDNA in macaques  
A variety of model systems were used to ensure that delivery of p24CE pDNA would 
induce strong immune responses  [9, 10, 26, 29]. The p24CE pDNA studies conducted in 
macaques are shown in Figure 2.2-4. Cellular immune responses were measured in 
blood [ADDRESS_1194509] vaccination by [CONTACT_857428] ( PBMC ) with peptides spanning the 7 CE [1 0, 29]. All animals developed CE -
specific cellular responses, as measured by  [CONTACT_20129]-γ production, with a frequency ranging 
from 0.1% to 0.8% of total T cells in blood. These responses were elicited by [CONTACT_295537]4 
and CD8 T cells, of both central (CD28+, CD95+) and effector memory phenotype (CD28-
, CD95+), and included cytotoxic and poly functional CE -specific T cells, as defined by 
[CONTACT_719504] B content, ability to secrete two cytokines (IFN -γ and TNF -α), and ability 
to degranulate (CD107a). In addition to cellular immune responses, vaccination with 
p24CE plasmids induced robust antibo dy responses to CE, not achieved by [CONTACT_857429] p55gag DNA. These studies demonstrated that vaccination with CE pDNA induces 
potent immune responses to subdominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], notachieved by [CONTACT_857430] -length Gag ( see Figure 2.2-5).

were vaccinated twice with a mixture of p24CE1&p24CE2 pDNA (N=6) or the dual -
expression vector p24CE1/2 (N=10). The frequency of CE -specific IFN -γ+ T cells was 
measured [ADDRESS_1194510] pr iming vaccination using CE -specific peptide pools 
composed of a mixture of 15 -mer overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_10373] 11 AA and 10 -mer peptides

Preclinical macaque studies of p24CE1/2 DNA prime/co -delivery of p24CE1/[ADDRESS_1194511] regimen was developed to maximize magnitude, breadth , and the 
generation of cytotoxic T cell responses recognizing the CE [ 10, 26, 29]. This regimen 
includes p24CE1/[ADDRESS_1194512] vaccine regimen 
comprising p24CE pDNA prime followed by p24CE+p55gag pDNA booster vaccination. 
Booster vaccination including p55gag pDNA significantly increased T cell responses and 
also induced highly cytotoxic CE -specific IFN -γ+ T cells with Granzyme B+ co-expression 
of >89%.  
 
The breadth of the response, measured by [CONTACT_857431], 
was compared among groups that received different CE -based vaccines (CE pDNA 
only, CE/ gag pDNA, and CE/CE+ gag pDNA) ( Figure 2.2-5). The CE+ gag pDNA booster 
vaccination induced responses with significantly increased breadth (2 -6 CE per animal), 
compared to CE or CE/ gag pDNA vaccines with 1 -3 or 1 -4 CE per animal, with no 
difference between the latter groups. All CE -based DNA vaccines induced b roader 
responses than the HIV p55gag pDNA only vaccine, which induced responses to 0 -2 CE 
per animal.

Immunogenicity of the CE pDNA vaccine regimen in SIV -infected ART -treated 
macaques.  
We previously showed that therapeutic SIV pDNA vaccination induces potent immune 
responses able to significantly reduce viremia after ART interruption [ 46, 47]. 
Importantly, in these studies we reported that despi[INVESTIGATOR_857390], viral loads then decreased dramatically in many DNA -vaccinated animals, 
resulting in significant long -term decreases in viremia.  
 
We hypothesize that CE pDNA vaccine could contribute to cure by [CONTACT_857433], 
effective immunity with less likelihood of immune escape. To test the CE vaccine 
concept as a potential therapeutic approach in the macaque model, we engineered SIV 
p27CE homologs to the HIV p24CE immunogens [ 29]. Analogous immunogenicity 
studies were conducted with the SIV p27CE in macaques and the results mirrored those 
obtained with the HIV constructs. The immunogenicity of the p27CE pDNA vaccine 
regimen was further tested in SIV mac251 -infected macaques treated with cART ([COMPANY_009], 
ViiV) for 10 months.  Four of the animals received the SIV p27CE DNA vaccine regimen 
(priming with p27CE, two-booster vaccination with p27CE+p57gag pDNA) , two macaques 
received sham pDNA ( Figure 2.2-6), and all were analyzed for CE -specific T cell 
responses 2 weeks later. The two sham DNA vaccinated macaques showed no T cell 

 22 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
responses to CE ( Figure 2.2-6) or total Gag (not shown), as expected, due to successful 
cART trea tment. Robust T cell responses to CE reaching more than 1% of T cells in 
blood (Figure 2.2-6) as well as to complete Gag (not shown) were induced upon 
vaccination.  
 
Figure 2.2 -6: Immunogenicity of CE of pDNA vaccine in cART -treated macaques. Six 
macaques were infected with SIV mac251  for 3 months and treated with cART ([COMPANY_009], 
ViiV) for 10 months, and  were vaccinated 2x with p27CE pDNA vaccine regimen 
(N=4) or sham DNA (N=2) via IM electroporation. Animals were primed with [ADDRESS_1194513] a gut 
microbiota enriched with Bifidobacterium [ 48]. Oral administration of Bifidobacterium 
improved tumor control similar to administration of a PD -[ADDRESS_1194514] was 
amplified when mice were treated with both PD -1 blocker and oral Bifidobacterium. 
Tumor control appears to be driven by [CONTACT_398]8 T cell infiltration into the tumor. Two species 

 23 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
of Bacteroides also appear to be associated with response to CTL A-4 blockade  [49]. 
Germ -free mice and those treated with antibiotics did not have tumor response to CTLA -
[ADDRESS_1194515] and environmental antigens 
[50]. The vaccine induced anti -gp41 antibody reacted with whole cell lysates of several 
anaerobic and aerobic intestinal microbiota. There appears to be a pre -existing pool of B 
cells that are cross rea ctive between intestinal microbiota and gp41. Studies in mice 
suggest that interaction with commensal microbes may be necessary for the 
development of neutralizing antibody to influenza vaccine [51]. Toll-like receptor (TLR) -
deficient mice had inadequate plasma cell responses to influenza vaccine ; this trend was 
also seen in germ -free and antibiotic -treated mice. Flagellated E. coli administered orally 
restored vaccine response but aflagellated E. coli did not, consistent with  TLR-based 
sensing of flagellar proteins.  
 
Stool microbiota analysis in elite controllers has suggested that gut microbes may 
contribute to CD8 T cell control of HIV. Nowak et al. found in principal coordinate 
analysis based on beta -diversity results that elite controllers clustered tightly together 
separate from either healthy controls or viremic participants [52]. These elite controllers 
had significantly lower weighted unifrac diversity. Elite controllers also had a significantly 
higher prevalence of the phylum Bacteroidetes and lower prevalence of Proteobacteria 
and Actinobacteria compared to viremic participants .  
 
We hypothesize that participants with a more robust T cell response to p24CE1/[ADDRESS_1194516] a higher  prevalence of the genus Bifidobacterium and /or the genus 
Bacteroides and lower weighted unifrac diversity of the stool microbiome.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
10.1 General Design Issues  
 
A5369 is a phase I/IIa, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to evaluate 
the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of p24CE/full -length Gag DNA, as a therapeutic 
vaccine in HIV -1 infected persons. The study targets to enroll 40 partici pants. All 
participants are well -suppressed on ART, current CD4 T cell counts >500 cells/mm3, and  
nadir CD4 T cell counts > 350 cells/mm3. Each participant will receive active 
vaccine/placebo at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24 delivered by [CONTACT_857446]. The primary efficacy outcome will be based on HIV -specific 
 55 A5369

The number of CE s with a CD4 and/or CD8 T cell  response at week 
26 compared to baseline in an individual study  participant. A CE 
response (for a participant at a given  timepoint) is defined by a 
criterion t hat uses Fisher’s exact test to compare the proportion of 
peptide -stimulated CD4 and/or CD8 T cells that are cytokine positive 
to the proportion  that are cytokine positive in the unstimulated sample  
(negative  control), and applying a stringent p -value of 10e -5 as a 
cutoff.  
 
NOTE: For this primary endpoint, we will sum the CD4 and CD8 
responses.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety

10.3 Randomization and Stratification  
 
Participants will be randomized 2:1:1 to the p24CE/full -length Gag DNA vaccine arm 
versus full-length Gag DNA vaccine arm versus placebo arm, using the permuted block 
method . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_857448] .  
 
10.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The primary comparison will be between the p24CE/full -length Gag DNA and placebo 
arms. Statistical power is estimated based on a two-sided , 5% significance level, 
Fisher’s exact test of whether a participant has a larger number of CE s with a CD4 
and/or CD8  T cell response at week 26 compared to baseline (i .e., a yes/no binary 
outcome), considering n=18 v ersus n=[ADDRESS_1194586] (see section 10.6.1 , Primary Immunogenicity ).  
 
The table below provides several scenarios to detect a difference (ranging from 0.50 to 
0.75) between the two arms in the probability that a participant has increased CE 
responses.  
 
Table 10.4 -1: Power and Effect Size  
 
Power  P_p24CE  P_placebo  Effect 
Size 
72% 0.60 0.10 0.50 
80% 0.64 0.10 0.54 
82% 0.65 0.10 0.55 
89% 0.70 0.10 0.60 
90% 0.71 0.10 0.61 
94% 0.75 0.10 0.65 
97% 0.80 0.10 0.70 
98% 0.85 0.10 0.75 
 
Power is 80% to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_1194587] size that would lend support for further 
development of the p24CE vaccine. The targete d anti -HIV immune responses being 
induced in less than 50% of study participants receiving the p24CE vaccine compared to 
placebo would not be seen as being clinically meaningful and would discourage further 
studies of this vaccine regimen. Power to detect a difference of 0.85 v ersus 0.10 
between the p24CE vaccine ar m and the placebo arm is >98%.  
 
 58 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
Power is also calculated for a secondary analysis to compare  the p24CE vaccine arm 
and the full -length Gag vaccine arm. Considering n=9 evaluable participants in t he full -
length Gag vaccine arm, the study has approximately 80% power to detect a difference 
of 0.85 v ersus 0.30 when comparing the p24CE and full -length Gag vaccine arms.  
 
The sample size calculation is based on the assumption that in the absence of 
intervention, while an HIV+ individual remains on stable and suppressive ART (i .e., 
placebo arm), the HIV -specific immune responses to the CE elements would be 
relatively stable over time. Hence the team expects only a small probability that 
longitudinal assays for a placebo participant would identify an increase in the number of 
CEs recognized by [CONTACT_398]4 or CD8 T cells.  
 
NOTE: The sample size calculation may change pending the testing of A5321 samples.  
 
Regarding the assessment of safety (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ), the sample size of 20 
participants receiving the p24CE/Gag DNA vaccine will provide >90% probability of 
observing a p24CE/Gag DNA -related AE that would occur in 11% or more of treated 
participants. The sample size of 10 participants receiving the full -length gag DNA 
vaccine will provide >90% probability of observing a full -length gag DNA -related AE that 
would occur in 21% or more of treated participants.  
 
It is anticipated that the study will take 6 -9 months to reach accrual targets.  
 
10.5 Study Suspension Rule  
 
 If at any time during the study:  
• Two or more participants experience a primary safety outcome  that is possibly or 
probably related to study treatment (as judged by [CONTACT_356522], blinded to treatment 
arm), or  
 
• One or more participants experience a primary safety outcome  that is definitely 
related to study treatment   or that is Grade 4 or death an d possibly or probably 
related to study treatment (as judged by [CONTACT_857449], blinded to treatment arm),  
then enrollment into the study will be temporarily suspended and the Study Monitoring 
Committee (SMC, unblinded to treatment assignment) will be aske d to review all safety 
data; review the relation to study treatment of the event(s) thought by [CONTACT_857450] a primary safety outcome; and recommend how the study should proceed 
with respect to resuming enrollment and continuing study treatme nt.  
 
Pending full SMC review, the protocol team will decide, in consultation with the SMC 
chair or designee, whether to continue study treatment for subjects already enrolled.  
 
10.6 Data and Safety  Monitoring   
 
At SMC reviews, data will be considered as detailed in section 7.4.

10.7 Analyses  
 
10.7.1 Primary Immunogenicity  
 
The planned analysis will compare Y= sum of CEs recognized by [CONTACT_398]4 and CD8 T 
cells at week 26 minus the number at baseline between the p24CE/full -length 
Gag DNA and placebo arms, using a two -sided 5% level Wilcoxon rank -sum test, 
which is anticipated to have greater statistical power than analyzing the binary 
version of whether Y>0, for whi ch statistical power was based. An exact 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the the median of all paired differences between 
observations in the two arms (i.e., Hodges -Lehmann estimate) will be calculated 
to provide additional insight on the effect of p24CE/ full-length Gag DNA vaccine.  
 
The primary immunogenicity analysis for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_857402], 
limited to participants who received all four study vaccination/placebo 
administrations and who did not take any medication prohibited by [CONTACT_43038] y 
protocol on or prior to their week [ADDRESS_1194588] binomial 95% 
CI. 
 
10.7.3 Secondary Analyses  
 
Secondary analyses will compare Arm 2, the gag -DNA alone vaccine arm, to 
each of the other a rms. These analyses will be performed in the same manner as 
the primary analysis.  
 
The percentage of participants in each study arm with a CD4 and/or CD8 cell 
response to an increased number of CEs at week [ADDRESS_1194589] binomial  95% CI. Pairwise comparisons among 
study arms will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test. Similar analyses will be 
performed for CD4 and CD8 cell responses separately.  
 
The change in total magnitude of CD4 T cell responses against eac h CE added 
together among study arms will be compared using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank -
sum test. The analysis for CD8 T cell responses will be conducted in a similar 
manner. All statistical tests will be two-sided at the 5% nominal level of 
significance without adjustment for multiple testing.  
 
For each tolerability endpoint, all occurrences of the endpoint will be summarized 
descriptively (e.g., for each participant with the endpoint, the answers to all of the 
questions in that participant’s tolerability questionnaire will be reported), with an 
 60 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/[ADDRESS_1194590] binomial 95% CI on the probability of the tolerability endpoint for each 
treatment arm. Also, the participant ratings of pain will be described a) when the 
device was placed on the participant’s skin and the vaccine/placebo was 
injected, b) at the ti me of the electrical stimulation and muscle contraction, c) 10 
minutes and 30 minutes after the procedure was completed, by [CONTACT_2939], 
and the left  and right deltoid separately.

SHORT TITLE FOR THE STUDY: HIV -1-Gag Conserved -Element DNA Vaccine (p24CE) as 
Therapeutic Vaccination  
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and are curr ently taking anti -HIV medications. This study 
is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH). The doctor in charge of this study at this 
site is: ( insert name [CONTACT_789] ). Before you decide if you want to be a part of this 
study, we  want you to know about the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you 
about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to 
take part in this  study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The study will look to see if two HIV vaccine s are safe in people infected with HIV. Additionally, 
the study will look at whether or not the HIV vaccine s improve the immune system’s ability to 
fight HIV . This study will also look at whether the intramuscular injection of the study vaccines  
given along wit h electroporation will be well tolerated . 
 
The HIV vaccine  used in this study  is experimental. This means that this vaccine  has not been 
approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA).  
 
 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY?  
 
To be in this study, you must continue taking your current anti -HIV drugs. Your anti -HIV drugs 
will not be provided to you by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
 69 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/[ADDRESS_1194608] a screening visit. Tests will be done at the screening visit to see if 
it is safe for you to join the study. The screening visit will take about 1 hour, but it may be 
shorter or longer.  
 
At the screening visit:  
 
• Your HIV -[ADDRESS_1194609].  
• You will  have a complete physical exam and will be asked questions about how you are 
feeling.  
• You will also be asked to answer questions about your medical history and medications you 
are taking now and have taken in the past.  
• You will have a skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_857409]. This test will also measure t he right depth when giving the injections in the upper 
arm muscles.  
• You will have a pregnancy test done, if you are a woman able to become pregnant. You 
cannot take part in this study if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
• You will have a urinalysis perform ed to evaluate the health of your kidneys.  
• You will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) test done to measure the electrical activity 
of your heart. You will be asked to lie down very still and breathe normally during the 
test.  
 
You will have about 2 tablespoons of blood drawn from a vein in your arm:  
• To measure HIV viral load (a viral load test measures how much HIV is in your blood).   
• To measure CD4/CD8 T  cell counts (the number of white blood cells that fight infection).  
• To test for hepatitis B and hepatitis C (viruses that can infect your liver).  
• To conduct routine safety tests.  
 
You will be told the results of the tests done at the screening visit . 
 
If you do not enroll into the study  
If you decide not to take part in this study or if you do not meet the eligibility requirements, we 
will still use some of your information. As part of this screening visit, some demographic (for 
example, age, gender, race), clinical (for example, disease condition, diagnosis), and laborat ory 
(for example, CD4 cell count, viral load) information is being collected from you so that ACTG 
researchers may help determine whether there are patterns or common reasons why people do 
not join a study.  
 
Pre-Entry  
If you qualify for the study, you will  return to the clinic about [ADDRESS_1194610] between 3 to 4 hours.

FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
 At the pre -entry visit:  
• You will have a total of about 3 tablespoons of blood drawn from a vein in your arm . 
• You will have blood collected and stored for future immunologic testing (to measure the 
body’s ability to fight infection).  
• You will have a pregnancy test done, if you are a woman able to become pregnant.  
• You will have blood collected to measure CD4/CD8 T cell counts (the number of wh ite blood 
cells that fight infection).  
• You will have blood collected for human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) typi[INVESTIGATOR_14632].  
• You will have blood stored for future tests.  
• If you agree, you will have leukapheresis performed. You will also be required to have a 
leukapheresis performed at the week 26 visit.  By [CONTACT_266349], 
researchers are able to get many more white blood cells than is usually possible.  
• If you agree, y ou will have stool  sample s collected to study the different kind of bacteria  in 
your stool . These samples will be stored and will be tested after the study is over. You will 
not be given the results. (This test is optional)  
 
Leukapheresis Procedure  
The leukapheresis procedure may be performed at [insert site -specific details] . The procedure 
will take about [insert site -specific details]  and the full visit will last about [insert site -specific 
details] . You will have to remain in a semi -reclining or r eclining position for most of this time.  
 
Leukapheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from an 
individual/donor and separating the blood into individual components so that leukocytes (white 
blood cells) can be removed. The remain ing blood components are then put back into the 
bloodstream of the individual/donor. This will be done by [CONTACT_4859] a needle attached to sterile 
tubing in one arm, and first sending your blood through a machine. This machine spi[INVESTIGATOR_857410] e red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen), the white blood cells (cells that 
fight infection) and the platelets (cells that help form clots). The white blood cells will be kept for 
testing. The rest of your blood will be returned to your body through ano ther needle and tube in 
your other arm. Not all of your white blood cells are removed, and your body will make more 
white cells within a few days. Losing the number of white blood cells that are collected does not 
pose a danger to your health.  
 
Entry  
You w ill return to the clinic at least 24 hours after your pre -entry visit. The entry visit (week 0) 
will last about 1 -2 hours, but may be shorter or longer.  
 
At the entry visit:  
• You will have a brief physical exam . 
• You will be asked about how you are feeling and any medications you have taken since the 
last visit.  
• You will have a pregnancy test done, if you are a woman able to become pregnant.  
• You will have a total of about 4 tablespoons of blood drawn from a vein in your arm.  
• You will have blood draw n for routine safety tests.  
• You will have a urinalysis performed to evaluate the health of your kidneys.

FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
 • You will have blood drawn for CD4/CD8 T  cell counts, HIV viral load, and future 
immunologic testing.  
You will be told the results of the safety tests , HIV viral load, and CD4/CD8 T cell counts done 
during the study.  
 
Study Injections  
When you enter the study, you will be placed into one of the three groups . You will be 
randomized 2:1:1 (by [CONTACT_3364]) to receive either the p24CE1/2 pDNA vaccine (an HIV vaccine) 
followed by p24CE1/2 + full -length Gag pDNA vaccine  (a different HIV vaccine) , OR the full -
length Gag pDNA vaccine alone, OR placebo (the placebo is a salt solution that does not 
contain any vaccine, medicine, or drugs).  
 
Neither you nor the study staff will know whether you will receive the vaccine or placebo. You 
will receive the injections at the clinic at weeks 0 (entry), 4, 12, and 24.  
 
Electroporation (EP) Procedure  
To improve the effectiveness of the vacci ne, instead of a regular needle and syringe, a small, 
hand -held device will be used to inject the vaccine or placebo into your upper arm muscle. To 
give the vaccine or placebo, the study staff will press the device against your skin and press a 
button. Alt hough you will not be able to see them, the device will put an injection needle and 
four thin wires into your muscle. The vaccine or placebo will be given through the injection 
needle into your muscle. After the injection, the device will give a very short  electrical signal to 
your muscle at the spot of the injection. The electrical signal will last for about one half second. 
You will feel twitching in your muscle,  which is often painful. Previous participants have 
described the feeling as a short “cramp” o r “punch” in their muscle. Right after the electrical 
signals are finished, the device will be removed from your muscle. Your muscle may be sore to 
the touch after the vaccination . If this occurs, it usually does not last for more than 30 -60 
minutes.  
 
Before Injection  
Due to the risk of dizziness/lightheadedness or in rare cases, fainting, the injection will be given 
to you while you are in a secure, seated position.  
 
After Injection  
You will be observed by [CONTACT_857455] a standing pos ition following the 
injection. You may ask for pain -relieving medication after each injection if you need it.  
 
After each injection, you will be asked to stay at the clinic for 30 minutes to be observed and to 
complete a brief survey (Procedure Tolerabili ty Questionnaire). This survey will ask you 
questions on the level of discomfort you may have experienced during the vaccination , including 
the overall acceptability of the procedure.  
 
You will be called 2 to 3 days after each injection to see how you are doing. The telephone call 
will take about 5 -10 minutes. If you prefer not to be contact[CONTACT_5143], then you will be 
asked to return to the clinic within 2 to 3 days after each vaccination . The study staff may ask 
you to come to the clinic if you are h aving any side effects from the vaccination .  
 72 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/[ADDRESS_1194611]:  
• Your temperature for 4 days after each injection.  
• Any side effects for 5 days after each injection.  
• Any rash or skin irritation around and/or in the middle of the injection site.  
• Any medications taken.  
• Any non -study vaccines received.  
 
The diary will be given to you at the entry visit. It will take you about 10 -15 minutes to complete 
the diary each day. You will bring the diary back to the clinic at your next visit and at every visit 
afterwards until the 26 -week follow -up visit. The diar y will be collected by [CONTACT_857456] (week 48); if you stop the study early, the diary will be collected your last study visit.  
 
During the Study  
After your entry visit, the next study visits will take place over a 12-month period (wee ks 4, 6, 
12, 24, 26, and 48). Each study visit will last about [ADDRESS_1194612] a brief physical exam. At the injection visits (weeks 4, 12 , and 24), you will have a 
pregnancy test done, if you are a woman able to become pregnant, before you have the 
injection. At weeks 4, 12, and [ADDRESS_1194613] blood drawn for CD4/CD8 T  cell counts, HIV viral load, and future immunologic testing. 
You will have between [ADDRESS_1194614] stool sample collecte sd at week 26 to study the different kind of 
bacteria in your stool.These samples will be stored and will be tested after the study is over. 
You will not be given the results. (This test is optional .) 
 
If you agreed to have leukapheresis perf ormed at the pre -entry visit you will be required to also 
have leukapheresis performed a t the week 26 visit . 
 
NOTE: Your blood that is drawn for future immunologic testing, which is required for this study, 
will be stored with usual protectors of your iden tity. Your blood samples will be processed in the 
laboratory to produce a certain type of white blood cells, called PBMC (peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells) , and plasma.  
 
Other  
If you agree, some of your blood that is left over after all required study testing is done may be 
stored (with usual protectors of your identity) and used for future ACTG -approved HIV -related 
research.  
 
You may refuse or withdraw your permission for stor age of leftover samples without any impact 
on you taking part in the study or any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. You

how would vaccine be provided?  
 
During the study:  
 
If you must permanently stop receiving the study -provided vaccine  before your study 
participation is over, the study staff will discuss other options that may be of benefit to you.  
 
After the study:  
 
After you  have completed you r study participation, the study will not be able to continue to 
provide you with the vaccine you received on the study.  
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
The vaccine or placebo used in this study may have side effects, some of which are listed 
below. Please note that these lists do not include all the side effects seen with the study 
vaccine. These lists include the more serious or common side effects with a known or possible 
relationship.  There may be more serious or common sid e effects that we do not know about yet. 
Therefore, it is important that you report any side effects to the study staff. If you have questions 
concerning additional study vaccine side effects, please ask the medical staff at your s ite. 
 
There is a risk of serious and/or life -threatening side effects when non -study medications are 
taken with the study vaccine. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse about all 
medications you are taking before you start the study and also before starting any new 
medications while on the study. Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in 
any other clinical trials while on this study.  
 
The following side effects  can occur from either the vaccine or the placebo in this study. If you 
do have a reaction, it does not mean that you received the study vaccine.  
 
General Vaccination Risks  
The possible risks for vaccines in general include fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, 
headache, dizziness, and fatigue. We know these side effects can occur with other vaccines. 
They can occur whether you receive the vaccine or the placebo in th is study. The side effects 
do not usually last long.  
 
As with all vaccines or drugs, you could have an immediate allergic reaction, including itchy 
rash, hives, low blood pressure, sudden body swelling, or even difficulty breathing. Allergic 
reactions can  be life threatening; therefore, the study staff will watch you for 30 minutes after 
each injection. There may be other side effects, even serious ones that we do not know about 
yet. Therefore, it is important that you report any side effects to the study staff as soon as they 
occur.

 For people infected with HIV, vaccinations can cause a temporary increase in the HIV viral load, 
but this has not been seen when people are also taking medications that lower the amount  of 
HIV in the blood. The long -term effec ts of temporary increases in HIV viral load levels are 
unknown.  
 
Risks of Injections  
• Arm discomfort  
• Bleeding or bruising at the spot where the needle enters your body  
• Small risk of fainting or infection  
• Stinging, pain, soreness, redness, itching, swelling,  burning, warmth at injection site  
• Induration (hardness under the skin) at the site where the vaccine/placebo is given  
 
Risks of Drawing Blood  
Blood tests for screening and study visits will be done by [CONTACT_4859] a needle into one of your 
veins and this can  cause temporary mild pain or discomfort at the needle site (common), local 
bruising at needle site (rare), infection , and fainting (very rare).  
 
Risks of HIV DNA Vaccines, including pDNA Study Vaccine  
HIV-[ADDRESS_1194617] long -term follow -up on people taking part in these studies.  
 
Possible risks related to DNA vaccines include muscle damage, or the production of antibodies 
(proteins made by [CONTACT_10489]’s immune system in response to a foreign substance) to DNA. 
Other potential risks include insertion of the vaccine DNA into the body's DNA (leading to 
cancer) or into the DNA of a bacteria or virus in your body. None of these possible risks of DNA 
vaccines have been seen in laboratory tests or in animals or humans so far, but you need to be 
aware of these possible risks. During the study, regular blood tests and check -ups will be done 
to monito r these possible side effects.  
 
The pDNA vaccine consists of artificial DNA. Since the vaccine in this study has not been given 
to humans for treating HIV infection, all the possible risks or side effects are not known.  
 
The pDNA vaccine was tested in animals at doses similar to or larger than those planned to be 
given in this study wit hout serious side effects. However, people may respond differently to the 
vaccine than animals.  
 
Information about local injection site reactions in humans after injection of the pDNA vaccine is 
not available at this time. However, the local reactions rel ated to intramuscular (IM) injections 
such as pain, hardness under the skin, redness, and swelling may occur and are expected to be 
mostly mild to moderate in severity based on results from earlier HIV clinical trials with related 
products. Information abo ut systemic events (which affect your whole body, such as fever or not 
feeling well) with the pDNA vaccine are not available at this time. Based on results from clinical 
trials with related products in healthy adults and in HIV -infected persons, systemic e vents are 
expected to be mild to moderate in severity.

 It is unknown whether receiving this HIV vaccine will change your response to any future HIV 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_857411]. This might prevent you from taking part in other 
experimental vaccine or immune studies.  
 
Risks of EP Procedure  
This section describes the risks and restrictions we know about. There may also be unknown 
risks, even serious ones. If we learn about new risks durin g this study, we will tell you.  
• Brief twitc hing/contraction of the upper arm muscle where the vaccination  is given will occur 
during the the EP procedure. This may result in a painful sensation, which should last only a 
few seconds.  
• It is possible that the EP procedure could cause you to become diz zy or lightheaded. If severe 
enough, this could lead you to faint. Should this happen, you may require additional tests 
and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• After the EP device is removed, slight bleeding may occur in the skin at the vaccination site. 
This bleeding , if any, should only last for a few minutes.  
• Delivery of the vaccine  with the EP device is likely to result in muscle soreness or pain of mild 
to moderate severity at the vaccination site. Redness, swelling, and/or bruising in the area of 
the vaccination could also occur. It is possible that these reactions could persist for several 
days or more after administration.  
 
Other Expected Risks  
Common : 
• Muscle pain with severe muscle contractions during vaccination administration  
• Mild to moderate injection site pain, tenderness, redness, bruising, or edema (swelling under 
the skin)  
• Muscle aches or headache in the first few days following vaccination  
 
Less common : 
• Severe vaccination site pain or tenderness  
• Joint pain  
• Vaccination site bruising (a mass of blood in the tissue caused by [CONTACT_93356]), laceration (cut or 
slash), or bleeding related to the vaccination procedure  
• Dizziness/lightheadedness  
 
Uncommon or rare : 
• Fainting  
• Severe reaction of the vaccination  site including sterile abscess (lumps caused by [CONTACT_857457]) or secondary bacterial infection  
• Allergic reaction, including rash, urticaria (hives), angioedema (swelling of the skin), 
bronchospasm (narrowing of the muscles that help y ou breathe), or anaphylaxis (life -
threatening allergic reaction)  
 
 77 A5369

 Unknown frequency or theoretical risks :  
• Muscle damage at the vaccination  site  
• Insertional mutagenesis (a mutation caused by [CONTACT_857458] a normal gene)  
• Autoimmune reaction  (a process in which your immune system attacks your body)  
 
Risks of Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_857412]. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_857413]. It is an anesthetic, similar to the numbing medicine used by  [CONTACT_103513]. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], like all 
medicines, can have side effects. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_857414]. The nervous system side effects include confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, 
shaking, or seizures. The heart side effects can include decreased heart pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fast heart 
rate, low blood pressure, abnormal heartbeats , or even death. Other possible side effect s 
include nausea, vomiting, or chills. All of these side effects are very rare, but may happen as a 
result of accidental injection into the bloodstream.  
 
Risks of Leukapheresis  
Leukapheresis has been shown to be safe in HIV -infected donors and does not aff ect CD4+ T -
cell count or immune status of short -term donors. The needle used is larger than normal blood 
draw and may be uncomfortable. Rarely, a participant may feel faint during or after 
leukapheresis. This sort of reaction can be handled by [CONTACT_857459]’s position or 
administering intravenous fluids. You may experience chills, nausea, and heartburn caused by 
[CONTACT_857460][INVESTIGATOR_266274]. This chemical  may use up some of the calcium in your blood 
stream, and tingling in the face, lips, or hands may be noted. If this happens, study staff may 
slow the rate of infusion of this chemical and may offer you one or two calcium carbonate tablets 
to correct the c alcium loss. Participants will be observed closely by [CONTACT_857461].  
 
 
ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY?  
 
The vaccine in this study may be unsafe for unborn babies. If you are having sex that could lead 
to pregnancy, you must agree not to become pregnant or make a woman pregnant for at least 
three months after the final study vaccin ation . Because of the risk involved, you and your 
partner must agree to use two method s of birth control that you discuss with the study staff. You 
may choose two of the birth control methods listed below:  
• Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal ag ent 
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide  
• Intra-uterine device (IUD)  
• Hormone -based contraceptive  
 
If you can become pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test before you enter this study. The 
test must show that you are not pregnant. If you think you may  be pregnant at any time during 
the study, tell your study staff right away. The study staff will talk to you about your choices. If 
you become pregnant while on the study, you will be asked if you wish to continue in the study 
 78 A5369  
FINAL Version 1.0  
  03/09/18  
 
 and come for study visits fo r routine safety evaluations. You will not receive any further 
injections that are scheduled.  
 
Safety information regarding the performance of this pDNA vaccine in pregnant women is not 
available at this time. Therefore, this vaccine is not to be given to  pregnant women or nursing 
mothers.  
 
If you become pregnant while on study, the study staff would like to obtain information from you 
about the outcome of the pregnancy (even if it is after your participation in the study ends). If 
you become pregnant duri ng the study and do not give birth by [CONTACT_857462], 
and if you agree, you will be contact[CONTACT_857463] . 
 
If you are taking anti -HIV drugs when you become pregnant, your pregnancy will be reported to 
an international database that collects information about pregnancies in women taking anti -HIV 
drugs. This report will not use your name [CONTACT_163436].  
 
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you take part in this study, you should expect no direct benefit. Information learned from this 
study may help others who have HIV.  
 
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
 
Instead of being in this study you have the choice of:  
• treatment with prescription drugs available to you  
• treatment with experimental drugs, if you qualify  
• no treatment  
 
Please talk to your doctor about these and other choices available to you. Your doctor will 
explain the risks and benefits of these choices.  
 
 
WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?  
 
We will do everything we can to protect your privacy. In addition to the efforts of the study staff 
to help keep your personal information private, we have gotten a Certificate of Confidentiality 
from the U.S. Federal Govern ment. This certificate means that researchers cannot be forced to 
tell people who are not connected with this study, such as the court system, about your 
participation. Also, any publication of this study will not use your name [CONTACT_163437].

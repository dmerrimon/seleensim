DESENSITIZATION IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS (PALISADE)  
Short Title  PALISADE  
Clinical Phase  [ADDRESS_1092703]  2015 -004257- 41 
IND Sponsor  Aimmune Therapeutics , Inc. (formerly Allergen Research Corporation ; ARC)  
Number of Subject s Approximately 500 peanut -allergic  subjects will be randomized 3:1 to peanut oral 
immunotherapy (OIT) versus  placebo . At least 80% of the subjects randomized will 
be children.  
Objective  The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of AR101, a pharmaceutical -
grade peanut allergen f ormulation , through reduction in clinical reactivity to limited 
amounts of peanut allergen in peanut -allergic chil dren (ages 4 -17 years, inclusive).  
The secondary objectives are:  
• To demonstrate the safety of AR101 as measured by  [CONTACT_357095] , including  serious adverse events  in children (ages  4-17 years, 
inclusive) . 
• To evaluate the immunological effects of peanut OIT therapy  in children  (ages 
4-17 years, inclusive) . 
Study Design  This is a n international,  multi center, randomized,  double -blind , placebo -controlled  
study of the efficacy  and safety of  AR101 in a characterized desensitization  OIT 
regimen in peanut -allergic  individuals.  The study will consist of a screening phase, 
that includes a Screening double -blind, placebo - controlled  food challenge 
(DBPCFC ), and a double -blind OIT treatment  phase that includes an initial 
escalation period, an up-dosing  period, and a maintenance peri od, followed by [CONTACT_792676] .  
An open -label safety follow -on study (ARC004 ) is planned after completion of 
ARC003 .  
All eligible subjects will receive escalating dose s of either AR101 or placebo.  
Eligible subjects who reach the targeted dose of 300 mg/d  and maintain that dose 
for approximately  24 weeks will undergo a n Exit  DBPCF C. Subjects who do not 
reach  300 mg/d will be considered escalation failure s and nonresponder s for the 
primary analysis . 
A DBPCFC will be performed for those subjects achievin g the target dose of 
300 mg/d and contin uing to receive that dose throughout the maintenance period  
(~24 weeks ). Each subject will be unblinded when he/she completes  the DBPCFC 
at the end  of the ~24-week maintenance period , provided regulatory and IRB/EC 
approval for ARC004 have been received, the availability of IP for ARC004, and all 
major data queries for the subject have been resolved . If this is not the case, the 
subject shall remain on blinded treatment until these requirements are satisfied. The 
subject should continue his or her maintenance visits (completed as unscheduled visits), every 30 days and complete all protocol procedures at each visit until study 
completion and rollover to ARC004.   
All placebo subjects  who complete ARC003  are eligible for rollover into the 
ARC004  protocol. Placebo subjects  from ARC003 will,  in ARC004 , undergo an 
escalation schedule identical to that for active subjects in the ARC003  protocol . All 
subjects on active treatment  in ARC003  who pass the DBPCFC at the 300 mg 
(443 mg cumulative ) challenge  dose level of peanut protein  are eligible to proceed

to ARC004 . Those who do not pass DBPCFC at the 300 mg ( 443 mg cumulative ) 
challenge dose level  will be considered endpoint  failures  and nonresponder s for the 
primary analysis . They will not be eligible for rollover into the ARC004  protocol  
due to safety concerns . Those subjects who pass DBPCFC at the 300 mg ( 443 mg 
cumulative ) challenge dose level, but fail at the 600 mg ( 1043 mg cumulative ) or 
1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) challenge dose level, will  also be considered 
endpoint failures and nonresponder s for the primary analysis  for North America or 
Europe, respectively ; however, they will be eligible for rollover into the ARC004 
protocol  because tolerating a 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) dose of peanut protein is 
considered a clinically relevant level of desensitization  in the event of accidental 
exposure . 
A Data Safety Monitoring Committee (D SMC) will be  established to monitor the 
study for safety.

Title  PEANUT ALLERGY ORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY STUDY OF AR101  FOR 
DESENSITIZATION IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS (PALISADE)  
Treatment Description  Screening/baseline : All eligible subjects will undergo a DBPCFC  at the end  of the 
screening portion of the study.  The Screening  DBPCFC will be an abbreviated 
version of the DBPCFC described in the PRACTALL guidelines , progressing  only 
up to  a top challenge dose of  100 mg (144 mg cumulative) of peanut protein or 
placebo.  Additionally, the DBPCFC will progress through the dose levels in an 
unaltered sequence, without repeating any dose.  Those subjects who have dose -
limiting symptoms  (DLSs) at or before the 100  mg (144 mg cumulative) challenge 
dose of peanut protein (measured as 200 mg of peanut flour) will be randomized 3:1 
to active treatment  (AR101)  or placebo .  
For each subject, a “blinded” Evaluating Physician is to be designated to assess the 
tolerability of the challenge doses presented in the DBPCFC. The Blinded 
Evaluating Physician  (or Blinded Assessor)  is not to be involved  directly  in the 
oversight of study product dosing (neither initial escalation, nor up -dosing , nor 
maintenance), nor the assessment or management of adverse events. To the extent 
practicable, the same Blinded Evaluating Physician who determines DLSs in the 
Screening DBPCFC should determine DLSs in the Exit DBPCFC.  
Initial Escalation  (2 days): Eligible subjects will initiate OIT starting at a dose of 
0.[ADDRESS_1092715] , or 
who tolerate the 3 mg, but not the 6 mg dose, will undergo confirmatory testing of  
the tolerability of  a 3 mg  dose the following day  (refer to Initial Escalation Schedule 
at end of synopsis).  Therapy details are found in Section 
3 and Section 6 of the 
protocol.  
Up-dosing:  Subjects will receive daily oral dosing of peanut or placebo OIT  for 
about 5 months  (20 weeks, if up -dosing proceeds without holding at, or reducing, a 
dose level; 40 weeks, maximum) . All escalation  doses (see escalation table below) 
will occur in a clinical research center  (CRC)  or other monitored setting  (unless 
required by a specific institution, no distinction will be drawn between an investigational site, study center office, clinic, or CRC, provided the capability 
requirements for monitoring and emergency intervention are met by [CONTACT_68811]) . 
All up -dosing  activities  will be performed under direct observation.  Therapy details 
are found in Section 
3 and Section 6 of the protocol.  
Maintenance: Those subj ects who reach the target maintenance dose of 300 mg/d of 
study product  will enter a n approximately 24-week  Maintenance Period  of 
continued dosing at 300 mg/d.   
Exit DBPCFC : Following completion of the ~24- week Maintenance Period , 
subjects will undergo an Exit DBPCFC (to a  cumulative  maximum of 2043  mg of 
peanut protein).  Subjects who fail to tolerate the Exit DBPCFC at 300 mg (443 mg 
cumulative) of peanut protein will be discontinued from further  study (Section  3.3 
for details) .

associated with severe reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. Peanut and/or tree nut 
allergies account for the majority of fatal food -induced anaphylaxis ( Sampson et al., 2005). 
Furthermore , published reports  suggest that the prevalence of peanut allergy, like other food 
allergies, has  been rising, and is now at high levels, affecting up to 10% of the population. 
(Branum & Luk acs, 2008; Sicherer et al., 2014 ). Peanut allergy, unlike many other types of food 
allergy , is usu ally life -long, with approximately 80% of patients  remaining peanut- allergic in 
adulthood.  
The current standard of care in management of food allergy is dietary avoidance of the allerg enic 
food, and education of the patien t/family in the acute management of an allergic reaction.  
Unfortunately, a ccidental ingestions remain  common, with up to 50% of food- allergic patients 
having at least 1 allergic reaction over a 2-year period ( Sicherer et al ., 1998). Furthermore, strict 
adherence to an avoidance diet can be complicated due to difficulty in interpreting food labels 
(Joshi et al ., 2002) and by [CONTACT_792678] ( Altschul et al., 2001; Vierk et al ., 2002). The burden of avoidance and constant 
fear of accidental exposure can negatively affect  the health -related quality of life for both 
patien ts and their families  (Primeau et al ., 2000; Avery et al., 2003; Buchanan et al., 2007; 
Sicherer et al., 2010; Hofmann et al., 2009; Anagnostou et al ., 2014). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_107529], accidental exposure continues to be a major concern in 
peanut allergy because allergic responses can be triggered after ingestion of just milligram quantities of peanut protein. Accidental exposures may result from commercial food product mislabeling as well as inattention to, or mistrust of,  food warning labels ( Vierk et  al., 2007). 
Foods prepared outside the home, including those encountered in schools, daycares, restaurants, or even the homes of friends and relatives present another ready source of accidental exposures.  
Oftentimes the origin of the accidental exposure remains unknown. The threat of accidental exposure and its consequences for patients with peanut allergy and their families  continues to 
drive research in the field of food allergy.  
While advances in understanding the causes o f food allergy, strategies for food- allergy 
prevention, and the mechanisms underlying tolerance continue to be made, a cure for food 
allergy remains elusive.  In the meantime, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_792638] e event of an accidental exposure to an allergenic food continue to be 
developed. An approach that has shown consistently promising results is allergen- specific 
immunotherapy, a therapy that entails administration of increasing amounts of an allergen to individuals with IgE -mediated food allergy to raise the threshold and decrease the severity of 
allergic responses to the allergenic food. These allergen -based immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_792639], epi[INVESTIGATOR_73823], and most advanced among these, oral immunotherapy (OIT).  
Oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy has been widely studied  in recent years and has 
demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy results in early clinical trials. Additionally, beneficial immunologic changes have been shown to occur over time th at would tend to indicate 
progression toward a clinical  state of sustained desensitization  with continued OIT

PALISADE   31 July 2017 (Oppenheimer et al ., 1992; Secrist et al ., 1995; Nelson et al., 1997; Kapsenberg et al ., 1999; 
Lehrer et al ., 1999; Frew et al 2003; Bousquet et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Skripak et al., 
2008; Jones et al., 2009; Narisety et al., 2009; Blumchen et al., 2010;  Kim et a l., 2011; 
Varshney  et al., 2011). 
The goal of Aimmune Therapeutics ’ characterized oral desensitization immunotherapy 
(CODITTM) program for peanut allergy is to induce a state of  clinically meaningful 
desensitization to peanut protein, where clinically meaningful desensitization is defined as the 
absence of moderate or severe allergic reaction following ingestion of small, but potentially dangerous, amounts of peanut protein. In practical terms, this  state of desensitization should be 
sufficient to protect a patient with peanut allergy in case of  an accidental exposure to peanut 
while the patient is attempting to maintain a peanut- avoidant  diet.   
It is unfortunately inherent in the nature of accidental exposures that the level of exposure is typi[INVESTIGATOR_792640]. Nevertheless, it is generally believed that most clinically relevant accidental exposures to peanut protein occur at low levels.  In 1 well documented case of accidental peanut 
ingestion, the amount ingested was calculated to be approximately 45 mg  (McKenna & Klontz, 
1997).  Moreover, work by [CONTACT_792679] a variety of 
foods and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_792641] a serving, showed that accidental exposures from peanut-contaminated or mislabeled foods are likely to occur a t levels below 
15 mg of peanut protein ( Rimbaud et al., 2013). While across the peanut -allergic populat ion the 
threshold levels at which allergic reactions are triggered varies wide ly, approximately 25% of 
peanut-allergic individuals would be expected to react to 15 mg of peanut protein and 5% to as little as 0.5 -1.5 mg, based on a cross -study retrospective  analysis performed by [CONTACT_792680] (VITAL) 2.0 study group ( Remington 2013
; Allen et al ., 
2014). Moreover, fully half of the peanut allergic  population would be expected to have an 
allergic reaction to no more than 100-[ADDRESS_1092732] many accidental exposures to 
peanut.  
In its Phase 2 study, ARC001, Aimmune Therapeutics showed that a clinically meaningful level 
of protection, defined as the ability to consume a maximum single dose of 300 mg and a cumulative dose of 443 mg in a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), an ethically acceptable model for accidental exposure,  was achievable with daily dosing of AR101, 
a highly characterized, pharmaceutical grade formulation of defatted peanut flour, when administered in a  controlled OIT regimen . As presented in greater detail below,  79% of subjects 
who embarked on the OIT regimen in ARC001 were able to achieve the target dose of 300 mg/d, 
after completing an up-dosing period that lasted, on average, approximately [ADDRESS_1092733] an additional 2 weeks of maintenance therapy at 300 mg/d, all subjects ( ie, 23 of the 
29 origin ally randomized to active treatment) were able to tolerate at least 4 43 mg cumulative of 
peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms in a DBPCFC.  
It is, however, well known from clinical experience, and documented in clinical trials, that a 
peanut- allergic patient’s threshold sensitivity to peanut can vary day to day by [CONTACT_792681] ( Glaumann et al ., 2013). Also, accidental exposures of up to [ADDRESS_1092734]  if a 
significantly greater proportion of subjects  undergoing OIT to a maintenance dose of 300 mg/d 
of peanut protein as AR101, as compared to placeb o, will be able to tolerate at least [ADDRESS_1092735] been completed and their results 
published, including 4 open- label studies ( Jones et al ., 2009; Hofmann et  al., 2009; Blumchen et 
al., 2010; Yu et al ., 2012), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
(Varshney  et al., 2011), and a randomized, contemporaneous natural history-controlled study 
(Anagnostou et al., 2014). All have shown peanut OIT to induce a clinically meaningful level of 
desensitization and to be overall safe and well-tolerated when performed in a supervise d medical 
setting by [CONTACT_21724]. All of the studies tested for desensitization by [CONTACT_792682] 
(OFC) after subjects had gone through a period of up-dosing with increasing amounts of peanut protein followed by a period of maintenance therapy. The two randomized controlled studies are discussed in greater detail  below. 
• Varshney et al ., [ADDRESS_1092736] arting material for AR101 to Aimmune. They enrolled 28 subjects aged 
1 to 16 years. After completing up-dosing to 4000 mg (a much higher level than is proposed in the AR101 trial) over a 44-week period, subjects were maintained at that dose for 1 month and then returned at week 48 for a DBPCFC. Three peanut OIT subjects withdrew early in the study because of allergic side effects. In the DBPCFC all remaining peanut OIT subjects (n = 16) ingested the maximum cumulative dose of 5000 mg of 
peanut protein (appr oximately 20 peanuts), whereas placebo patients (n  = 9) could 
tolerate only a median cumulative dose of 280 mg (range, 0-1900 mg; p < 0.001). In 
contrast with the placebo group, the peanut OIT group showed reductions in skin prick test wheal size (p  < 0.001) and increases in peanut-specific IgG4 (p < 0.001). Peanut OIT 
subjects had initial increases in peanut -specific IgE (p  < 0.01), but this had returned to 
baseline by [CONTACT_792683]. 
• Anagnostou et al., 2014 (STOP II trial) : This single ce nter randomized controlled 
crossover trial in 99 children aged between 7 and 16 years conducted in the [LOCATION_006] used peanut flour as the desensitizing agent that, like the Varshney et al ., 2011 study, came 
from the same manufacturer that supplies the starting material for AR101. The primary outcome was desensitization, defined as a negative peanut challenge to 1400 mg cumulative of peanut protein in a DBPCFC, after a total of 6 months of OIT and a maintenance dose of 800 mg/d of peanut protein. Daily dosing with 800 mg of peanut protein was tolerated by 84% of the children. Desensitization, was reported for 62% of the children in the active arm and 0% of children in the control arm. Also, quality-of- life 
scores improved (decreased) after OIT (median change –1·61; p < 0.001) relative to baseline in within -group comparisons. While this trial used a different dosage regimen

The results of thes e controlled studies are consistent with the results from open- label studies

increasing duration of treatment has been  evident. P eanut OIT has consistently been  assessed to 
be overall safe and well tolerated  in the clinical trial setting , but the authors of even recent 
review articles on the subject conclude that additional work needs to be conducted before OIT for peanut allergy is ready for widespread adoption in clinical practice ( eg, Campbell 2014; 
Trendelenburg et  al., 2014; Nurmatov et al., 2014 ; Le & Burks, 2014). 
The previously published clinical trial findings from peanut- allergic patients ranging in age from 
1 to 65 years old, provided the basis for the Phase  2 trial, ARC001, conducted by [CONTACT_792684], to investigate the efficacy and safety of AR101 in  desensitizing peanut- allergic 
subjects.  
1.2.2 Clinical T rials Sponsored by [CONTACT_489150]   
[IP_ADDRESS] Results of ARC001 , A Phase 2  Study   
Study design: ARC001 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of 
efficacy and safety of AR101 (characterized peanut allergen ) OIT in peanut-allergic children and 
adults (4 to 21 years of age). ARC001 had a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (D SMC) to 
monitor the study for safety. The study consisted of a screening period, an initial escalation 
period, a double- blind OIT treatment (up -dosing and maintenanc e) period, followed by a 
double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC).  
Screening/baseline : All eligible subjects unde rwent a DBPCFC of up to 100 mg (143 mg 
cumulative) of peanut protein or placebo during the screening portion of the study. The 
Screening DBPCFC was an abbreviated version of the DBPCFC described in the PRACTALL guidelines using up to 100 mg (143 mg cumulative) of peanut protein or placebo. Additionally, the DBPCFC progressed through the dose levels in an unaltered sequence without repeating any dose. Those subjects who had dose-limiting symptoms at or before the 100 mg (143 mg cumulative) challenge dose of peanut protein (measured as 200 mg of peanut flour) were 
randomized 1:1 to AR101 or placebo.  
Up-dosing OIT treatment : Subjects received daily oral dosing of AR101 or placebo OIT for 
about [ADDRESS_1092738] observation.   
Exit DBPCFC: After the subjects had been up-dosed to a 300 mg/d dose and had continued to 
receive that dose for 2 weeks, subjects underwent a DBPCFC of up to 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein or placebo.

PALISADE   31 July 2017 All placebo subjects who completed ARC001 were eligible for rollover into the ARC002 
protocol. Placebo subjects in ARC002 underwent an escalation schedule identical to that for 
AR101 subjects in the ARC001 protocol. All subjects on AR101 who passed the DBPCFC by [CONTACT_792685] ≥  443 mg cumulative of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms were 
eligible to proceed to ARC002. Those who did not pass we re considered endpoint failures .  
Efficacy Results:  
In ARC001, 56 subjects were randomized: [ADDRESS_1092739] dose of study treatment was administered.  The intent -to-treat (ITT)  population, thus, comprised 
55 subjects in total, 29 in the AR101 and 26 in the plac ebo arm. The 2 study groups were overall 
well matched for baseline characteristics including baseline sensitivity in the S creening 
DBPCFC. Six subjects in the AR101  arm withdrew from the study prior to the E xit DBPCFC.  
For the primary efficacy analysis con ducted in the ITT Population, AR101 was shown to be 
statistically significantly superior to placebo, with 23 of 29 (79%) AR101 desensitization responders as compared to 5 of 26 (19%) placebo desensitization responders, resulting in a treatment difference o f 60% (p <  0.0001 by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test).  
At the time of the Exit DBPCFC, 100% of the 23 AR101 subjects undergoing the DBPCFC (Completer Population) tolerated  300 mg as compared to, 5 of the 26 (19%) placebo study 
completers, resulting in a treatment diff erence of 81% (p  < 0.0001 by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test).  
It was also found at Exit DBPCFC that 18 of 29 (62%) AR101 subjects in the ITT Population tolerated 600  mg while none of placebo subjects tolerated 600 mg, resulting in a treatment 
difference of 62%. Post -hoc analysis by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test yielded statistical significance at the 
p < 0.0001 level. In the Completer Population, 18 of 23 (78%) AR101- treated  subjects and  no 
placebo subjects tolerated [ADDRESS_1092740] model, AR101  treatment was shown to increase 
the probability of tolerating higher maximum doses with no or mild symptoms  as compared with 
placebo treatment.  The adjusted probability of tolerating 300 mg was 0.82 for AR101  and 
0.14 for placebo; the adjusted probability of  tolerating [ADDRESS_1092741] ratio (95% CI) was determined to be 0.10 (0.04, 0.25) ( p < 0.0001), indicating that the risk of failing the Exit DBPCFC in AR101 
subjects was one -tenth the risk as compared to placebo subjects.  
The percentage of subjects with a maximum symptom severity grade of moderate or severe/worse was lower in the AR101 -treated group than in the placebo -treated group at every 
peanut protein level during the Exit DBPCFC. For AR101 subjects, no subject experie nced a 
severe/worse symptom during Exit DBPCFC, and moderate symptoms were not encountered until a dose of [ADDRESS_1092742] experienced moderate or severe/worse symptoms at each evaluated dose.  
For the key secondary endpoint of change from baseline in maximum tolerated dose of peanut protein at Exit DBPCFC analyzed in an analysis of covariance  (ANCOVA)  model, a treatment

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 difference of 0.912 log 10 mg (p < 0.0001) was observed with a change from baseline in tolerated 
dose of 1.254 log 10 mg for AR101  and 0.341 log 10 mg for placebo. In terms of the ratio of 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of peanut protein at the Exit DBPCFC compared to Baseline, 
AR101  subjects were able to tolerate 17.[ADDRESS_1092743] was calculated as a ratio of two ratios (study 
exit result : baseline result in the AR101 group / study exit result : baseline result in the Placebo group)  The largest relative treatment eff ect, 4.756, was noted for peanut -specific IgG4, reflecting 
study exit values that were 5 -times baseline in the AR101 group compared to levels that were 
nearly unchanged in the Placebo group. The 95% CI around this re lative treatment effect 
(3.271, 6.915) e xcluded the null value of 1.  
For the secondary endpoint of changes in skin prick test (SPT) results, the difference between treatments was calculated as the change from baseline to study exit in the AR101 group minus 
the change from baseline to study exit  in the Placebo group. At exit visit, a notable difference in 
the change from baseline in maximum peanut SPT wheal diameter was observed between 
treatment groups, with a treatment difference of   -5.2 mm.  The 95% CI for this treatment 
difference ( -9.2, - 1.1) excluded the null value of  0. 
Safety Results:  
AR101 was generally well -tolerated.  The overall incidence of  treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) 
was 97% for the AR101 treatment group and 85% for the placebo group. One subject (3%) in the AR101 group experienced a treatment -emergent SAE of anaphylactic reaction related to 
treatment.  And [ADDRESS_1092744] (4%) in the placebo group experienced an SAE of anap hylaxis related 
to the peanut protein in the Exit DBPCFC, not study product. An additional subject experienced 
a non- treatment -emergent SAE of anaphylactic reaction following the Screening DBPCFC. Four 
(14%) AR101 subjects discontinued due to adverse event s, with either hypersensitivity (n  = 3) or 
vomiting (n  = 1) being the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation. Two 
additional AR101 subjects discontinued due to treatment -related reasons that included GI AEs, 
but not exclusively. No placebo s ubjects discontinued due to adverse events. The most 
commonly occurring TEAE was hypersensitivity, which was reported in 71% of study subjects. The next most commonly reported TEAEs were pyrexia (16%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (13%), headache (11% ), and vomiting (11%).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events classified as an allergic reaction by [CONTACT_792686] 71% of subjects. For these treatment -emergent hypersensitivity events, MedDRA coding 
indicated that the most common preferred terms were vomiting (16%) and abdominal pain (15%).  Treatment -emergent hypersensitivity adverse events were more common in AR101 
subjects than in placebo subjects (90% vs. 50%, respectively), however these events tended to be mild or moderate in severity and did  not typi[INVESTIGATOR_792643].

findings were noted. 
In summ ary, AR101 was safe, generally well- tolerated, and statistically superior to placebo for 
reducing clinical reactivity to peanut allergen in peanut-allergic children and adolescents to 
young adults. AR101 treatment significantly increased the probability of tolerating peanut allergen doses ≥  [ADDRESS_1092746] notably peanut- specific IgG4 levels, as compared to placebo.  
[IP_ADDRESS] ARC003 , A Phase 3 Study with AR101   
Protocol ARC003  is designed to be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to confirm the 
efficacy and safety of AR101 as an oral immunotherapy for desensitizing children and adults with peanut allergy .  
[IP_ADDRESS] ARC004, A  Phase 3 Follow- on Study with AR101  
Protocol ARC004 , an open- label  follow -on study from ARC003, will be performed as a separate 
protocol. The study is intended to demonstrate the safety of  daily dosing with AR101  for an 
extended period (months to years), with the following objectives: 
• To expand, in unblinded fashion, the safety database for AR101; 
• To confirm, unblinded, the efficacy of OIT with AR101  up-dosed to a maintenance dose 
of 300 mg/d of peanut protein in the former ARC003 placebo population;  
• To provide an opportunity to the ARC003  trial participants  to maintain  the level of 
desensitization th ey may have achieved.  
1.[ADDRESS_1092747] the risks associated with 
repeated DBPCFC ( Section 9.4) .  
All subjects enrolled must undergo a Screening  DBPCFC to peanut that must be positive at or 
before the 100 mg (144 mg cumulative) dosing level of peanut protein (measured as 2 00 mg of 
peanut flour with approximately 50% protein content) in accordance with  PRACTALL  (Practical 
Issues in Allergology, J oint [LOCATION_002]/European Union I nitiative) consensus guidelines 
(Sampson et al ., 2012), regardless of how they were initially diagnosed as peanut allergic.  This 
should select for roughly the more sensitive half of the peanut-allergic population (Remington 2013; Allen et al ., 2014 ), according to a logistical regression analysis performed by 
[CONTACT_941] V ITAL  2.[ADDRESS_1092748] at risk from accidental exposure, ie , 
ages 4 to 17 years, while allowing for older subjects who are motivate d to seek desensitization to 
be included. It is intended that fully 80% of the study population ( ie, 400 subjects)  will be 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092749] 20 0 subjects randomized from the 4 to  11 year s of age range and 
150 subjects randomized from the 12 to  17 ye ars of  age range. 
The lower  age limit of 4 years was selected based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_582630]-developmental 
considerations related to feeding behavior ( Fallon  et al ., 1984; Cashdan 1994; Farrow & Blisset , 
2012; American Academy of Pediatrics 2013), as well as practical clinical trial exec ution 
considerations and safety . Very young children, for example,  have limited ability to reliably 
follow a study protocol.  
As only about 20% of children with peanut allergy outgrow the condition, it is important to 
collect safety and efficacy data in adults. The upper age limit of 55 years was selected to reduce 
the chance of enrolling subjects with clinically significant heart disease ( Mozaffarian  et al ., 
2015) who  could be at increased risk from the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_792644]. 
This is particularly relevant in the clinical trial setting, where the risk of iatrogenic anaphylaxis is increased due to the requirement for repeated DBPCFC.   
In the current study, subjects with  severe or life -threatening epi[INVESTIGATOR_792645] [ADDRESS_1092750] had prior life- threatening epi[INVESTIGATOR_792646], and hence, are 
exactly the type of patients who could benefit from dese nsitization therapy . 
1.4 Rationale for Selection of Study Drug  Regimen  (Dose and Duration)  
For t he Phase 3 study, ARC003, the dosing regimen to be used is predicated on the dosing 
regimen successfully used in the Phase 2 study, ARC001. The ARC001 dosing regimen, in turn was built on the work of the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) and its 
investigators . The  basic structure of the dosing regimen  consists of  a single- day initial escalation 
at very low doses, followed by a buildup phase of dose escalations , with a single escalation 
occurring every 2 weeks , and  then an extended maintenance phase at a fixed daily dose. This  
dosing regimen has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and efficacious in previous studies (Burks et al ., 2012)  and was shown to be similarly well tolerated and efficacious in the Phase 2 
study, ARC001, conducted by [CONTACT_489150] . 
The total duration of treatment in the current Phase 3 study will be approximately 12 months 
(~6 months escalation and 6 months maintenance at 300 mg/d). Aimmune recognizes that any 
number of up-dosing regimens may be e ffective in escalating peanut -allergic patients to a daily 
maintenance dose of peanut protein, and the [ADDRESS_1092751] demonstrated the ability to allow subjects to tolerate challenge doses ranging from 1.25 to 16.7 times their maintenance dose ( Clark et al ., 
2009; Jones et al., 2009; Blumchen et al., 2010; Varshney et al., 2011; Anagnostou et al., 2014; Cronin, Wisniewski & Commins , 2014; Vickery et al., 2015) . The data from Aimmune’s Phase [ADDRESS_1092752] 2 weeks of maintenance dosing at 300 mg ( with >  95%  passing DBPCF C at a 
cumulative challenge dose of 443 mg of peanut protein and the majority passing at a 1043 mg 
cumulative challenge) and that extending maintenance dosing from [ADDRESS_1092753] improvement in the overall degree of desensitization. Accordingly, a blinded maintenance period  of 6 months is considered sufficient  to demonstrate 
efficacy and assess safety in  the Phase 3 study. The ability to convey to patients that they are at a 
therapeutic level of desensitization in a reasonable timeframe  is an important consideration. 
Thus, the duration of blinded placebo therapy  is limited  to 12 months in this study. 
The data from Aimmune’s Phase 2 trials, consistent with previously published studies, indicate that the use of a low dose maintenance phase can provide a clinically meaningful level of desensitization that is considerably higher than the daily maintenance dose.  Three studies in 
particular (Jones et al ., 2009; Cronin , Wisniewski , & Commin s, 2014; Vickery et al., 2015) have 
specifically reported that daily dosing with 300 mg of peanut protein w ill allow quantities of 
peanut protein ranging from 2.1 to 5 grams to be tolerated in an oral food challenge.  
1.5 Rationale for the Doses Used for the DBPCFC 
The study DBPCFCs will be conducted in accordance with  the recommended PRACTALL 
guidelines although the Screening  DBPCFC will not exceed  100 mg (144 mg cumulative). This 
is to select subjects representative of approximately the more sensitive half of the peanut -allergic 
population ( Section  1.3).   The Exit DBPCFC  will not go above a 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) 
dose to help ensure subject  safety.  Additionally, the DBPCFCs will progress through the dose 
levels in an unaltered sequence without repeating any dose to provide standardization of the 
amounts of peanut protein subjects are exposed to when being tested in the clinical trial setting. 
The Exit DBPCFC will asse ss protection against approximately 2-4 peanuts’ worth of peanut 
protein  at 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) dose. To assess further desensitization, patients 
tolerating the 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) incremental dose will also be challenged with 
1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative ), or approximately 4-8 peanut’s worth of peanut protein. 
Additionally, since accidental exposures typi[INVESTIGATOR_393214] , the 
ability to tolerate 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of peanut protein will be assessed as a key 
secondary endpoint . As discussed in Section 1.1, all of these challenge dose levels are believed 
to represent amounts of peanut protein in excess of what might typi[INVESTIGATOR_792647].  
1.[ADDRESS_1092754] s with peanut allergy, it does not cause discernible side effects in 
humans. 
As noted earlier ( Section 1.1), t here have been several  oral immunotherapy studies performed in 
subjects with peanut allergy using procedures and dosing regim ens similar to those used in our 
Phase 2 studies (ARC001 and ARC002) and proposed for  the current  Phase 3 study. In general,  
the safety profile  from  the completed Phase 2 study, ARC001, was similar to the safety profiles 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 reported from previous peanut OIT studies. At the start of the ARC001 study it was anticipated 
that approximately 80%, 15%,  and < 1% of the subjects would have a t least [ADDRESS_1092755] 1 mild, moderate , or severe symptom,  were 69%, 28%, and 0%, respectively. It is important 
to note that the vast majority of adverse events reported from our Phase [ADDRESS_1092756] been allergy-related, predictable, and reversible. Specifically, the buildup and 
daily maintenance doses of peanut OIT may cause allergic symptoms including sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, flares of eczema, ocular, nasal, oral and/or throat pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, cough, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath , 
in addition to severe anaphylaxis. The likelihood of a subject experiencing any allergic symptoms is expec ted to be lessened by [CONTACT_792687]101  
and by [CONTACT_489135] a clinical setting until the maintenance dose is achieved.  
The major adverse event  of concern from peanut OIT, other than anaphylaxis, that has been 
reported in the literature is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) , reversible upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90524]. In 
the ARC001 study, 6 (20%) of the AR101-treated subjects discontinued dosing prematurely for treatment- related reasons associated with GI AEs.  One of these subjects subsequently underwent 
endoscopy and was found to have biopsy-proven EoE.  
There is a strong association between IgE-mediated food allergy and EoE ( Noel 2004; 
Spergel 2012; Greenhawt 2014).  Consequently, patients with IgE- medi ated food allergy who 
encounter the food to which they are allergic, such as must occur during OIT, are at increased 
risk for manifesting EoE.  As of 2014, at least [ADDRESS_1092757] been reported ( Lucendo et al ., 2014).  At present , it remains unclear 
whether in such cases OIT induces EoE or causes pre- existing subclinical EoE to become 
symptomatic.  When EoE occurs spontaneously, the current standard of care treatment generally 
entails removing known or suspected food allergens from the diet. When EoE occurs in the setting of OIT, treatment should similarly entail removal of the desensitizing ( ie, allergenic) 
agent. As the diagnosis of EoE requires endoscopic biopsy, the true incidence of EoE related to OIT is diff icult to know, because withdrawal of the offending allergen is typi[INVESTIGATOR_792648], which in turn tends to obviate the need to perform an invasive procedure. Given the association between IgE-mediated food allergy and EoE, a high index of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_792649]-like process should be maintained whenever chronic recurrent GI symptoms occur during OIT.  
Oral food challenges are expected to  induce an allergic response in food- allergic individuals. 
Allergic reactions can be severe, including life-threatening allergic reactions; however, the risk of an allergic reaction is reduced by [CONTACT_80927] a very small amount of the food, gradually increasing the dose, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_792650] a 
significant reaction.  If subjects have an allergic reaction during the challenges, they may need 
oral, intramuscular, or intravenous medications , and will be treated per study center standard of 
care. Trained personnel, including a physician, as well as medications and equipment  (per 
PRACTALL recommendations and investigational site standard operating procedures) , will be 
immediately available to treat any reaction.  With these precautions, t he rate of severe,

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 life-threatening , serious adverse even ts of anaphylaxis due to OIT is anticipate d to be <  0.5% 
over the course of the ARC003 study. 
There may be a risk that during participation in the trial the subjects may decrease their vigilance 
against accidental peanut ingestion because they believe they  are protected from it.  This 
phenomenon has been reported in previous trials. S ubjects in the trial and their participating 
family will be warned that they should continue to practice their usual vigilance against accidental ingestion of peanuts or peanut-containing foods. 
1.6.[ADDRESS_1092758] may 
receive placebo during the double-blind treatment period of the study. Information from this study may help researchers to better understand peanut allergy or to develop future tests or treatments  to help patients with this condition. 
2 OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of AR101, a pharmaceutical -grade peanut 
allergen formulation, through reduction in clinical reactivity to limited amounts of peanut allergen in peanut- allergic children (ages 4 -17 years,  inclusive).  
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
The secondary objectives are: 
• To demonstrate the safety of AR101  as measured by  [CONTACT_20497], 
including serious adverse events in children (ages 4-17 years, inclusive). 
• To evaluate the immunological effects of peanut OIT therapy in children (age s 
4-17 years, inclusive) . 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
ARC003  is a multi- center, randomized , double-blind placebo-controlled study. The study design 
is illustrated in  Figure 3 -1. 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 Figure 3–1. Study Design 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1092759] a clinical history of peanut allergy, a serum IgE to peanut 
of ≥ 0.35 kU A/L and/or a skin prick test ( SPT) to peanut of ≥ 3 mm v ersus control at the time of 
screening . All eligible subjects will undergo an initial DBPCFC at the end of the screening  
period (refer to Section 6.6.1) . This  DBPCFC will include both a peanut challenge (defatted 
peanut flour) and a placebo challenge ( artificially peanut -flavored oat flour)  on separate days. 
The Screening  DBPCFC  will be an a bbreviated version of the DBPCFC described in the 
PRACTALL guidelines , with top challenge doses of 100 mg (1 44 mg cumulative) of peanut 
protein and placebo. 
For each subject, a “blinded” Evaluating Physician  (Blinded Assessor) is to be designated to 
assess the tolerability of the challenge doses presented in the DBPCFC. The Blinded Evaluating 
Physician is not to be involved directly  in the oversight of study product dosing (neither initial 
escalation, nor up-dosing, nor maintenance ), nor the assessment or management of adverse 
events. To the extent practicable, the same Blinded Evaluating Physician who determines DLSs in the Screening DBPCFC should determine DLSs in the Exit DBPCFC. 
Those subject s who have dose- limiting symptoms at or before the 100 mg (1 44 mg cumulative) 
challenge dose of peanut protein  (measured as 200 mg of peanut flour) will be enrolled into the 
study. According to a logistical regression analysis performed by [CONTACT_941] V ITAL  2.[ADDRESS_1092760] for roughly the more sensitive 
half of the peanut-allergic population ( Remington, 2013; Allen et al., 2014). Those who 
successfully consume a [ADDRESS_1092761] had dose- limiting symptoms to  the placebo part, or both 
parts , of the Screening  DBPCFC ( ie, to oat flour as well as peanut flour) will be considered a 
screen failure and will not be randomized. 
Approximately 500 subjects who pass screening will be randomized 3:1 to either AR101 (active 
treatment) or placebo using a proprietary passwor d-protected i nteractive response system . At 
least 80% of the subjects randomized will be children. 
3.2 Treatment Phase  
The Treatment Phase comprises 3 periods:  
• Initial Escalation Period  – 2 days in duration; 
• Up-dosing Period (also referred to as the Buildup Period) – This is defined as the time 
from the subject’s first home dose of study product at [ADDRESS_1092762]’s first in- clinic 
dose at 300 mg, ideally 20 weeks in duration, but may be extended to a maximum of 
40 weeks to accommodate dose reductions and  re-escalations, if necessary;  
• Maintenance Period  – The Maintenance Period starts with  the first home dose of 
300 mg. Ideally , it will be 24 weeks in duration, but it may be extended by [CONTACT_792688] 4 weeks (for a maximum Maintenance Period duration of 2 8 weeks), or to a 
total Treatment Phase duration of [ADDRESS_1092763], to accommodate dose reductions and re-escalations that may occur during the final weeks of the Maintenance Period . 
The Treatment Phase start s with an initial escalation at the study center, followed by [CONTACT_25764]-dosing 
for approximately 20 weeks, and then approximately 24 wee ks of maintenance dosing at 
300 mg/d . Treatment will be conducted in a double-blind fashion. The  study products (AR101 or 
placebo) will be coded according to subject randomization number. The subjects and the investigational site personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment . 
After the initial escalation period (comprising dose -escalation to a maximum of 6  mg on Day-1 
and confirmation of the tolerability of a single 3 mg dose on Day-2) , subjects will report to the 
study center every 2 weeks to escalate their  OIT  dose to an expected daily dose of 300 mg of 
peanut protein. This constitutes the Up -dosing Period. The dose- escalation schedule is described 
in detail in  Table 3 -1 and  Table 3 -2.

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 All subjects who reach and tolerate 300 mg/d  will continue at that dose level for the duration of 
the Maintenance Period . The first Maintenance visit occurs [ADDRESS_1092766] unable to achieve a dose of 300 mg/d  of 
peanut protein by [ADDRESS_1092767], 
as described in  Section 6.7.2 and Section 6.7.3, and illustrated  in Figure 6 -1 and Figure 6 -2 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If a subject  discontinues therapy prematurely for any reason, the subject will be followed for 
safety and asked to return to the CRC [ADDRESS_1092768] to 
undergo an Early Discontinuation Vis it (Section  6.5). In the event of ongoing AEs, subjects who 
have discontinued therapy should continue to be followed beyond the Early Discontinuation 
Visit until such time as the AE has resolved or is assessed to have reached a chronic stable state (a determination that may  not be made sooner than 30 days after the Early Discontinuation  
Visit). 
A Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be  established and will meet approximately 
every 3 months to monitor the study for safety.  
3.3 Exit DBPCFC  
All s ubjects who reach the targeted daily dose of 300 mg and maintain that dose through the 
Maintenance Period  will undergo an Exit DBPCFC. The Exit DBPCFC  will be performed in 
accordance with PRACTALL guidelines, but starting at a dose of 3 mg of peanut protein (except 
for subjects who reacted to 1 mg in their Screening DBPCFC; these subjects will be required to 
start their Exit challenge at 1 mg; see also Section  6.6.2) and requiring progression in an 
unaltered sequence ( Table 6 -1), without repeating any dose. Also, the Exit DBPCFC will includ e 
a [ADDRESS_1092769] will be unblinded after  he/she completes the DBPCFC , provided regulatory and 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Ethics Committee (EC) approval for ARC004 have been 
recei ved, the availability of IP for ARC004, and all major data queries for the subject have been 
resolved . If this is not the case, the subject shall remain on blinded treatment until these 
requirements are satisfied. The subject should continue his or her mai ntenance visits (completed 
as unscheduled visits) every 30 days, and complete all protocol procedures at each visit until 
study completion and rollover to ARC004. To  maintain the study blind overall, individual 
unblinding information should only be distributed to designated team members on a need -to-know basis (refer to Masking Plan for details).  
Subjects who do not reach the target dose by W eek [ADDRESS_1092770] . 
3.4 Follow -on Study ARC00 4 
All placebo subjects  who complete ARC003 are eligible for rollover into the ARC004 protocol. 
Placebo subjects from ARC003 will, in A RC004, undergo an escalation schedule identical to that 
for active subjects in the ARC003 protocol. All subjects on active treatment in ARC003 who 
pass the DBPCFC at the 300 mg ( 443 mg cumulative ) challenge dose level of peanut protein are 
eligible to proc eed to ARC004. Those who do not pass  DBPCFC at the  300 mg ( 443 mg 
cumulative ) challenge dose level  will be considered endpoint failures and nonresponder s for the 
primary analysis.  They will not be eligible for rollover into the ARC004 protocol  due to safety 
concerns . Those subjects who pass  DBPCFC at the  300 mg ( 443 mg cumulative ) challenge dose 
level , but fail at the 600 mg ( 1043 mg cumulative ) or 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) challenge 
dose level , will be considered endpoint failures and nonre sponder s for the primary analysis  for 
North America  or Europe, respectively ; however, t hey will be eligible for rollover into the 
ARC004 protocol because tolerating a 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) dose of peanut protein is considered a clinically relevant lev el of desensitization  in the event of accidental exposure . 
Upon successful completion of Study ARC003, all subjects will be eligible to receive AR101 in Study ARC004. S ubjects  who received AR101 in Study ARC003 will continue on their 
maintenance dose of 300 mg/d, and subjects who had previously received placebo in Study 
ARC003 will undergo dose -escalation according to the same schedule and procedures used in 
ARC00 3, but in open -label fashion.  At the end of the up- dosing period followed by a period of 
continued maintenance dosing at 300 mg/d, those subj ects will be required to pass a DBPCFC by 
[CONTACT_792685] 300 mg ( 443 mg cumulative ) of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms to 
continue in the study. All subjects continuing maintenance th erapy in ARC004 will be required 
to undergo a DBPCF C after at least 6  months of additional maintenance treatment.   
3.5 Study Design Safety Considerations  
The study design incorporates  the following important safety considerations : 
• All dose escalations w ill be  performed under direct observation and medical  supervis ion 
in the CRC 
• The peanut OIT  will start at 0.5 mg and will only escalate to  a maximum  single dose of 
6 mg during the initial escalation on Day -1 
• Adverse events , including dosing- related allergic  symptoms,  whether expected or not,  
will be captured throughout the study 
• All subjects  and/or their participating family  (as appropriate for age and home 
circumstances)  will be provided with  an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injector and will be trained in 
its use  
• Subje cts will be strongly cautioned against consuming any peanuts or peanut -containi ng 
foods other than the study product  while on study, and will be instructed to remain on a 
peanut -free diet.

sachets requiring one sachet/day.  Matching placebo containing sachets are also provided . 
Capsules containing study product will be provided in pre- packaged  bottles or blister cards 
assembled into dosing kits. Each individual bottle or blister of a blister card will contain a single 
day’s dos e of study product; each kit will contain 21 daily doses at a given dose level, enough to

(Section  3).  
All study products ( both peanut allergen  and placebos) will be packaged  and labeled at the 
central packaging facility . The products will then be shipped to a drug depot where they will be 
labeled and inventoried for shipment to the clinical sites. Study products will be shipped  by [CONTACT_792690], according to site-specific institutional policies.  Study products will then be di stributed to subjects/subjects’ parents

held at the site for documented destruction or return to the sponsor’s designee (as instructed) ; 
dosing kits once opened cannot be used for any other dosing interval or any other subject. At each clinic visit, subject s will receive a kit of capsules to be taken at home according to their 
specific dose level.  The subjects will be instructed to document capsules taken at home using 
electronic diary logs and to bring all unused capsules back to the clinic at the next visit.  The 
subjects will be instructed to store the dosing kit  in the refrigerator other than when it is removed 
to obtain the daily dose. 
Procedures for preparation and administration of doses given in clinic or at home are the same.  
Dose preparation is to be  completed by [CONTACT_792691], as age- appropriate.  (For 
in-clinic dosing, dose preparation may be performed by [CONTACT_792692]/subject under the 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092790] supervision of clinic staff for the purpose of teaching and reinforcing training.) The 
capsules should be pulled apart, and gently rolled between finger and thumb, followed by a light 
tap to the end of each half of the capsule to ensure full delivery of contents. The contents of the 
capsules are to  be mixed with a vehicle food, such as apple sauce, yogurt, pudding, or other 
palatable, age-appropriate, food. Care must be taken not to inhale the powder as this could provoke worsening of asthma or induce an allergic reaction. Study product may not be added to food heated  above room temperature before consumption. The vehicle food must be one to 
which the subject is not additionally allergic.  The v olume of the vehicle food should be such that 
the entire dose can be consumed in a few spoonfuls.  The study product should be consumed as 
promptly after mixing  as practicable. If not consumed within [ADDRESS_1092791] be taken at a consistent time (within a 4- hour time period) each day . A targ et 
interval of at least [ADDRESS_1092792] activities likely to increase allergic  reactivity ( eg, exercising or taking hot showers or 
baths within 3 h after dosing). Dosing should also not occur within [ADDRESS_1092793] has been engaged in strenuous exercise prior to dosing, dosing should be delayed until signs of a hypermetabolic state ( eg, flushing, sweating, rapid breathing, and/or 
rapid heart rate) have abated.  
Except as may be necessary in the course of treating an adverse even t (Section  6.7), it is crucial  
that subjects take their dose every day. No attempt should be made to make up for a missed dose if greater than [ADDRESS_1092794] elapsed since usual time of dosing. 
5.3 Drug Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) and International Council 
for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guid eline  (ICH E6),  the investigator is required to 
maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug (study product) received, to whom the drug was dispensed (subject-by-subject accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452]. A drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each subject. This log will contain the identification of each subject  and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. 
All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection by [CONTACT_93243].  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092795] should be brought back to the clinic with each visit for reconciliation of remaining capsules/sachets.  
5.5 Modification of Study Treatment  
As described in the protocol ( Section 6.7) , pea nut OIT doses may be adjusted by [CONTACT_792693] . If such a dose modific ation 
occurs, the subject will return all kits and  unused capsules /sachets  of study product during the 
dose adjustment visit, and be dispensed capsules at the adjusted dose level. 5.[ADDRESS_1092796] be able to discontinue antihistamines  and other medications that could interfere with the 
assessment of an allergic reaction  5 half -lives  prior to the initial day of escalation, skin prick 
testing  (SPT) , and oral food challenges. Usua l topi[INVESTIGATOR_266746].  
5.7 Prophylactic Medications 
None. 
Although symptomatic treatments for chronic/recurrent AEs are  permitted, as for example with 
H-1 or H-2 histamine blockers, proton pump inhibitors, or beta-adrenergic agonists, such 
medications should not be started in advance of symptoms; once started, their use should be minimized , and then discontinued, at the earliest medically appropriate opportunity.  
5.8 Rescue Medications for Acute Allergic Reactions 
Treatment of individual acute allergic reactions during peanut OIT therapy should be with either 
an antihistamine and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], along with IV fluids, beta -adrenergic agonist ( eg, albuterol), 
oxygen, and/or steroids, as indicated.  Subjects and parents /guardians are likely already to have 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injection device , but for those who do not, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injection 
device will be provided.  The expi[INVESTIGATOR_792654]- injectors will be tracked and 
subject/families resupplied  as necessary.  Study staff must document in each subject’s medical 
record that the subject and parent/guardian have been provided with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]-injection device and have been trained in its proper usage including injection technique.
  
5.9 Symptomati c Treatment for Chronic and/or Recurrent Adverse Events  
Symptomatic treatment for chronic/recurrent AEs is permitted (except for  prohibited medications  
[Section  5.10]), but should be used to supplement dose reduction, not substitute for it. It is 
advised that an attempt to withdraw symptomatic therapy be made prior to dose re- escalation.  If

related to study product, must be withdrawn by [ADDRESS_1092798] will be considered a  nonresponder .
 
5.10 Prohibited Medications 
1. Omalizumab (Xolair)  
2. Systemic (oral) corticosteroids used for any greater  duration than a total of [ADDRESS_1092799] not be up -dosed during the  3 days 
after ceasing the administration of oral steroids

be weighed against the potential benefits of peanut OIT. This assessment must be performed for any medications being taken at study entry or added during the course of the study. Th e use of 
medication with known cardiovascular side effects during the course of the study is discouraged; but if an investigator deems use necessary, it must be undertaken with caution. It is beyond the scope of this protocol to list all drugs with cardiov ascular side effects. Classes of d rugs with a 
high potential for cardiovascular side effects include antipsychotics, cycloo xygenase 2  inhibitors 
(chronic use), non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (chronic use), a ntiarrhythmics, 
antihypertensive s, and ant ineoplastic s. Before a drug with cardiovascular side effects is used in 
conjunction with OIT, the investigator should discuss its use with 1 of the study’s Medical Monitors.  
Immunomodulatory (including immunosuppressive) medications constitute another class of drugs whose use  during the course of the study is generally prohibited. It is beyond the scope of 
this protocol to list all immunomodulatory drugs; broadly, these include drugs to treat or prevent transplant rejection, autoimmune disease, and cert ain neoplasias -  examples include 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, anti -tumor necrosis alpha drugs, and anti -IgE drugs. If an investigator 
contemplates the use of a potentially immunomodulatory drug during the course of the study, the investigator should discuss this with 1 of the study’s Medical Monitors .

stratifying randomization for age and geographic region will ensure balanced representation of potentially relevant subpopulations in ARC003. It is anticipated that approximately 65% of subjects will be recruited from North America, 30% from Europe, and potentially  up to 5% from 
other regions. Investigational centers from Southern as well as Northern Europe are expected to participate.  At least 80% of the subje cts randomized will be children . Analysis of the ARC001 
data showed no interactive effect of age on treatment effect ( ie, desensitization), so stratification 
by [CONTACT_792694] [ADDRESS_1092803] pari ty between males and females after the age of puberty, social factors can play a 
significant role in clinical trial participation, such that a given clinical  trial population may not 
match exactly the disease population. Taking this into account, a target for the proportion of males to females recruited from the adolescent and adult peanut -allergic populations is not being 
set.  
Randomization will be performed  using an interactive response system .

[ADDRESS_1092833] dose of AR101  to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (Section  6.5). 
The procedures for dose reduction and re-escalating back to a dose of 300 mg/d in the Maintenance Period  will follow the same guidelines as for the Up -dosing Period.  
The procedure for monitoring subjects for safety after in-clinic dosing is the same as for up -
dosing visits ( Section 6.7.3) , except  that the initial period of required post-dose observation may 
be shortened to 30 min. 
6.4 Unscheduled Visits / Unscheduled Blood Draws  
The procedures performed at Unscheduled Visits may include any or all of those performed at 
Up-dosing Visits.  
Additionally, if a subject (subject’s parent/guardian) declares his or her intention to discontinue study product dosing, whether at a scheduled visit or an unscheduled visit, a blood draw should be performed to obtain a CBC, immunoglobulin assays, and optional exploratory immune cell 
characterization samples (if the subj ect is participating in the sub study). If a blood draw is 
performed at this time, it will take the place of the Exit Visit / Early Discontinuation Visit blood draw ( Section 6.5).  
6.5 Exit Visit / Early Discontinuation Visit  
Subjects who tolerate 300 mg/d  and a re maintained at this dose for approximately [ADDRESS_1092834]. 
Subjects who withdraw from ARC003 wholly or in part due to intolerable gastrointestinal 
symptoms, who are not enrolled in the optional saliva study, may be approached at the time of their early termination v isit to provide voluntary consent to enroll and participate in the saliva 
substudy (North America sites only) . If this occurs, such subjects will provide a saliva sample 
as part of the early termination visit and then again during post- OIT follow -up ( Table A6  in 
Appendix  6). 
The following procedures will be performed at the Exit/ Early Discontinuation  Visit: 
• Concomitant medication  review

• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature); if DBPCFC is to be conducted, these vital sign measurements should be taken shortly before the first challenge dose 
• PEFR ([ADDRESS_1092835] value taken). PEFR should , to the 
extent possible,  be measured at the same time as for prior visit assessment s. 
• Urine p regnancy test, for females of childbearing potential 
• Blood draw to collect samples for :  
o Peanut- and peanut -component specific IgE , total IgE, and peanut- and peanut-
component specific IgG4 measurement  (immunoglobulin assays. The amount of 
blood taken for the immunoglobulin assays will be communicated from the central 
laboratory and included in the manual of procedures.

the approximately 24- week  Maintenance Period.  The Exit DBPCFC is to  be conducted in 
accordance with PRACTALL guidelines, with the protocol- specified modifications, as described 
in Section 6.6.2. 
Each subject participating in the study will be unblinded when he/she completes the Exit Vi sit 
procedures (including the Exit DBPCFC for eligible subjects), provided regulatory and IRB/EC 
approval for ARC004 have been received, the availability of IP for ARC004, and all major data 
queries for the subject have been resolved  (Section 3.3). If this is not the case, the subject shall 
remain on blinded treatment until these requirements are satisfied. The subject should continue his or her maintenance visits (completed as unscheduled visits), every [ADDRESS_1092837]. All ARC003 placebo subjects who complete the study are eligible for rollover into the ARC004 
protocol. Former ARC00 3 placebo  subjects in ARC004 will undergo an escalation schedule 
identical to that for active subjects in the ARC003 protocol.  All subjects on active treatment

level of peanut protein are eligible to proceed to ARC004. Those who do not pass DBPCFC at the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) challenge dose level  will be considered endpoint failures and 
nonresponder s for the primary analysis.  They will not be eligible for rollover into the ARC004 
protocol due to safety concerns. Those subjects who pass DBPCFC at the  300 mg ( 443 mg 
cumulative) challenge dose level , but fail at the 600 mg (1043 mg cumulativ e) or 1000 mg

nonresponders for the primary analysis for North America  or Europe, respectively ; however, 
they will be eligible for rollover into the ARC004 protocol because tolerating a 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) dose of peanut protein is considered a clinically relevant level of desensitization. 
6.6 Double -Blind , Placebo Controlled Food Challenge  (DBPCFC) 
Prior to performing DBPCFC,  the subject must  be off antihistamines and other medications that 
could interfere with the assessment of the DBPCFC  for an appropriate length of time (5 half-
lives of the antihistamine or other medication in question). Also p rior to the DBPCFC , subjects 
will be assessed for an exacerbation of asthma as determined by [CONTACT_393265] a PEFR  < 
80% of predicted.  
Subjects must be free from active wheezing,  a flare of atopic  disease ( eg, atopic dermatitis ), or 
suspected intercurrent illness prior to DBPCFC. Additionally, subjects must be fully recovered, 
ie back to their baseline state of health, from any preceding illness for at least [ADDRESS_1092838]  allergenic food (in this case, peanut , presented as

*For explanation of contingent/optional doses indicated in parentheses refer to  Section  6.6.[ADDRESS_1092840], a “blinded” Evaluating Physician (Blinded Assessor) is to be designated to assess the tolerability of the challenge doses presented in the DBPCFC. The Blinded Evaluating Physician is not to be involved directly in the oversight of study product dosing (neither initial 
escalation, nor up-dosing, nor maintenance ), nor the assessment or management of adverse 
events (for details refer to the Masking Plan). To the extent practicable, the same Blinded Evaluating Physician who determines DLSs in the Screening DBPCFC should determine DLSs in the Exit DBPCFC.  
Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) are to be measured just prior to each challenge dose of the DBPCFC or at [ADDRESS_1092841] occurred. Dose-limiting symptoms, in the setting of the DBPCFC, are any symptoms that, in the investigator ’s assessment, indicate poor tolerability of the last challenge dose administered, and 
preclude safe advancement to the next challenge dose.  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 Dose -limiting symptoms, typi[INVESTIGATOR_393232]  (signs), indicate a positive reaction and 
termination of dosing. The criteria for determining if symptoms are dose limiting during 
DBPCFC are the same as for determining whether a specific dose during up -dosing is tolerated 
(Section  6.7) with the exception that even mild symptoms, if they require pharmacological 
treatment, will be considered dose -limiting . 
As with up -dosing, severe symptoms will always be assessed as dose limiting; and moderate 
symptoms, with only rare exceptions (requiring a documented explanation), will also be assessed 
as dose limiting. Mild symptoms, on the other hand, may or may not be assessed as dose- limitin g 
(Section  6.7). 
In general, if an investigator is unwilling to advance to the next challenge dose in a DBPCFC because of the emergence of allergic symptoms, the last symptom -eliciting challenge dose 
should be considered  to have  been  not tolerated due to dose- limiting symptoms.  There may, 
however, be exceptions to this, as for example if an emotional reaction to continuing the challenge dose escalation interferes with the ability to progress the dose escalation to the point where  convincingly (typi[INVESTIGATOR_792656]) dose limiting symptoms occur. Any such instances must 
be accompanied by [CONTACT_792697].  
On the days that subjects undergo DBPCFC s (Screening and Exit), they must, at a minimum, be 
observed for [ADDRESS_1092842] challenge dose, with vital sign measurements 
and assessment for signs and symptoms of allergic reaction performed every 30 minutes. Any signs or symptoms of allergic reaction will be recorded in the CRF on the appropriate Dosing Symptom / AE form.  
If DBPCFC is completed with no symptoms detected after [ADDRESS_1092843]/subject’s parent or guardian to enquire if any AEs (including allergic symptoms) occurred subsequent to the subject leaving the clinic, and to provide assistance in the recording of any such events. 
6.6.1 Screening Double -Blind , Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC)  
The initial (Screening)  DBPCFC for eligi bility will consist of administering gradually increasing 
challenge doses of a peanut flour mixture  (containing ~50% peanut protein) or a placebo  (oat) 
flour mixture , mixed in a vehicle food, at 20 to 30 min intervals.  The placebo flour mixture  will 
be supplied pre-mixed with a small amount of artificial peanut flavor to provide a reasonable 
degree of taste-matching of the final placebo/vehicle food mixture to the peanut/vehicle food mixture.  Additional, non- allergenic, powdered flavoring agents have be en added both to the 
peanut and placebo flour mixture s to help further mask the distinctive flavor of peanut. A small 
amount of oat flour has been added to the peanut flour mixture to help match its consistency to 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 the placebo flour mixture. Investigational sites will be provided with standardized recipes for 
preparation of the DBPCFC in a separate manual of procedures.  
The Screening DBPCFC will be performed in accordance with PRACTALL guidelines, but requiring progression in an unaltered sequence without repeating any dose. The procedure will also be modified in that the top dose will be capped at 100 mg (144 mg cumula tive) peanut 
protein or placebo, as shown in  Table 6 -1. Other wise, the PRACTALL recommendations for 
maintaining safety and  assessing symptom severity serve as useful guidelines. 
The DBPCFC is to be conducted as 2 challenges, each on a separate day , using a placebo 
(artificially peanut -flavored oat flour)  for one challenge and peanut (as defatted peanut flour)  for 
the other. The [ADDRESS_1092844]’s caregiver, nor any of the 
clinic staff (save for the unblinded preparer of the challenge foods) knows which challenge 
contains the peanut or the placebo. The same vehicle food should be used for both parts of the DBPCFC.  The clinic staff may not be unblinded as to the order of the two parts (peanut and 
placebo) of the DBPCFC until after completion of the observation period of the second part of the challenge.  
6.6.2 Exit Double -Blind , Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC)  
The Exit DBPCFC will be conducted in a manner similar to  the Screening  DBPCFC, but starting 
at a dose of 3 mg of peanut protein (except for subjects who fai led their Screening DBPCFC at 
1 mg), and with the last 3 challenge doses progressing from 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) to 
600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) and then to 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein as 
shown in  Table [ADDRESS_1092845] should continue on the days between the two parts of the Exit 
DBPCFC, according to the same dosing guidelines that apply throughout the Maintenance 
Period. 
Subjects who failed their Screening DBPCFC at the 1 mg challenge dose of peanut protein will 
be required to start the Exit DBPCFC with a 1 mg dose. At the investigator’s discretion, a 1  mg 
dose may be added at the beginning of the escalation (for a maximum cumulative dose of 2044 mg peanut protein) of any subject’s Exit DBPCFC. 
Subjects will be considered desensitization responders for the primary endpoint analysis for 
North America or Europe  if they are able to tolerate  an Exit DBPCFC challenge dose of 600 mg 
(1043 mg cumulative) or 1000 mg (2043 cumulative) of peanut protein with no, or only mild, symptoms , respectively .

6.7.1 Assessment of the Severity  of Acute Allergic Reaction s to Peanut  OIT   
Subjects may develop allergic symptoms during the course of OIT, similar to those seen during 
other desensitization protocols ( eg, venom immunotherapy, drug desensitization, desensitization 
to aeroallergens by [CONTACT_22666] ). The severity of the reaction will be determined on 
the basis of the investigator’s judgment. The following definitions, developed to be consistent both with the PRACTALL consensu s report on DBPCFC, and with the CoFAR grading system 
for allergic reactions, are provided as a general guide.  
Mild Symptoms:  
• Skin – limited  (few)  or localized hives, swelling  (eg, mild lip edema ), skin flushing ( eg, 
few areas of faint erythema) or pruritu s (mild, eg , causing occasional scratching ) 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – rhinorrhea ( eg, occasional sniffling or sneezing ), nasal congestion, 
occasional cough, throat discomfort  
• Gastrointestinal (GI ) – mild abdominal discomfort (including mild nausea), minor 
vomiting  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) and/or a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_792657] S ymptoms : 
• Skin – systemic hives ( eg, numerous or widespread hives), swelling  (eg, significant lip or 
face edema), p ruritus  causing protracted  scratching, more than a few areas of erythema or 
pronounced erythema   
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing without

• GI – persistent moderate abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/nausea, more than a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_393221]/or diarrhea  
Severe Symptoms:

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 clinical judgment in determining the tolerability of a dose is when the dose elicits mild allergic 
symptoms.  The following Table 6 -2 illu strates the likely combinations of symptom severity and 
tolerability:  
Table 6-2. Allergy Symptom Severity and Study Product Dose Tolerability  
Symptom Severity  Assessed Tolerability  
None  Tolerated

Mild , meeting  pre-defined tolerability criteria ( Section 6.7.1 ) Tolerated  
Mild , not meeting pre- defined tolerability criteria ( Section  6.7.1 ) Not tolerated  
Moderate  (except for rare exceptions,  Section  6.7.1) Not tolerated  
Severe Not tolerated  
In general, the severity of an allergic reaction will correspond to the maximum severity of any of 
its symptoms. 
No Symptoms : If a dose elicits no symptoms, the dose will be assessed as tolerated.  
Mild Symptoms : When dosing with study product elicits an acut e reaction characterized by [CONTACT_792698] a mild symptom or symptoms, the investigator will be required to assess 
whether the dose was or was not tolerated.  The determination of tolerability must be made on the 
basis of clinical judgement.  The following are presented as guidelines for determining whether a 
dose associated with the emergence of a mild symptom or symptoms was tolerated.  A dose 
eliciting only mild symptoms may be considered to be tolerated if the symptoms are:  
• Isolated to a single organ system 
• Resolve with no pharmaceutical intervention or with a single oral administration of an H1 antihistamine  
• Do not require administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
• Are not worsening in intensity or distribution over time  
• Resolve, or shows definite signs of resolving, in under 1 hour 
• Do not include objective wheezing 
Based on experience from Phase 2, most acute allergic responses to dosing that are characterized by [CONTACT_792699].  If, however, an allergic 
response to dosing is characterized by [CONTACT_792700] (eg, has mild symptoms occurring in 2 or more organ systems, requires treatment with 2 doses of 
antihistamine or 1 dose epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], shows progression in severity or distribution over time, is protracted in duration, or includes objective wheezing), then even though the allergic symptoms may be mild, the dose sh ould be assessed to be not tolerated.  If a dose elicits mild symptoms that  
do not fit all of the above criteria and the dose is assessed to be tolerated, then a brief explanation 
as to why the dose was considered tolerated must  be recorded in the CRF.  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 Moderate s ymptoms : In general, if a dose elicits moderate symptoms, the dose will be assessed 
as not tolerated.  There may, however, be rare occasions when a dose eliciting moderate 
symptoms could be assessed as tolerated.  Generally , this would only be the case for a transient, 
self-limited (requiring no intervention and resolving completely) symptom occurring in a single 
organ system. In addition, typi[INVESTIGATOR_558253]. Any dose associated 
with moderate sympt oms and assessed as tolerated must be accompanied by a brief explanation 
in the CRF as to why the dose was considered tolerated.   
Severe symptoms : In nearly all cases, if a dose elicits severe symptoms, the dose will be 
assessed as not tolerated.  Whenever a dose elicits an allergic response characterized by [ADDRESS_1092848] should continue in the study, dosing at a 
reduced dose level, or be discontinued early from the study.  
The determination of tolerability will decide the course of action to be taken in response to dose-
related reactions ( Section  6.7.3).  
6.7.3 Assessment of the T olerability  of a D ose Level  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Acute Symptoms Occurring after D osing  
The assessment of the tolerability of a single dose forms the foundation for assessing the tolerability of  a dose level during home- dosing when acute symptoms arise in close temporal 
succession to dosing. With the report of moderate or severe  symptoms occurring during 
home -dosing, the dose level should be considered not tolerated and the subject brought to the 
clinic the day after the emergence of such symptoms for administration of the next dose of study product under medical supervision. If a dose administered at home is suspected to have been not tolerated, even on the basis of mild symptoms, the subject should also return to the CRC for dosing under medical supervision.  
The recurrence of a mild symptom or symptoms over the course of several  days of home-dosing 
should suggest that the dose level is not tolerated, even if each individual occurrence of 
symptoms could be assessed  as tolerated  on the basis of the criteria listed above. If the 
investigational site is notified of mild dose-related symptoms on [ADDRESS_1092849] observation for assessment of the tolerability of the dose level.  If mild dose-related symptoms are noted on 7 or 
more occasions during a 2-week dosing interval at a given dose level, that dose level should be considered not tolerated and appropriate action taken ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Because of the reduced reliability inherent in the second -hand reporting of symptoms, 
investigators are strongly encouraged to have subjects return to the clinic to undergo dosing under direct observation whenever acute allergic symptoms associated with do sing are reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Chronic / Recurrent S ymptoms  
GI symptoms were the most common potentially allergic symptoms to occur on a subacute, chronic, and/or recurrent basis during Phase [ADDRESS_1092850] a chronic/recurrent reaction to study product, the dose level 
should be reduced. As with acute symptoms, the level of the dose reduction should be guided by [CONTACT_107610]. Symptomat ic treatment is permitted (refer to  Section 6.7.5) , but 
should be used as a supplement to  dose reduction, not a substitute for it. 
For chronic/recurrent GI symptoms, especially upper GI symptoms, investigators are advised to have a low threshold for instituting a dose reduction and/or for considering early discontinuation of affected subjects from the study , owing to the potential for EoE.  
For subjects determined to be having dose- limiting chronic/recurrent GI symptoms up to and 
including the 20 mg/d dose level, it is advised that dosing of study product be suspended for 4 weeks and resumed at a dose level of 3 mg/day for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1092851] dose 
given in the CRC under medical supervision. If tolerated, up-dosing may resume, with caution, according to the usual schedule, as tolerated , (Note  – The 4 -week suspension of dosing in 
response to chronic/recurrent GI symptoms occurring up to and including the 20 mg/d level is the only protocol- specified exception to the rules for missed OIT delineated in Section 6.8.) 
For subjects who develop dose- limiting chronic/recurrent GI symptoms at the 40  mg/d dose level 
or above, dose reduction and re- escalation is to proceed as described in Section 6.7.5. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_1092852] course of action, with possible actions being the following:  
• Extending the time interval between dosing (up to an additional 30 min ) without any 
additional treatment   
• Instituting  enhanced clinical monitoring. This could include (though is not limited to) 
more frequent vital sign  monitoring (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), auscultation, and/or the 
addition of pulse oximetry  
• Treating  with antihistamine  and then resuming dose escalation within [ADDRESS_1092853] 
dose, if assessed as safe  
• Treating additionally with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], beta-agonist, oxygen, IV fluids, and/or glucocorticosteroids,  as necessary,  and discontinuing dose- escalation 
• Discontinuation of desensitization protocol  
Mild  symptoms : For oral/pharyngeal pruritus  occurring in isolation, a specific type and 
commonly occurring mild allergic reaction , the recommended action is to advance to the next 
dose in 30 min (though the action taken is, as always, at the investigator ’s clinical discretion).  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 For other  mild symptoms , the action to be taken, at  the investigator’s  discretion , should be to 
either:  
• Advance  to next dose  in 30 to  60 min utes or 
• Treat  with antihistamine and then resume dose escalation within [ADDRESS_1092854]  to be  safe to continue dosing ( ie, having no or only minimal residual signs or 
symptoms)  
In general, if a  subject requires only [ADDRESS_1092855] requires a secon d medication ( eg, epi[INVESTIGATOR_73803]  a beta- agonist) to treat the 
symptoms , or more than [ADDRESS_1092856] is to receive no further OIT, even if the symptoms were  assessed to be mild.  Use of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_792658] -related symptoms, even in the unlikely event that the symptoms are 
graded as mild, will be cause to terminate the initial escalation.   
Moderate s ymptoms : For  moderate symptoms , if the symptoms are not worsening or amassing 
at a rapid pace, then a stepwise appro ach to treatment may be taken at the discretion of the 
investigator.  If the first action  undertaken is  to implement a n observation period, the observation 
period should not exceed  [ADDRESS_1092857] with antihistamines  or immediately with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] , as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093] . Other therap ies may be ad ded either sequentially or 
simultaneously, per investigator judgment.  
If moderate symptoms  occur at any of the doses below 6 mg ( ie, up to and including 3 mg), then 
the desensitization pro cedure  will be discontinued and the subject considered an escalatio n 
failure  and desensitization nonresponder . The decision to discontinue escalation is to be based 
solely on the determination of whether  the allergic reaction was of  moderate  severity.  Although 
it is generally the case that some form of  treatment will be  instituted for moderate symptoms, 
treatment is not a requirement for assessing an allergic reaction as being of moderate severity .  
Severe s ymptoms : For severe symptoms, t he action s taken should be to discontinue the initial 
escalation and administer the appropriate rescue medications.  The desensitization pro cedure  will 
be discontinued regardless of the dose at which the severe symptom or symptoms occurred, and 
the subject  will be  considered an escalation failure and desensitization nonresponder . 
A Medical  Monitor  (from INC or Aimmune)  is to  be available at all times to answer any 
questions or  to assist in any decisions  related to the study protocol.

6.7.5 Treatment for Reactions D uring the Up -dosing  Period : Dose Adjustment  
If a dose or dose level is assessed as not tolerated, the action taken will depend on the type and 
severity of the dose-related reaction and the investigator’s clinical judgement. The following possible actions are at the investigator’s disposal and are considered in greater detail in subsequent sections ( Section [IP_ADDRESS],  Section [IP_ADDRESS], and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], and  Figure 6 -2): 
• Dosing the subject under medical supervision in the CRC – this is encouraged whenever 
there is question as to the tolerability of a dose level.  It may be performed at the current 
dose level or at a reduced dose level, if there is already a high index of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_558254] .  
• Holding dose level at current level for  an additional 1 to 2 weeks before attempting dose 
escalation  – this may be done at the discretion of the investigator if there is concern that 
the current dose level has not been sufficiently well tolerated to attempt up -doing to the 
next dose level .  
• Reducing dose by [ADDRESS_1092858]  a 
2- to 4-week period before attempting dose re- escalation  – Generally, this should be the

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 action taken when a dose that has been observed in the CRC is assessed as not tolerated, 
if a dose elicits moderately severe symptoms, if a single dose of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558255] a dosing reaction, or if the investigator is convinced of the intolerability of the current dose level.  In short, it should be considered the default action 
whenever a dose or dose level is assessed as not tolerated.  
• Reducing dose level for less than the usual 2-week period – this may be instituted as 
treatment for a n intercurrent AE, to aid the investigator in determining if a dose level is 
or is not tolerated, or if a pattern of decreased study product tolerability during menses is discerned.  The level of the reduction in dose, ranging from a 1- step reduction to a 50% 
reduction will be at the investigator’s discretion, based on clinical judgement. The manner in which dose escalation may resume will depend on the level and the duration of the dose reduction. 
• Temporarily withholding study product dosing – this may be instituted as treatment for 
an intercurrent AE or to aid the investigator in determining if a dose level is or is not tolerated, but the duration of withholding study product may not exceed [ADDRESS_1092859] depends on the duration for which dosing was withheld .  
• Reducing dose by [ADDRESS_1092860] 
6 weeks – continuing dosing at a reduced dose level for at least  6 weeks prior to 
attempting re -escalation is mandatory if 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558256] a single 
AE. 
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_558257] – this is an option that 
the subject may elect at any time and for any reason.  The investigator must discontinue 
the subject from further dosing and continuation in the trial under circumstances that could jeopardize the health of the subject or the integrity of the trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reactions to In -Clinic D osing   
If symptoms arise in the clinic after up -dosing, the investigator is to determine whether or not the 
dose was tolerated ( Section  6.7.3). The process algorithm for continued dosing after dose- related  
symptoms occur  is described below and shown in  Figure [ADDRESS_1092861] experiences only oral/pharyngeal pruritus  following  the administration of the first 
dose at a new dose level , the dose will generally be assessed as tolerated , and the same dose can 
be repeated the next day at home and continued throughout the 2- week home -dosing interval, 
unless other symptoms begin to develop (see below).  
If other mild symptoms  occur with the first dose at a new dose level and the dose is assessed as 
not tolerated, the action taken should be to have the subject return to the CRC the next day for 
dosing at  the last tolerated dose  (ie, a 1-step dose reduction) under medical supervision (if the 
subject is unable to return to the CRC on the day specified, the investigator may initiate an 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092862] 
date possible). If the reduced dose is assessed as tolerated , the subject is to  continue on that daily 
home dose for the ensuing 2 weeks. ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for actions to be taken in the event that 
symptoms develop during home-dosing.) If the reduced dose is again assessed as not tolerated , 
the subject is to return to the CRC the next day for supervised dosing at a 1- or 2- step reduction 
in dose (per investigator judgment, based on severity of reaction). If this further reduced dose is assessed as tolerated , the subject will continue at that dose level for daily home-dosing over the 
ensuing [ADDRESS_1092863] dose at a new dose level  and the dose is assessed as 
tolerated , the action taken should be to repeat the same dose the next day. It is advised that the 
repeat (next day’s) dose be administered in the CRC, but it may be given at home, at the investigating physician’s discretion . If the second dose at the new (increased) dose level  is 
tolerated without symptoms, then the subject is to  continue on that dose level  for the requisite 
[ADDRESS_1092864] tolerated dose (at the investigator’s discretion) and continue dosing at home for the next 2 weeks at the investigator-determined dose level. ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]
 for actions to be taken in 
the event that symptoms develop during home-dosing.) If, following the first dose at a new dose level, the second dose at the new (increased) dose level  is again accompanied by [CONTACT_558304], 
but is assessed as not tolerated , the procedures outlined in the paragraph above should be 
followed. 
If moderate symptoms  occur with the first dose at a new dose level , except for rare instances, the 
dose will be assessed as not tolerated. T he action taken should be to have the subject return to 
the CRC the next day for dosing at  the last tolerated dose under medical supervision. If this 
reduced dose elicits no allergic symptoms, ie , is well  tolerated, the subject will continue on that 
daily home dose level  for an additional [ADDRESS_1092865] experiences mild symptoms at  the 
reduced  dose, the procedures for responding to a dose with mild symptoms should be followed 
(see above and  Figure  6-2. If the subject experiences moderate symptoms at the reduced dose 
level,  the subject should return to the CRC the next day and receive a further 1- or 2-step dose 
reduction (per investigator judgment). If this reduced dose is well tolerated, it will b e continued 
as the daily home dose for at least 2 weeks before re- escalation is attempted in the CRC. If the  
dose is not well tolerated,  but elicits mild symptoms, then the treatment procedures for 
responding to mild symptoms should be followed (see above,  and Figure [ADDRESS_1092866] in the 
study.  
In the rare instance that a dose eliciting moderate symptoms is assessed  as tolerated , then the 
actions taken should be the same as for a dose with mild symptoms  assessed  as tolerated  (see 
above). 
If severe symptoms occur, the action should be to treat the subject for the allergic reaction , and 
then, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, decide whether or not to dis continue the subject  
from the study. If it is determined that it is safe to allow the subject to continue in the study, the 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092867] tolerates the dose reduction  (ie, shows no or only mild symptoms that 
are assessed as tolerated) , then the subject  is to remain at the reduced  dose level  for at least 
[ADDRESS_1092868] is to be considered an escalation failure nonresponder. 
For spec ific questions related to dose -escalation or continuation of the same dose that are not 
answered in the above protocol, the Medical Monitor  will be available for consultation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] React ions to Dosing at Home 
With the occurrence of symptoms of an acute reaction to study product after home -dosing, or any 
acute allergic reaction, subjects/parents or guardians are instructed to call the study site. The 
investigator must then determine whether or not the dose was tolerated ( Section 6.7.3).  Because 
of the reduced reliability inherent in the second-hand reporting of symptoms, investigators are strongly encouraged to have subjects return to the clinic to undergo dosing under dir ect 
observation whenever acute allergic symptoms associated with dosing are reported.  
When  symptoms of a dose- related allergic reaction are reported  during the course of daily 
home -dosing, the investigator must assess the severity of the reaction and whether the dose 
associated with the reaction was tolerated . The appropriate intervention will depend on the type 
and severity of symptoms ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Figure 6 -2).  
In general, moderate or severe symptoms will be considered clinically significant , and any dose 
eliciting such symptoms assessed as not tolerated; however, mild symptoms may also be 
considered clinically significant, eg , if affecting  multiple organ systems, increasing in intensity, 
occurring with increasing frequency, or affecting a larger area over time , and assessed as not 
tolerated . Whenever there is question as to the clinical significance of mild signs or symptoms, 
the investigator should have the subject return to the CRC for observed dosing under medical 
supervision.  
For home- doses assessed as not tolerated  on the basis of acute dose-related symptoms, the same 
procedures described in Section 6.7.5, above, for adjusting up -dosing should be followed.  
The recurrence of mild symptoms over the course of several  days of home-dosing should suggest 
that the dose level is not tolerated, even if each individual occurrence of symptoms could be assessed  as tolerated  on the basis of the criteria listed above. I n this circumstance, i nvesti gator  
judgment will be required to determine the best course of action with the possible actions being 
the following:  
• Continue with daily home dosing at the current dose level  
• Continue the same daily dose for the rest of the 2- week interval , with  the dose split into 
2 fractional doses given 8 to 12 hours apart  (the 2 fractional doses need not be equal) 
• Return to the CRC for repeat dosing at the current dose level under direct observation to confirm whether or not the dose level is tolerated

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 • Return  to the CRC for dosing of a previously tolerated dose level , either a 1 - or 2- step 
reduction (per investigator ju dgment, based on severity of reaction) and follow the 
procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] above 
• Institute the 4 -week hiatus from dosing, with resumption of dosing at the 3 mg/d dose 
level, as permitted  for recurrent GI symptoms occurring at or before  the 20  mg, as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• Discontinuation of dosing 
Any subject who discontinues build-up dosing due to severe or repeated allergic reactions to 
study product should have his/her mechanistic blood draw and CBC ( Section  8) at, or as nearly 
as possible to , the time of  the last dose and no later than at their Early Discontinuation Visit.

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Adjustment in Response to Adverse E vents  
At the  investigating physician’s discretion, temporary dose reductions, ranging from a 1- step 
decrement ( ie, to the previous dose) to approximately half of the current dose level  (to the 
nearest feasible available whole dose), can be instituted  as part of the treatment regimen for an 
intercurrent AE. Also, if a pattern of decreased tolerability of study product during menses is 
discerned, then a temporary dose reduction can be instituted during this time. Temporary dose 
reductions for intercurrent AEs may be instituted as follows:  
• For dose reductions of ≤  4 consecutive days, whether dose re- escalation is to occur at 
home or in the CRC is at the investigator’s discretion.  If the reduction in dose is 
maintained for ≤  4 consecutive days, then the prereduction dose level may be resumed , 
with the biweekly es calation schedule kept unaltered.  
• If a reduction in dose is maintained for [ADDRESS_1092871] is to return to the CRC to undergo dosing under medical supervision. At the investigator’s discretion, the prereduction dose level may be resumed or dosing may continue at the reduced dose level. The biweekly escalation should be reset so that the subject receives at least 2 consecutive weeks of treatment at the dose level assigned (either the reduced or the prereduction dose level). 
• If a re duction in dose is maintained for [ADDRESS_1092872] may also be withheld at the investigator’s discretion, in response to an intercurrent AE. Doses withheld as part of the treatment for an AE constitute a special category 
of missed peanut OIT doses ( Section  6.8).  
6.7.6 Treatment for Reactions D uring the Up- dosing Period: Pharmacological and 
Supportive Treatments  
Treatment of acute reactions should be with either an antihistamine and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], along with IV fluids,  a beta -agonist ( eg, albuterol, by [CONTACT_107606]), oxygen, and/or 
glucocortico steroids , as in dicated.   
Many mild acute allergic reactions can be transient and self -limiting, requiring no therapeutic 
intervention. Others, however, may require treatment.  Generally, for mild symptoms requiring 
treatment, the subject should receive antihistamines .  
Acute allergic reactions manifesting with moderate symptoms will generally require therapeutic intervention, although some, even moderate, symptoms may  on rare occasion  be so transient as 
to require no specific treatment.  Generally, for mo derate symptoms  requiring treatment, the 
subjects should receive antihistamines  and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], as indicated . If there is uncertainty as 
to the severity of the reaction, administering epi[INVESTIGATOR_266758].  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 Generally, severe symptoms will require treatment with epi[INVESTIGATOR_539957] a minimum.  If severe 
symptoms that quali fy as stage 3 anaphylaxis (defined in Appendix 3 ) occur at any time, dosing 
with study product will stop and the subject will be dis continued from the  study as an escalation 
failure nonresponder.  
Antihistamines  
If a subject receives antihistamines only, the dose escalation can be continued.  If symptoms 
during a build-up day require administration of more than 2 doses of an antihistamine  or of an 
antihistamine in combination with other medications (except epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), there should be a dose 
reduction of 1 or 2 dose levels, with the next dose given in the CRC. If epi[INVESTIGATOR_393225], then a different course of action is to be taken (see below).  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] - General  
Any reaction  to study product (in clinic or at home) that requires more than two doses of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_792660]. The subject will be 
asked to return to the CRC [ADDRESS_1092873] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (Section  6.5). 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] - Clinic  
If a single administration o f epi[INVESTIGATOR_266761], or after , a dose -escalation in the 
clinic, no further dosing of study product is to occur at that visit. The next dose of study product is to be reduced by [CONTACT_792701], but biweekly dose escalation 
should continue. 
If a single administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393228] a second consecutive time during, or after,  
[ADDRESS_1092874] to 
undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section  6.5). 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] - Home  
If a single administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_558263], this epi[INVESTIGATOR_792661] [ADDRESS_1092875] receiving the 300 mg/d dose of study product for 
approximately [ADDRESS_1092876] dosing guidelines and procedures  will be followed as for the Up -dosing Period. 
6.8 Missed Peanut OIT (Study Product) Doses during Up- dosing : 
Missed doses of study product at any phase of the study can pose a significant risk to t he enrolled 
subjects, but the risk is believed to be highest during the Up-dosing Period. The algorithm for missed consecutive doses of study product is as follows:  
• Miss 1 dose – The next dose would be at the current dose level  and could be given at 
home  
• Miss 2 doses in a row – The next dose would be the current dose level  and could be given 
at home 
• Miss 3 doses in a row – The next dose would be the current dose and would be given under supervision in the CRC  
• Miss 4 doses in a row – The next dose would be the current dose and would be given under supervision in the CRC 
• Miss 5 -7 doses in a row – I nitiate the next dose at approximately 50% of the last tolerated 
dose (to the nearest feasible available whole dose that is ≤50% of the last tolerated dose ). 
This d ose is to be administered  under supervision in the CRC. If tolerated, d ose 
escalation may resume with dose increases of [ADDRESS_1092877] has 
returned  to the dose level at which the lapse in dosing occurred. If symptoms occur, the 
dosing guidelines for the up- dosing period apply. 
• Missing > [ADDRESS_1092878] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (Section  6.5). 
• Additionally,  excessive missed dosing, defined as [ADDRESS_1092879] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section  6.5). 
• If study product has been withheld for [ADDRESS_1092880] dispensing error, dosing may be reinitiated at approximately 25% of the last tolerated dose (to the nearest feasible available whole dose that is ≤  25% of the 
last tolerated dose ) if the lapse in dosing occurred during the Up-dosing Period. If the 
lapse in dosing occurred during the Maintenance Period, dosing may, at the investigator’s discretion , be reinitiated at 50% o f the last tolerated dose (to the nearest feasible available 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 whole dose that is ≤  50% of the last tolerated dose). The reduced dose is to be 
administered  under supervision in the CRC. If tolerated, d ose escalation may resume with 
dose increases of [ADDRESS_1092881] has returned to the dose level at which the 
lapse in dosing occurred. If symptoms occur, the dosing guidelines for the U p-dos ing 
period apply. 
• If study product has been withheld for ≥  15 consecutive days for any reason, at any point 
in the study (with the exception of a dosing hiatus instituted for chronic/recurrent GI AEs at or before the 20 mg dose level, as per  Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , the subject will be considered 
an escalation failure nonresponder , and will be asked to return to the CRC [ADDRESS_1092882] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Vi sit 
(Section  6.5). 
No attempt should be made to make up for a missed dose if greater than [ADDRESS_1092883] is off antihistamines for an 
appropriate length of time (5 half- lives of the antihistamine that is being used), a skin test probe 
is pressed th rough a commercial peanut allergen  extract  into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. Positive (histamine) 
and negative (saline- glycerin ) controls are placed to establish that the response is not blocked 
and to determine if there is dermatographism, respectively.   
6.[ADDRESS_1092884] subjects will, however, become de facto unblinded to 
their on-study treatment assignment on the basis of their experience with the food challenge; ie, 
subjects who fail 1 part of the Exit DBPCFC early on may reasonably deduce that they had been in the placebo arm of the study, and those who tolerate both parts of the Exit DBPCFC (or fail 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092885] dose levels tested) may reasonably deduce that they had been in the 
AR101 arm. Hence, t he study is double -blinded on an individual subject basis only up to 
completion of the Exit DBPCFC . It is for this reason that assessment of reactions to DBPCFC 
will be made by a Blinded Evaluating Physician (Blinded Assessor).  
Although the unblinding of subjects after completion of the Exit DBPCFC cannot influence the manner in which they are assessed or treated by [CONTACT_686593] (as their participation in ARC003 will have concluded at that time), knowledge of subjects’ treatment assignments could potent ially influence the investigational site personnel’s conduct toward other 
subjects who have not yet reached the conclusion of the study . The risk of bias being introduced 
into the determination of DLSs during DBPCFCs due to knowledge of the treatment assignments of other subjects will be substantially reduced  by [CONTACT_792702] a Blinded Evaluating Physician (Blinded Assessor) who is not otherwise directly  
involved with the treatment of the subjects he or she is evaluating. Additionally, the duration of the study and the anticipated rate of recruitment are such that that enro llment should not be 
influenced by [CONTACT_941] E xit DBPCFC, as enrol lment should be completed before the first  subjects  
exits  the study. 
Additionally, to ensure that allocation of subjects to their appropriate analysis populations is not biased by [CONTACT_792703], specific masking procedures have been put in place to shield study team members who could be involved i n determining allocation of the 
subjects to the analysis populations from knowing subject treatment assignments (refer to Masking Plan). To further ensure that allocation of subjects to their appropriate analysis populations is performed in an unbiased way, subjects will not be informed of their on- study 
treatment assignments or rollover into the open- label follow -on study, ARC004, until all major 
data queries, ie  queries that could influence allocation to [ADDRESS_1092886] 
been resolve d (as detailed in the Masking Plan) , regulatory and IRB/EC approval for ARC004 
have been received, and IP for ARC004 is available .  
Those subjects who are not eligible for the  DBPCFC at Week 68 of their projected up- dosing 
schedule, may  be unblinded at thi s time  (their projected study Week 68) or when the last subject 
completes the Exit DBPCFC , provided all major data queries for the subject have been resolved . 
6.12.[ADDRESS_1092887] s. During site  visits, the site monitor will check the clinic  and/or pharmacy logs 
to ensure that appropriate randomization assignments are received, recorded, and maintained.  
6.12.[ADDRESS_1092888].  The decision to unblind should, if at all 
possible, be made in collaboration with the sponsor’s Medical Monitor. If a life -threatening 
event occurs , the subject should be treated as if the subject received active study product . For all 
unscheduled non- life-threatening events that require unblinding, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_792704] l monitor who will coordinate with the sponsor’s representatives . 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 6.12.3 Breaking the Blind  
Site personnel or other study team members (such as a Medical Monitor) may request emergency 
unblinding as described above . If it is specifically necessary to provide a treatment assignment to 
the Sponsor, this information will be provided to a Medical Monitor and/or Clinical Operations Designee. 
In case emergency unblinding is necessary, the interactive response system  allows study 
personne l with appropriate permissions to request unblinding for a specific subject. An 
automated notification  is then sent to the sponsor and the sponsor’s safety designees to inform  
them of the unblinding. A built-in audit trail documents the unblinding process and the persons 
involved. 
6.12.4 Documenting and Unblinding  
Any premature unblinding requires a full written account by [CONTACT_792705](s) that necessitated unblinding of the study medication for an individual participant. This 
account incl udes the reason(s) for unblinding, the name [CONTACT_8152]’s medical monitor who 
was notified of the unblinding, the names of the unblinded individual staff members  and the date 
and time the unblinding occurred. The treatment assignment is confidential and  should not be 
provided to blinded team members, as detailed in the Masking Plan. 
7 SAFETY MONITORING  
This section defines the types of adverse events that should be reported and outlines the 
procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. 
7.1 Definitions  for Recording of Safety Events 
All safety events observed under this protocol are reported through the electronic data capture 
system for the duration of the study. Some safety events arising under certain defined conditions are recorded on specific forms as follows.   
• Any allergic symptoms observed during in -clinic dosing will be recorded directly on the 
Escalation  / In-Clinic  Dosing form (also referred to as a Study Product Administration 
form) , and are not recorded on an adverse event form (to avoid duplicate reporting) 
unless the event is considered a serious adverse event . These symptoms are,  however, by 
[CONTACT_108], adverse events ( Section 7.2)  and will be reported as such in the database.  
• Safety events related to accidental food exposure are recorded on an Accidental Food Exposure form . They are not to be reported on an adverse event form (to avoid duplicate 
reporting) u nless the event is considered a serious adverse event, as defined belo w 
(Section  7.3 and Section 7.4.2).  
• For any event occurring after a subject has signed the informed consent form that meets 
the definition of anaphylaxis, an Anaphylaxis Epi[INVESTIGATOR_792662]’s Reporting C enter within 24  hours of its  occurrence and/or the 
site’s being notified of the event ( Section 7.7.2) , if the event is associated with any of the 
following: 
o An emergency room visit; 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
o More than 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266776];  
o Assessment of the anaphylaxis as severe, as defined in Appendix 3.  
• If any safety event meets the definition of a serious adverse event  (whether or not related 
to dosing), it will also be recorded on an adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE) 
form.   
• Skin prick test reactions are not considered adverse events unless the reaction, or a 
complication from the procedure, is considered a serious adverse event, as defined below  
(Section 7.4.2).  
• Food challenge reactions that occur in the clinic are captured  on study specific forms and 
are not reported on an adverse event form (to avoid duplicate reporting) unless the event is considered a serious adverse event, as defined below  (Section  7.4.2).  
o As study product is not used in the DBPCFCs, no AEs occurring from Screening DBPCFC can be treatment -related (referring to treatment with study product).   
o For food challenge reactions that occur at the Exit DBPCFC, it will also usually be the case that study product was not the cause of the reaction, as study product is not used in the challenge.  There is, however the possibility that dosing with study product 
in the days prior to Exit DBPCFC could contribute  to a reaction encountered during 
the challenge.  The investigator must determine if dosing with study product in the 
days prior to Exit DBPCFC likely contributed to any observed reaction. If so, the investigator should indicate the level of the relatedness , and provide a brief 
explanation as to the manner in which prior dosing with study product was thought to be contributory. 
• All serious adverse events are reported on the AE/SAE form set in addition to the Skin Prick  form or an Oral Food Challenge form if the event occurred during 1 of these 
procedures. All other safety events that occur throughout the study are reported on the 
AE/SAE form set.  
7.[ADDRESS_1092889] will need to be recorded 
(Section  7.7.1).   
It is common for allergic reactions, especially allergic reactions to food allergens, to manifest with multiple symptoms.  Investigator sites will record each individual symptom as an AE an d 
indicate the symptom is part of an allergic reaction by [CONTACT_174542] “allergic reaction” box on the AE form.  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092890] may be asked  to return to the site.  These events will be reported as follows: 
• Accidental Food Exposure form  will be completed  for each of these events in addition to 
events where consumption of peanut without a reaction occurs.  
• If the accidental food ingestio n safety event meets the definition of a serious adverse 
event, as defined below ( Section 7.4.2) , the AE/SAE form  will be completed  as well.   
7.4 Definitions  
7.4.1 Adverse Event (AE) or Medical Event  
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not considered 
drug related which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change in clinical status, ECGs, routine labs, x- rays, physical examinations, etc., that is considered clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_65227].  
Suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that the 
drug caused the event. 
Adverse reaction is any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
7.4.2 Serious Events (Serious Adverse Events, Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions or 
Serious Adverse Reactions)  
A serious adverse event including a serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction as determined by [CONTACT_792706]: 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening AE (Life -threatening means that the study subject  was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_266764], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect 
6. Important medical event that may not result in [ADDRESS_1092891] likely cause of SAEs in this study will be anaphylaxis; however, 
not all occurrences of anaphylaxis are necessarily SAEs.  Guidance for determining when 
anaphylaxis should be reported as an SAE is provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_1092892]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylaxis 
The definition of anaphylaxis that has been ad opted for this study is from  the 2014 position paper 
by [CONTACT_474820] ( EAACI ) Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Guidelines Group (Muraro  et al ., 2007) , that in turn was based on the publications 
of Simons et al. (2011) and Johansson et al. (2004), and is consistent with the recently published “International consensus on (ICON) anaphylaxis” ( Simons et al ., 2014).  Accordingly, 
anaphylaxis is defined as a severe, potentially  life-threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction, 
characterized by [CONTACT_589637]-threatening airway, breathing, or circulatory problems that is usually, though not always, associated with skin and mucosal changes. 
With respect to the i nclusion of being “potentially life- threatening” in the definition of 
anaphylaxis and how that relates to  the assessment of anaphylaxis as an SAE, reference is made 
to the 2012 FDA Guidance for Industry and Investigators, “Safety Reporting Requirements for 
INDs and BA/BE Studies,” that states, “An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence 
places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.” Thus, for the reporting of anaphylaxis as an SAE, the severity of the reaction, assessed according to the EAACI system for gra ding the severity of anaphylactic reactions ( Muraro et al ., 2007), is 
also to be taken into account ( Section  7.6 and Appendix 5).  
When the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is made, the basis for having suspected the diagnosis must be documented, using the criteria established by [CONTACT_792707] ( Sampson et al ., 2006) (Appendix 3).  These criteria were again 
affirmed in the recently published “International consensus on (ICON) anaphylaxis” ( Simons et 
al., 2014).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Adverse E vents  Resulting in Prolonged Disruption of D osing  
Gastrointestinal AEs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_155650]/recurrent GI AEs, that result in a prolonged disruption of 
dosing will be considered AEs of special interest and will be assessed longitudinally according to the procedures described below. For the purpose of delineating these AEs o f special interest, 
prolonged disruption of dosing is defined as withholding study product for > 7 days. This will include 3 categories of subjects:  
• Any subject whose dose is withheld for > 7 days due to GI AEs and resumes dosing at a reduced dose level ( Section  6.7) 
• Any subject who develops chronic/recurrent GI AEs at or before reaching the 20 mg dose level and resumes dosing after a 30-day dosing hiatus ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]);  
• Any subject who permanently discontinues dosing who had experienced GI AEs (Section  4.3.2).  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 84 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 Subjects under the age of 18 years who fall into any of these 3 categories will be asked to fill out 
the PEESSTM v2.0 questionnaire ( Franciosi et al ., 2011), with the assistance of a paren t or 
guardian, as appropriate, every month for 6 months; adults will be given the same questionnaire. It should, however, be noted that the PEESS
TM v2.[ADDRESS_1092893] validity ( Franciosi et al ., 
2011; Martin et al., 2015) and so holds promise for being a valuable tool to follow the clinical course of EoE or an EoE- like immune -mediated GI syndrome. Thus, the PEESS
TM v2.0, could 
reveal trends toward symptomatic improvement or worsening that might otherwise go undetected.  
Subjects who discontinue dosing prematurely due to chronic/recurrent GI AEs are to be 
requested to return to the clinic for evaluation monthly for at least 6 months (if the subject is asymptomatic, telephone follow-up with a physician investigator may substitute for in- clinic 
visit, at the investigator’s discretion) . If chronic/recurrent GI AEs persist beyond [ADDRESS_1092894] with chronic/recurrent GI AEs has not experie nced complete resolution of symptoms 
within [ADDRESS_1092895] should be referred to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist.  
If a subject who discontinued dosing with the investigational product pre maturely  due to 
chronic/recurrent GI AEs is unable to discontinue the use of symptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_792663] (eg , H1 or H2 histamine blockers or proton pump 
inhibitors) by [ADDRESS_1092896] should be 
referred to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist.  
As is the case for any AE occurring during the study, so it is for chronic/recurrent GI AEs that 
the investigator may, at any time , and at his or her discretion, request consul tation from an 
outside physician or additional testing to assist in the diagnosis or management of the AE. 
If a subject is seen  by a gastroenterologist, the investigational site is to procure records of the 
visit, as well as any test results, including those from endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy, if performed. These are to be retained with the subject ’s source documentation.

PALISADE   31 July 2017 7.4.4 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity) or severity is not consistent with 
applicable product information, such as safety information provided in the package insert, the investigational plan, the investigator’s brochure or the protocol.  
7.5 Adverse Event Monitoring  
7.5.1 Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
Although the safety of peanut OIT overall  is well established, a Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (D SMC) will monitor the study for safety. The D SMC will meet periodically to 
review accruing safety data. The committee will consist of i ndividuals with extensive 
multi- center clinical study experience drawn from the fields of clinical immunology (specifically 
food allergies) and biostatistics. These individuals will be entirely independent of the conduct of 
the study. Further details will be provided in the DSMC  Charter . 
7.5.2 Adjudication Committee  
The Adjudication Committee (AC) will review reports of specific SAEs and AEs of special interest to verify appropriate diagnosis as per protocol definitions (eg , anaphylaxis) and 
appropriate determination of event seriousness, severity, and causality. The AC will provide a complete assessment of the selected cases to help independently validate these reports.  
Adjudication Committee assessments will be reported in addition to the investigator’s assessments.  
7.6 Severity  Grading  
The investigator is to assign  severity  grades to adverse events (AEs).  Depending on the type of 
AE, different severit y grading systems will be used  in this study.  
• The severity grading of allergic reactions will be according to the definitions developed 
the CoFAR group ( Appendix 4) .  
• The severity of anaphylactic reactions will be graded according to the EAACI system for grading the severity of anaphylactic reactions ( Appendix 3).   
• For grading the severity of all other AEs, the National Cancer Institute’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (NCI-CTCAE ) system will be used . The 
purpose of using the NCI-CTCAE system is to provide standard language to describe AEs (“toxicities”) and to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data and for assessment 
of the clinical significance of treatment- related toxicities.  The NCI -CTCAE provi des a 
term and a grade that closely describes the adverse event.  Each participating site will 
receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_266771]. For additional information and a printable version of the NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03 manual, consult the NCI-C TCAE 
website, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.   
For adverse events not inclu ded in the NCI-CTCAE listing, they are also to be grade d on a scale 
from  1 to 5, according to the General Grade Definition provided below:  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 86 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 Grade 1  Mild  Transient or mild  discomforts (< 48 hours ), no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374868] (non -prescription or single -use prescription therapy 
may be employed to relieve symptoms, eg, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_9840], acetaminophen for post -surgical pain).  
Grade 2  Moderate Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
Grade 3  Severe  Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually 
required; medical intervention/therapy required,

7.6.[ADDRESS_1092898] : Is there a reasonable possibility that the study product  caused the event? 
An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction.  
7.7 Adverse Event Collection Procedures  
Any new event or experience that was not present at S creening, or worsening of an event present 
at Screening, is considered to be an AE. Unchanged, chronic conditions are not AE’s and should 
not be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. Adverse events will be evaluated from the onset of 
the event until the time the event is resolved or medically stable, or until [ADDRESS_1092899].  Adverse events ongoing at the time that study 
treatment is discontinued may not be determined to be medically stable until 30 days  after the 
Exit or Early Discontinuation Visit has been conducted, in which case additiona l visits after the 
Exit or Early Discontinuation Visit will be required. Investigators should also report AEs discovered after cessation of dosing and prior to the Early Discontinuation. 
AEs may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the subject  
• Questioning the subject , which should be done in an objective manner  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject  
• Review of medical records/source documents 
• Review of home dosing symptom logs (provided to record symptoms between visits )

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 7.7.1 Recordi ng and Reporting Procedures  
A multi- screen  adverse event eCRF  will be used allowing all adverse events to be submitted 
through a single reporting mechanism. Serious adverse events will require additional information 
reported on additional screens  within th e electronic data capture ( EDC)  system.  Source 
documents , with subject identifiers redacted,  can be scanned and attached to the adverse event 
form as well.  The investigator will treat subject s experiencing adverse events appropriately and 
observe them at suitable intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes.  
7.7.2 SAE Recording and Reporting Procedures  
Serious adverse events will be recorded on the adverse event case report form (CRF).  All centers 
are obl igated to report SAEs within 24 hours  of their occurrence and/or the site ’s knowledge of 
the event to the  Reporting Center . The following attributes will be assigned:  
• Description  
• Date of onset and resolution (if known when reported)  
• Severity  
• Assessment of relatedness to test article  
• Action taken  
The site investigator will apply his/her clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event is of sufficient severity to require that the subject be removed from treatment.  If necessary, an 
investigator will suspend any trial procedures and inst itute the necessary medical therapy to 
protect a subject from any immediate danger.  
Subsequent review by [CONTACT_792708](ies), the D SMC, IRB/EC , or the sponsor(s) 
may suspend further trial treatment or procedures at a site.  The study sponsor(s)  and the  
regulatory health authorities  retain the authority to suspend additional enrollment and treatments 
for the entire study as applicable.  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he/she perceives as an intolerable AE, or for any other reason. If voluntary withdrawal is requested, the subject should 
be asked to continue (at least limited) scheduled evaluations, complete a study termination form, 
and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until the symptoms of any AE re solve 
or their condition becomes stable.

Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 7.8.2 Expedi ted SAEs Reporting to Regulatory  Health Authorities and DSMC   
The sponsor’s Medical Monitor will review each SAE report and will determine whether the 
SAE must be reporte d to regulatory health authorities on an expedited basis.  The final decision 
for disposition regarding expedited reporting to the regulatory health  authorities rests with the 
sponsor’s Medical Monitor. The Study  Sponsor and Clinical Research Organization (CRO) will 
provide the  DSMC and the Reporting  Center  with copi[INVESTIGATOR_792665]. 
The Reporting Center will provide these expedited reports to the individual site investigators . 
Events that are serious, related to therapy , and unexpected will be reported to regulatory health 
author ities within 15 days or for deaths and life-threatening events within 7 days ( as per 
applicable regulatory reporting requirements ). 
7.8.3 Notifying the Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Reporting Center will provide the DSMC with listings of all SAEs on an ongoing basis. 
Furthermore, the DS MC will be informed of expedited reports of SAEs. Periodic r eports from  
the DS MC as to the overall  safety of the ongoing study, and recommendations regarding 
continuation will be sent to th e investigators for forwarding to their IRBs/ECs if requested . 
Investigational sites are instructed to report epi[INVESTIGATOR_266775] 24 hours of their occurrence and/or the sites being notified of the event to the Reporting Center  for forwarding to 
the DMSC if the event is associated with any of the following: 
• An emergency room visit; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• More than 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266776];  
• Assessment of the anaphylaxis as severe, as defined in  Appendix [ADDRESS_1092901] and Ethics Committee  
The investigator will ensure the timely dissemination of all AE information, including expedited reports and DS MC safety reviews, to the IRB in accordance with applicable local regulations and 
guidelines. 
7.9 Other Safety Assessments and Precautions  
7.9.1 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations will be conducted at visits indicated in Appendix 1  Schedule of Events. 
Height and weight will also be recorded at specified visits . Vital signs will be measured , 
including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), and body temperature. Except whe re a full, age 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092902] ing and Co ntraception  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Test ing  
All female subjects of child -bearing age will undergo a serum pregnancy test at screening and 
then urine pregnancy test at subsequent visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception  
Subjects undergoing OIT are at increased risk for experiencing allergic reactions and may be at 
increased risk for experiencing anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure; and if this were to occur during pregnancy, it could result in compromised placental perfusion and significant risk to the fet us. 
Pregnancy is a time when the mother’s immune system undergoes complex and incompletely understood changes that are believed to reduce the risk of a maternal immune reaction directed against the fetus.  It is also a time when the fetus’s immune system is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. OIT, at its core, 
entails repeated stimulation of the immune system to affect changes in its makeup and function. What effects OIT -induced changes in the immune system might have on the course of pregnancy 
or fetal development are currently un known. Accordingly, female subjects of child -bearing 
potential  are required to practice effective birth control for the duration of the current study.  
Female subjects are to use either:   
• A highly effe ctive method of birth control, defined as 1 that results in a low failure  rate 
(ie, less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, 
injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstin ence, or a vasectomized p artner; or  
• Alternatively, if a highly effective method of birth control is not used, a n effective,  
double barrier method of contraception ( eg, male condom with female condom, cervical 
cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge)  may be used . 
7.[ADDRESS_1092903] discontinuation of the 
study in their jurisdictions .  
The DSMC will also be continually reviewing safety data, and can also recommend, in its 
judgment, halting the study for any substantial imbalance in adverse events, apart from anticipated allergic dosing symptoms.  
Aimmune Therapeutics additionally reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for 
any reason. The regulatory health authority(ies) and IRBs/ECs will be notified in the event of 
study discontinuation. 
7.10.[ADDRESS_1092904] halt up-dosing and re-start with a reduced dose if more than 3 days of dosing are missed. Seven or more consecutive days of missed dosing due to non-
compliance constitutes an individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], as does a significant number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393237] ( ie, [ADDRESS_1092905] 3 occasions)  during the Up-dosing 
Period . Missing [ADDRESS_1092906] being 
discontinued from the study as an escalation failure nonresponder:  
• Failure to accomplish up-dosing of study product after 3 attempts  
• Failure to identify a tolerated dose of study product after 3 attempts at dose reduction   
• Administration of 3 or more doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_792666]- related 
allergic reaction . 
8 MECHANISTIC ASSAYS  
Assays will be performed to measure humoral (immunoglobulin; antibody) immune responses at 
Screening/Baseline, at the end of the Up-dosing Period, and at the Exit or Early Discontinuation 
visit. The blood samples for these serum -based assays can and should be collected with the same 
blood draw as the CBC. This is mandatory blood draw is to be performed at Screening, the End of Up -dosing / Start of Maintenance Period Visit, and the Exit Visit.  
Additionally, subjects will be asked to participate in an optional substudy to characterize cellular immune responses in allergy. The c haracterization of immune cells, including lymphocytes and 
basophils, based on their surface markers and responses to in vitro stimulation, performed by [CONTACT_792710] (ITN) and consequently will require an additional consent/assent 
form to be signed.  
8.1 Peanut -Specific A ntibody (Immunoglobulin) Assays  
Antigen immunotherapy has been shown to induce antigen- specific humoral responses.  The 
balance of isotypic response may  play a role in allergen sensitivity ( eg, an increase of IgG / IgE).  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 92 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 The blood sample for antibody analysis should be collected with the same blood draw as the 
CBC. Collection of a sample for antibody analysis, like the CBC, is mandatory. 
At each of the s pecified  points, a sample of serum  will be stored for assessment of peanut 
specific antibody levels (immunoglobulin assays) . Total IgE and specific IgE and IgG4 will be 
measured using UniCAPTM. Peanut specific IgE and IgG4 ( included in the immunoglobulin 
assays) will be measured at S creening/Baseline, the end of the Up-dosing Period, and the 
Exit/Early Discontinuation visit. Additionally, as part of the Screening/Baseline immunoglobulin 
assays, component-resolved (Ara h1, Ara h 2, Ara  h3, Ara h 8, and Ara h 9) peanut IgE testing will 
be performed. The amount of blood to be drawn will be  determined on the basis of the 
requirements of the test and  individual laboratory protocols, in compliance with local 
regulations.  
8.2 Optional Immune Cell Characterization  
This ex ploratory characterization of the mechanism of action of OIT at the cellular level will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_80910] (ITN). Immune cells, including lymphocytes, 
monocytes, and potentially basophils, and eosinophils, will be analyzed for the ir cell surface 
markers by [CONTACT_4133] . Additionally, in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes and potentially 
basophils, or other immune cell types will be performed.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_1092907] an a dditional volume of blood collected at the same 
time as the immunoglobulin assay blood draws ( Section  8.1; full procedures will be provided in 
the manual of procedures). Participation in the sub study to characterize immune cell responses 
does not require an additional venipuncture. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1092908]-DBPCFC blood draw. Participation 
would require 2 additional venipunctures, 1 after the  Screening DBPCFC and 1 after the Exit 
DBPCFC (the blood draw after the Exit DBPCFC will be included in the ARC004 protocol). The 
same types of in vitro assays will be performed on these samples as will be performed in the immune cell characterization sub study, but on cells collected after a controlled allergic 
challenge. Because participation requires 2 additional blood draws, separate informed consent is required.  
8.3 Optional Oral Biomarke r Substudy  
Subjects will also be given the option to participate in a companion substudy to examine the 
relationship between food allergy and other gastrointestinal disorders. The study, coordinated by 
[CONTACT_7060]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349], will involve the collection of saliva to measure gene expression products (including ribonucleic acids) that may reflect susceptibility to eosinophilic esophagitis or other potentially IgE- related GI diseases. This 
substudy w ill require subjects/parents to undergo a separate informed consent (and assent, as age 
appropriate) process.

PALISADE   31 July 2017 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
This section outlines the major statistical consideration for the ARC003 study, a randomized 
evaluation of peanut  OIT versus placebo therapy  and baseline  for individuals with peanut  
allergy . A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized  prior to the first subject 
undergoing Exit DBPCFC .  
Data will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_792711] . The descriptive summary 
for the categorical variables will include co unts and percentages . The descriptive summary for 
the continuous variables will  include means, medians, standard deviations and minimum and 
maximum values.  
All data will be listed for all subjects.  
9.1 Analysis Populations  
The ITT population ( ie, the Full Analysis Set)  will consist of all randomized subjects who 
received at least [ADDRESS_1092909] the peanut part of the food challenge . Sensitivity analyses and supportive 
analyses of the primary endpoint, and key secondary endpoints, and other secondary endpoints will be performed using the Completer  population. These supportive analyses are considered 
important because th ey will provide the basis for informing patients and their families of their 
chances of achieving a clinically relevant level of desensitization if Up -dosing and maintenance 
therapy are achieved.  
The Per Protocol ( PP) population will be a subset of the Com pleter population, limited to 
subjects who have no major protocol deviations that may influence the desensitization response . 
Additional criteria to exclude subjects from the PP population may be added. Any changes will 
be documented in a SAP amendment or other supporting document.  Exclusions will be 
determined by [CONTACT_792712]. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The Safety population will consist of all subjects who recei ve randomized study treatment. The 
Safety population will be used for summaries of safety parameters . Subjects will be analyzed 
according to treatment received.  
The modified ITT ( mITT ) population will consist of all randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of randomized study treatment and who have sufficient data to assess treatment 
success or failure for the primary efficacy endpoint. Subjects who withdraw early for reasons unrelated to treatment success or failure will be excluded as there are  no dat a to suggest they are 
a treatment success or failure. Withdrawals for escalation failure, treatment -related AEs, and 
deaths will not be excluded and these will be counted as treatment failures. Exclusions will be determined by [CONTACT_792713] t o database lock and overall study unblinding. Subjects will 
be analyzed according to randomized treatment. The mITT population may  be used for 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE   31 July 2017 sensitivity analyses of the pr imary and key secondary endpoints if the mITT population differs 
from ITT population by > 5% in either treatment arm. Sensitivity analyses of selected endpoints 
may, however, be performed if the mITT population differs from the ITT population by ≤  5% in 
both treatment arms.   
The decision to conduct analyses in the mITT population and other subsets of the ITT population 
will be made before database lock and overall study unblinding. 
9.2 Study Endpoint Assessment  
9.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
North America : The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects aged  [ADDRESS_1092910] 600 mg 
(1043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms at the Exit DBPCFC  
(ie, responders) . 
The primary efficacy analysis will test for a treatment difference in the response ra te in the ITT 
population. A ll individuals failing to achieve the success definition described above will be 
considered treatment failures , as will subjects who fail to achieve and maintain a [ADDRESS_1092911] (escalation failure nonresponders). All individuals who drop out of the 
study or discontinue OIT prior to undergoing the Exit DBPCFC will be considered treatment 
failures  (ie Missing = Failure) . The Farrington -Manning test will be used to test that the 
difference in response rates (AR101 minus Placebo) is not equal to 0.[ADDRESS_1092912]- based 95% confidence interval is greater than the pre- specified margin o f 
0.15. 
Europe : The  primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects age d [ADDRESS_1092913] 1000 mg (2043 mg 
cumulative) of peanut protein with no more than mild symptoms a t the Exit DBPCFC 
(ie, responders) . 
The primary efficacy analysis will test for a treatment difference in the response rate in the ITT population. All individuals failing to achieve the success definition described above will be considered treatment failur es, as will subjects who fail to achieve or maintain a [ADDRESS_1092914] (escalation failure or nonresponders , respectively ). All individuals who 
drop out of the study or discontinue OIT prior to undergoing the Exit DBPCFC will be 
considered treatment failures  (ie Missing = Failure) . The Farrington-Manning test will be used to 
test that the difference in response rates (AR101 minus Placebo) is not equal to [ADDRESS_1092915]- based 95% confidence interval is greater than 0.  
9.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are defined in Section  3.7, and a full description of the analyses 
planned for each will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). A brief description of the planned analyses for the key secondary endpoints and other selected secondary  endpoints is 
provided below.

PALISADE   31 July 2017 [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Other Selected Secondary Endpoints  
• Maximum dose achieved with no or mild symptoms at Exit DBPCFC: The probability 
estimates for tolerating each challenge dose or higher  of the Exit DBPCFC will be 
calculated based on the discrete hazards model in the ITT population  with terms for 
treatment group effect , region (North A merica and Europe) and the MTD  at the 
Screening DBPCFC (baseline) in the log 10 scale (Chinchilli et al., 2005).  The extreme 
value hazard function will be used for the model. The probability estimates will be tabulated by [CONTACT_792715]. The values for MTD for subjects who do not undergo the Exit DBPCFC will be imputed using the maximum doses of peanut protein tolerated in their Screening DBPCFC. The treatment effect hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval  (95% CI) and p -value will be based on the 
Wald statistic.   
• Change from baseline in maximum tolerated dose  (MTD)  of peanut protein at DBPCFC : 
Analyses of change from baseline MTD will be performed using change calculated on the log
10 scale. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model of change from baseline MTD 
at Exit DBPCFC (log 10 mg) will be fit with terms for treatment group , region, and the 
MTD at baseline (log 10 mg). The values for MTD for subjects who do not undergo the 
Exit DBPCF C will be imputed using the maximum doses of peanut protein tolerated in 
their Screening DBPCFC . The baseline adjusted least squares means with 95% CIs  by 
[CONTACT_792716]. The p- value is 
based on the F- test for treatment group effect adjusted for the MTD  at baseline (log 10 
mg). Residuals for ANCOVA will be assessed for non -normality using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk 
test. If significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_1092924]. 
The statistical methods used for testing the remaining secondary endpoints are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SA P). 
9.2.3 Supportive Analyses of Primary and Secondary Endpoints

The sample size of 495 subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 years, randomized at a ratio of 3:1, 
provides sufficient power to detect a treatment effect for the primary efficacy analysis. The set of 
assumptions and calculations that follow are provided to show this sample size is adequate to demonstrate the AR101 response rate is significantly higher than placebo with at least a 15% margin  for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis in North America, and t he sample size is 
adequate to demonstrate t he AR101 response rate is significantly higher than placebo for the 
primary efficacy endpoint analysis in Europe. Additionally, with a trial of th is size, there would 
be an 80% probability of observing at least 1 AE among 375 subjects assigned to AR101 when the background rate of the AE is 4.3 per 1,000 subjects. With the completion of the ARC004 study and the ongoing ARC002 study (for a total of ap proximately 550 subjects treated with 
AR101), it is estimated that there would be an 80% probability of observing at least 1 AE when 
the background rate of the AE is 2.9 per 1,000 subjects.  
While natural history of peanut allergy desensitization is not fully understood, significant 
short-term improvements in consumption amounts are believed to be uncommon. Nevertheless, 
the sensitivity thresholds to peanut allergen are known to vary day to day based on numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  The inherent  variability in the sensitivity threshold for allergic 
reaction to peanut as measured by [CONTACT_792719]- allergic 
patients not undergoing immunotherapy ( Glaumann et al., 2013),  as well as in the placebo arms 
of several peanut immunotherapy trials (Sampson et  al., 2011; Varshney et al., 2011; Fleischer et 
al., 2013; Sampson et al., 2015).  The publication by [CONTACT_792720] . (2013) showed that the 
threshold for responding in oral food challenge can vary up or down by [CONTACT_309700]. The placebo response rates reported across therapeutic trials also vary widely, ranging anywhere 
from 11 to 55%, and are dependent on multiple factors, including the level of peanut protein set as a target response, the specific procedur es for oral food challenge employed, the dose level of 
maintenance therapy, and the duration of immunotherapy. 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092927]. Only 2 randomized controlled trials of peanut 
OIT ( Varshney et al ., 2011; Anagnostou et al ., 2014) have been reported to date, and these 
employed significantly different study designs. In the Varshney study, 16 of 19 (84%) subjects randomized to active treatment demonstrated a high degree of desensitization (although baseline sensitivity to peanut had not been established). This stands in contrast to the Anagnostou study, wherein only 24 of 49 (49%) subjects randomized to active treatment achieved the predefined level of desensitization.  
North America:  In the Phase 2 ARC001 study the primary endpoint was determined at the 
300 mg (443 mg cumulative) level of peanut protein in the Exit DBPCFC, whereas in the current 
Phase 3 study, ARC003, the primary endpoint will be determined at the 600 mg ( 1043 mg 
cumulative) dose level of peanut protein in the Exit DBPCFC , a level that was studied as an 
additional endpoint in ARC001. For the purpose of calcula ting statistical power for the ARC003 
study, the response rates at both the 443 mg (primary) and 1043 mg (additional) cumulative dose 
endpoints from ARC001 have been taken into consideration. 
In the Phase 2 ARC001 study, the placebo response rate for the primary endpoint in the ITT 
population of tolerating 443 mg cumulative of peanut protein at Exit DBPCFC was 19% (95% CI of 7% to 39%), and it was 0%  (95% CI of 0% to 13%) in the post -hoc analysis of 
tolerating [ADDRESS_1092928] that the  point estimate for the p lacebo response rate in the primary endpoint of ARC003 
is likely  to fall between 0 and 19% (based on point estimates), although it could be as high as 
13 to 39% (based on upper bound of the 95% CIs). Taking into account  the wide range of 
placebo response rates evident from the literatur e, a placebo response rate of 20% for the primary 
endpoint is assumed for power calculations in this study. 
The response rate in the AR101 arm of the ARC001 study was 79% (95% CI of 60% to 92%) 
and 62% (95% CI of 42% to 79%) for endpoints based on tolerating [ADDRESS_1092929] that the point estimate for the active treatment response rate at the 
primary endpoint in ARC003 is likely to fall between 62 and 79% (based on point estimates), 
although it could be as low as 42 to 60% (based on lower bound of 95% CIs). Given that dropouts accounted for the majority of desensitization failures in ARC001, a 6-month study, and the opportunity for dropout increases as the duration of the trial increases , a 50% AR101 
response rate at the primary endpoint is assumed  for the purpose of power calculation for 
ARC003, a 12 month study. This approach is consistent with published recommendations for adjusting assumptions about Phase 3 response rates based on Phase 2 results ( Wang, Hung, & 
O'Neill , 2006; Kirby [CONTACT_2297]., 2012).   
An additional 15% margin in the  separation between the placebo response and the response to 
AR101 will be included in defining the success criteria for the primary endpoint. This will help 
to ensure that the number of peanut- allergic patients spared moderate or severe allergic reactions 
at Exit DBPCFC (a model for accidental exposure) after treatment with AR101 represents a clinically meaningful benefit , and not just a statistically significant non- zero difference from 
placebo . The primary efficacy analysis is based on the Farrington -Manning test with a two -sided 
alternative hypothesis at the 5%  level of significance ( Farrington and Manning, 1990). Given 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092930] 20% , a 2- tailed 5% level test would have approximately 89 % 
power to detect an AR101 response rate of at least 50% and rule out treatment differences 
(AR101 minus placebo)  that are 15% or less for  the primary endpoint . 
Europe : Based on preliminary data from ARC002, 40 out of 55 subjects treated in ARC001 and 
ARC002 with AR101 underwent an Exit DBPCFC with a  single dose of 1000 mg (2043 mg 
cumulative) of peanut protein after approximately 12 or more weeks of maintenance dosing at 
300 mg/d. Of these, 24 subjects tolerated a single dose of 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut with no more than mild symptoms. This corresponds to an AR101 response rate of 44% (95% CI of 30% to 58%). We assume a placebo response rate of 15% at a single dose of 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein (two- thirds of what we assumed for the 
placebo response rate at a single d ose of 600 mg [1043 mg cum ulative]).  A sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1092931] 93% power to detect an AR101 response rate of at least 30% at a single dose of 1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein when the placebo respons e rate is at most 15%.

11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Statement of Compliance  
This study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in the United 
States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) – 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 and 312 and in the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) “Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance”, and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol. Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4215]/EC and other applicable health authorities. Any amendments to the protocol must also be approved by [CONTACT_582692], IRB/EC and other applicable health authorities before they are implemented. Any amendments to the consent materials must also be approved by [CONTACT_792723]/EC before they are implemented.
 
11.2 Informed Consent/Assent  
The informed consent /assent  form is a means of providing information about the study to a 
prospective adult subject or a pediatric  subject’s parent/guardian and allows for an informed 
decision about participation in the study. Because the study population will comprise a significant percentage of children, parents or legal guardians will be asked to read, sign and date a con sent form before a child enter s the study, takes study product, or undergoes any 
study-specific procedures. Children will sign an assent as appropriate.  Consent materials for 
parents/guardians who do not speak or read English will be translated into the appropriate language. The informed consent /assent  form will be  evaluated for revis ion whenever the protocol 
is amended.  A copy of the informed consent /assent  will be given to a prospective adult subject or 
a pediatric  subjects’ parent/guardian for review. The investigator (or designee),  will review the  
consent /assent  and answer questions, as well as emphasize the need to avoid allergen exp osure 
other than to AR101 , and the necessity to continue exposure to AR101  to maintain 
desensitization.  The prospective adult subject or a pediatric subje ct’s parent/guardian will be told 
that being in the study is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw his/her child from the study at any time, for any reason. 
In the optional saliva substudy (North America sites only)  in which samples will be obtained 
noninvasively from ARC003 participants, only subjects enrolled in ARC003 and providing 
additional consent for this substudy are eligible to participate ( Appendix  6). 
11.[ADDRESS_1092935] ’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study. Each subject will 
be assigned a sequential identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store and report subject  information.

Anaphylaxis is likely when any one of the 3 following sets of criteria is  fulfilled: 
1. Acute onset of an illness ( min to h) with involvement of: 
o Skin/mucosal tissue ( eg, generalized  hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
AND  
o Airway compromise ( eg, dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/ bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF) AND /OR 
o Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg , hypotonia, syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80909] ( min to h): 
o Skin/mucosal tissue ( eg, generalized  hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) 
o Airway compromise ( eg, dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF)  
o Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg , hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
o Persistent  GI symptoms ( eg, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain) 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen ( min to h):  
o Infants and Children: low systolic B P (age -specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP* 
o Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline 
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less than 
(70 mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1 to 10 years; and < 90 mmHg  from age 11  to 17 years.  
Note: Isolated skin or mucosal lesions following the ingestion of a food constitute a 
“food-induced allergic reaction”.

PALISADE 31 July 2017  Appendix 5:  Guidance for Determining When an Epi[INVESTIGATOR_489119] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
For an epi[INVESTIGATOR_266781], Aimmune  advises that the event satisfy 
one of the outcome-based definitions of SAE specified in Section 7.4.2 of the 
Protocol, with the stipulations (denoted in italics ) indicated. These stipulations follow from, and 
are consistent with, the criteria for D SMC reporting ( Section 7.7.2):  
1. Death – No further stipulation.  
2. Life-threatening AE (Life -threatening means that the study subject was, in theopi[INVESTIGATOR_266764], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.): 
For anaphylaxis to be considered life-threatening it should be assessed to have been 
severe, as defined in Appendix 3 and of a Grade 4 allergic r eaction, as defined in 
Table A4  of Appendix 4. 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]: The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266782], as, for example, might be implemented to watch for a delayed or biphasic reaction.  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions: No further stipulation.  
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect: No further stipulation. 
6. Important medical event that may not result in  one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event: 
o In general, for an anaphylactic epi[INVESTIGATOR_489121] “important medical event,” it should have resulted in an emergency room visit, and the emergency room visit should have been associated with intensive therapy. What constitutes intensive therapy is to be determined by [CONTACT_093], but may include such interventions as IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], intubation, or admission to an intensive care unit.  
o One or 2 intramuscular injections of epi[INVESTIGATOR_792673]  
o If an investigator assesses an epi[INVESTIGATOR_582664] “important medical event” when the epi[INVESTIGATOR_582665], the rationale for the assessment must be explained in detail in the narrative of the event.

PALISADE 31 July 2017  Appendix  6: (North America sites only) Exploratory Biochemical and Molecular Study of 
Peanut -Allergic Children and Adu lts with Oral Immunotherapy -Related 
Gastrointestinal Symptoms in ARC003  
Background 
A strong association exists between food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) ( Noel 2004; 
Spergel 2012; Greenhawt 2014). Instituting an elemental diet free of potential allergens is the 
most reliably effective treatment for spontaneously occurring EoE ( Arias 2014; Wechsler 2014 ). 
In some cases of EoE, if a specific allergy -provoking food can be identified, then dietary 
avoidance of the offending food can result in resolution of the esophageal symptoms (Spergel 2012). Alternatively, elimination from the diet of the most common food allergens, 
including milk, egg, peanut/tree nuts, soy, wheat, and shellfish/fish, can also result in resolution of the esophagitis ( Kagalwalla 2006; Gonsalves 2012). When reintroduction of a suspected 
allergenic food is associated with the return of symptoms, t his strongly implicates the food as a 
likely causative agent of the EoE ( Gonsalves 2012).  
IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to food allergens , but also aeroallergens ( Alpan  2012;  
Ridolo 2012; Wolf  2013; Rea 2014), figures prominently in the pathogenesis of EoE, but other 
factors besides the induction of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction also appear important. 
One circumstance in which multiple factors pertaining to food exposure are controlled at the time that EoE becomes symptomatic is when EoE occurs in  the setting of oral immunotherapy (OIT). 
The inciting food is known, as is the amount and timing of its consumption. Moreover, EoE occurs only in a minority of patients undergoing OIT. Thus, studying EoE when it arises during the course of OIT may provide a unique opportunity to gain insights into its pathogenesis.  
In OIT studies, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_792674] 
(Anagnostou 2014; Yu 2012; Blumchen 2010; Jones 2009) and account for a substantial 
proportion of premature discontinuations of study treatment ( Burks 2012; Varshney 2011; 
Jones 2009; Vickery 2011). This was also observed in the completed ARC001 study and the ongoing ARC002 study. In the ARC001 study, 6 out of 29 subjects (21%) receiving active treatment discontinued prematurely . Four of the early discontinuations were attributed by [CONTACT_792726]; and in one of these cases the diagnosis of EoE was subsequently established by [CONTACT_175753]. In the other two discontinuations, at least one GI AE had occurred  in each subject . In the ongoing ARC002 study, 
an open- label follow -on to the ARC001 study, 6 of the 26 subjects (22%) who had been assigned 
to the placebo group in ARC001 discontinued therapy prematurely. Four of these early discontinuations were due to recurrent GI AEs and two were due to study visit scheduling difficulties .  
Repeated bouts of abdominal pain and vomiting are common to both EoE and chronic/recurrent OIT-related GI symptoms, suggesting a common, or at least a similar, etiology in at least a 
proportion of patients. To date, at least [ADDRESS_1092948] been 
confirmed histopathologically to be EoE as reported in the medical literature  (Hofmann 2009; 
Vickery  2011; Wasserman, 2011; Sánchez-García 2012; Lucendo 2014), and in still other cases 
the symptomatology and clinical course (with or without concomitant blood eosinophilia) have been highly suggestive of EoE (Narisety 2009; Vickery 2011; Stein 2012) . A rec ent review of 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 117 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE 31 July 2017  the literature (Lucendo, 2014) has indicated that the incidence of confirmed EoE in OIT is on the 
order of 3% (ranging from approximately 1% to 5%), but the incidence of suspected EoE on clinical grounds may be in the vicinity of 15 to 25%. 
Establishing the association between OIT and the subsequent development of EoE is not always 
straight forward . The time to onset of EoE during the course of OIT may vary depending on the 
allergen and OIT regimen . Many ( Vickery 2011; Wasserman 2011), though not all 
(Hofmann 2009), of the reported cases of EoE with peanut OIT had developed GI symptoms early in the course of oral desensitization, whereas with milk OIT the occurrence of EoE has tended to be after reintroduction of milk into the diet (Sánchez -García 2012; Maggadottir 2014; 
Nowak -Wegrzyn 2014). Not all EoE occurring during OIT i s necessarily caused by [CONTACT_792727] , 
however. Food allergies often  occur to more than one type of food and allergies to foods often 
coexist with allergies to airborne and contac t allergens.  
Chronic GI AEs affecting participants in ARC003 have been designated as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) in the ARC003  protocol document, Amendment 1. The goal of the 
current substudy is to explore the biology of these GI AESIs occurring during our Phase 3 trial using a readily available and noninvasive sampling method (saliva) in an attempt to overcome some of the difficulties in assessing intolerable GI AEs in subjects undergoing OIT.  
Rationale for the Proposed Study  
The overa ll aims of this substudy are to collect biospecimens through a noninvasive technique, 
and to analyze them to develop a better understanding of the biochemical and molecular changes that occur when OIT participants develop GI adverse events significant enou gh to require 
discontinuation of the OIT protocol. We will obtain preliminary information regarding these biological changes in biospecimens from symptomatic individuals, as well as controls, using methods that have been developed for the study of eosinophilic GI disorders at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349], Cincinnati, OH, [LOCATION_003].  
Specifically, this substudy of ARC003 , Amendment [ADDRESS_1092949] further information fr om those subjects 
who go on to experience GI side effects during OIT and controls. To overcome the obstacles 
limiting traditional EoE  evaluations in this context (e g, performance of an 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]), an easily collected biospecimen will be analyzed to determine whether patterns can be detected that correlate with patterns seen in other subjects with known bona fide EoE. As there are no known clinical predictors of EoE, all ARC003 participants will be approached about participating in thi s substudy. Further analyses will be 
conducted on those subjects who develop GI symptoms during the course of OIT and controls who do not develop GI symptoms. While all subjects will provide baseline saliva specimens (collected at screening), we will be op portunistic about the collection of esophageal specimens, 
which may provide additional supportive data. Specifically, if subjects in the study withdraw from OIT and undergo a clinically -indicated EGD, we will, whenever possible, collect biopsy 
material fro m the site for further analysis, as per the ARC003 protocol.  
In addition to addressing the detection of biomolecular signatures in subjects having adverse events, it is possible  that specific biomolecular signatures could emerge from the planned study 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092950]’s 
response to OIT and the collection of biospecimens  in this substudy co uld facilitate these future 
analyses.  
Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Participants  
Risks  
The principal potential risk associated with this sub study is the potential for emotional or 
psychological distress related to the discovery of uncert ain information that is not itself 
diagnostic but may sugg est a new clinical diagnosis (i e, EoE). To mitigate against this risk, and 
because the assays run in this substudy are experimental, exploratory, and not part of standard 
care EoE diagnostics, the r esults of these studies will not be shared with participants. Clinical 
management of these individuals will be at the judgment of the site investigator, per the current 
standard of care. The ARC003 protocol document also contains specific recommendations a bout 
the clinical follow -up of subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_792675]. All study candidates entering ARC003 will 
undergo an informed consent procedure detailing the potential risk of OIT -associated 
gastrointestinal symptoms, including the possibility of EoE.  
There are no known physical risks to the saliva collection procedure.  
Benefits  
Individual subjects are not expected to benefit from participation in this study. Information from 
this study may help researchers to better understand peanut allergy and its relations hip to EoE or 
to develop future tests or treatments to help patients with one or both of these conditions. 
Objectives  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to analyze biomolecular  expression patterns  in saliva samples obtained 
longitudinally from peanut -allergic participants undergoing OIT in ARC003 . These studies will 
target the salivary RNA transcriptome, and if necessary f urther validate, with molecular- , 
cellular -, and/or protein -based approaches,  the expression profile of gene pathways that are likel y 
relevant to intolerable  GI side effects in ARC003 subjects.  
Secondary Objectives  
The key secondary objective is to examine the relationship of the RNA expression profile to selected clinical variable s from ARC003, including:  
• The frequency and severity of AEs related to the gastrointestinal tract  
• The frequency of dosing interruptions (reductions and/or discontinuations) directly related to GI AEs  
• Peripheral blood eosinophil counts  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 119 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE 31 July 2017  • PEESS v2.0 scores  
• Immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgG4, and their subclasses) 
Further secondary objectives include the correlation of salivary RNA transcriptome data to 
histopathologic and molecular analyses of the esophagus, when available. 
Substudy Design  
This is an optional substudy in which samples will be obtained from ARC003 participants 
according to the Schedule of Events in Table A6 . Only subjects enrolled in ARC003 and 
providing additional consent for this substudy are eligible to participate. Subjects enrolled in both ARC003 and this substudy will undergo saliva collection coordinated at the designated ARC003 study visits. Otherwise these subjects will be treated according to the ARC003 study protocol.

c Subjects withdrawing early fr om ARC003 with GI symptoms that were not already enrolled in this 
substudy will be consented to enroll upon early termination.  
Subjects in this substudy will undergo [ADDRESS_1092952] a baseline saliva sample collected at Screening (before the Screening DBPCFC). Because the GI adverse events of special interest are unpredictable and treatment -emergent, the approach 
to sampling post- randomization will differ by [CONTACT_792728]. Subjects who develop 
GI-predominant adverse events that prompt their withdrawal from ARC003 or a protracted 
disruption of dosing with study product will be considered “ca ses” in  this substudy. The second 
saliva sample will be collected from cases when the first PEESSV2.0 is completed . The final 
saliva sample for cases will be collected at the end of the protocol -defined 6-month follow-up 
period for subjects that withdraw from therapy. 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 120 of 126 
Protocol ARC003, Amendment 4.0  
PALISADE 31 July 2017   “Controls” in this substudy will be defined as ARC003 participants receiving OIT (active and 
placebo) who do not develop intolerable GI symptoms. Following the baseline collection, asymptomatic subjects will provide saliva samples at the 6-week up-dosing visit and again at the end of the updosing period.  
This substudy will principally involve: collection, shipment, and banking of saliva samples at 
specified  time points; gene expression analysis of selected salivary biospecimens; and correlation 
with basic biometric data (eg , peripheral blood eosinophils, clinical symptom reports/PEESSv2.0 
scores) obtained as necessary, and clinical outcome per the ARC003 protocol. Biochemical detection of eosinophil activation products or metabolites may also be possible from collected samples.  
Subject participation will consist of signing an informed consent form (ICF) approved by [CONTACT_21980] (IRB), ethics committee (EC), research ethics board (REB), or like authority, and age-appropriate assent form, when indicated, as per local guidelines, and the provisions for biospecimen collection and handling (further detailed in Section 4.3).  
Case Definition: ARC003 Events Triggering P EESS v2.0  
The following passage is taken from Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the ARC003 Protocol, Amendment 1 and serves to identify the case definition in this substudy; eg, the ARC003 subjects who develop the 
GI AESIs requiring further evaluation .  
GI AEs, typi[INVESTIGATOR_155650]/recurrent GI AEs, that result in a prolonged disruption of dosing will be considered AEs of special interest and will be assessed longitudinally according to the procedures described below. For the purpose of delineating these AEs of special interest, prolonged disruption of dosing is defined as withholding study product for > 7 days. This will include 3 categories of subjects: 
o Any subject whose dose is withheld for > 7 days due to GI AEs and resumes dosing at a reduced dose level ( Section  6.7 of the ARC003 protocol) 
o Any subject who develops chronic/recurrent GI AEs at or before reaching the 20 mg 
dose level and resumes dosing after a 30-day dosing hiatus ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] of the 
ARC003 protocol ); 
o Any subject who permanently discontinues dosing who had experienced GI AEs 
(Section  4.3.2 of the ARC003 protocol ). 
Subjects under the age of 18 years who fall into any of these 3 categories will be asked to fill out the PEESS  v2.0 questionnaire ( Franciosi et al ., 2011), with the assistance of a 
parent or guardian, as appropriate, every month for 6 months; adults will be given the same  version of the questionnaire. It should, however, be noted that the PEESS v2.[ADDRESS_1092953] validity ( Franciosi et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2015) 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092954] symptomatic improvement or worsening that might otherwise go undetected. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
All endpoints in this substudy are considered exploratory. The primary objective is to 
characterize RNA expression patterns in salivary specimens collected from peanut- allergic  
subjects who participated in a study of peanut OIT and developed intolerable GI adverse events that inte rfered with treatment (ie, resulted in reducing, holding, or discontinuing OIT dose 
levels) . ARC003 subjects who do not develop limiting GI symptoms will also be studied as 
control specimens. Secondarily we will also examine the associations of the salivar y RNA 
expression changes with selected clinical variables as listed in Section 3.[ADDRESS_1092955] correlation to RNA expression patterns observed in esophageal 
specimens, when available.  
Bioinformatic analysis plan for primary and secondary objectives  
The bioinformatic analysis plan for the primary and secondary objectives of this study include: 
• Quality control of the genome-wide RNA sequencing data 
• Expression filter and statistical filter  
• Clustering analysis with known clinical outcomes 
• Develop an algorithm (similar to Wen et al ., 2013) to quantify the oral sample signature 
[CONTACT_792735] v2.0 
• Use a portion of the samples as a training set for  machine learning , then carry out the 
support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the rest of the samples. SVM is a supervised learning  mode l with associated learni ng algorithms  that analyze data and recognize 
patterns.  
• Principle Component Analysis (PCA) will be employed to globally categorize the samples, reduce the dimensionality for signature [CONTACT_792736]/or quantitative comparisons to the 
patterns of biomolecular and biochemical  expression seen in subjects with spontaneously 
occurring EoE or other esophageal pa thologies (historical controls). These control specimens 
will be obtained under separate protocols at the investigative laboratory.

Lead Investigative Laboratory 
The lead investigative laboratory is the following: Wen Lab – Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349]  
S6.[ADDRESS_1092957], Cincinnati, OH [ZIP_CODE]  
[LOCATION_003].  
Permission to obtain samples of esophageal tissue from the residua (if any) of biopsy specimens obtained during the performance of routine clinical endoscopic biopsy will be requested for subjects who undergo this procedure.  
4. Study Blinding Procedures 
This substudy will be unblinded after ARC003 is unblinded. The precautions relating to 
maintenance of blinding are detailed in the ARC003 Masking Plan. In order to 
understand the clinical significance of the bioassays performed in this substudy, information about the clinical history (including history during participation in ARC003) and treatment assignment in ARC003 will be analyzed. However, ARC003 treatment assignments will not be provided to any individual directly involved in performance of 
laboratory assays until all assays are completed. Subject identification will be known 
only to the personnel at the investigational site obtaining informed consent, and potentially the site monitor(s) and auditors. Subject identification will be kept confidential.  
5. Safety Monitoring 
As the study entails no treatment, there can be no treatment -emergent or treatment -related 
adverse events (AEs) in  this substudy. As outlined in Section 1.3, the principal risk 
associated with a genetic -based study is the potential for emotional reactions upon 
learning that the subject or a subject’s family member does or does not carry or expres s a 
gene associated with a particular condition.  
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_1092958] assessments for normality and adjustments as necessary. Measures of correlation and longitudinal repeated measures will be assessed  with 
appropriate techniques (e g regression modeling) as necessary. Statistical testing for 
differences between treatment groups or time points may be assessed, but specific hypothe ses are not pre-specified.  
7. Study Endpoint Assessment 
All endpoints in this study are considered exploratory and are defined in Section 3.8.  
8. Subject and Demographic Data 
Baseline Characteristics, Demographics, and Safety Data  
Baseline and demographic characteristics may be reported for each subject enrolled in the 
present study as they were obtained in ARC003. Demographic data could include age, race, sex, body weight and height. Other analyses involving safety data may also be performed.  
Use of Medications  
There will be no medications used in this substudy. Data from concomitant medication use in ARC003 related to AEs may be analyzed as part of this substudy.  
9. Sample Size Calculations  
This is an exploratory and hypothesis-generating study involving minimal risk to subjects.  No specific sample size calculations have been performed.

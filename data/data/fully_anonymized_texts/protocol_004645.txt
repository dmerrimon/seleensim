 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
  
Study Design  
This is a placebo controlled study in 400 patients , testing the hypothesis that pre -treatment use of 
intravenous nitroglycerin will decrease the incidence of renal insufficiency after  percutaneous  
angiography , cardiac or lower extremity  
 
Intervention  
Patients undergoing  percutaneous angiography  will be randomly assigned to receive in travenou s 
nitroglycerin (5 mcg/min, titrated up to 50mcg/min for  at least  1 hour, maintaining systolic blood 
pressure (B P) > 100 mmHg,  before and 3 hours after the procedure)  or a norma l saline placebo in 
a 1:[ADDRESS_643278] induced 
nephropathy  (CIN) .  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
 
1- The primary endpoint will be the change in estimated g lomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
assessed by m odification of diet for renal disease formula , after percutaneous 
angiography . 
 
Secondary Endpoints :  
 
1- CIN will be defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 25% or ≥ 0.5 mg/dl post -
percutaneous angiography .  
2- Safety profile of the intervention including volume overload, hypotension, headache, the 
need for hemod ialysis, intra-aortic balloon pump, endotracheal intubation or the use of 
pressors.  
3- Analysis and comparison to a CIN predictive score calculator (Mehran Score).

MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER  | CoNaN Trial  [ADDRESS_643279] media (1 -3).  The incidence has been reported in the range of 
0 to 50%, depending on comorbidities and risk factors (4 -8).  CIN usually resolves 
spontaneously , but it has been associated with an increased risk of morbidity, in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473], 
and late mortality (9 -10). There is no specific management for renal insufficiency after the 
development of CIN.   Therefore, there is interest in finding  preventive strategies.  Available 
evidence supports the use of hydration, sodium bicarbonate, and reduc tion of  contrast volume 
administered to  patients at risk (22). Statin use for prevention of CIN is still controversial (30 -
32), with a recent publication showing promising results  (33). A hydration system was proposed 
by [CONTACT_499685]. (34) that showed CIN preventive effects. Further studies are needed to support 
these findings. Other agents , such as N-acety lcysteine, fenoldopam, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], captopril , 
prostaglandins and am inophylline  have been evaluated in the prevent ion of CIN  with varying  
results  (23-29).  
 
Animal models suggest that the impaired synthesis of nitric oxide is one important contributor to 
the pathogenesis of the vasoconstriction that may lead to CIN (11-13). We plan to investigate 
whether the use of intravenous nitroglycerin before exposure to contrast media  reverses this 
vasoconstriction , and therefore,  prevents the development of CIN.  
 
The present manuscript  describes the background, rationale, study design, safety monitoring, and 
analysis plan for the proposed c ontrast nephropathy and nitrates trial (CoNaN).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_643280] agents (14 -18).  
 
Devrim et al, performed a randomized animal model trial, exposing rat kidneys to contrast media 
and measur ing nitric oxide ( NO) levels after exposure. They suggested that non-ionic  low 
osmolar contrast medium administration leads to accelerated oxidant reactions and decreased NO 
level in rat kidney tissues.  (13) 
 
In another animal model  completed by [CONTACT_499686]. they exposed anesthetized rats to the 
inhibitor of NO formation, L -NG-monomethylarginine (LNMMA). While increasing blood 
pressure and reducing renal blood flow they measured a decline in oxygen tension. These 
responses were promp tly reversed by L -arginine, a NO donor, which by[CONTACT_499687]. They concluded that vasodilatation  by [CONTACT_499688]

 renal medullary oxygenation and play an important role in the prevention of medullary hypoxic 
injury. ( 19) 
 
Agmon et al, produced a simple model of radiocontrast induced nephropathy. Rats were 
pretreated with indomethacin (prostaglandin blocker) and N omega -nitro -L-arginine methyl ester 
(L-NAME, to inhibit nitric  oxide synthesis)  and then exposed to a contrast agent. A cute renal 
failure consistently developed, with a decline in creatinine clearance . Pretreatment with L-
NAME [CONTACT_499696] . It was  concluded that prostanoids 
and nitric  oxide have an important protective role in the renal response to radiocontrast material , 
and r educed synthesis of these vasoactive substances in renal/vascular diseases may predispose 
patients to radiocontrast nephropathy. ( 11) 
 
The mechanism by [CONTACT_9444] N -acetylcystein e and other antioxidants have been proposed to confer 
renal protection in some animal models and human trials is through stimulation of nitric oxide 
synthase ( NOS ) to increase the endothelial production of NO. (17) 
 
Nitroglycerin exerts its effects by [CONTACT_499689].  In 
smooth muscle, nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase which increases guanosine 3’5’ 
monophosphate (cGMP) leading to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and smooth muscle 
relaxation.  It prod uces a vasodilating effect on the peripheral veins and arteries, with more 
prominent ef fects on veins than arteries . (20)   
 
In the study of Efrati et al, the administration N-acetylcysteine was associated with maintenance  
of higher urinary NO levels after  exposure to contrast media in comparison to the placebo group, 
were it was associated with a decrease of NO urinary levels after exposure to the toxin. They 
explained that “contrast media agents can cause a direct tubular injury, leading to the generation  
of oxygen free radicals, which in turn react with nitric oxide to produce peroxynitrite. 
Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant that further decreases nitric oxide bioavailability and results in 
more tissue injury. Patients with chronic renal failure, diabetes  mellitus, and heart failure have 
impaired nitric oxide activity, which could account for their susceptibility to develop con trast 
media nephrotoxicity”. (17 ) 
 
We recently completed a small retrospective study at our institution  (exhibit A) . We sought to 
investigate whether the use of nitrates before PCI reduces the incidence of CIN. We evaluated 
patients that were admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499680]. 
We measured the effects of pre -procedure nitrate use on post -PCI renal function in patients who 
received nitrates within [ADDRESS_643281] -media. 
But prospective, randomized -controlled trials are warranted to support or refute this hypothesis.

MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER  | CoNaN Trial  7 
 The mechanistic hypothesis of the CoNaN trial is that by [CONTACT_094] -treating with intravenous 
nitroglycerin and exposing the renal vasculature to nitric oxide donor (NO), the damage caused 
by [CONTACT_499690], 
thus reducing the incidence of CIN.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_643282] INDUCED NEPHROPATHY  
 
Experimental animal studies provide evidence that NO plays a role in  CIN. The clinical 
information on the use of intravenous nitroglycerin to prevent CIN is limited to one retrospective 
study. Our hypo thesis that  pre-PCI exposure to intravenous nitroglycerin could  prevent CIN has 
a favorable theoretical basis . The reality of our premise is still uncertain.  
 
Our proposal for a randomized clinical trial will answer a simple clinical question. It will help to 
demonstrate a correlation or not, between experimental results obtained in  animal models and 
human subjects. It will also contribute to clarify the role of  NO donors in the renal vasculature.

5.4 TREATMENT REGIMENS  
Continuous intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin 5 mcg/min will be started and titrated every 3-5 
minutes for a max imum  of 100 mcg/minute if tolerated by [CONTACT_232893] (>100/60mmHg), at 
least 1 hour before and 3 hours after the procedure. The nitroglycerin  for infusion  comes in a pre -
mixed 250 ml bottle, with a concentration of 200  mcg/ml.  
Intravenous sodium chloride 0.9 %, will be administered at 1ml/kg /hr at least [ADDRESS_643297] 3 hours  after for both treatment arms . If the ejection fraction is known to 
be less than 40% or patient have signs and symptoms of volume overload, a 0.5 ml/kg/hr 
regimen will be utilized.  If the patient is in acute  congestive heart failure, no intravenous fluids 
will be given.  
5.4.1 NITROGLYCERIN PHARMACOLOGY  
Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator an d antianginal agent, that can be administer intravenously, orally, 
intra-anal, as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_168842], as a patch, sublingual and as a translingual  spray.  In our study it 
will be administered via intraveno us infusion as previously  specified by [CONTACT_760].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  NITROGLYCERIN HUMAN TOXICITY  
Nitroglycerin serious adverse reactions include severe hypotension, nitrates tolerance, 
bradycardia, anaphylactoid reactions, and methemoglobinemia. Other common reactions include 
headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, flushing , orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, 
edema, burning oral sensation (sublingual use) and tingling oral sensation (sublingual use).  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERE HYPOTENSION  
 [CONAN TRIAL ] 
Version  5 April 14, 2015  
 
MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER  | CoNaN Trial  [ADDRESS_643298] of Nitroglycerin is hypotension. Nitroglycerin forms free 
radical nitric oxide. In smooth muscle, nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase which increases 
guanosine 3’5’ monophosphate (cGMP) leading to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and 
smooth muscle relaxation. This produces a vasodilator effect on the peripheral veins and arteries 
with more prominent effects on the veins, decrease preload (left ventricular end -diastolic 
pressure); may modestly reduce afterload. This can lead to severe hypotension and paradoxical 
bradycardia and  increased angina pectoris can accompany hypotension.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  METHEMOGLOBINEMIA  
Methemoglobinemia is a n uncommon side effect of nitroglycerin use.  Methemoglobin is an 
oxidized form of  hemoglobin  that has a decreased affinity for oxygen, resulting in an increased  
affinity of oxygen to other heme sites and overall reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues. 
The oxygen -hemoglobin dissociation curve  is therefore shifted to the left  when it’s present . 
When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in  red blood cells,  tissue hypoxia can occur.  The 
protective enzyme systems normally present in red blood cells maintain methemoglobin levels at 
less than one percent of the total hemoglobin in healthy people. Exposure to exogenous oxidizing 
drugs and their metabolites such i s nitrates may accelerate the rate of formation of 
methemoglobin up to one -thousand fold , overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and 
acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  NITROGLYCERIN DRUG TO DRUG INTERACTIONS  
Nitroglycerin is relatively save medi cation. Some medications can cause severe or fatal adverse 
reactions. Interaction risk stratification is done following the following classification:  
 
A - No known interaction  
B - No action needed  
C - Monitor therapy  
D - Consider therapy modification  
X - Avoid combination  
 
 
 Alfuzosin: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Nitroglycerin.  Risk C: Monitor 
therapy  
 Alteplase: Nitroglycerin may decrease the serum concentration of Alteplase. Risk 
C: Monitor therapy  
 [CONAN TRIAL ] 
Version  5 April 14, 2015  
 
MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER  | CoNaN Trial  14 
  Ergot Derivatives: May diminish the vasodilatory  effect of Nitroglycerin. This is 
of particular concern in patients being treated for angina. Nitroglycerin may 
increase the serum concentration of Ergot Derivatives.  Risk X: Avoid combination  
 Heparin: Nitroglycerin may diminish the anticoagulant effect of  Heparin. 
Nitroglycerin may decrease the serum concentration of Heparin. Risk C: Monitor 
therapy  
 Hypotensive Agents: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Hypotensive 
Agents.  Risk C: Monitor therapy  
 Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors: May enhance the v asodilatory effect of 
Vasodilators (Organic Nitrates).  Risk X: Avoid combination  
 Prilocaine: Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents may enhance the 
adverse/toxic effect of Prilocaine. Combinations of these agents may increase the 
likelihood of significant met hemoglobinemia. Management: Monitor patients for 
signs of methemoglobinemia (e.g., hypoxia, cyanosis) when prilocaine is used in 
combination with other agents associated with development of 
methemoglobinemia. Avoid lidocaine/prilocaine in infants receiving  such agents.  
Risk C: Monitor therapy  
 Rosiglitazone: Vasodilators (Organic Nitrates) may enhance the adverse/toxic 
effect of Rosiglitazone. Specifically, a greater risk of myocardial ischemia was 
reported for users of this combination in a meta -analysis. Management: Consider 
alternatives to this combination when possible. Rosiglitazone prescribing 
information states that the combination of rosiglitazone and a nitrate is not 
recommended.  Risk D: Consider therapy modification  
 Ethanol: Avoid ethanol (may incr ease the hypotensive effects of nitroglycerin). 
Monitor.  
 Herb/Nutraceutical: Avoid bayberry, blue cohosh, cayenne, ephedra, ginger, 
ginseng (American), kola;  licorice (may worsen hypertension). Avoid black 
cohosh, [LOCATION_004] poppy, coleus, golden seal, haw thorn, mistletoe, periwinkle, 
quinine, shepherd's purse (may cause hypotension).

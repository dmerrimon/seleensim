 NCI Update Date: October 4, [ADDRESS_630473] a 1 8% rate of complete patho logic response (pCR = pT0pN0). Ultimately, 
we assert that neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy will be safe, well tolerated 
and result in improved long -term oncologic outcomes for patien ts with upper tract 
urothelial carcinoma . 
1.[ADDRESS_630474] urothelial cancer (UTUC) accounts for roughly 5% of all urothelial 
cancers (UC), with 11, 000 new cases annually in United  States.  At 
presentation, 30% of patients demonstrate invasive and/o r locally advanced 
disease, 30 -40% have regional lymph node involvement, and 20% harbor 
metastatic disease.  Systemic recurrence and progression rates after surgery 
alone for patients with advanced UTUC are hi gh with ranges between 45 -60%.  
5-year cancer s pecific survival (CSS) rates for pT2 and pT3 tumors are 73% and 
40%, respectively.1,2  While radical nephro -ureterectom y (RNU) represents the 
standard therapeutic option for patients with UTUC, there are significant 
challenges associated with inaccurate clinical staging, high prevalence of occult 
metastatic disease, poor baseline and worsening post -operative global renal 
function, and subsequent difficulties with administration of meaningful systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Cisplatin based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has shown a therapeutic 
benefit in patients with bladder UC. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy 
had a 5% absolu te improvement in CSS, compared to patients treated with 
cystectomy alone. [ADDRESS_630475] shown that the use 
of NAC prior to RNU has been associated  with pathological downstaging.5 In 
Matin et al. ‘s retrospective review of 150 patients who received platinum -based 
NAC treatment of biopsy proven high grade UTUC, the overall incidence of pT2 
or higher disease was significantly lower in the  NAC group compared to the 
control patients (46.5% vs. 65%; p=.043) .5  Moreover, a 14% pathologic 
complete response rate (pCR) was observed in that retrospective study . Finally, 
several authors report favorable oncologic outcomes in patients with advanced 
UTUC treated with pre -surgical systemic chemotherapy, compared to historic 
controls.6-[ADDRESS_630476] that UTUC patients are at an increased risk of 
baseline or future chronic kidney disease (CKD), rendering many poor 
candidates for perioperative cisplatin chemotherapy. [ADDRESS_630477] 
shown 25 -52% and 65 -78% incidence of CKD before and after RNU. 9,10 Lane et 
al. evaluated 336 patients who underwent NU for UTUC and found that at 
baseline, 52% of the cohort were poor cisplatin -based chemotherapy candidates 
due to impaired renal function . Following RNU, there was a 21% reduction in 
renal function and RNU rendered 78% of the patient’s poor candidates for 
cisplatin -based therap y. In a sub -group analysis of 144 high -risk patients (T2 -T4 
NX disease) at the time of RNU, who would be ideal candidates for systemic 
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February  11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, 2017  
8 treatment, impaired preoper ative renal function was observed in nearly 60% of 
patients . Following RNU, the frequency of renal impairment increased to 78% 
(p=.009).  Based on this alone, 61% of all patients and 49% of high risk patients 
who could have received chemotherapy preoperati vely were unable to receive 
treatment after RNU .10 Thus a strong rationale exists to optimize delivery of 
cisplatin -based regimens to patients with adequate renal func tion and to define 
the role of non -cisplatin regimens in the large portion of UTUC patients who are 
poor candidates for cisplatin therapy.  
The target population of this study includes patients with clinically localized high 
grade UTUC, since histologic gra de is one of the few reliable and readily 
obtainable pathologic staging variables, and correlates well with advanced 
pathologic stage, and eventual oncologic outcomes.11-13  Patients will be 
assigned to a treatment arm and receive a platinum based NAC regimen based 
on their screening creatinine clearance  (CrCl) , determined by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault 
calculation or direct 24 -hour urine measurement , followed by [CONTACT_490394] -
uretere ctomy and regional lymph node dissection.  NAC with accelerated 
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (AMVAC) will be 
administered to patients with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min, based on CrCl cut-off with 
demonstrated safety in modern neoadjuvant cisplatin studies.3,5  Patients with  30 
≤ CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min, will be offered gemcitabine/carboplatin (GCa), which has 
demonstrated response in patients with UC and impaired CrCl treated in the 
metastatic setting.14-16  As stated above, because of additional nephron loss with 
up-front surgery, many of UTUC patients with baseline CKD will not qualify for 
any additional systemic therapy after surgery, thus the rationale for including a 
non-cisplatin arm for t his group.  
Pathologic complete response (pCR) is a relevant, generalizable, early end -point 
for NAC in UC of the bladder and therefore was chosen as the initial primary 
efficacy endpoint in this proposed UTUC NAC trial.3  A targeted pCR rate of 18 % 
was chosen based on well characterized results of NAC in UC of the urinary 
bladder and from limited experience with NAC in UTUC.3,5,[ADDRESS_630478] urothelial 
cancers are difficult to access for initial staging and resection, thus the expected 
pCR rate in this trial is lower than the near 40% seen in bladder NAC studies, a 
rate achieved by [CONTACT_490395]. Important 
additional endpoints of renal functional outcomes (both improvements and 
declines on therapy), bladder and systemic recurrence -free survival and cancer -
specific/overall survival will be assessed.   
Finally, the trial design permits utilization of pre -treatment and post -treatment 
tumor tissue, peripheral blood, and urine specimens to study, among oth ers, 
biomarkers and molecular and pathways important in resistance and response to 
chemotherapy.

5.2 Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements  
NOTE:  For this protocol, the Adverse Event Reporting period includes the 
time the patient is on chemotherapy and continues through [ADDRESS_630510]- surgery.  
5.2.1  Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required 
as part of every  clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of the 
patients enrolled, as well as those who will enroll in future studies 
using similar agents.  
 Routine reporting:  Advers e events are reported in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial using Medidata Rave.   
 Expedited reporting:  In addition to routine reporting, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for 
timelier monitoring of patient safe ty and care. The following 
sections provide information and instructions regarding expedited 
adverse event reporting.  
5.2.2  Terminology  
 Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug  (or surgery)  in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal product  (or surgery) , whether or not 
considered related t o the medicinal product  (or surgery) .  Rev. 10/15

20  Attribution:  An assessment of the relationship between the 
adverse event and the protocol treatment, using the following 
categories.  
ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related  to treatment . 
Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related  to treatment . 
Possible  The AE may be related  to treatment . 
Probable  The AE is likely related  to treatment . 
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to treatment . 
 
 CTCAE:   The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events provides a descriptive terminology that is to be utilized for 
AE reporting.  A grade (severity) is provided for each AE term.  
 Expectedness:  Expected events are those that have been 
previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent  
(or surgery) . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes, when either the type of event or the 
severity of the event is NOT listed in the protocol or drug package 
insert.  
5.2.3  Reporting Procedure  
This study requires that expedited a dverse event reporting use 
CTEP’s Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS) . The CTEP ’s 
guidelines  for CTEP -AERS  can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov .  A 
CTEP -AERS  report must be submitted electronically to ECOG -ACRI N 
and the appropriate regulatory agencies via the CTEP -AERS  Web-
based application located at http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
In the rare event when Internet connectivity  is disrupted a 24 -hour 
notification is to be made by [CONTACT_490403]  
 the AE Team at ECOG -ACRIN  ([PHONE_8216])  
 the FDA (1 -800-FDA-1088)  
An electronic report MUST be submitted immediately upon re -
establishment of internet connection.  
Supporting and follow up data:  Any supporting or follow up 
documentation must be u ploaded to the Supplemental Data Folder in 
Medidata Rave within [ADDRESS_630511] be faxed to the FDA (800 -332-0178)  in the same 
timeframe.

21 5.2.4  Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Many factors determine  the reporting requirements of each individual 
protocol, and which events are reportable in an expeditious manner, 
including:   
 the phase (0, 1, 2, or 3) of the trial  
 whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial 
agent or both  
 the seriousness of the event  
 the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
grade  
 when the adverse event occurred (within [ADDRESS_630512] 
administration of investigational agent vs. ≥ [ADDRESS_630513] 
administration of inve stigational agent)  
 the relationship to the study treatment (attribution)  
 the expectedness of the adverse event  
Using these  factors, the instructions and tables in the following 
sections have been customized for protocol E A8141  and outline the 
specific exp edited adverse event reporting requirements for study 
EA8141 .

 NCI Update Date: October 4, [ADDRESS_630539] – Solid Tumors  
Prior to patient receiving protocol surgery, response and progression will be 
evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_39699] (RECIS T) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in RECIST.  
Patients will also be evaluated ac cording to RECIST criteria in the event that 
after protocol surgery, patient's resection status is not R0 (e.g., disease is still 
present after protocol surgery). In the event that this occurs, a new baseline 
reference point will be established based on th e post -surgery scan.  
The following general principles must be followed:  
1. To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be compared. All 
baseline evaluations should be per formed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than four weeks  before registration.  
2. All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or 
calipers.  
3. The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to 
characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
6.12.[ADDRESS_630540] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as ≥ [ADDRESS_630541] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_630542] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_630543] be 
recorded in millimeters.  
NOTE:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated 
area are not considered measurable.  
Malignant  Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_630544] scan (CT 
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short  axis wi ll be measured and 
followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm 
short axis), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions , 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as 
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February  11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, 2017  
38 non-measurable. Non -measurable also includes lesions that are < [ADDRESS_630545] x -ray. 
NOTE:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically 
defined simple cysts should not be considered as 
malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -
measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions ’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions. 
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be 
identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected  on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, 
but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion  does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for 
nodal lesions) for all target lesio ns will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum 
of the diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objectiv e tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the [ADDRESS_630546] be 
used to cha racterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline 
and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed

Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February  11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, 2017  
39 Clinical L esions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm 
in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_68458] p hotography, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest X -ray 
Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, 
CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_630547] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slic e thickness. MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, 
spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image 
acquisition variables involved in MRI which gre atly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences 
used should be optimized for the evaluatio n of the type and site of 
disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up must 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the 
scope of the RECIST guidelines to p rescribe specific MRI pulse 
sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. 
Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans. Body scans should be p erformed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT 
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for 
use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and 
can be used interchangeably with conventional CT  in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET 
portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an 
investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of le sion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations 
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February  11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, [ADDRESS_630548] in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to 
determine rel apse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Cytology, Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., 
residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumor s, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor 
has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be 
a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
6.12.3  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
node s (whether target or non -target) must have reduction 
in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters  
NOTE:  For patients that have disease presence after 
protocol surgery, the new baseline reference 
point established on post -protocol surgery 
scans should be used.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February  11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, [ADDRESS_630549] a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest su m on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also cons idered progression, See Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ). 
NOTE:  For patients that have disease presence after 
protocol surgery, refer to the smallest sum post -
surgery.  
Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualif y for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study. (Note: a change of 20% or 
more that does not increase the sum of the diameters by 5 
mm or more is coded as stable disease)  
To be assigned a s tatus of stable disease, measurements 
must have met the stable disease criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.  
NOTE:  For patients that have disease presence after 
protocol surgery, stable disease can be 
assigned as a stat us if measurements met 
criteria at least once after surgery at a minimal 
interval of 8 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes 
must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short a xis) 
Non-CR/Non -PD 
Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s).  
Progressive Disease (PD)  
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
When the patient also has measurable disease, there must 
be an overall level of substan tial worsening in non -target 
disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 
“increase” in the size of one or more non -target lesions i s 
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February  11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, 2017  
42 usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status. The designation of overall progression solely on the 
basis of change in non -target disease in the face of SD or 
PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the patient only has non -measurable disease, the 
increase in overall disease burden should be comparable 
in magnitude to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in 
tumor burden from “trace” to “large”, an increase in  nodal 
disease from “localized” to “widespread”, or an increase 
sufficient to require a change in therapy.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is 
exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_147782],  and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investigator).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions constitutes Progressive 
Disease (PD).  
A growing lymph node that did not meet the criter ia for 
reporting as a measurable or non -measurable lymph node 
at baseline should only be reported as a new lesion (and 
therefore progressive disease) if it:  
a) increases in size to ≥ 15 mm in the short axis, or  
b) there is new pathological confirmation tha t it is disease 
(regardless of size).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
Prior to protocol surgery (or for those patients who do not 
receive protocol surgery), the best overall response is the 
best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence or non -protocol therapy 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The 
patient’s best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement an d confirmation 
criteria.  
After protocol surgery, if patient has presence of disease, 
the best overall response is the best response recorded 
from the surgery until disease/progression/recurrence or 
non-protocol therapy (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
surgery). The patient’s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

8.3 Gemcitabine  
8.3.1  Other Names  
2'-Deoxy -2',2'-difluorocytid ine monohydrochloride, Gemzar  
8.3.2  Classification  
Antimetabolite (nucleoside pyrimidine analogue)  Rev. 10/15  
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, 2017  
52 8.3.3  Mode of Action  
Gemcitabine exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells 
undergoing DNA synthesis (S phase) and also blocking the 
progression of cells t hrough the G1/S phase boundary. Gemcitabine 
is metabolized intracellularly by [CONTACT_25525] (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. The 
cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine is attributed to a combination of two 
actions of the diphosphate and the triphosphate nucleosides, which 
leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. First, gemcitabine diphosphate 
inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible for catalyzing 
the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphate s for 
DNA synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by [CONTACT_404137] a reduction in the concentrations of 
deoxynucleotides, including dCTP. Second, gemcitabine triphosphate 
competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the 
intracellular concentration of dCTP (by [CONTACT_14193]) 
enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA 
(self-potentiation). After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated 
into DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added t o the growing DNA 
strands. After this addition, there is inhibition of further DNA synthesis. 
DNA polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the gemcitabine 
nucleotide and repair the growing DNA strands (masked chain 
termination). In CEM T lymphoblastoid cells , gemcitabine induces 
internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, one of the characteristics of 
programmed cell death.  
8.3.4  Storage and Stability  
Unreconstituted drug vials are stored at controlled room temperature 
(15ºC to 30ºC, 59ºF to 86ºF). Reconstituted solution s hould be stored 
at controlled room temperature and used within 24 hours. Solutions of 
gemcitabine should not be refrigerated; as crystallization may occur. 
The unused portion should be discarded.  
8.3.5  Dose Specifics  
1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 -60 minutes on Days 1  and 8 of each cycle. A 
Cycle is 21 days.  
8.3.6  Preparation  
Reconstitute the 200 mg vial with 5ml and the 1 gm vial with 25 ml 
preservative free normal saline to make a solution containing 38 
mg/ml. Shake to dissolve. Gemcitabine may be further diluted with NS 
as per institutional standards.

63 9. Statistical Considerations  
9.1 Study Design/Primary Endpoint  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the complete pathologic 
response (pCR = pT0pN0) rate attained by [CONTACT_490424] -grade u pper tract urothelial 
carcinoma.  There are two treatment arms, and treatments will be assigned 
based on the measured creatinine clearance (mCrCl) at baseline.  Patients with 
mCrCl  > 50 ml/min will receive AMVAC (accelerated methotrexate, vinblastine, 
doxo rubicin and cisplatin) for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_490425], while 
patients with 30 ml/min ≤ mCrCl ≤ 50 ml/min will receive GCa (gemcitabine and 
carboplatin) for [ADDRESS_630581] comparison between the two treatment 
arms.  
The primary endpoint of this  study is pCR rates.  Based on  prior studies, a pCR 
rate of 18 % would be worthy of further study, while a  pCR rate of 4 % would not 
justify further utiliz ation of the treatment. With [ADDRESS_630582] 3  pCRs  are observed in a given 
arm.  Using this design, there is a 10 % probability of declaring a treatment worthy 
of further  study if the true pCR rate is 4 %, and a 90% probability of declaring a 
treatment worthy of further study if the true pCR rate  is 18 % by [CONTACT_2329] a one -sided 
exact binomial test.  
Per protocol patients should complete protocol therapy with nephroureterectomy 
by 60 days following chemotherapy.  However, patients who are unable to 
complete protocol therapy in this timeframe will be eva luable for response if 
surgery is within 6 months of completion of chemotherapy . Patients who undergo 
nephroureterectomy beyond 6 months of completion of chemotherapy will be 
followed for recurrence  and other endpoints  but not evaluable for pathologic 
response.  
9.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include re currence -free survival (RFS), event -free 
survival (EFS), bladder cancer -free survival, cancer -specific survival  and renal 
functional outcomes.   
RFS and bladder cancer -free survival will be evalu ated in patients deemed 
disease free after surgery.  RFS is defined as the time from the date of surgery to 
disease recurrence or death from any cause.  Patients alive without documented 
recurrence will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.  Bladder 
cancer -free survival is defined as the time from the date of surgery to the earlier 
of a return of bladder cancer or death from any cause.  Patients alive without 
documented bladder cancer will be censored at the date of last disease 
assessment.  E FS is defined as the time from registration to the earlier of 
recurrence, disease progression, new invasive primary cancer, or death from any 
cause.  T he method of Kaplan and Meier will be used to characterize  RFS, EFS 
and bladder cancer -free survival.    
ECOG -ACRIN  EA8141  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: February 11, 2019  
 NCI Update Date: October 4, 2017  
64 Cancer -specific survival is defined as the time from registration to death due to 
cancer; deaths due to other causes will be counted as competing events.  
Cancer -specific survival will be analyzed using Gray’s method and cumulative 
incidence estimates will be reported.   
Renal function outcomes and safety are also important endpoints of this study.  
The proportion of patients with renal insufficiency (CrCl < 60 ml/min) post 
chemotherapy and post nephroureterectomy  as well as the proportion of patients 
with r enal function improvement (CrCl < 60 ml/min at baseline and CrCl ≥ 60 
ml/min on study) will be reported along with e xact binomial confidence intervals .  
The distribution of changes in renal function post chemotherapy as well as post 
surgery from baseline w ill also be reported.  The analysis of renal function 
outcomes will be performed among patients who receive at least one dose of 
chemotherapy.  All patients who receive any part of the treatment will be 
monitored for toxicity, and the percent of patients w ith various toxicities will be 
tabulated.  
9.3 Accrual  
We propose to accrue 2 8 eligible pa tients per arm for a total of 56  eligible 
patie nts in this study. With about 7 % allowance for ineligibility, additional [ADDRESS_630583] to accrue 2 patients 
per month. The total  accrual will be completed in 2.5 years.  
9.4 Safety Monitoring  
Interim analyses of toxicity are performed twice yearly for all ECOG -ACRIN  
studies. Reports of these analyses are sent to the ECOG -ACRIN  Princ ipal 
Investigator or Senior Investigator at the participating institutions. Expedited 
reporting of certain adverse events is required, as described in Section 5.2.

Urothelial Carcinoma  
Study PI: [CONTACT_47310] H. Abbosh, MD, PhD, Fox Chase Cancer Center  
Statistician: Eric Ross, PhD, Fox Chase Cance r Center  
Aim:  
To define genetic correlates of stage, grade, and pathologic complete response (pCR) 
after neoadjuvant platinum -based chemotherapy (NAC) in high grade UTUCC using next 
generation sequencin g (NGS) of urinary DNA (uDNA).  
Background:  
The explosi on in the identification of new drug targets in many cancers has been fueled 
in large part by [CONTACT_490438]. However, given the difficulty of access to preoperative 
tissue and the rarity of the disease, NGS studies of UTUCC has been absent with a few 
excepti ons, thus contributing to the lack of improvements or new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_413682].  
Although accurate clinical staging is difficult in bladder cancer, the problem is 
compounded in UTUCC because of difficulty in accessing and navigating the upper 
urinary t ract. Often only small pi[INVESTIGATOR_490387] a heterogeneous tumor are 
available, making pathologic assignment of T -stage or histologic grade (and therefore 
therapy assignment) unreliable. Biopsy for the identification of high grade UTUCC is 
specific but n ot sensitive1-4. Urinary biomarkers which associate with grade or stage 
could lessen some of the diagnostic dilemmas surrounding UTUCC and provide 
predictive or prognostic biomarkers which are completely lacking in UTUCC as well as 
MIBC. For example, sever al genetic alterations are enriched only in non -muscle -invasive 
bladder cancer (NMIBC) or MIBC but not both5. These might be used to more effectively 
stage high grade T1 tumors if they genetically resemble muscle -invasive tumors. 
Enhanced clinical T -stagin g in UTUCC might thus more appropriately triage patients into 
endoscopic, extirpative, or multidisciplinary treatments. uDNA -based biomarkers would 
make for a facile, reproducible, and robust diagnostic med ium in the management of 
UTUCC.  
In preliminary stu dies in MIBC, our group has shown that uDNA can be used to identify 
mutations in key bladder cancer genes, and quantitate their presence or clearance after 
NAC. Clearance of mutations from uDNA associates with pCR, while persistence of 
mutations correlates  with persistence of disease. Our approach was recently funded by 
[CONTACT_490439] (R21CA218976). I now seek to apply the 
same approach in UTUCC patients treated in EA8141 as proposed in my recently -
funded Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network Young Investigator Award 2018. This 
approach in the future could be used to identify candidate UTUCC patients who achieve 
pCR after NAC and possibly steer them into organ preservation algorithms and avoid

80 radical nephroureterectomy. Enumeration of somatic variants in high grade/high stage 
UTUCCs such as those which are being recruited in EA8141 would also serve to help 
develop uDNA -based biomarkers to enhance clinical staging both at time of diagnosis 
(invasive vs noninvasive) and after NAC (pCR vs residual disease). Since several 
mutated genes in urothelial cancers are targetable with currently available drugs, uDNA 
might also one day be used for predictive biomarkers of response to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
I propose to perform targeted NGS of uDNA isolated  from urine specimens collected in 
the EA8141 study to define molecular correlates of T -stage and/or pCR after NAC. 
These molecular correlates might one day be used in conjunction with traditional clinical 
staging for precision medicine, precision surgery,  or organ preservatio n approaches to 
treating UTUCC.  
Therefore, I propose to perform targeted exome sequencing of uDNA from patients 
treated in the EA8141 trial for the purpose of annotation of mutations before and after 
administration of NAC. Several biom arkers may be evaluable using this type of data 
including enhanced clinical T -staging, prospective biomarkers of cisplatin response (i.e. 
‘who will respond to NAC ?’), as well as retrospective biomarkers (i.e. ‘ who responded to 
chemotherapy ?’). From a basic  research standpoint, this endeavor will provide insight 
into upper tract biology and chemoresponse. From a clinical/translational standpoint, it 
will set the stage for personalized medicine algorithms which assign targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_490388] y-conferring mutations, and for personalized surgical algorithms 
possibly including surgical avoidance in patients who are complete responders at the 
molecular level.  
Rationale:  
Layering “genetic staging” onto clinical staging at the time of diagnosis of h igh grade 
UTUCC would deepen the clinicians understanding of each patient’s disease. In the 
future, if targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_490389], uDNA would be a 
natural source of companion biomarkers.  Additionally, if patients achieve pC R after 
NAC, then there will be no residual source of tumor to shed variant DNA into the urine. 
Pre-surgical identification of these complete responders might allow for nephron -
preserving approaches to UTUCC treatment. Additionally, follow up uDNA sampling  
might be used to identify subclinical recurrence and allow for early salvage 
nephroureterectomy.  
Preliminary Data  
Method:  A panel of 50 
MIBC genes was 
selected for targeted 
NGS by [CONTACT_490440] -nominated 
drivers6 or drivers in 
other cancers that a re 
frequently mutated in 
MIBC7 (right). Mutation 
of at least one panel 
gene is present in 99% 
of TCGA MIBC tumors 
with a median of 4 
variants/tumor.

81 was chosen for sequencing library preparation because it uses single molecule tags, 
which greatly enhances the sensitivity of variant detection, well below the Taq 
polymerase error rate8, 9. This allows for highly accurate variant calling by “stacking” 
PCR -duplicates to create consensus sequences.  Variants are only called if they are 
seen in all of the family members (true PCR duplicates) which comprise a consensus 
sequence because false calls arising from Taq errors will occur in <100% of the family 
members. Single molecule tags also allow for true depth -of-sequencing by [CONTACT_490441] r of unique tags for each fragment or base. This makes variant detection highly 
accurate even at low variant allele fraction (VAF) which is expected after en doscopic 
debulking and/or NAC.  
Urine DNA (uDNA) was isolated from urine from [ADDRESS_630599] urothelial cell 
carcinoma (UTUCC) before and after AMVAC treatment on [CONTACT_490448]’s trial 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Urine 
samples from this trial were 
centrifuged, and the pellets 
were used for other studies.  
The urine supernatants (4 -8 mL 
of urine) were us ed to isolate 
uDNA.  This resulted in an 
average yield of 3.6 µg of DNA 
per sample (12 samples; range 
540 ng to 8.4 ug).  In addition, 
germline DNA was isolated 
from white blood cells. These 
three DNA sources were 
subjected to sequencing using 
the 50 -gene panel.  Median 
depth of sequencing was 775x for pre -AMVAC samples (range 80 to 1307x), 456x for 
post-AMVAC samples (range 280 -1352x), and 762x for germline (range 166 to 1023x).  
Pre-AMVAC variants in the uDNA were identified using SureCall.  These variants  were 
compared against germline to filter SNPs, sequencing errors, and rare variants that may 
be associated with clonal. hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential10. Using this 
approach, 106 variants (hereafter called mutations) were identified (median 16.5 , range 
3 to 38).  All six samples had evidence of branched evolutionary tumor growth as 
described by [CONTACT_490442]11, 12. This manifested as multiple distinct variants in the 
same gene ( KMT2C , KMT2D , ARID1A , etc), often in multiple genes.   
Mutation p ersistence 
associates with tumor 
persistence . To determine if 
mutations persisted or 
cleared after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, post -AMVAC 
sequencing libraries were 
searched using the genomic 
coordinates of the pre -
AMVAC mutations.  Under 
the same calling con ditions 
used for the previously 
described bladder cancer 
Figure 1 : uDNA and germline DNA from 6 patients was subjected to 
targeted sequencing and mutation clearance/persistence status was 
assigned to each subject as described.  Subject -level mutation 
persistence was identified in 4 of 5 nonres ponders.  Additionally, 
mutations associating with high -grade UTUCC are present in 5 of 6 
patients with high grade disease.  
Figure 2 :  Mutation 
clearance status 
was correlated with 
responder status.  In 
analysis of the 
combined cohorts, 
the biomarker is 
strongly associated 
with responder 
status (p=0.0037, 
Fisher’s exact test).

82 preliminary data (at least [ADDRESS_630600] 30 reads per site, Phred>30, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_490390]>30, strand bias<2:1), each pre -AMVAC mutation clearance or persistence status 
in the post -AMVAC urine  sample was ascribed at the mutation level.   Subject -level 
mutation clearance was assigned only if all mutations demonstrated mutation clearance.  
Persistence of even one pre -AMVAC mutation in the post -AMVAC sample assigns 
subjects to mutation persistence  status.  Mutation persistence was identified in 4 of 5 
nonresponders (Figure 1). Mutation clearance was identified in the single complete 
responder and one nonresponder.  This translates to an 80% sensitivity for identifying 
patients with residual disease , and 83.3% accuracy of the biomarker test.  In combined 
analysis of the UTUCC cohort described here and an additional 9 patients with MIBC, 
mutation persistence status translates to a 91% sensitivity for identifying patients with 
residual disease and 93% accuracy for the biomarker test. Combined cohort analysis 
shows that the biomarker strongly associates with responder status (p=0.0037, Fisher’s 
exact test; Figure 2).  Cautious optimism is being exercised because of the small cohort 
size, and additional p atients with MIBC are being studied.  
Mutations associated with high grade disease are detectable in high grade disease . 
Additional analysis was performed to determine if mutations associated with grade. All 
UTUCC in the AMVAC trial were high grade.  Mutati ons in TP53 , HRAS , ATM , CDKN1A , 
and deletion of CDKN2A  are highly specific for high grade UTUCC, whereas FGFR3  
hotspot mutations are present in both high and low grade UTUCC13, 14.  FGFR3  
mutations, however, are much more common in low grade tumors (>90%) vs high grade 
tumors (10 -15%).  Mutations in genes associated with high grade disease were identified 
in 5 of 6 AMVAC patients’ pre -AMVAC urine.  An FGFR3  hotspot mutation was identified 
in the lone patient without high -grade genetics.  This approach may t herefore also be 
useful in assigning grade to disease using urine as a diagnostic medium.  
Mutations in tissue are represented in the urine .  Twelve MIBC cases where pre -AMVAC 
urine was available underwent whole exome sequencing of the tissue.  In the tissu e, 64 
mutations in tissue (MT) were identified, and 39 of these 64 mutations (61%) were 
detected in the pre -AMVAC uDNA (MU). Additional MU were identified that were not 
called in the tissue.  Ten of the 64 MT were subclonal in the tissue; 5 of 10 subclonal  MT 
were identified in uDNA. Two MT undetected in urine had <100x coverage in uDNA deep 
sequencing. Although no whole exome sequencing has been performed on UTUCC 
samples to similarly validate the approach, we expect to find a similar diagnostic overlap 
between MT and MU when we sequence a cohort of UTUCC patients in collaboration 
with Surena Matin, MD (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston).  In addition, most 
UTUCC patients had well -known hotspot mutations in either the TERT  promoter, HRAS , 
TP53 , or FGFR3 , which suggests that some/most of the other identified variants are true 
variants.   
Experimental Plan:  
Specimens:   The following specimens from patients who consented on EA8141 to allow 
their specimens to be used for future research will be utilized for the se assessments:  
 Pre- and post -NAC urine, 4 -8 mL  
 Germline DNA isolated from EDTA whole blood or PB MCs isolated from whole 
blood.  
No samples are expected to be exhausted.  
Specimen Preparation:  At the time of analysis, DNA will be isolated from 8mL (or 4mL if  
8mL is not available) of urine and from blood cells collected from each patient.  uDNA

Sequencing:  Germline DNA and pre - and post -chemotherapy uDNA seque ncing libraries 
will be generated using the HaloPlexHS kit. Captured and pooled specimens will be 
subjected to targeted sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) which is housed within 
the Fox Chase Cancer Center Genomics Facility. [ADDRESS_630601] mutations in preliminary studies.   
Mutation  Calling:  Agilent provides variant calling software, SureCall, to detangle PCR 
duplicates which are identified using single molecule tags and call variants from 
HaloPlexHS sequencing output. Variants will be filtered out if they have <30 reads at the 
varia nt base, <3 variant reads, Phred <30, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_395867] <30, or strand bias >2:[ADDRESS_630602] a 0.01 VAF allele 87.6% of the time based on Poisson 
statistics. Similarly, 1000x -coverage will reliably detect a 0.01 VAF allele 99.7% of the 
time.  For reference, the lowest VAF was 0.02 in the preliminary specimens  excluding 
specimen #16pre, which missed two variants as the result of a technical error. Pre - and 
post-NAC sequences will be filtered against the germline to remove SNPs.   
Description of the High Grade UTUCC Genome:  With this limited but relevant panel o f 
genes, commonly mutated genes in high grade UTUCC will be identified. Some 
correlation to chemoresponse may be feasible for candidate DNA repair genes such as 
ERCC2  or ATM /FANCC /RB1.  
Evaluation of Mutation Clearance:  Patients’ specimens will be analyzed  to determine if 
mutation clearance or persistence occurred. Test negative and test positive cases will be 
separated into true responders and true non responders. Fisher’s exact test will be used 
to determine if mutation clearance/persistence identifies co mplete responders. Statistical 
analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_1345]/ACRIN statisticians supported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Abbosh.   
Sequence Validation:  PCR products spanning NGS -identified variants will be amplified 
from uDNA using specific primer pairs and Sanger sequenced  to confirm specificity of 
NGS findings for 10% of the variants. If variants are not identified, tumor tissue from 
nephroureterectomy specimens will be requested form EA8141 for confirmation of 
variants. Given that many variants identified in the prelimina ry data were found at low 
frequencies, amplicon -based NGS approaches may be necessary instead.   
Feasibility:  The sequencing approach chosen to study urine samples from patients with 
urothelial cancer of the upper tract or bladder appears to be robust in p ilot studies.  The 
main feasibility concern now becomes whether there will be adequate DNA isolated from 
the urine specimens to accomplish quality sequencing.  Several factors may impact DNA 
yield. In preliminary studies cellular debris was removed prior t o freeze -thaw and NGS. 
In contrast, EA8141 bio -specimen processing and storage protocol does not involve 
separation of cells and debris from urine supernatant. One freeze -thaw cycle is 
anticipated to lyse intact cells (both malignant and benign), thus rele asing more DNA. 
This may increase yield, but the impact on urine variant allele frequency (VAFU) may 
increase or decrease. For instance, if the intact cells are mostly normal urothelial cells or 
malignant cells, the VAFU may decrease or decrease, respectiv ely.  Also, nephrostomy 
tubes placed to treat urinary obstruction may decrease the amount of shed uDNA if urine 
from the collecting system is diverted from the bladder (where it will be voided), whereas 
stents may increase DNA yield by [CONTACT_490443]. Lastly, uDNA used in

84 generation of preliminary data was previously isolated after ‘debulking’ by [CONTACT_490444].  Pre -chemotherapy UTUCC tumors 
probably retain a greater percentage of initial tumor bulk  when compared to MIBC since 
endoscopic diagnostic or ablative procedures are probably less effective than TURBT.  
Sample size and statistical considerations:  It is anticipated that [ADDRESS_630603] 
adequate specimens for study. pCR rates for NAC in U TUCC patients is historically 12 -
33%15-18. Therefore, of the 30 patients, I anticipate 24 patients (80%) will have residual 
disease identified in their nephroureterctomy specimen (the EA8141 investigators 
expected 18% of patients to achieve pCR). Because a  clinician would want to be very 
sure that a negative 
test (no residual 
mutations detected) is 
highly reassuring that 
there is no disease 
present, the statistical 
analysis is based on the true positive rate (TPR; ie sensitivity).  These [ADDRESS_630604] (where the 
test positively identifies residual disease). The alternative hypothesis is 90% TPR, and 
there is a reasonably high power to detect a difference from the null hypothesis wi th a 
type I error o f ≤0.1. In reality, the test is likely not clinically useful if sensitivity is <70%.  
Significance:  
The proposal outlined here will provide a genetic roadmap for high -grade UTUCC and its 
potential biomarkers, which are sorely needed for a disease where stag ing and grading 
is so difficult. It will also provide the basis for further studies into the nature of 
chemosensitivity and resistance in UTUCC. Prospective identification of chemosensitive 
tumors will lead to improvements in UTUCC patients in several resp ects: new 
opportunities might be identified to shuttle putative nonresponders to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_490391]; and nephron -sparing approaches might be within reach if 
chemotherapy reliably results in pCR as detected by [CONTACT_490445]; larger  studies 
sequencing the whole exome through the urine could be undertaken to identify putative 
biomarkers of prospective response such as mutations in ERCC219 or other DNA repair 
genes20. 
Conclusion and Future Studies:  
Described here is a robust method to characterize the UTUCC genomes of patients 
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and perform correlative studies to determine if 
urine biomarkers enhance clinical staging before or after chemotherapy.  Correlations of 
mutations to long term outcomes and eval uation of predictive and prognostic alterations 
would be undertaken as follow up increases. Additionally, work will be ongoing in similar 
analyses on specimens from MIBC patients and might result in improvements to the 
technology and analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_490392] r to initiating studies on UTUCC specimens. Lastly, 
data will be made publically available after publication to serve as a resource for other 
scientists or clinicians.  Although the sample size is inadequate to establish a clinically 
useful test, this coho rt will be combined with other cohorts which have been committed 
by [CONTACT_490446].  If the accuracy of the test is confirmed, 
larger prospective studies will be sought to establish the test as an enhancement to 
clinical staging an d potentially use chemotherapy for curative intent.

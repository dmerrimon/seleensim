The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_273773] N -of-1 methods 
in a virtual research study ; to remotely  recruit and enroll  participants ; to assess the 
feasibility of using  a placebo  and to determine the feasibility of  the proposed 
methods used to collect and assess participant adherence and response to a wellness 
strategy  (in this case, melatonin for poor sleep quality) . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_273774] N -of-1 study design, or what we are terming ‘ Personalized Trials ’, 
can have widespread use in future research and clinical practice to address high public health burdens with a high heterogeneity of response .  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_273775] a  Personalized Trials  model  to evaluate 
an individual participant’s experience with a wellness strategy for  self-report ed 
poor sleep quality. Participants (N=60) will be sent a Fitbit device and [ADDRESS_334455] aining the protocol. After the end of the 14- week  trial, 
participants will receive a summary of their observed data  in a personalized report . 
Creating this type of report will help to assess the feasibility of using a N -of-1 trial 
design through user -acceptability of sleep quality and wellness -related data 
visualizations , and the ability to choose preferred intervention (if any) based on the 
data. Participants will be asked to complete a satisfaction survey (electronic or phone /video call  if they are non- responders) and participate in a  virtual interview  
(such as over Microsoft Teams or a phone call)  to inform acceptability of protocol 
requirements, study materials, and personalized reports.

We believe Personalized Trials are feasible to scale to a large randomized controlled trial, and eventually clinical practice  specifically to address frequent 
chronic complaints with the custom N -of-1 pathways we are developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Data 
collected to support our hypothesis include device adherence, survey  adherence, 
website  and social media  engagement metrics , adherence to  assigned  supplement 
during assigned week, and participant satisfaction based on qualitative interviews and surveys. Results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_248363] N -

3. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND MATERIAL/PRELIMINARY STUDIES AND SIGNIFICANCE  
• Describe and provide the results of previous work by [CONTACT_69063] , including 
animal studies, laboratory studies, pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] , pre-clinical and/or clinical studies 
involving the compound or device to be studied.  
• Include information as to why you are conducting the study and how the study differs from what  has been previously researched, including what the knowledge gaps are. 
• Describe the importance of the knowledge expected to result  
 
This project represents a pi[INVESTIGATOR_248364] -funded grant 
“Re- engineering precision therapeutics through N -of-1 trials” (Northwell IRB 19 -
0572- MRB ) which is funded to test use cases appropriate for N -of-[ADDRESS_334456] available 
evidence (e.g., results from parallel group, phase III randomized clinical trials; 
RCTs) for recommendin g therapi[INVESTIGATOR_24305] a patient. Yet, conventional, between- group 
RCTs only provide estimates of the effect of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_273776] 
‘average’ patient in those trials. Individual patients, however, often respond 
differently than the hypothetical average p atient in the phase III RCTs, and thus, 
heterogeneity of therapy response plagues clinical decisions made for an individual 
patient every day.    
 
The most scientifically rigorous  — and potentially transformative — method for 
determining optimal therapy for a patient is a single -patient (N -of-1) trial. N -of-1 
trials are multiple crossover trials, usually randomized, and often masked, 
conducted within a single patient, with data collected objectively, continuously, 
and in the real -world, for a sufficient time period to determine whether the therapy, 
compared to a placebo or other active therapy, is optimal for a particular patient. 
They also yield information on off -target actions, such as side- effects or unintended 
consequences, so that a more complex pi[INVESTIGATOR_273777]: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_334457] described Personalized Trials as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_248367]- based design 
pyramid1.  Clinicians can use these techniques to monitor and make treatment 
decisions in chronically ill patients2, of whom 25% experience adverse treatment 
effects3. Personalized Trials are speci fically designed to help patients and their 
clinicians make healthcare decisions that are informed by [CONTACT_5019]- integrity, evidence -
based information uniquely relevant to the outcomes and values important to them4. 
In a series of demonstration trials, Personalized Trials led to valuable changes in 
treatment, cessation of treatment, or confirmation of the original treatment5-8. For 
example, of 71 N -of-1 trials for patients with any chronic pain, 46 patients (65%) 
decided to change their pain medication due to trial results9. However, Personalized 
Trials are conducted infrequently in clinical practice10-12. In post -mortem 
assessments as to why Personalized Trials had yet to become commonly employed, 
proponents concluded that they were insufficiently appealing to patients or 
clinicians to justify the cost and effort needed to design and implement them10,11. 
Specifically, Personalized Trial design specifications had mostly been driven by 
[CONTACT_248390]13,14, with little input from patients.   
 
Rationale for Selecting Sleep Quality  as a Personalized Trial  
Participant report of poor sleep quality meets all of  our criteria for selection as a 
use case as outlined in our umbrella grant : it has high public health burden;  high 
heterogeneity of therapy response ; multiple, evidenced- based treatments ; and is 
high priority for a Personalized Trial approach as determined by [CONTACT_273798].  A recent study of US workers found the 
prevalence of short sleep duration to be 37.6% and poor sleep quality to be 19.2% , 
supporting the need for innovative treatments15. This instance will adapt our N -of-1 
trial platform to be able to deliver an experience comparing two dose s of 
commercially  available, non-prescription melatonin supplements to a placebo. This 
alpha -t e 8sting will enable us to expand our N -of-1 trial platform of non-
pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including C omplementary A lternative M edications  
(CAM), for future randomized trials . Of note, it is possible  that future  Personalized  
trials of over -the-counter supplements  could be conducted at the direct -to-
consumer level.  
 
Rationale for Selecting Placebo  as the Control C ase  
Without development of innovative platforms for conducting Personalized Trials, 
with within -participant randomization to eligible wellness management options, 
including when clinically appropriate, placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] , patients and clinicians cannot 
obtain the objective data they need to empi[INVESTIGATOR_273778]. Scientists may be able to use Personalized or N -of-1 trials to better 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/2022                           Page 6 of 36 
 understand the uniqueness of melatonin  responders versus non -responders. Off -
target responses (such as increased stress or decreased physical activity) could also 
be detected in this methodology, as the unique responsiveness of one patient to 
several time periods of therapy exposure will be available.  Should this pi[INVESTIGATOR_248370], scalable implementation and satisfaction 
with this methodology amongst participants, it will be a critical step in broadening 
the application and ut ilization of this methodology for future randomized trials . 
 
Rationale for Selecting Melatonin as the Intervention  
Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced by [CONTACT_10489]. It is a derivative of the 
amino acid tryptophan produced in humans and other mammals and regulates 
circadian rhythm and sleep- wake cycles.  Exogenous m elatonin supplements are 
widely used to treat insomnia and sleep disorders, as well as to adjust altered sleep 
schedules related to jet lag. Synthetic melatonin is available as a food supplement 
in various dosage forms such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]16. Because it is categorized as a dietary 
supplement , synthetic melatonin is made in factories that are not regulated by [CONTACT_1556]. Listed doses may not be controlled or accurate. The melatonin and placebo 
doses provided for this study are prepared by [CONTACT_273799], an  
NSF-GMP registered laboratory  that exceeds USP standards for supplement 
manufacturing. This laboratory has a fifty- year history of producing products for 
clinical research and was recommended to our Center by [CONTACT_273800].  
 
Doses of melatonin available over the counter  range from 0.3mg to a maximum of 
10mg , but more commonly falls within the range of 0.3mg – 3mg17. Our study has 
chosen to test two dosages : 0.5mg and 3mg vs placebo. 
 
Since melatonin has a very low side effect profile and limited evidence of 
habituation and tolerance, it is widely used among people that suffer from 
insomnia, sleep dysregulation, and sleep disorders. Various clinical trials have been 
conducted proving the efficacy of exogenous melatonin in treating sleep disorders 
regardless of the etiology16, 18 -20. A 2015 review on the safety of melatonin 
supplements indicated that only mild side effects were reported in various short -
term studies that involved adults, surgical patients, and critically ill patients. Some 
of the mild side effects that were reported in the studies  included headache, 
dizziness, nausea and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]21.

meetings.   
 
 
 
6.  RECRUITMENT METHODS  
• Describe the source of potential subjects  
• Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects  
• Describe any materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  A copy of any 
advertisements (flyers, radio scripts, etc.) should be submitted along with the 
protocol.  
• If monetary compensation is to be offered, this should be indicated in the protocol  
 
Since the pro posed study will take place virtually, potential participants are not 
required to reside within travelling distance of Northwell Health . Therefore, the 
exclusion criteria do not preclude those living outside of [LOCATION_001] state from passing screening., but only individuals who reside in states for which the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) has provided approval will be cleared for participation if eligible.  Individuals who do not live in a cleared state will have 
their enrollment workflow paused and may be removed from the waitlist if their state is cleared in the future.   
 Potential participants will be recruited via the following avenues:  
- Paid and unpaid social media advertisements targeted to individuals who meet study eligibility demographics and identify as having poor sleep quality.  
- E-mail advertisement through employee and student communication 
channels, both including and outside of Northwell Health and Hofstra University. 
- E-mail advertisement through existing email lists from those who have 
previously expressed interest in participation in a Personalized Trial  or 
who have screen failed for other Institute -led research, but who have 
been informed their data will be retained for future research . 
- Online research listings, such as the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research clinical trials listing ( https://www.northwell.edu/clinical- trials ) 
and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)  
- Flyers, shared at urgent care/walk -in and physician clinics, within and 
outside of the Northwell Health network.  
- Short promotional videos shared online or in clinic waiting rooms. 
- Recruitment posts within online wellness groups, such as those that discuss recurring poor sleep quality

7.  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  
• Describe the characteristics of the subject population, including their anticipated number, age, ranges, sex, ethnic background, and health status. Identify the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of any subpopulation.  
• Explain the rationale for the involvement of special classes of subjects, such as fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners or other institutionalized individuals, or others who are likely to be vulnerable.   You cannot include these populations in your research, unless you indicate such in the protocol  
• Similarly, detail exclusionary criteria: age limits, special populations (minors, pregnant women, decisionally impaired), use of concomitant medications, subjects with other diseases, severity of illness, etc.  
 
Up to 60 participants will be randomized to receive this pi[INVESTIGATOR_182239]. We 
estimate about 70% will identify as female and 30% will identify as  male. We aim 
to recruit a diverse pool of participants with varied ethnic and racial backgrounds.

• Describe the duration of an individuals participation in the study  
• Describe the duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects  
• The estimated date of study completion  
 
The study will take place over the course of [ADDRESS_334464] two weeks will be 
a baseline period, where no supplement is assigned, but data are collected , 
including self -report  of sleep quality and duration and accelerometer -derived  sleep 
and activity data . After successful completion of the baseline period, participants 
will be randomized to six  2-week intervention blocks of a 3mg dose melatonin, a 
0.5mg dose melatonin, and a placebo. At the end of the 14 weeks, a report 
containing the individual’s  observed data will be prepared for  each participant  and 
electronically sent to them along with a satisfaction survey (electronic , or phone if 
they are non -responders) . Creating this type of participant report will help to assess 
the feasibility of using a N -of-1 trial design through user -acceptability of sleep 
quality  and wellness -related data visualizations and the ability to choose preferred 
intervention (if any) based on the data. This report will be sent within 3 months of study completion. A $[ADDRESS_334465]  (ClinCard) will be sent to each participant as

HIPAA Authorization form before completing an initial screening survey process . 
The HIPAA Authorization will be electronically signed via the N1Thrive by 4Peacocks platform.  The initial screening process includes identifying symptoms 
on the validated Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ) , as well as questions 
pertaining to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consenting coordinators will review 
these data and determine whether or not  a potential participant is eligible to 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_334468] over the course of 2 weeks. Potential participants will not receive any melatonin or placebo 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_273782], and they will be asked to refrain from taking any 
melatonin on their own. Participants will be instructed to continue treating their sleep quality issues  as they normally would. 
 At three randomized times each day during waking hours  (identified by [CONTACT_273801]) , baseline participants will 
receive a text message asking them to rate their pain, fatigue,  concentration, 
confidence, mood, and stress levels at that exact moment.  Each morning, baseline 
participants will receive a survey asking a few questions about their sleep quality the previous night  using a modified version of the Consensus Sleep Diary, as well 
as factors that may have contributed to any sleep issues . At the end of the baseline 
period on Sunday evening, baseline participants will receive a slightly longer survey that includes the Insomnia Severity Index.  
 During the baseline period, potential participants will be asked to wear their Fitbit all day and night, even while they are sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Participants will be asked to download the Fitbit app to their smart phone. Baseline participants will be instructed to sync their Fitbit device by [CONTACT_273802] .  
 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_334469] 80% adherence of Fitbit wear and survey submission during the first 10 days of the baseline period will  be given until day 14 of the trial to obtain 80% adherence. 
Those who still do not meet 80% adherence by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_334470] 80% adherence during the baseline period  will be randomized to one of two intervention sequences in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Participants who are randomized to receive intervention sequences will receive confirmation including their protocol timeline. Participants will also receive a second mailed kit including medication adher ence devices containing pi[INVESTIGATOR_156930] a 
3mg dose melatonin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_156930]  a 0.5mg dose melatonin, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_156930] a  placebo . 
Participants will not know when they are taking 3 mg melatonin, 0.5 mg melatonin or placebo (single blinded).  Enrollment will continue until up to [ADDRESS_334471] been randomized overall, with 30 participants randomized to receive ABCCBA and 30 participants randomized to receive CBAABC.  
 Each intervention sequence is made up of 6 2 -week periods assigning either 3mg 
dose melatonin, 0.5mg dose melatonin, or placebo . Participants will not be aware 
of which pi[INVESTIGATOR_273783]. Instead, they will receive a text notification each night asking them to take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_273784] a designated container (A, B, or C) [ADDRESS_334472]. 
Throughout each intervention sequence, participants will be asked to refrain from taking additional melatonin on their own.   Melatonin and placebo supplements will be stored at the study team office  from 
delivery  until time of dispensation to participants upon their randomization into the 
intervention period. The supplements will be handled only by [CONTACT_273803]. Records of the batch numbers of supplements 
provided to each participant will be maintained.  
 During all intervention weeks (12 weeks total), participants will be asked to continue wearing their Fitbit device each day and night. They will continue to receive 3 randomized text message surveys  each day with questions about their 
pain, fatigue, concentration, confidence, mood, and stress at that current moment, as well as a morning text asking them to report on their sleep quality the previous 
night , using a modified Consensus Sleep Diary. Morning surveys during the 
intervention weeks will also include questions about any melatonin or placebo-
related side- effects the participant is experiencing.  At the end of each intervention 
period on Sunday evening (every two weeks), participants will receive a slightly 
longer survey that includes the Insomnia Severity Index. A study phone number

 Participants may receive additional text messages to those outlined above with important reminders about their protocol (e.g., transition to a new intervention period), or to remind participants to sync their data  or charge their devices . We will 
send a maximum of 5 text message surveys  per day during the study, as well as  text 
messages of  these reminders and other important study communications .   
 In the event of an unanticipated circumstance that temporarily prevents a participant from completing study activities (illness, injury, death in the family, etc.), the participant will have the option of pausing their study to resume once their circumstance has been positively resolved.  Participants will complete remote data monitoring after they have gone through one baseline period (two weeks), two 3mg dose melatonin intervention periods  (two 
weeks each), two 0.5mg dose melatonin intervention periods  (two weeks each), and 
two placebo periods (two weeks each), or 14 weeks total. Alternatively, a participant may choose to withdraw from the study, or be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_5051]. Upon completion of data monitoring, participants will be given instructions on how to un- link their Fitbit from the study account. Melatonin 
or placebo adherence tracking will be  suspended, as will daily text messages and 
survey prompts.    We will compi[INVESTIGATOR_248374] -reported data from questionnaires , side effects, pain, 
fatigue, concentration, confidence, mood, and stress  assessments, as well as

intensity)  and sleep (duration, estimated sleep stages) for each individual 
participant. Melatonin or placebo adherence will be tracked via a study dashboard connected to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_273786]. No identifying inform ation associated with participants  will be provided to 
Nomi, the medication adherence device company, or included on the adherence report provided by [CONTACT_273805]. We will analyze this data and create a summary report of the participant’s observed data  over the study period, in relation to the 3mg 
melatonin, 0.5mg melatonin, and placebo intervention periods .  
 The participant will be sent this report in a secure text through the N1Thrive platform  by [CONTACT_29452]. Participants will also be sent links to several online 
videos explaining the terms and data visualizations available in their summary report. The se videos will be general to the template report and will not contain any 
individual results or health information. Participants will be sent a satisfaction survey after receiving  their individual report. Study participation will end upon 
completion of the satisfaction survey.

12.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
• Describe how your data will be used to test the hypotheses.  
• State clearly what variables will be tested and what statistical tests will be used.  
• Include sample size calculations.  
• If this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], state which variables will be examined for hypothesis 
generation in later studies.  
 
The sample size of [ADDRESS_334475] a sufficient number of  
patients to obtain a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of personalized trials of sleep quality with melatonin  compared to a placebo . The numbers of sleep 
quality reports, questionnaires, and intervention  repetitions per trial were based on 
expert recommendations by a statistician and estimations about maximal duration 
of the trial to maintain patient engagement. With n=60 randomized participants, 
expecting a trial completion rate of 70%, we anticipate SUS data are available in

 about n =[ADDRESS_334476] error no greater than 8% in 
estimating the rate of SUS ≥ 8522. The standard error will be the largest when the 
trial completion rate is at 50% . Data will be reported transparently so that 
individual level heterogeneity can be assessed23. 
 Participants will be randomized into one of two different intervention orders, ABCCBA or CBAABC, where A=3mg dose melatonin, B=.5mg dose melatonin, and C=placebo. Although participants will be aware of their randomization order 
(i.e. ‘A’ weeks, ‘B’ weeks, and ‘C’ weeks), they will be blinded to each letter’s corresponding supplement or placebo until their participant summary report. Two intervention orders were chosen to test out the feasibility of carrying out a virtual, N-of-[ADDRESS_334477] participant acceptability 
with back -to-back single -blinded placebo  intervention (i.e. , no intervention) 
extending through [ADDRESS_334478] participant acceptability with starting a Personalized Trial with a single -blinded placebo  after a baseline run -in (i.e., no intervention for 
the first 4 weeks). Intervention order was not included as a factor in the statistical 
analysis because this is an  acceptability and feasibility study.   
 The randomization schedule will be set up by a member of the  Institute of Health System Science data team and provided to the data analyst assigned to Personalized Trials to Improve Sleep Quality . Randomization will occur with a fixed seed value 
for the purposes of repeatability and auditability, and the list of 60 participants will be split into two groups of 30 using a random shuffle function that  takes that seed 
as in input. The order in which an individual becomes eligible for one of these 60 randomiza tions will determine the placement given (i.e.  the first person eligible 
will be randomized to the intervention order given to participant  1, and continue 
sequentially). Eligibility is obtained by a participant maintaining at least 80% adherence of survey response, Fitbit wear ≥ 12 hours a day 80% of days , and 80% 
sleep data ≥ [ADDRESS_334479]

The primary outcome measure will be a mean usability score, obtained using the 
System Usability Scale (SUS), a validated 10 -item questionnaire originally 
developed by [CONTACT_248398] 1986 that asks users to score each item on a Likert 
scale from Strongly Disagree ( rating of 1) to Strongly Agree ( rating of 5).  The 
SUS will be presented to the participant as addressing the ease of use, complexity, 
consistency of the Personalized Trials  system as a whole, from  recruitment to 
receipt of the report.  Individual re sults are calculated to arrive at a composite 
measure out of 100. Participant SUS scores will be averaged together. Higher 
scored values correlate to a more usable system,  and therefore a better outcome.

Version Date: 09/12/2022                           Page 22 of 36 
 A specific data and safety monitoring plan is only required for greater than minimal risk research.  For guidance on creating this plan, please see the  Guidance Document  on the 
HRPP website . 
 Part I – this part should be completed for all studies that require a DSMP.   Part II – This part should be completed when your study needs a Data and Safety Monitoring Board or Committee  (DSMB/C ) as part of your Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan.   
 
Part I:  Elements of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
•  Indicate who will perform the data and safety monitoring for this study.   
• Justify your choice of monitor, in terms of assessed risk to the research subject’ s 
health and well being.  In studies where the monitor is independent of the study staff , 
indicate the individual’ s credentials, relationship to the PI, and rationale for selection 
• List the specific items that will be monitored for safety (e.g. adverse events, protocol compliance, etc)  
• Indicate the frequency at which accumulated safety and data information (items listed 
in # above) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_2037] (s) or the DSMB/C.   
• Where applicable, describe rules which will guide interruption or alteration of the study design.   
• Where applicable, indicate dose selection procedures that will be used to minimize 
toxicity.  
• Should a temporary or permanent suspension of your study occur, in addition to the 
IRB, indicate to whom will you report the occurrence.

16. WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
• Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the 
research without their consent  
• Describe procedures for orderly termination 
• Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, 
including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection.    
Circumstances under which participants may be withdrawn from the research 
without their consent include failure to maintain protocol adherence,  ,self-reported

 adverse side effects to two or more interventions , significant cell phone carrier 
issues that prevent the participant from receiving study text messages, it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_273794]. We will not withdraw a participant based on non -adherence to wearing their Fitbit , 
taking their supplement, or completing daily surveys, as this absence of data is useful for feasibility purposes. Because of this, lack of adherence to Fitbit wear , 
taking the supplements, or completion of daily surveys are not considered protocol deviations. 
 A potential participant will not be randomized to receive the intervention protocol until he/she has demonstrated at least 80% adherence to continuous Fitbit monitoring (activity recorded > 12 hours/day, and recorded sleep activity ) and 
response to survey questionnaires during the baseline period.  
  Potential participants will be notified of the possibility of being removed from the study before intervention randomization due to adherence issues in the informed consent. Participants who fail to maintain minimum adherence during baseline will be notified by [CONTACT_273808] [ADDRESS_334483] their continued study eligibility. Once a protocol deviation has been repeated, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_248384]’s continued eligibility in the study, with consultation of the DSMB if needed. If it is determined that the participant will be withdrawn from the study, the participant will be notified of their withdrawal from the study by [CONTACT_273809]. The participant will stop receiving notifications and survey 
prompts and will be sent instructions to un- link their Fitbit device.  The participant 
will be able to keep their Fitbit device.  The participant will be asked to return their 
[ADDRESS_334484] office, or to email [EMAIL_5361], an e -mail account 
monitored by [CONTACT_1744] -approved members of the research team . Participants will be 
contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the research team confirming their study withdrawal, and to answer any questions the  participant  may have. The participant will stop 
receiving notification and survey prompts and will be sent instructions to un- link 
their Fitbit device. They will be able to keep their Fitbit device. Data collection will 
stop the business day the letter  or e-mail is received. All data up until the receipt 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239

 date of the letter or e-mail will be included in the research study. The participant 
will be asked to return their 3 Nomi pi[INVESTIGATOR_182586], the Nomi charger, and any unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_273795], as they would at regular study end. 
 Partial withdrawal, defined as study participation and data collection without the use of one of the melatonin/placebo supplements  will be allowed if a participant 
experiences an adverse event to one of the intervention  options ( 3mg dose 
melatonin, 0.5mg dose melatonin, or placebo). In instances where participants  
contact [CONTACT_273810]-report serious side -effects or otherwise contact [CONTACT_273811] -reported side effects, participants will 
be permitted to continue their involvement in the study, should they be interested. Participant data will continue to be collected and monitored, while removing the self-reported adverse intervention option from their randomized protocol (i.e. skip 
the intervention days and continue with placebo and/or other intervention). T his 
will allow the participant to still evaluate their individual response to the self -
reported non- aggravating intervention option. In the event that both intervention 
options create self -reported adverse events for the participant, they will be 
withdrawn from the study. 
 
Participants who are deemed ineligible and removed from the study during the intervention period (but not the baseline period) and participants who are withdrawn from the study will still be asked to complete the end -of-study 
satisfaction survey and follow -up interview. These participants will not receive a 
personalized participant report, and therefore the questions asked in the satisfaction survey and follow -up interview will be abbreviated (will not include the approved 
questions about the participant re port asked of other participants).  
  
17. RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
• Describe any potential risks and discomforts to the subject (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess their likelihood and seriousness and whether side effects are reversible. Where appropriate, describe alternative treatments and proce dures that might be advantageous to the subjects.  
• Include risks to others , like sexual partners (if appropriate)  
• Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits and in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may re asonably be expected 
to results  
• Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks, 
including risks to confidentiality, and assess their likely effectiveness.   
 
This study poses no greater than minimal risk to subjects.  Monitoring for adverse 
side-effects will be performed during the N -of-1 trial. Subjects will be encouraged 
to adhere to the supplement  protocol, but  will also be told that they can discontinue 
intervention at any time.   
 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_334485] nor operate heavy machinery within 5 hours of taking their nightly 
supplement. Participants will only be advised to take melatonin one hour before their bedtime.  Study participants document side effects daily and may withdraw from the study at any time without consequence should these side effects be viewed as bothersome.  
 
There is also the potential risk of loss of privacy of information pertaining to 
research material collected by [CONTACT_1758]. Yet, we will take precautions, described 
below, to minimize these risks.   
 Melatonin A dverse Events  
As per the manufacturer’s recommendations, individuals  who are pregnant or 
lactating , or taking MAO inhibitors or corticosteroids will be screened out, as well 
as those with depression, seasonal affective disorder, schizophrenia, autoimmune disease,  and asthma  to avoid contraindications . Potential participants with these 
conditions will screen out of the study.   We will emphasize to subjects  in the intervention arm that they can stop taking 
supplements or withdraw from the N -of-[ADDRESS_334486] once a year. An y serious 
adverse effects will also be reported to the IRB.   
 Surveys  
Should a participant report emotional distress in responding to survey questions, the research coordinators will refer to our Principal  Investigator  (a licensed  clinical 
psychologist), who will recommend follow -up. 
 Fitbit 
There is no additional risk with using a Fitbit activity monitor for research as compared to using the device as a consumer, including mild skin irritation (i.e. contact [CONTACT_8748]) which occurs among a small proportion of users. Participants 
will be instr ucted via the consent form on methods to reduce irritation (e.g. keep 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239

 the band clean and dry) and that they can remove the band for a short period of 
time.  
 Loss of Confidentiality or Privacy  
All subjects will be informed that their responses are confidential and that they may refuse to participate in the project or withdraw at any time without explanation, and that such action will not affect their future interactions with their health care 
providers, employment, educational studies, or the  research  study. The risk of loss 
of confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_273812] a 
Northwell -approved database  and minimizing the use of PHI. To ensure 
confidentiality, all data  containing personal identifiers, and used to track contact 
[CONTACT_98995], will be kept in a secure, password- protected, encrypted  Northwell -
approved database. No paper documents with personal identifiers will be kept. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_273796]. All data will be obtained specifically for research purposes.  
 
  
Personal or identifiable information is not stored on any of the devices  used in this 
study. No information about the participants or the participants’ health history will be shared with Nomi or Fitbit, except for the information the participants directly share themselves should they choose to use the device for personal use at the conclusion of the study. There is no additional risk with us ing Nomi  or Fitbit as 
part of this research study as compared to using the device as a consumer.  
 
 
  18. RESEARCH RELATED HARM/INJURY  
• Describe the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might need as a result of anticipated problems that may be known to be associated with the research.  
• If the research is greater than minimal risk, explain any medical treatments that are available if research -related injury occurs, who will provide it, what will be provided, 
and who will pay for it.   
 
Research -related injuries are not expected for this no greater than minimal risk 
project.  
 
 19. POTENTIAL BENEFIT TO SUBJECTS  
 
• Explain what benefits might be derived from participation in the study, noting in particular the benefit over standard treatment (e.g. a once -a-day administration 
instead of four times a day, an oral formulation over an IV administration).  
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/2022                           Page 27 of 36 
 • Also state if there are no known benefits to subjects, but detail the value of knowledge to be gained  
Although not a primary endpoint, participants randomized to the intervention  may 
receive an indirect benefit , i.e., they may gain a better understanding of how  
melatonin  personally affects them or could possibly see a positive effect on their 
sleep disturbance symptoms.  This may result in their being more satisfied with their sleep quality wellness regimen and in achieving reduced sleep disturbance symptoms. Through pooling N -of-1 trial data, a greater understanding of the 
effectiveness of melatonin will a rise. Through comparing N -of-1 interventions with 
usual care (during the  baseline run -in and placebo periods ), participation by [CONTACT_273813] N -of-[ADDRESS_334487] PRIVACY INTERESTS OF SUBJECTS  
 
• Describe the methods used to identify potential research subjects, obtain consent and gather information about subjects to ensure that their privacy is not invaded.  
• In addition consider privacy protections that may be needed due to communications 
with subjects (such as phone messages or mail).   
 
Names and email addresses from potential study participants will not be collected 
until they have read through web information explaining the research study and 
protocol and indicated their interest in the study. This information will be stored in 
a Northwell -approved database drive to store PHI, and it will only be accessible to 
research staff listed on the approved IRB protocol. Names or other identifying information will not be shared with those outside the research team, except as indicated in the “Data Management and Confid entiality” section above for the 
purposes of sending research communications. Phone numbers and email will only be used for study- related communications, and employees will be  contact[CONTACT_273814].

Consent and written authorization will be obtained electronically  via the 
N1Thrive by 4Peacocks platform , with a copy of the electronically signed form 
sent to the participants with their study instructions and devices. Before being 
sent a copy of the consent form, potential participants will be sent through a 
series of web pages that summarize the study, as well as collect pre -screen ing 
information  with written authorization .

In the state of NY, any participants under the age of 18 are considered children.  If your study involves children, additional information should be provided to describe:  
• How parental permission will be obtained  
• From how many parents will parental permission be obtained 
• Whether permission will be obtained from individuals other than parents, and if 
so, who will be allowed to provide permission.  The process used to determine 
these individual’s authority to consent for the child should be provided  
• Whether or not assent will be obtained from the child 
• How will assent be documented  
• Whether child subjects may be expected to attain legal age to consent to the procedures for research prior to the completion of their participation in the research.  If so, describe the process that will be used to obtain their legal consent to continue participation in the study.  Indicate what will occur if consent is not obtained from the now -adult subjects.

o Describe whether assent will be documented and the process to document assent  
o Indicate if the subject could regain capacity and at what point you would obtain their consent for continued participation in the study  
 
N/A 
 
 
If the study will enroll non -English speaking subjects:  
• Indicate what language(s) other than English are understood by [CONTACT_84992]  
• Indicate whether or not consent forms will be translated into a language other 
than English  
• Describe the process to ensure that the oral and written information provided to those subjects will be in that language  
• If non- English speaking subjects will be excluded, provide a justification for 
doing so  
Our goal for this research is to test virtual research delivery capabilities for 
the digital health technology used for this specific use case.  While there may be some personal benefit derived, the study is not designed to seek out or document any specifi c benefit, and our primary outcome measure is 
devoid of such calculation.  We are focused on soliciting feedback from participants on the ease of platform use, if the research delivery was satisfactory, if the participant report was deemed useful, etc.  In  the future, 
it will be especially important to obtain this feedback from individuals who are non -English speaking, and the intention once we document minimum 
use requirements, acceptability, and proof of greater effectiveness over traditional research met hods through our project’s forthcoming RCT, is to 
seek funding so that we can work with N -1 Thrive to build virtual delivery 
capabilities that are fit- for-purpose in research involving individuals who 
are non -native English speakers. Having a platform capa ble of accurately 
displaying research requirements and study related material is especially important for speakers whose language involves characters that may not be easily displayed electronically or may introduce formatting errors.  We aim 
to be transpar ent that further research is needed to assess feasibility in the 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239  
Version Date: 09/12/[ADDRESS_334489] the platform scaled to larger 
clinical trials  designed to  assess safety and/or efficacy of the given 
interventions (e.g. melatonin).  Injustice has no place in research with human subjects and undermines public trust in science, thus we are comm itted to enrolling a racially and ethnically diverse population in this 
protocol and for all research conducted by [CONTACT_273815]. Towards that commitment, we anticipate that many participants interested in this current research pr oject will represent racial and ethnic 
minority groups, and we intend to advertise the research without restriction.    
Race and ethnicity (not just English proficiency) are strongly correlated with access to care, environmental exposures, income, employme nt, and 
other social determinants of health, which, by [CONTACT_108], affect health outcomes.  We will collect information on all of these factors to help inform virtual research delivery and do not believe that focusing on native English speaking participant s in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] -  those that may be from ethnically 
and racially diverse populations -   will confirm pre -existing bias or will 
later negatively impact equitable access, participant comprehensibility or research  design applicability to  the diverse populations that may be solicited 
for participation in  future clinical trials run under an N -of-1 design.    We 
would be happy to further discuss considerations for equality in research and ways we as researchers and ethics professionals can address bias and 
structural injustices.   
 
 
24.  WAIVER OR ALTERATION OF THE CONSENT PROCESS         N/A          
 
Complete this section if you are seeking an alteration or complete waiver of the consent   process.  
• Describe the possible risks of harm to the subjects involved in this study and explain why the study involves no more than minimal risk to the subject:   
• Explain why the waiver/ alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects  
• Explain why it is impracticable to conduct this research if informed consent is required   
• Explain why it is not possible to conduct this r esearch without using the 
information or biospecimens in an identifiable form  
• If appropriate, explain how the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.   If not appropriate to do so, explain why.  
 
Since the consent process will be remote and self -directed, it is not practicable  or 
feasible for the investigator  to sign the consent form in  N1Thrive or RedCap.  As 
such, we  request  a waiver of the investigator’s  signature  [CONTACT_273817].   Individuals are encouraged to reach out to the

about tracking disclosures.  
 
 
Complete this section if you seek to obtain a partial waiver of the patient’s authorization for screening/recruitment purposes (i.e., the researcher does not have access to patient records as s/he is not part of the covered entity)  
Note: Information collected through a partial waiver for recruitment cannot be shared 
or disclosed to any other person or entity. 
• Describe how data will be collected and used:  
• Indicate why you need the PHI  (e.g.PHI is required to determine eligibility, 
identifiers are necessary to contact [CONTACT_69073], other)  
• Indicate why  the research cannot practicably be conducted without the partial waiver (e.g. no access to medical records or contact [CONTACT_69074], no treating clinician to assist in recruitment of the study population, other)  
 
 
 
26.  VULNERABLE POPULATIONS:  
 Indicate whether you will include any of these vulnerable populations. If indicated, submit the appropriate appendix to the IRB for review:

This study is not targeting  employees or students.  However, a ll employees  of the 
health system, as well as graduates  and students of Hofstra University are eligible to 
participate in the study  Northwell Health has the most diverse employee workforce in 
the state of New  York and it services a vast number of individuals from racial and 
ethnic minority groups. Hofstra University also has a significant number of students 
   
 
 
Protocol Number: 21- 0239

 who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. As such, we expect a diverse subject 
population.  
 Individuals with a supervisory relationship over an employee will not enroll any 
individual who reports to them in this study. Employee participation or non -
participation in this study will have no bearing on an individual’s position at Northwell 
Health.  
 
Similarly,  professors or supervisory staff  will not enroll individuals who report to or 
work or study under them. Student -participation or non- participation will have 
no bearing on an individual’s position at  Hofstra University or  Northwell Health.     
 
We do not intend to prevent study personnel or other employees of theInstitute of Health 
System Science who express an interest in the research from participating. However, no 
supervisory personnel will be able to enroll participants who report to them in this 
resea rch. We are not intentionally targeting minorities, but expect minorities to be part of 
those eligible for participation.  
 
 
27.  MULTI -SITE HUMAN RESEARCH (COORDINATING CENTER)  
 
If this is a multi- site study where you are the lead investigator, describe the management 
of information (e.g. results, new information, unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others, or protocol modifications) among sites to protect subjec ts.

Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_677915] more stringent surveillance of potassium levels  
Serum potassium levels of study patients will be monitored systematically throughout the 
study. In addition to the clinical laboratory tests pre -defined in the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix  A), unscheduled assessments of serum potassium levels are recom mended under 
certain situations (eg,  vomiting and/or diarrhea for  1 day) that may impact patients’ serum 
electrolyte levels or fluid balance.  
In patients with serum potassium above the normal laboratory reference range (serum 
potassium levels  5.0 mmol/L), it is advised that the Investigator should reinforce  enforce 
dietary restriction for management of elevated potassium and consider local guideline 
recommendations. For diabetes patients, in addition to dietary restrictions and clinical 
management of hy perkalemia, the investigator should also enforce adequate glycemic control. 
Table 1 below summarizes the laboratory testing for assessment of serum pot assium levels 
 5.0 mmol/L and guidelines for management of study drug, which includes continuation 
thereof, holding of study drug, and/or discontinuation of study drug. If serum potassium levels 
are < 5.0 mmol/L, no action is indicated. A serum potassium level of  5.6 mmol/L requires a 
hold of study drug and appropriate retesting and intervention as described in Table 1. A 
potassium level of  6.0 mmol/L necessitates immediate and permanent discontinuation of 
study drug.  
Because of potential issues anticipated from routine sample handling and extended 
transportation time to the central laboratory,  falsely elevated serum potassium values  
pseudohyperkal emia secondary to hemolysis may occur in centralcentrally analyzed  
laboratory  analyzed samples may be expected . For this reason, during treatment with study 
drug, all serum potassium assessments, including retests, will be performed at both local and 
central laboratories.  
In general, if the initial local and/or central laboratory test shows that a patient’s serum 
potassium level is  5.3 mmol/L, a repeat local test is required to confirm elevation of serum 
potassium levels and dictate actions to be taken as  outlined in Table 1. In the absence of 
hemolysis, the more conservative value from the central or local laboratories should be used. 
Results from the local laboratory will usually be used for the immediate decis ion process and 
for safety purposes. All samples should be screened for hemolysis to eliminate the 
possibility of pseudohyperkalemia. Results from the central laboratory will be used for 
data analysis. If a major discrepancy exists between the local and ce ntral laboratory 
values, defined as a ± 0.3 mmol/L difference between values or if hemolysis is noted in the 
specimens, repeat blood samples should be obtained to confirm eligibility or continuation 
in the study. Again, decisions to enroll or randomize a p atient should generally be based 
on the local serum potassium. However, if the central laboratory serum potassium is  4.8 
mmol/L and the local potassium test is >  4.8 mmol/L, the more conservative value may 
be used if the difference between the 2 samples is  0.3 mmol/L.[ADDRESS_677916] Serum 
potassium recheck is recommended  within 24, 48, or 72  hours, of the depending on the

concentration of either the l ocal or central laboratory sample. The repeated test must be 
conducted using . Blood samples should be obtained atraumatically, without fist clenching 
or prolonged use of a non tourniquet . Non-hemolyzed sample and blood samples sent for 
rechecks or retests  will be analyzed in both local and central laboratories. In some 
circumstances, as outlined below in Table 1, a second retest may be indicated and shoul d be 
performed within [ADDRESS_677918] to the withdrawal of study drug (if 
indicated) and application of standard of care. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_522682], serum

enforced. In addition, in diabetic patients, adequate glycemic control should be enforced. Consider use of loop diuretics as 
appropriate to manage hyperkalemia. If treatment with potassium -binding resins is required, the patient  should be permanently 
discontinued from study drug.  
Elevated serum potassium levels should be analyzed locally and centrally to rule out hemolysis. If the locally analyzed blood  
sample is missing, or the result is inconclusive, another blood sample should  be taken as soon as possible but no later than 
24 hours to confirm the value.

may be modified if necessary during the safety assessment, following withdrawal of the 
study drug to maintain blood pressure control.  
The following guidelines are based on the 2017 Guideline  for the Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults.1A hypertensive emergency is 
defined as a confirmed (based on the mean of at least 2 current consecutive protocol -required 
blood pressure readings, or otherwise obt ained blood pressure reading) severe elevation in SBP 
>180 mmHg and/or DBP >120 mmHg with neurologic and/or cardiac symptoms, or, in 
asymptomatic patients, a confirmed elevation in SBP >200  mmHg, regardless of DBP. A 
confirmed (based on the mean of at leas t 2 current consecutive protocol -required blood 
pressure readings, or otherwise obtained blood pressure reading) asymptomatic DBP of >120 
mmHg should also be managed as a hypertensive emergency, regardless of the SBP. If  SBP 
>200 mmHg or DBP >120 mmHg and  the patient is asymptomatic, the blood pressure 
measurement should be repeated approximately every 10 minutes over a 30 -minute period, 
with the patient resting in a quiet, comfortable environment to confirm the elevated blood 
pressure. 
Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate medical intervention to reduce blood pressure 
per local practice guidelines and the medical judgment of the Investigator. Reduction of blood 
pressure (not necessarily to normal ranges) are required to prevent or li mit further target organ 
damage, which can include hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, acute 
ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary 
edema, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic an eurysm, acute renal failure, and eclampsia. 
Employment of pharmacological classes that are available for the treatment of hypertensive 
emergencies should be used per local guidelines. In general, autoregulation of tissue perfusion 
is disturbed in hypertens ive emergencies; thus, continuous infusion of short -acting titratable 
antihypertensive agents is often preferred; use of oral therapy is discouraged for hypertensive 
emergencies.  
Diagnoses of hypert ensive emergency require  discontinuance of the study drug , and 
immediate treatment per local treatment guidelines. The occurrence of hypertensive 
urgency or a transient severe elevation in blood pressure may or may not require removal 
of a patient from the study drug  but should be recorded as an adverse event an d reviewed 
with the study Medical Monitor. AHA/American College of Cardiology definitions, 
clinical definitions, and treatment algorithms for hypertensive emergency, hypertensive 
urgency, or marked elevations in blood pressure appear in Appendix C . 
It should be noted that hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting with acute intracranial 
hemorrhage and acute ischemic stroke require particularly close man agement; local guidelines 
for such patients should be followed.

The population for this study will be  male and female patients 18 to 85 years of age, inclusive, 
with Stage 3B/4 CKD (defined as eGFR  15 and  44 mL/min/1.73 m2, based on the isotope 
dilution mass spectrometry traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease  equation version  4, 
according to central laboratory results at Screening ). Patients are to have  uncontrolled  
hypertension (Grade 1 to 2 systolic hypertension  – ESC/ESH) defined as : 
• Resting trough-cuff seated SBP  140 and  [ADDRESS_677939] 2 current

• Currently on  [ADDRESS_677940] as 
tolerated to recommended hypertension target doses  (such as diuretics  [except for 
potassium -sparing diureti cs], renin-angiotensin system blockers, and/or calcium channel 
blockers.  One of the antihypertensive medications  must be high ceiling  diuretic (loop or 
thiazide-like), unless there is a documented intolerance  or contraindication  to diuretic therapy . 
The doses of the antihypertensive medications should be stable without any  dose adjustment 
during the 30  days prior to randomization ; OR 
• Patients with uncontrolled  hypertension and moderate -to-severe CKD  with documented 
history of intoler ance to multiple antihypertensive  medication s on fewer than

placebo run -in period; and a mean (Visit 1 and Visit 3) eGFR  15 and  44 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION:  
This is a Phase 2 , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study to assess the 
efficacy, safety , and pharmacokinetics (PK)  of KBP-5074 in patients with moderat e-to-severe 
CKD and uncontrolled  hypertension  (Grade 1 to 2 systolic hypertension – ESC/ESH) .  
The study will enroll approximately 240 patients, randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups (80 patients in each group): KBP -5074 0.25 mg once daily (QD), KBP -5074 0.5 mg QD, 
or placebo QD. Randomization will be stratified to balance enrollment for key variables that may 
influence safety and/or efficacy evaluations, including eGFR (  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
and SBP (  160 versus < 160 mmHg ). Approximately 30% of patients enrolled in the study should 
have eGFR in the rang e of 15 to  29 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_677942] of up to a 4-week screening period, 2 -week open-label (placebo) run -in 
period, 84-day double -blind treatment period,  and a 4-week post -treatment safety follow -up 
period. 
Plasma samples for PK analysi s will be collected from all patients. A total of 4 PK samples will 
be collected from  each patient, including at Day 1 (prior to discharge), Day 14 pre-dose, Day  28 
pre-dose, and the End of Study Visit (Day 112)/Early Termination Visit. The pre-dose samples 
assume that patients will be dosed in the unit on the  days above. If patients are not dosed in the

antihypertensive medications they are receiving during the screening period and  throughout the 
duration of the study (unless they deve lop symptomatic hypotension).  The dose of diuretic may 
be adjusted based on developi[INVESTIGATOR_522679], weight gain or loss, or pulmonary congestion.  
Patients will be advised to main tain their normal diet and avoid unhealthy levels of  alcohol use or 
potassium-rich foods/drinks during the study period. No potassium supplements are permitted , 
unless clinically indicated to treat hypokalemia on an emergent basis until serum potassium values 
are within the normal range. The use of p otassium-sparing diuretics is not permitted within 
3 months prior to Screening until the end of study assessments . Intermitted or chronic use of 
potassium -binding drugs  is not permitted for 3 months prior to Screening until the end of study 
assessment s.  
After completion of the screening period and the qualifying Screening Visit, patients who meet 
all eligibility criteria (except those criteria scheduled to be assessed after the Screening Visit), will 
enter the 2 -week, open -label (placebo) run -in period. A t the end of the run -in period (Visit 3) , 
patients will be re assessed for eligibility, including persistence of  uncontrolled  hypertension and 
compliance with open -label placebo received during the run -in period and current 
antihypertensive medication. If a  patient’s compliance is <  80% or > 120%, the patient will not be 
eligible for the study, and no further visits will be performed.   
If a patient is found to be in eligible during Screening , a single  rescreening is allowed if the 
Investigator believes that t he patient’s medical condition has changed , and the patien t may be 
eligible before the re screening tests. Please note that a new patient number should be assi gned to 
any rescreened patient , and all of the procedures defined in the protocol for the Screenin g Visit 
and during the run -in period must be repeated.  
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 4/Day  1 will be randomized (stratified based on 
eGFR  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and SBP  160 versus < 160 mmHg) into the study on 
Day 1. All randomized patients will receive double -blind treatment for [ADDRESS_677946] dose of study drug.  Antihypertensive

examination findings.  
The following  serum potassium/hyperkalemia -related par ameters and renal function -related 
parameters will be collected and evaluated:  
• Incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as serum potassium  5.6 mmol/L),  incidence of severe 
hyperkalemia (defined as serum potassium  6.0 mmol/L), and incidence of patients with 
serum potassium >  5.0 mmol/L ; 
• Change in serum potassium levels from baseline to Day 84; and  
• Change in eGFR and creatinine levels > 30% throughout the study period.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all randomized pa tients who take at least 
[ADDRESS_677948] 1 dose of 
randomized study drug.  
The population -pharmacokinetic (PPK)  Population will include all randomized patients who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_677949] analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment, baseline eGFR level (  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and background  
antihypertensive medication (2  or more) as  factors, and the baseline SBP value as a covariate. The 
least-squares means, standard errors, and the 2 -tailed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each 
treatment group and for the comparison will be estimated. The t reatment difference between 
KBP-5074 doses and pla cebo will be estimated from the ANCOVA model. No mult iple 
comparison adjustment will  be used for this Phase 2 study.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT Population. Other imputation methods for 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be explo red. The supportive analysis will be carried out for the

premature dropouts and/or major protocol deviations  or violations . 
For continuous secondary efficacy variab les, the same ANCOVA model will be used as the 
primary efficacy analysis. For categorical data, logistic regression or chi -square test will be used. 
Treatment effects will be evaluated between KBP -5074 doses and placebo.  
Safety assessments will include mon itoring of adverse events, vital signs (pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and oral temperature), clinical laboratory findings, 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examination 
findings. All safety analyses will be conducted on the total patient cohort based on the Safet y 
Population.  
The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of patients with adverse events 
and clinical laboratory abnormalities. Other safety data will be summarized as appropriate.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Activities. Reports will 
be provided to the Medical Monitor for approval of the coded terms after the database is clean, 
prior to unblinding. The number and frequency of patients with treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) (ie, thos e adverse events that newly occur or worsen in severity during the study) 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. Serious adverse events  (SAEs) and 
TEAEs related to  study drug will be summarized in the same manner. A list of patients w ith SAEs 
and those who discontinue from the study due to an adverse event will be provided.  
Summary statistics by [CONTACT_522704], at all post -randomization visits, and  changes 
from baseline to the post -randomization visits for laboratory value s will be provided. Occur rence 
of significant abnormalities  in laboratory values from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. Vital signs, body weight, and physical examination findings will be summarized.  
The analysis of the PK/PD relationship wil l be explored. Population PK models will be built using 
a nonlinear mixed effects modeling technique with NONMEM software  based on the 
PPK Population . Different PK models will be attempted to fi t the PK concentration -time data . 
After the PPK modeling, a p opulation PD approach will be us ed to explore the 
concentration -effect relationships. Different PD models will be att empted to fit the 
concentration -effect data.  All PD exploration will be based on the ITT Population.  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
For this Phase [ADDRESS_677951] deviation of 
change from baseline of 15 mmHg, with 80 patients/group, the CI of the observed difference 
would not include 0. Assuming 10% to  15% dropout post randomization, 80  patients/group or a

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 32 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND INFORMATION  
High blood pressure and hypertensive kidney damage are the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in the [LOCATION_002].1 Although considerable progress has been made in the treatment of 
hypertension and prevention of progression of renal insufficiency , the development of new therapy 
remains critical. Mineralocort icoid receptor (MR), a member of the steroid receptor family, has 
been shown to have a major pathophysiological role in the progression of kidney diseases , and the 
inhibition of MR signaling considerably reduces proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD).1,2,3 
Eplerenone is a highly selective aldosterone blocker developed for the treatment of hypertension 
and heart failure. However, MR antagonism with epler enone causes a dose -dependent increase in 
serum potassium concentrations  and is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with a creatinine 
clearance of <50 mL/min. E plerenone should also be avoided in patients receiving potassium 
supplements or other potas sium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene, particularly 
in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, and microalbuminuria.[ADDRESS_677963] with an improved efficacy and a 
low potential for adverse effects  in patients with hyperte nsion and moderate -to-severe CKD could 
potentially address this public health issue  and an unmet medical need .  
KBP BioS ciences Co., Ltd. (hereafter KBP BioS ciences) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_522684] -5074, a new 
investigational non -steroidal MR antagonist (MRA) , for the treatment of hypertension and 
nephropathy , including diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy. It binds to the MR and blocks the 
binding of al dosterone, a component of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system. Aldosterone 
binds to MR in both epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (eg, kidney) and non -epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (eg, heart, blood vessels, and brain) 
tissues, and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorpt ion and possibly other 
mechanisms. Thus, MRAs have the potential to block the deleterious effects of aldosterone on the 
cardiovascular system.  
As a non-steroidal MRA, KBP -5074 has the following potential advantages:  
• KBP-[ADDRESS_677964] better efficacy in lowering blood pressure and renal protection in 
preclinical  disease m odels than th e benchmark compound eplerenone; and   
• KBP-5074 demonstrated a favorable safety profile compared to that of eplerenone ; with no 
abnormal levels of potassium, cholesterol, triglycerides , or serum creatinine during the 
long-term toxicology studie s. This suggests that KBP -5074 is potentially a safer  and more 
efficacious MRA . 
KBP-5074 is an investigational agent, and limited data regarding its clinical safety profile are 
available at this time. Because KBP -5074 has the same mechanism of action as ep lerenone, 
common adverse events associated with eplerenone may be relevant: dizziness, diarr hea, 
coughing, fatigue, and flu -like symptoms.  
A battery of pharmacology and toxicology studies including rat and dog acute toxicity studies, rat 
and dog 4 -week and 13-week repeated dose toxicity studies, genotoxicity  studies, and safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted to support the Investigational New Drug application  for 
conducting clinical trials.

program can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.[ADDRESS_677965] s to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of KBP -[ADDRESS_677966] panel (Protocol KBP5074 -1-001, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has been completed. Single 
oral doses of KBP -[ADDRESS_677967] s (a total of [ADDRESS_677968] s received 
KBP-5074). There were no drug -related adverse events reported during the study. There were no 
clinically meaningful trends noted based on safety laboratory assessments , including complete 
blood count and potassium levels, physical examinati ons, vital sign measurements, and  
electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the  study. No evidence of bon e marrow suppression was 
observed with increasing drug exposure. Specifically, no clinically meaningful trends of change 
in the complete blood counts (white blood cell, neutrophils, red blood cell, or platelets) with 
increasing drug exposure were observed.  No gender difference in  drug exposure was observed. 
The time to maximum observed concentration  under fasted cond itions varied from [ADDRESS_677969] absorption of KBP -5074 following oral administration under 
fasted conditions.  
An open-label, multiple ascending dose study  to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of 
KBP-5074 in healthy subjects with a separate panel in patients with mild -to-moderate renal 
impairment  (Protocol KBP5074 -1-002, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has been completed . Administration of 
doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg KBP -5074 once daily ( QD) for 14 days in healthy subjects  (n = 12), and 
0.5 mg and 2.5 mg QD for 56 days in mild -to-moderate CKD patients  (n = 14) with proteinuria 
was safe and well tolerated overall.  There was no apparent relationship between doses and the 
incidence or intensity of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs). Hyperkalemia was observed 
in the high dose group for both healthy volunteers and  mild-to-moderate CKD patients with 
proteinuria  (high risk of h yperkalemia). No h yperkalemia was observed in  the 0.5 mg dose group , 
other than 1 patient with a protocol inclusion violation of excessive serum potassium at baseline 
(5.1 mmol/L) and a history of acute kidney failure who had a hyperkalemia event (defined as a 
single observation of potassium >  5.6 mmol/L).  All hyperkalemia events (other than in the patient 
with the protocol violation) were resolved without treatment.  A clinically meaningful reduction of 
urine albumin -to-creatinine ratio ( UACR) was observed in both treatment groups in Part 2 of the 
study. An apparent trend for clinical ly meaningful reduction of blood pressure was also observed, 
especially for patients with elevated blood pressure and renal impairment in Part 2 of the study.  
A Phase 1, open-label study in hemodialysis (HD)  and non-HD patients  with severe CKD  to 
evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK of KBP -5074 following oral administration  
(Protocol KBP5074 -1-003, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has been completed . Administration of  a single dose 
of 0.5 mg KBP-5074 in HD patients (n  = 6) and non -HD patients (n  = 5) was safe and 
well tolerated overall. No severe TEAEs, serious adverse events ( SAEs), deaths, or study 
discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred during the study.  
A Phase 1, open -label, parti al crossover, single -dose study to evaluate the PK, dose 
proportionality, and safety/tolerability of tablet versus capsule formulations of KBP -5074 in 
healthy subjects (Protocol KBP5074 -1-004, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has been completed. The study was 
designed to eval uate the PK of a new tablet formulation versus that of the current capsule 
formulation and help determine dose selection in future studies. Twenty healthy subjects were 
allocated 4:1 to either the crossover study groups (Cohort 1, 16 subjects) or to the 0.25-mg tablet

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 34 single-dose treatment group (Cohort 2, 4 subjects). Subjects allocated to Cohort 1 were randomized 
1:1 to 0.5  mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects) or 1.0 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects). Within Cohort 1, 
subjects were further randomized to receive a single dose of KBP -5074 (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) in 
either capsule or tablet formulation in a 2 -period crossover design that was  separated by a 2 -week 
washout period and concluded with a 2 -week follow -up period. Subjects allocated to Cohort 2 
received a single d ose of 0.25 mg in tablet formulation only. Cohort 2 provided additional data for 
the evaluation of dose exposure for the tablet formulation. The bioavailability of KBP-5074 tablet 
relative to KBP -5074 capsule was sl ightly higher: approximatel y 5% to 10% hi gher in area under 
the plasma concentration versus time curve s (AUCs) and 15% to 20% higher in the maximum 
observed plasma concentration ( Cmax). Dose proportionality of KBP -5074 tablet in the range of 
0.25 mg to 1.0 mg was demonstrated based on Hummel Crit eria; dose propor tionality of KBP -5074 
tablet in the range of 0.25 mg to 1.0 mg was not demonstrated but was close to dose proportionality 
according to Smith Criteria. Administration of KBP -5074 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1.0 mg tablet 
formulations, and 0.5  mg and 1.0 mg capsule formulations was generally safe and well tolerated, 
and the incidence of TEAE s was similar among treatments.  
The current study (Protocol KBP5074 -2-001) is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , 
multi-center, Phase 2 study to asse ss the efficacy, safety, and PK of KBP -5074 0.25 mg QD and

3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, mul ti-center study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and PK of KBP-5074 in patients with moderat e-to-severe CKD and uncontrolled 
hypertension  (Grade 1 to 2 systolic hypertension – ESC/ESH) .  
The study will enroll approximately 240 patients, randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups (80 patients in each gr oup): KBP -5074 0.25 mg QD , KBP-5074 0.5 mg QD, or placebo 
QD. Randomization will be stratified to balance enrollment for key variables that may influence 
safety and/or efficacy evaluations, including eGFR (  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
SBP ( 160 versus < 160 mmHg ). Approximately 30% of patients en rolled in the study should 
have eGFR in the rang e of 15 to  29 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_677971] of  up to a 4-week screening period, 2 -week open-label (placebo) run-in 
period, 84-day double -blind treatment period,  and a 4-week post -treatment safety follow -up 
period. 
Plasma samples for P K analysis will be collected from all patients. A total of 4 PK samples will 
be collected from each patient, including at Day 1 (prior to discharg e), Day 14 pre -dose, Day  28 
pre-dose, and the End of Study Visit (Day 112)/Early Termination Visit. The pre -dose samples 
assume that patients wi ll be dosed in the unit on the  days above. If patients are not dosed in the 
unit on those days, a PK sample will be collected during each of these visits and the date and time 
of the last dose will be recorded.  
Safety will be assessed systematically, and an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) 
will perform cumulative reviews of safety data at regular intervals during the study.  
Serum potassium levels, serum creatinine, and blood pressure will be closely monitored 
throughout the study  and clinically significant changes will be r eported as adverse events of special 
interest. 
At Screening and the end of the placebo run -in period (Visit 3),  patients must have uncontrolled  
hypertension  (Grade 1 to 2 s ystolic hypertension  – ESC/ESH) , defined as resting trough-cuff 
seated SBP  140 and  [ADDRESS_677972] 2 current consecutive blood 
pressure readings in the clinic and a serum potassium  4.8 mmol/L at Screening and the end of 
the placebo run -in period (Visit 3) , and a mean (Visit 1 and Visit 3) eGFR  15 and 
 44 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_677973] dose and/or types of the 
antihypertensive medications they are receiving during the screening period and throughout the 
duration of the study (unless  they develop symptomatic hypotension).  The dose of diuretic may be 
adjusted based on  developi[INVESTIGATOR_522679], weight gain or loss, or pulmonary congestion.  
Patients will be advised to main tain their normal diet and avoid unhealthy levels of  alcohol use or 
potassium -rich foods/drinks during the study period. No potassium supplements a re permitted, 
unless clinically indicated to treat hypokalemia on an emergent basis until serum potassium values

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 37 are within the normal range. The use of potassium -sparing diuretics is  not permitted within 
3 months prior to Screening until the end of study assessments . Intermitted or chronic use of 
potassium -binding drugs is not permitted for 3 months prior to Screening until the end of study 
assessments.  
After completion of the screening period and the qualifying Screening Visit, patients who meet all 
eligibility criteria (except those criteria scheduled to be assessed after the Screening Visit), will 
enter the 2 -week, open -label (placebo) run -in period. A t the end of the run -in period (Visit 3) , 
patients will be re assessed for eligibility, including persistence of uncontrolled  hypertension and 
compliance with open -label placebo received during the run -in period and current antihypertensive 
medication. If a patient’s compliance is <  80% or > 120%, the patient will not be eligible for the 
study, and no further visits will be performed.  
If a patient is found to be ineligible during Screening , a single rescreening is allowed if the 
Investigator believes that th e patient’s condition has changed, and the patien t may be eligible 
before the re screening tests. Please note that a new patient number should be assi gned to any 
rescreened patient , and all of the procedures defined in the protocol for the Scr eening Visit a nd 
during the run -in period must be repeated.  
Patients who meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 4/Day 1  will be randomized (stratified based on 
eGFR  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and SBP  160 versus < 160 mmHg) into the study on 
Day 1. All randomized patients will receive double -blind treatment for [ADDRESS_677974] dose of study drug.  Antihypertensive 
therapy may be modified if necessary during the safety assessment, following withdraw al of the 
study drug to maintain blood pressure control.  
A subset of up to 40 patients per treatment group who agree to participate in 24 -hour ABPM and 
still meet eligibility criteria at the end of the run -in period (Visit 3) will undergo 24 -hour ABPM 
on Day -1, Day 40, and Day 82.

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 44 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment Groups  
After completion of the screening period and qualifying Screening Visit , patients who meet all 
eligibility criteria (except tho se criteria scheduled to be assessed after the Screening Visit) will 
enter a 2-week run-in period. During this time, all patients will be given open-label placebo.  
At the Day 1 Visit (scheduled within 4 ±2 days  after the end of the run -in period [Visit 3]), eligible 
patients will be randomized by  [CONTACT_185686] (IRT ) in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 
following treatment groups:  
• KBP-5074 0.25 mg QD  orally,  
• KBP-5074 0.5 mg QD  orally, or  
• Placebo QD  orally 
The duration of the double-blind treatment pe riod will be 84 days. Patients will remain on their 
stable antihypertensive medication  (ie, no change in antihypertensive medication ) throughout the 
entire study (including both the run -in and treatment periods).  The dose of diuretic may be adjusted 
based on developi[INVESTIGATOR_522679], weight gain or loss, or pulmonary congestion.  
5.2 Rationale for Dosing  
As outlined in Section 1, based on data from preclinical and clinical efficacy, safety, PK, and 
relative bioavailability studies, KBP BioSciences has determined that 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg QD are 
the appropriate dosage for a planned Phase 2b study using the KBP -5074 tablet formulation. 
Clinical data were derived from 102 study subjects who participated in 4 Phase 1 studies , which 
included healthy normal subjects  and patients with mild, moderate, a nd severe CKD , including  
patients receiving HD . Data show that study drug exposure, as expressed by [CONTACT_522707] 
(AUC, Cmax), is similar for healthy subjects and patients with mild -to-moderate CKD. Exposure is 
increased, however, in patients with se vere CKD (up to around 60% higher AUC and C max). 
Analysis of safety data from the Phase 1 studies suggests a possible correlation be tween increased 
exposure (AUC >  3000 ng*h/ml) and risk of hyperkalemia. The fragility of patients with severe 
CKD implies th at sensitivity to drug and/or increases in free drug levels could substantially 
potentiate wanted and unwanted pharmaceutical effects in this population. These effects may be 
amplified with the use of the tablet formulation of KBP -5074, which has an  approximately 
18% higher Cmax than the capsule formulation.  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Patients will be randomized to one 
of the 3 treatment groups listed in  Section 5.1. Randomization will be stratified based on the 
following values at baseline:  
• eGFR:  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 
• SBP:  160 versus < [ADDRESS_677987] of the 
study, including data management personnel, will remain blinded to treatme nt assignments.

Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_677988] of the study. Breaking of the blind should not occur except in the 
case of a medical emergency  and should occur after discussion with the Medical Monitor. In such 
a case, the Investigator may access this information by [CONTACT_522708]. If 
the blind is broken for an individual patient, the blinding should be preserved for the remainder of 
the patients throughout the duration of the study. In such a case, study personnel may be notified 
of that individual patient’s treatment assignment without jeopardizing study blinding for the 
overall study. 
If the blind is broken for a patient, the patient may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. 
This decision will be based on Investigator consultation with the Medical Monitor. All patients 
will be asked to continue study visits to the end of the study whether or not they remain on study 
drug. If a patient must temporarily discontinue study drug, th ey may or may not be able to re start 
study drug. This decision will be based on Investigator consultation with the Medical Monitor.

temperature), clinical laboratory findings, 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examination findings.  
The following serum potassium/hyperkalemia -related parameters and renal function -related 
parameters will be collected and evaluated:  
• Incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as serum potassium  5.6 mmol/L),  incidence of severe 
hyperkalemia (defined as serum potassium  6.0 mmol/L) , and incidence of patients with 
serum potassium >  5.0 mmol/L ; 
• Change in serum potassium level from baseline to Day 84; and  
• Change in eGFR and creatinine levels  > 30% throughout the study period.

this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an a bnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, co mplaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitor ed and 
documented from the time of in formed consent until study participation is complete . Patients 
should be instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator . Beginning 
with the Screening Visit, I nvestigators should make an assessment for adverse events at each visit 
and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF . 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_239636] . However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a spe cific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737] , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF . 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recor ded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present a t Screening  should not be reported as an adverse event 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( eg, ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present a t Screening  and significantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse event s. The Investigator  will exercise his or her medical and 
scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically signifi cant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring 
during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does n ot require 
reporting as an adverse event.

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 65 8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, 
ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_678005] information. For KBP-5074, the reference 
safety informatio n is included in Section 5.1.6  of the Investigator’s Brochure7 currently in force . 
The reference safety information will be reviewed yearly , and the periodicity of the review will be 
harmonized with the reporting period of the De velopment Safety Update Report.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_349988] (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study  drug 
using the categories of yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity : 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapac itating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities.  
Causality Assessment : 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, no r elation) – The time course between the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence  from study drug administration - 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
o Each repor t should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any other disease the patient may have.

o The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be 
examined  to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in 
question. 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - 
o Clinical and/or preclinical  data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 69 8.7 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Detailed procedures of sampling preparation, storage, and shipment will be described in a specific 
laboratory manual, which  will be provided to all sites. The visits at which these samples will be 
collected are shown in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A ) and the data captured will be 
forwarded to the central laboratory for evaluati on, unless otherwise specified.  See Appendix B  for 
a list of clinical laboratory analytes  to be measured .  
The Investigator should review and evaluate out of range laboratory results. Any clinically relevant 
abnormal laboratory  value sho uld be immediately re checked whenever possible, for confirmation 
before making any decision for the concerned patient. It should be documented as an adverse 
event/SAE as applicable.  
8.8 Vital Signs  
Vital signs include pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral tem perature. Vital signs will be assessed 
at the visits  indicated on the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A ). Triplicate  blood pressure 
should be taken approximately [ADDRESS_678013] 10 minutes  prior to assessment . Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured 
at the same time.  
8.9 Electrocardiograms  
A 12-lead ECG will be performed in triplicate at the visits  indicated on the Schedule  of Procedures 
(Appendix A ). Patients should be resting in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 10 minutes prior to the 
assessment. The Investigator will assess ECG data as normal, abnormal not clinically significant, 
or abnormal clinically significant. Any clinically significant abnormalities should be documented 
as an adverse event/SAE as applicable. All ECG traces will be kept as source data.  
8.10 Physical Examinations  
The Investigator or a licensed study team member, per local regul ations, will perform physical 
examinations according to the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A ). Physical examinations will 
evaluate the following body systems/organs: general appearance; dermatological; head and eyes; 
ears, nose, mouth, and throat; pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; genitourinary (optional); 
lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and neurological. If a system is not assessed, the 
Investigator or designee will note the reason in the source documents. If a n ew clinically significant 
abnormality or worsening from baseline is detected after randomization, then an adverse event 
should be reported and the patient should be considered for further clinical investigations and/or

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 70 8.12 Safety Surveillance and Management of Serum Potassium Levels  
Serum potassium levels of study patients will be monitored systematically throughout the study. 
In addition to the clinical laboratory tests pre-defined in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix  A), 
unscheduled assessments of serum potassium levels are recommende d under certain situations 
(eg, vomiting and/or diarrhea for  1 day) that may impact patients’ serum electrolyte levels or 
fluid balance.  
In patients with serum potassium above the normal laboratory reference range  (serum potassium 
levels  5.0 mmol/L), it is advised that the Investigator should reinforce dietary restriction for 
management of elevated pot assium and consider local guideline recommendations. Table 1 below 
summarizes the laboratory testing for assessment of serum potassium levels  5.0 mmol/L and 
guidelines for management of study drug, which includes continuation ther eof, holding of study 
drug, and/ or discontinuation of s tudy drug . If serum potassium levels are <  5.0 mmol/L, no action 
is indicated.  A serum potassium level of  5.6 mmol/L requires a hold of study drug  and 
appropriate retesting and intervention as described in Table 1. A potassium level of  6.0 mmol/L 
necessitates immed iate and permanent discontinuation of study drug.   
Because of potential issues anticipated from routine sample handling and extended transportation 
time to the central laboratory, pseudohyperkalemia secondary to hemolysis may occur in centrally 
analyzed la boratory samples.  For this reason, during treatment with study drug, all serum 
potassium assessments, including re tests, will be performed at both local and central laboratories.  
In general, if the initial local and/or central laboratory test shows that a patient’s serum potassium 
level is  5.3 mmol/L, a repeat local test is required to confirm elevation of serum potassium levels 
and dictate actions to be taken as outlined in Table 1. All samples should be screened for hemolysis 
to eliminate the possibility of pseudohyperkalemia . Results from the central laboratory will be 
used for data analysis. If a major discrepancy exists between the local and central laboratory 
values, defined as a ±0.3 mmol/L difference between values or if hemolysis is noted in the 
specimens, repeat blood samples should be obtained to confirm eligibility or continuation in the 
study. Again, decisions to enroll or randomize a patient should generally be based on the local 
serum potassium. However, if the central laboratory serum potassium is  4.8 mmol/L and  the 
local potassium test is >  4.8 mmol/L, the more conservative value may be used if the difference 
between the 2 samples is  0.3 mmol/L.10 
Serum pot assium recheck is recommended within 24,  48, or 72 hours , depending on the level of 
hyperkalemia, following Investigator notification of a serum potassium  5.3 mmol/L (see  
Table 1). The Investigator can perform additional serum potassium retests when clinically 
indicated for medical conditions or procedures that occur during the study. Blood samples should 
be obtained atraumatically, without fist clenching or prolonged use of a tourniquet. 
Non-hemolyzed blood samples sent for rechecks or retests will be analyzed in both local and 
central laboratories. In some circumstances, as outlined below in  Table 1, a second retest may be 
indicated and should be performed within [ADDRESS_678014] to the withdrawal 
of study drug (if indicated) and application o f standard of care. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_522682], 
serum potassium of > 5.0 mmol/L should be reported as an adverse event of special interest.  
The monitoring of serum potassium and the decision on whether or not to discontinue study drug, 
as well as other interventions , are outlined in Table 1.

9.1 Analysis Populations  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all randomized patients who take at least 
[ADDRESS_678027]  1 measurable concentration of total KBP -5074. 
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Demograph ic and Baseline Comparability  
Patient disposition and analysis population data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_522715]. Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_522716] (eg, age, sex, race, and eth nicity) and for baseline efficacy variables (such as SBP, 
serum potassium, eGFR, creatinine, DBP, and UACR). For efficacy variables, baseline will be 
defined as the Day 1 (Visit 4) measurement. If the measurement at this visit is missing, then the 
last measurement prior to the first dose of randomized study drug will be used.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study drug exposure, compliance, and concomitant t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_522693], calculated as percent of doses taken 
relative to doses scheduled to be taken, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Extent of exposure 
in days will be evaluated and summarized from the first dose date to the last dose date of 
randomized study drug. 
Concomitant medication/therapy verbatim terms will be coded using the late st version of the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. The number and percentage of patients taking new 
concomitant medications after first dose date will be summarized by [CONTACT_522717].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary efficacy analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis is  to evaluate  the change in trough-cuff seated SBP from baseline to 
Day [ADDRESS_678028] analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment, baseline eGFR level (  30 versus < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and background 
antihypertensive medication (2  or more) as factors , and the baseline SBP value as a covariate. The 
least-squares means, standard errors, and the 2 -tailed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each 
treatment group and for the comparison will be estimated. The treatment difference between

premature dropouts and/or major protocol deviations  or violations . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary efficacy analyse s 
For continuous secondary efficacy variables, the same ANCOVA model will be used as the 
primary efficacy analysis. For categorical data, logistic regression or chi -square test will be used. 
Treatment effects will be evaluated between KBP -5074 doses and placebo.  
9.2.3 Analysis of Safety  
The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of patients with adverse events 
and clinical laboratory abnormalities. Other safety data will be summarized as appropriate.  
All safety analyses will be conducted on the t otal patient cohort based on the Safety Population.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Reports will 
be provided to the Medical Monitor for approval of the coded terms after the database is clean, 
prior to u nblinding. The number and frequency of patients with TEAEs (ie, those adverse events 
that newly occur or worsen in severity during the study) will be summarized by [CONTACT_196209]. Serious adver se events and TEAEs related to  study dru g will be summarized 
in the same manner. A list of patients with SAEs and those who discontinue from the study due to 
an adverse event will be provided.  
Summary statistics by [CONTACT_522704], at all po st-randomization visits, and changes 
from baseline to the post -randomization visits for laboratory values will be provided. Occur rence 
of significant abnormalities  in laboratory values from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. Vital signs, body weight, and physical examination findings will be summarized.

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 91 APPENDIX C:   DEFINITION AND MAN AGEMENT OF HYPERTENS IVE 
CRISIS, EMERGENCY, A ND URGENCY  
Hypertensive Emergency  
The protocol definition for hypertensive emergency is consistent with that proposed by [CONTACT_941] 2017 
Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in 
Adults (see Figure 2). In this study, a hypertensive emergency is defined as a confirmed (based on 
the mean of 2 or more consecutive blood pressures readings) severe elevation in systolic blood 
pressure ( SBP) > 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP) > 120 mmHg in conjunction 
with new or progressive target organ damage (eg, Grade  III or IV, etc.), neurologic, or cardiac 
symptoms. Hypertensive emergencies require immediate attention and generally require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522695].  
Reduction of blood pressure (not necessarily to normal ranges) is required to prevent or limit 
further target organ damage, which can include, hyper tensive encephalopathy, intracranial 
hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure with 
pulmonary edema, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute renal failure, and 
eclampsia.  
Selection of  a specific agent for blood pressure reduction should be based on a patient’s clinical 
presentation and national or local clinical practice guidelines. In general, autoregulation of tissue 
perfusion is disturbed in hypertensive emergencies; thus, continuou s or intermittent infusions of 
short-acting titratable antihypertensive agents is often preferred; use of oral therapy is discouraged 
for hypertensive emergencies.  
It should be noted that hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting with acute intracra nial 
hemorrhage and acute ischemic stroke require particularly close management; local guidelines for 
such patients should be followed. Documented hypertensive emergency will require termination 
of the study drug.  
Hypertensive Urgency or Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure  
Confirmed blood pressures where SBP >  180 mmHg and/or DBP >  120 mmHg without 
neurologic, cardiac symptom, or new or progressive hypertensive target organ damage will be 
classified as a hypertensive urgency or markedly elevated blood pressur e.  
Management of a hypertensive urgency usually involves reinstitution/intensification of oral 
antihypertensive drug therapy and follow -up. Ideally, blood pressure measurements should be 
repeated approximately every [ADDRESS_678054] cli nical or laboratory evidence of acute target organ damage.

Version 4.0, 16 April 2019 92 These patients should not be considered as having a hypertensive emergency and instead are 
treated by [CONTACT_522723]. There is no indication for referral to the emergency department, immediate reduction 
in blood pressure in the emergency department, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522696].  
A documented epi[INVESTIGATOR_522697], pending 
response to drug therapy, may or may not require termination of the study drug.

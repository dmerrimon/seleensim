Abstract
Background: Infants born prematurely are at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_840453] 
(BPD). BPD is associated with death as well as long-term respi[INVESTIGATOR_871120]. Very few evidence-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871121]. Of 
these, the preferential use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) over mechanical 
ventilation (MV) is the most novel. CPAP applies a continuous distending airway pressure to lungs 
prone to collapse, while avoiding the ventilator-induced lung injury of MV known to contribute to the 
development of BPD. Sometimes, two levels of alternating pressure are applied, with higher and lower 
pressure levels alternating. This is called bi-level non-invasive support. When there is only one pressure 
level, this is the CPAP level. In bi-level support, the lower pressure level is considered the CPAP level. 
By [CONTACT_871137], CPAP helps prevent atelectasis. This improves oxygenation, in large part by 
[CONTACT_871138]/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. However, the overall beneﬁt of preferential CPAP over 
MV is modest. An explanation for this limited beneﬁt may be that most infants at highest risk for BPD 
fail CPAP and are nonetheless exposed to MV and its associated harms. Poor oxygenation is 
responsible for most CPAP failures. Strategies to improve oxygenation while on CPAP are needed to 
achieve a more substantial beneﬁt. A knowledge gap exists for a basic aspect of CPAP therapy: how 
much pressure should be used? While a greater airway distending pressure beneﬁts under-inﬂated lungs, 
excessive pressure may result in lung over-distension and risk harm. Strategies for determining a best 
CPAP level individualized to the needs of each premature infant are needed to help prevent BPD and 
are currently lacking (Figure 1).  Objectives: to evaluate the utility of a promising strategy for 
Page 9 of 20individualized CPAP level selection: identifying the lowest pressure level that minimizes V/Q 
mismatch. While traditional methods for measuring V/Q mismatch are invasive or technically 
burdensome, our team has expertise in the use of a simple, non-invasive technique: a computerized 
oxygenation model enabling bedside quantiﬁcation of V/Q mismatch on the basis of the curvilinear 
characteristics generated by [CONTACT_871139][INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO2) and peripheral oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) pairs. This technique uses data that is readily available at the infants bedside without 
a need for patient travel, additional instrumentation or blood draws, making it valuable in this 
vulnerable population. The primary speciﬁc aim of this research proposal is to measure the 
responsiveness of V/Q mismatch to a strategy of individualized CPAP level selection. In other words: 
can we detect measurable improvements in V/Q mismatch when applying a protocol for individualized 
best CPAP level selection? We hypothesize that V/Q mismatch will, on average, improve by 10% of 
baseline V/Q mismatch at the best identiﬁed CPAP level.  We will perform a phase II, single-arm 
prospective clinical trial, enrolling up to [ADDRESS_1216562] measure V/Q mismatch at baseline CPAP, set by [CONTACT_6098]. Subjects will then undergo a 
protocol of stepwise CPAP level changes, with improvements in V/Q mismatch relative to baseline 
deﬁning a positive response and guiding any additional CPAP level changes. Best CPAP will be deﬁned 
as the lowest pressure level associated with a progressive response. Our primary outcome will be the 
difference in measured V/Q mismatch between baseline and best CPAP, with a paired t-test for 
parametric results or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-parametric results testing our hypothesis that 
V/Q mismatch will improv
Objectives
Overall objectives
The objective of the proposed research is to evaluate a promising strategy for CPAP level selection: a 
physiologic approach minimizing V/Q mismatch and measured non-invasively at the infants bedside. 
We propose the following speciﬁc Aims and hypotheses in support of this objective:   Aim 1 (primary): 
measure the responsiveness of V/Q mismatch to a strategy of individualized CPAP level selection. We 
hypothesize that V/Q mismatch will, on average, improve by 10% of baseline V/Q mismatch at the best 
identiﬁed CPAP level. Aim 2: describe the distribution of best CPAP levels as identiﬁed by [CONTACT_871140]. 
Best CPAP levels will be described as both absolute values and relative to baseline (+2 cm H2O, -1 cm 
H2O, etc.). For this exploratory aim, we hypothesize that a best CPAP will be identiﬁed above the 
baseline in greater than 50% but less than 80% of subjects. Demonstrating that most but not all infants 
beneﬁt from higher pressures will highlight the importance of individualized CPAP level selection in 
premature infants.
Primary outcome variable(s)
Primary outcome measure: V/Q mismatch. This parameter will be calculated by [CONTACT_871141] a best-ﬁt curve connecting the FiO2/SpO2 pairs 
obtained during the study protocol. With lower V/Q and greater mismatch, the curve is progressively 
displaced to the right relative to a curve corresponding to an ideal reference lung (interrupted, left-most 
curve in Figure 2, see attached documents). The V/Q ratio is displayed on the software output after the 
FiO2/SpO2 pairs are input. Additionally, this parameter is also displayed as the degree of right-shift 
relative to the ideal reference lung (greater values indicate more mismatch), providing a positive 
continuous number with units of % FiO2 as an alternative measure to the ratio value with greater ease 
of use. This will be measured twice at baseline without a change in CPAP level and then following each 
CPAP level change. The primary outcome measure is the responsiveness of V/Q mismatch to a strategy 
of individualized CPAP level selection, measured as the improvement in V/Q mismatch between the 
second baseline level and best identiﬁed CPAP level for each subject (see Figure 3 in attached 
documents.) For infants not responding to either +[ADDRESS_1216563], with zero assigned as the improvement in V/Q mismatch.
Secondary outcome variable(s)
Secondary outcome: best CPAP level. Our second Aim is to describe the distribution of best CPAP 
levels as identiﬁed by [CONTACT_871140]. We hypothesize that best CPAP will vary between infants, resulting 
in a distribution of values. Best CPAP level will be identiﬁed as the lowest CPAP level associated with 
an improvement greater than 5% in V/Q mismatch relative to the preceding CPAP level, as described in 
the study protocol. This will be "measured" once at the conclusion of the study protocol. Excessive 
Page [ADDRESS_1216564] pressures can result in lung over-distension and can plausibly result in adverse cardiopulmonary 
interactions through transmission of positive pressure to the heart and intra-thoracic vessels (however, 
this has not been observed in any modern CPAP level studies performed in premature infants, see Table 
1). We will measure the impact of CPAP level changes on the following readily available clinical 
cardiovascular parameters during the study protocol: Mean arterial blood pressure will be measured 
with a neonatal blood pressure cuff used for routine clinical care and placed on an upper extremity or 
through pressure transduction of an indwelling arterial catheter, when present (uncommon in our 
subject population), with units of mm Hg. This outcome will be recorded at the end of each baseline 
and CPAP level period by [CONTACT_5051].  Heart rate will be measured and displayed by [CONTACT_871142], with units of beat per minute. This outcome will be recorded at the end of each baseline 
and CPAP level period by [CONTACT_5051].  Additional data to be collected will include: i) 
demographic data; (gestational age, birth weight, gender, race, etc.) ii) baseline variables (receipt of 
antenatal steroids, Apgar scores, age in hours and FiO2 at intervention, most recent hemoglobin level, 
CPAP pressure source and interface, etc.) and iii) important or pertinent in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871122] 
(survival to discharge, BPD, brain injury by [CONTACT_2207], patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, duration of: MV days, CPAP and supplemental oxygen, etc). 
This data will be used to explore associations between these variables and both a) baseline V/Q 
mismatch and b) the responsiveness of this parameter to CPAP level changes, with a goal of supporting 
hypothesis generation for subsequent research
Background
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease resulting from premature birth that affects 
nearly 70% of infants born 28 weeks gestational age (GA) (1). BPD and its precursor, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (RDS), are a leading cause of death in very premature infants (2). In turn, survivors 
require increased health expenditures and have adverse long-term respi[INVESTIGATOR_871123] (3-5). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_871124]ﬁcant burden of BPD on pediatric health, very few 
preventive interventions exist (6). Of these, a strategy of minimizing mechanical ventilation (MV) with 
preferential initial nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most novel (7-8). CPAP 
provides a continuous distending airway pressure, maintaining lung volumes and preventing atelectasis 
(a reduction in or collapse of the air sacs responsible for gas exchange) (9-10). This improves 
oxygenation by: a) reducing ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch (inefﬁcient matching of lung areas 
receiving fresh air for gas exchange (ventilation) with lung areas receiving blood (perfusion) for gas 
exchange) and b) intrapulmonary shunt (blood passing from the right side of the heart through the lungs 
and to the body without any gas exchange). Sometimes, two levels of alternating pressure are applied in 
this way, with the higher and lower pressure levels alternating. This is called bi-level non-invasive 
support. When there is only one pressure level, this is the CPAP level. In bi-level support, the lower 
pressure level is considered the CPAP level. CPAP helps prevent BPD by [CONTACT_871143]ﬁts while avoiding MV and subsequent ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), a key component in 
the pathogenesis of BPD. However, the beneﬁt of preferential CPAP is modest. It is estimated that 1 
death or case of BPD is averted per 25 treated infants (7-8). Consistent with this limited beneﬁt, 
46-83% of very premature infants at highest risk of BPD fail initial CPAP and nonetheless require MV 
(11-12). Oxygenation failure the result of excessive V/Q mismatch and shunt is the most frequent cause 
(12-14). An improved application of CPAP resulting in less oxygenation failure would further reduce 
death or BPD.  A critical knowledge gap exists for a basic aspect of CPAP therapy: how much pressure 
should be used? There is a lack of evidence informing this question. Multi-center trials assessing CPAP 
versus MV have used pressures as disparate as 4-[ADDRESS_1216565] not speciﬁed how these were 
determined (11, 12, 15). While higher pressures applied to under-inﬂated lungs likely improve 
oxygenation, excessive pressure may result in over-distension, increasing the risk of harms such as air 
leak syndromes (12) or adverse cardiopulmonary interactions (16). We propose evaluating a novel 
physiologic approach for individualized CPAP level selection: identiﬁcation of the lowest pressure level 
minimizing V/Q mismatch, a key contributor to poor oxygenation and CPAP failure. While traditional 
methods for measuring V/Q mismatch are invasive or technically burdensome (17-18) , our research 
team has expertise in the use of a simple, non-invasive technique: a computerized oxygenation model 
enabling bedside quantiﬁcation of V/Q mismatch (detailed within Methods) (19). In published research 
using this technique, our research team recently demonstrated a signiﬁcant association between 
gestational age and the degree of V/Q mismatch, as well as high inter-rater reliability and validity with 
this approach for predicting BPD (20-21). Identiﬁcation and application of an optimal pressure level by 
[CONTACT_24096] a reduction in V/Q mismatch may improve oxygenation, decrease CPAP failure, avoid 
injurious MV and further reduce death or BPD (see Figure 1 in attached documentation).  Table [ADDRESS_1216566] 20 years.

Phase*
Phase II
Design
Phase II, single-arm prospective clinical trial. The goal of a phase II clinical trial is to determine 
whether an intervention has a biologic effect and to monitor safety. In our proposal the intervention is a 
strategy of individualized CPAP level selection and the biologic effect is a response in V/Q mismatch. 
Please see Risk/Beneﬁt section for a complete discussion of safety considerations.
Study duration
Estimated length of time to enroll all subjects and complete the study: 10-12 months (please see Figure 
4 in attached documentation for a diagram describing expected enrollment).  Length of a subject's 
participation time in study: each subject will participate in activity study procedures for 60-[ADDRESS_1216567] trained to be hired as a clinical research 
coordinator. We will work with the clinical research support ofﬁce (CRSO) at the Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871125] a speciﬁc individual in a timely fashion upon award notiﬁcation. The 
clinical research coordinator will take assume the responsibilities of daily screening and enrollment of 
the study population, communication with and between the clinical team, research team and the IRB, 
implementation of the study interventions and data collection and management. An allotment of 
adequate time to complete the research is detailed in Figure 5 (attached documents). There are adequate 
facilities for the research. The equipment necessary for conducting the study is used in the routine 
clinical practice of the HUP ICN, PAH ICN, and the CHOP N/IICU. This equipment includes pulse 
oximeters, continuous positive airway pressure generating devices and nasal interfaces, blood pressure 
cuffs and pressure transducers and cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_225614]. All study interventions are simple 
maneuvers performed in daily clinical practice. Only the timing and sequence of their implementation 
require additional basic training. [CONTACT_871171] will lead the project implementation and training. [CONTACT_871172], [CONTACT_871173] and a respi[INVESTIGATOR_871126] a clinical research coordinator will perform 
the study interventions. Regular research meetings with all participating staff will ensure full 
understanding of the protocol and all research related duties.

Procedures
The Non-Invasive V/Q Mismatch and Shunt Technique: A non-invasive computerized technique that 
quantiﬁes V/Q mismatch and shunt has been developed and provides a unique opportunity for research 
in premature infants. The technique can be applied using oxygenation data readily available at the 
bedside without travel outside of the HUP ICN, PAH ICN, or the CHOP N/IICU, additional 
instrumentation or phlebotomy. This is particularly valuable in premature infants requiring continuous 
monitoring in a specialized hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871128] a subsequent need for blood transfusions. The technique characterizes the 
relationship between FiO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) (see Figure 2 in attached 
documentation). Step-wise changes in delivered FiO2 result in changes in SpO2 measured by [CONTACT_105]-
invasive pulse oximetry, a standard of care monitoring device. Multiple paired values of FiO2 and SpO2 
are then plotted graphically. A computer program (22) connects the pairs by [CONTACT_871147] a best-ﬁt curve. 
The primary impairments of gas exchange accounting for oxygenation failure in premature infants - V/
Q mismatch and shunt - have predictable effects on the shape of the curve relative to an ideal reference 
lung (interrupted, left-most curve in Figure 2). A progressive right shift of the curve is noted as V/Q 
mismatch worsens, while a progressive depression of the curve is noted as shunt worsens. In other 
words, the degree of V/Q mismatch is characterized by [CONTACT_871148]-shift in the position of the up-
slope of the curve, while the degree of shunt is characterized by [CONTACT_871149]. 
Avoidance of oxygen toxicity in premature infants generally limits routine clinical SpO2 targeting to a 
maximum of 95% (23). For infants without notable shunt, reliable characterization of the plateau of the 
curve, and quantitative estimation of shunt, requires targeting multiple SpO2 values in excess of 95% - 
an unjustiﬁed risk in this population. In contrast, the position of the up-slope of the curve is well 
characterized by [CONTACT_871150]2 values between 85-95%. This curvilinear characteristic thus provides a 
quantitative measure of V/Q mismatch that can be measured at the bedside, and alternatively quantiﬁed 
as the degree of right shift from the ideal reference lung curve, with units of % FiO2.  Study Protocol: 
Prior to initiation of the study protocol, the following criteria will be met to prioritize patient safety: 1. 
Page 14 of 20No active consideration of endotracheal intubation; as determined by [CONTACT_871151]. 2. 
No hemodynamic instability, deﬁned as a baseline heart rate less than 100 beats per minute (bpm) or 
greater than 180 bpm; or a mean arterial blood pressure of less than 30 millimeters of mercury (mm 
Hg). 3. No supplemental FiO2 requirement greater than 0.45. 4. No capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]/arterial partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide greater than [ADDRESS_1216571] blood gas analysis, unless performed more than 6 hours 
prior. 5. No more than 6 apnea/bradycardia/desaturation events requiring tactile stimulation or more 
than [ADDRESS_1216572]-ductal limb and used for SpO2 measurements. V/Q will ﬁrst be measured on two separate 
occasions 30 minutes apart at baseline CPAP, set by [CONTACT_6098]. The repeat baseline measures will 
allow an estimate of the stability of V/Q as a function of time (further discussed in Confounding under 
Analysis Plan). To measure V/Q mismatch, gradual changes in delivered FiO2, followed by [CONTACT_7535]2 
measurement, will be applied to obtain three FiO2/SpO2 pairs, one each for SpO2 values in the ranges 
of 85-87%, 89-91% and 93-95%. To obtain each SpO2 range, FiO2 will be titrated gradually until SpO2 
falls within the desired values. After 60 seconds of stabilization at the identiﬁed FiO2 value, SpO2 will 
be recorded every 30 seconds for 2 minutes if an adequate signal waveform is present, providing up to 
four SpO2 values. These values will be averaged to calculate the SpO2 value used for the FiO2/SpO2 
pair, acknowledging the inherent instability of pulse-oximeter values over time in premature infants. A 
computer software program will immediately calculate V/Q from the identiﬁed FiO2/SpO2 pairs at the 
bedside. Next, CPAP will be increased by +1 cm H2O. A period of 15 minutes will elapse to allow 
equilibration of lung volumes in response to the CPAP level change (24). V/Q calculations as described 
above will be repeated. A positive response will be deﬁned as an improvement in V/Q at the new 
pressure level of 5% relative to the preceding CPAP level. Responders will undergo subsequent 
stepwise +1 cm H2O increases up to +3 cm H2O from baseline or 8 cm H2O; whichever is less. Infants 
not responding to the initial +1 cm H2O increase will return to baseline CPAP for 15 minutes and then 
be assessed at -1 cm H2O from baseline. Infants responding at this lower CPAP level will undergo an 
additional decrease to -2 cm H2O from baseline or 3 cm H2O; whichever is greater. The allowed range 
of -2 to +[ADDRESS_1216573] (and last) CPAP level at which a positive response, as deﬁned above, is measured. 
The baseline CPAP level will be deﬁned as best for those infants not responding to either +1 or -1 cm 
H2O CPAP level changes, with a corresponding V/Q improvement of zero. Upon completion of the 
study protocol, infants will be returned to their baseline CPAP level. The study protocol will typi[INVESTIGATOR_871129] [ADDRESS_1216574] tolerance of the study procedures. These criteria are designed to be 
conservative safety measures and will result in study termination and provision of supportive care, as 
needed.  Patient Safety Considerations:  Extensive patient safety considerations minimizing the risks 
associated with implementation of this phase II design research protocol have been incorporated:  1. 
Many of the key eligibility (inclusions and exclusion) criteria reﬂect the deliberate selection of a 
premature infant population that is inherently less vulnerable and at lower risk of common morbidities 
of prematurity and less likely to suffer any adverse outcomes from implementation of the study 
procedures. a). I1. Corrected gestational age 27-35 weeks (GA): this selects a study population in which 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_871130], while avoiding less mature 
infants with a CGA less than 27 weeks who are more prone to physiologic instability. We exclude this 
population in consideration of safety for this phase II study despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high risk of CPAP failure and a 
potential for beneﬁt from our long-term research goals of establishing methods to prevent CPAP failure.  
b) I2. Chronologic age of greater than [ADDRESS_1216575] 24 hours of 
life when they may be more prone to physiologic instability.  c) I3. On continuous CPAP support for 
greater than [ADDRESS_1216576] to infants newly transitioned to CPAP without a period of demonstrated 
tolerance. d) I4. Supplemental oxygen requirement, with a fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO2) 0.[ADDRESS_1216577] 2 consecutive hours. This ensures that CPAP level changes are only performed in infants 
requiring supplemental oxygenation, suggesting V/Q mismatch and/or shunt from atelectasis. These 
subjects would plausibly beneﬁt from carefully monitored changes in continuous distending airway 
pressure to counteract the pathophysiology resulting in the oxygen need. This criteria avoids CPAP 
Page 15 of 20level changes in infants on CPAP but not requiring supplemental oxygen as they are less likely to 
beneﬁt from changes in pressure level.  e) E2. Exclusion of infants with current or prior air leak 
syndrome. This avoids study in infants with suggestion of a pathophysiology that could worsen with 
increased CPAP levels. 2. To further avoid study in infants with physiologic instability, the following 
criteria will be met prior to initiation of the study procedures; with deferral of the study until they are 
met:  a. No active consideration of endotracheal intubation; as determined by [CONTACT_871152].  b. No hemodynamic instability, deﬁned as a baseline heart rate less than 100 beats per minute 
(bpm) or greater than 180 bpm; or a mean arterial blood pressure of less than 30 millimeters of mercury 
(mm Hg).  c. No supplemental FiO2 requirement greater than 0.45.  d. No capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]/arterial partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide greater than [ADDRESS_1216578] blood gas analysis, unless performed more 
than 6 hours prior.  e. No more than 6 apnea/bradycardia/desaturation events requiring tactile 
stimulation or more than 1 requiring positive pressure bag ventilation in the preceding 6 hours. 3. 
Stepwise changes in CPAP level, with assessment after each CPAP level change and restriction of 
further pressure changes to instances in which there is a response suggestive of improving physiology - 
deﬁned as greater than a 5% improvement of baseline V/Q mismatch. Infants who are at inadequate 
lung volumes at baseline CPAP are likely to show beneﬁt with higher pressure levels, while infants with 
adequate lung volumes at baseline CPAP are unlikely to show any physiologic beneﬁt at higher pressure 
levels. Similarly, infants with over distended lung volumes at baseline may beneﬁt from lower pressure 
levels, while infants with adequate lung volumes at baseline CPAP are unlikely to show beneﬁt with 
lower pressure levels. This key element of study procedures will protect against the risk of over-
distension or loss of lung volumes secondary to the study procedures. 4. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]. The 
following "stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]" will be monitored in each subject throughout the study procedures and will 
result in study termination, provision of supportive care and a return to baseline settings when 
appropriate:  a) a drop in mean arterial pressure to a mmHg value less than 30 mm Hg and in excess of 
10% from the baseline value, or in excess of 20% of baseline value.  b) an increase in heart rate to 
greater than 190 bpm and in excess of 10% from the baseline value or in excess of 20% of the baseline 
value. c) with an adequate pulse waveform, a sustained drop in SpO2 to less than 80% for greater than 
one minute or a drop in SpO2, to less than 75% for greater than 30 seconds or less than 45% for any 
duration of time.  d) a two-fold increase in the hourly frequency of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (apnea/
bradycardia/desaturation) relative to the average frequency in the four hours prior to study initiation. 
For infant without any events in the four hours prior to study initiation, greater than one event per hour 
will be used as a threshold. Further, any single event requiring bag- mask positive pressure ventilation 
will lead to study termination.

Analysis Plan
Results will be summarized using basic descriptive statistics. For Aim 1, a paired t-test for parametric 
results or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-parametric results will be used to test our hypothesis that 
V/Q mismatch will improve at best CPAP level compared to baseline. For Aim 2, we will calculate the 
proportion of subjects in which best CPAP level is identiﬁed above the baseline pressure level to assess 
our hypothesis that this occurs in greater than 50% but less than 80% of subjects. Further, best CPAP 
for the cohort will be summarized as mean and standard deviation (if parametric) or median and 
interquartile range (if non-parametric). No formal statistical testing of signiﬁcance will be performed 
for this second descriptive Aim. The change in V/Q over the two baseline periods, as well as the change 
in heart rate and blood pressure between baseline and best CPAP levels will be tested using the 
statistical approach as Aim 1. We predict the null hypothesis of no signiﬁcant difference for these 
comparisons. Should a signiﬁcant change in V/Q be identiﬁed between baseline periods, we will 
perform an additional analysis comparing the change in V/Q between baseline periods to the change in 
V/Q between baseline and best CPAP level to account for the independent impact of time on V/Q 
Page 16 of 20mismatch.  Confounding: key elements of our study design limit confounding for Aim 1, to measure the 
responsiveness of V/Q mismatch to a strategy of individualized CPAP level selection. The use of a pre-
post within-patient analysis limits confounding from variation in between-patient characteristics. A 
remaining important source of confounding is the possibility that V/Q simply improves over time 
irrespective of CPAP pressure changes. We account for this by [CONTACT_35755] V/Q on two separate 
occasions 30 minutes apart at baseline CPAP in the study protocol, facilitating an assessment of the 
stability of V/Q over time.

Data conﬁdentiality
xPaper-based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved 
in the study.
xComputer-based ﬁles will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the 
use of access privileges and passwords.
xPrior to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and conﬁdentiality of identiﬁable information.
xWherever feasible, identiﬁers will be removed from study-related information.
A Certiﬁcate of Conﬁdentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at 
risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject's ﬁnancial standing, 
employability, or liability.
A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the 
subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
conﬁdentiality. (This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.)
Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because 
the research involves web-based surveys.
Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identiﬁcation of subjects.
Subject Conﬁdentiality
Several strategies will be employed to maintain conﬁdentiality of identiﬁable data and to adequately 
protect patient privacy. Use of identiﬁable private information will be limited to consent documentation 
and a study enrollment log. The study enrollment log will link the patient information to a unique 
patient study ID. This ID will be used in all other paper-based and computer-based ﬁles. Paper-based 
records will be scanned and made into PDFs following completion of each subject's protocol. 
Destruction of paper-based records will occur at the completion of the study. Only study personnel will 
have access to computer based ﬁles, which will be maintained within an institutionally secured and 
managed network drive  or an institutionally secured & managed device within the ofﬁces of the 
Division of Neonatology. The study enrollment log linking patient identiﬁable information to other data 
will be destroyed within 5 years of study completion. Data will not be shared with non-study personnel.

Consent
1. Consent Process
Overview
We will obtain informed consent from both parents unless one parent is deceased, unknown, 
incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care 
and custody of the child. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_871154] a member of the research team and the parents or legal guardians of the infant while present at 
the HUP ICN, Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871131], or the CHOP N/IICU. Written information regarding the 
nature of the study will be initially provided to the parents or guardians, as well as further information 
face-to-face. This information handout will be written in non-medical language, and will explain the 
voluntary and non-binding nature of participation in the study, the relevance of the study, the objective 
of the study, the study procedures, potential risks and that participation will not change the standard 
course of care. It will also explain the steps that will be taken to ensure privacy and conﬁdentiality. We 
will ensure that the parents or guardians are able to read and comprehend the handout. All materials will 
be written in a 8th grade reading level. As the exclusion criterion indicates, we will not enroll those who 
are not English speakers. Following sufﬁcient time for the handout to be read and comprehended, a 
member of the treatment or research team will approach the parents or guardians to obtain informed 
consent. We will ensure that the parents or guardians understands the contents of the handout and allow 
them to ask any questions or concerns, which will be fully addressed. Prior to signing the consent form, 
a member of the treatment team will summarize the central components of the study and consent 
process, and verify understanding of the consenting parties. Following obtaining of the informed 
consent, the parents or guardians will be reminded of the voluntary and non-binding nature of the 
consent and reminded that they may withdraw support at any time. The parents or guardians will be 
approached and the consent process will be performed within the physical boundaries of the HUP ICN,

Risk / Beneﬁt
Potential Study Risks
Potential study risks are limited to the physiologic risks associated with changing CPAP and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_871132]. No direct psychological, social, economic, monetary, legal, or those risks that 
result from a loss of conﬁdentiality is in any way anticipated. With respect to the physiologic risks 
associated with changing CPAP and FiO2, several study design elements minimize the risk for harm in 
this phase II study. They are extensively detailed within "Patient Safety Considerations" in the 
"Procedures" section of this application. In summary, the eligibility criteria select a population in whom 
the study objectives are relevant, but who are less vulnerable to injury than extremely premature infants. 
The principal risks associated with the study procedures are those associated with over and under-
distension of the lungs with CPAP level changes and the possibility of transient hypoxia and hyperoxia 
during FiO2 changes. The former are minimized by [CONTACT_871157]-wise changes in CPAP, ensuring 
that additional pressures are only tested when there is suggestion of improving physiology, and an 
evaluation restricted to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_871133] [ADDRESS_1216580] studied levels as low as 0 cm H2O and as high as 9 cm H2O without reported 
concerns for harm (See Table 1). The latter will be limited by [CONTACT_871158]2 
target range. Additional safety criteria to be veriﬁed immediately prior to application of the study 
interventions and comprehensive safeguards to protect against adverse events during the study 
interventions are described within "Procedures"  Further, with respect to the physiologic risks imposed 
by [CONTACT_871159]2 changes, the likelihood and seriousness of these risks are minimal for the 
following reasons: 1. The CPAP levels evaluated reﬂect those used in routine clinical practice and levels 
assessed in international trials of CPAP therapy.  2. The CPAP level changes are transient and of short 
duration; the baseline clinical CPAP level is returned to at study termination.  3. The tested SpO2 levels 
will be within 85-95%, the range consistent with acceptable target SpO2 levels in international clinical 
practice.  4. A member of the research team will remain at the bedside throughout the study procedures, 
ensuring a greater degree of oxygen titration to target saturation levels than is often possible in routine 
clinical care. 5. All prior studies (Table 1) using CPAP level changes similar to and in times in excess of 
the range proposed in this study have either not reported concerns for adverse events or reported a lack 
of signiﬁcant increase in adverse events as a result of study.
Potential Study Beneﬁts
1. Individual subject: A. We do not expect direct patient beneﬁt from the study intervention as the 
intervention is not applied with a therapeutic intent but to measure changes in physiological responses 
and all subjects included in the study may not experience/need lung re-recruitment. For infants in need 
of lung re-recruitment, the study procedure could potentially serve as a carefully monitored lung 
recruitment maneuver, guided by [CONTACT_871135] V/Q mismatch. In infants for whom the 
Page 20 of 20supplemental oxygen need required for study inclusion reﬂects atelectasis, study participation may 
recruit atelectactic lung that remains ventilated despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a subsequent return to baseline CPAP levels. The 
potential beneﬁt of lung recruitment maneuvers of this type - with temporary increases in continuous 
distending pressure followed by a return to a lower pressure resulting in sustained beneﬁt - is supported 
by [CONTACT_871160][INVESTIGATOR_27111] (25-26).  B. We do not 
propose to maintain infants on best CPAP as deﬁned in this protocol. However, the information gained 
during through the study procedures will be shared with the clinical team. Information regarding the 
oxygenation response to changes in CPAP level in a speciﬁc infant are of clear clinical interest, but are 
rarely obtained due to the time and personnel resources required for careful measurement. The study 
procedures provides this information, which may be considered by [CONTACT_871161]. 2. There are beneﬁts that may accrue to society for 
future premature infants newborns through completion of this study. These are considerable as they 
would help in deﬁning respi[INVESTIGATOR_871134], an area of considerable 
morbidity in this population.
Alternatives to Participation (optional)
We will include the following language in the informed consent: "If you choose not to participate in this 
study, your baby [CONTACT_871162], PAH ICN, or 
the CHOP N/IICU. The alternative to enrolling your child in this study is not to participate. No negative 
consequences will result from choosing not to participate in the study."
Data and Safety Monitoring
Safety and privacy will be ensured as stated previously in Study Procedures, Conﬁdentiality, Subject 
Privacy/ Protected Health Information and Potential Study Risks. A committee compromised of the 
research team and two additional neonatologists not directly involved in the study will meet to review 
safety data after 7 and 14 subjects are enrolled.  We will document the proportion of subjects requiring 
early study termination on the basis of these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], with an expectation of less than 20% of 
enrolled subjects. Safety monitoring following application of the study protocol will include monitoring 
for air leak syndromes (pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumomediastinum; as 
determined by [CONTACT_871163]) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_528316], deﬁned as an increase in baseline FiO2 greater than 0.10 in the 48 hour following the 
study intervention, excluding infants in whom the rate of rise in FiO2 prior to study interventions 
demonstrates a comparable FiO2 trend. We anticipate these outcomes in no more than 10% of enrolled 
subjects.

Risk / Beneﬁt Assessment
As previously described, many considerations to minimizing risk have been taken in the study 
procedures. The risk incurred from participating in the study is small; the protocol only deviates from 
standard of care practices in the HUP ICN, PAH ICN, or the CHOP N/IICU by [CONTACT_871164]2 levels. The changes are within the range used in neonatal clinical practice and implemented for 
short periods of time. The infants will be monitored closely for any physiologic instability suggestive of 
possible evolving harm through a set of conservative "stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]" providing an opportunity to 
terminate the study and prevent harm. The study's potential beneﬁt to society, as described above, 
justiﬁes the small risk posed to the recruited subjects.

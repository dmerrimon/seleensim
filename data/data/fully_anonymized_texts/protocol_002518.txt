What are some general things you should know about research studies?  
You are being asked to take part in a research study.   To join the study is voluntary.  
You may choose not to participate, or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any 
reason, without penalty.  
 
Research studies are designed to obtain new knowledge. This new information may help people 
in the future.    You may not receive any direct benefit from being in the research study. There 
also may be risks to being in research stu dies. Deciding not to be in the study or leaving the 
study before it is done will not affect your relationship with the researcher, your health care 
provider, or the University of North Carolina -Chapel Hill. If you are a patient with an illness, 
you do not  have to be in the research study in  order to receive health care.  
 
Details about this study are discussed below.   It is important that you understand this information 
so that you can make an informed choice about being in this research study.   
 
You will b e given a copy of this consent form.   You should ask the researchers named above, or 
staff members who may assist them, any questions you have about this study at any time.  
 
What is the purpose of this study?  
The purpose of this research study is to test a  new investigational device developed by 
[CONTACT_209575] -cancerous tissue in the esophagus 
(Barret’s Esophagus).   Investigational device means it is not  yet approved for use in humans and 
is still being tested in res earch studies to determine its effectiveness and safety. The device uses 
light to detect changes in cells of the esophagus (food tube).  This research is being done to 
collect information on the operating characteristics of the device to prepare it for use  in a larger 
scale study.  
 
17-[ADDRESS_250483] Pi[INVESTIGATOR_209570] 09Jan2018  Page 2 of 6 You are being asked to be in the study because you are presenting to UNC h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_209572].  
 
Are there any reasons you should not be in this study?  
You should not be in this study if you: 
1. Are younger than [ADDRESS_250484] had prior surgery of your esophagus other than uncomplicated nissen 
fundoplication  
4. Are pregnant  
How many people will take part in this study?  
A total of approximately [ADDRESS_250485]?  
Your participation in this study will last less than [ADDRESS_250486] of care upper endoscopy  (a procedure where a tube with light 
and camera on the end are inserted into your esophagus) .  You will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 7 days after th e 
procedure to see how you are doing.  Your participation is complete when you’ve completed the 
7 day follow -up. 
What will happen if you take part in the study?  
If you agree to take part in the study, then you will be asked to sign this consent form.  If y ou are 
a female with reproductive potential, then you will complete a urine pregnancy test  paid for by 
[CONTACT_1758] .  We will collect relevant information from your medical record for this study related to 
your age and information about any esophageal conditi ons you may have (acid reflux, Barrett’s 
Esophagus, etc.).  
 
You will then undergo your upper endoscopy that  has already been scheduled as part of your 
clinical care.  During the upper endoscopy,  and prior to taking any clinically indicated biopsies 
(small  tissue samples),  an investigational device developed by [CONTACT_209576].  
 
The investigational device, an  optical c oherence tomography (OCT) probe, will be attached to 
the end of the endoscope (a tube with a camera and light on the end)  and passed with the 
endoscope into your esophagus . This method of attaching a probe to the end of an endoscope is 
common practice during an upper endoscopy.  However, in this study the probe is 
investigational, meaning it is not yet approved for use in hu mans.  
 
17-[ADDRESS_250487] with the lining (epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]) of your esophagus and will 
transmit light against it, similar to holding a flashlight against your skin.  The device uses 
information from the light to take images and collect data about  the lining of your esophagus . It 
is similar to an ultrasound, but instead of bouncing sound waves off of the object, it bounces 
light waves. These light waves are collected by [CONTACT_209577].  These ima ges and data will be  used in this study and stored indefinitely.   
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_209573].  If biopsies are taken for your clinical 
care, then results from those biopsies will be used in this study. No study -specific bi opsies will 
be taken. Your clinical biopsies are stored at UNC as part of your clinical care.  Slides (small 
slices of tissue) from your stored clinical biopsies may also be requested and used in this study.  
 
You will be contact[CONTACT_65312]  [ADDRESS_250488].  
 
What are the possible benefits from being in this study?  
Research is designed to benefit society by [CONTACT_31283].   You will not benefit 
personally from being in this research study.  
  
What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?  
There are no known complications due to application of the OCT imaging techniques . Although 
the technique is not invasive, the probe itself will come in contact [CONTACT_209578] .  For that reason, there is a theoretical risk of infection.  To guard against this, the 
probe will be disinfected between use s using acceptable disinfection methods. To date, there 
have been no adverse effects reported from exposure to the spectrum of light used in this device.  
There is no risk of radiation from this device because it uses only light waves.  
 
There may be uncommon or previously unknown risks. You should report any problems to the 
researcher.  
 
Pregnancy tests will be done on all females who might be able to get pregnant at the start of the 
study.   Pregnancy tests will be paid for by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
 

17-[ADDRESS_250489] Pi[INVESTIGATOR_209570] 09Jan2018  Page 4 of 6 What if we learn about new findings or information during the study?  
You will be given any new information gained during the course of the study that might affect 
your willingness to continue your participation.   
 
How will information about you be protect ed? 
Electronic research records will be stored on secure encrypted computers and paper records will 
be maintained in locked filing cabinets.  Access to all records for this study (paper and 
electronic) will be limited to research personnel.  In addition, y ou will be assigned a unique 
identifier (code) that does not contain any protected health information.  One master list linking 
you to your code will be maintained separately from the  analyzed  research data.  Some of your 
protected health information will be used in this research study and stored with the research data.   
 
Participants will not  be identified in any report or publication about this study. Although every 
effort will be made to keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law 
requires the disclosure of such records, including personal information.   This is very unlikely, 
but if disclosure is ever required, UNC -Chapel Hill will take steps allowable by [CONTACT_209579].   In some cases, your information in this research study could 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_31294], research sponsors, or government agencies (for 
example, the FDA) for purposes such as quality control or safety.  
 
A copy of this consent form will go in to your  medical record.   This will allow the doctors caring 
for you to know what study medications or tests you may be receiving as a part of the study and 
know how to take care of you if you have other health problems or needs during the study.  
What is a Certifi cate of Confidentiality?  
To help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
National Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose 
information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the 
Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained 
below.  
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United 
States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of Federally funded projects or for 
information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of  the federal Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).  
You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of 
your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this 
research. If an i nsurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research 
information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
No voluntary disclosure will be made.

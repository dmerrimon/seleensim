I. Abstract  
Recently interfascial plane blocks have been developed for analgesia including erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146791] (ESP) block.  The ESP block has been hypothesized to provide truncal analgesia by [CONTACT_802047].  However, recent studies hav e shown that the spread 
of local anesthetic by [CONTACT_802048].  It has been established that interfascial plane blocks can result in systemic levels of local anesthetic that can achieve therapeutic concentrations similar to those observed by [CONTACT_802049].  Free and total plasma lidocaine levels will be measured until steady state levels are achieved with ESP blocks.  Add itionally, the safety of the ESP block using doses of 
local anesthetic has not been rigorously evaluated   This study will evaluate both the analgesic efficacy and safety of ESP blocks in post- cardiac surgery 
i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)  patients in comparison to intravenously adminis tered lidocaine.   
 
II. Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies  
Postoperative pain is a significant issue following open heart surgery and 
poorly controlled pain can result in significant cardio-respi[INVESTIGATOR_337446].  A significant number of patients suffer from pain issues both at rest (49%) and on movement (62%) following open heart surgery via sternotomy (1,2) and adequate pain management requires closer re -assessment and treatment.   The 
intensity of pain is noted to be higher in the first [ADDRESS_1107096]-surgery (3,4,5,6,7,8) and hence modalities to control pain may make the greatest difference in the first two days after surgery.  
 
 
Enhanced recovery pathways utilizing multimodal analgesia have shown significant analgesic and opi[INVESTIGATOR_802035] (9,10). Some such multimodal analgesic regimens have also incorporated regional anesthesia, but the optimal analgesic regimen is still elusive. Central neuraxial blocks such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], intrathecal and paravertebral blocks have been utilized for cardiac surgery associated pain but 
given not widely adapted to practice due to concerns of altered coagulation status and the possibility of neuraxial hematoma. Additionally, there is a lack of clear guidelines to provide deeper regional nerve blocks in this patient population. A variety of interfascial plane blocks have been developed, among which the erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_802036] (ESP) block has gained popularity recently. Given the non- neuraxial and superficial location of the structures of interest, 
more healthcare providers are offering ESP to provide analgesia following open heart surgery. Early evidence available from a clinical trial comparing ESP to no block and non-standardized multimodal anesthesia has shown variab le pain reduction but consistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_263067] (11,12). The ESP 
block has been hypothesized to provide truncal analgesia by [CONTACT_802050] (LA) into the paravertebral space (PVS). However, recent anatomical studies have contested this idea, showing unreliable spread of LA to the PVS. It is also well known that bilateral paravertebral blocks can result in higher than acceptable systemic levels of LA both in cardiac (13,14) and non-cardiac surgical patients and this may be true following bilateral ESP as well. Hence, the pharmacokinetic profile of administered local anesthetics is necessary given the lack of information about the local anesthetic systemic levels following bilateral ESP.  
 It is well known that interfascial plane blocks can result in systemic levels of LAs that achieve therapeutic concentrations (15) similar to that observed by [CONTACT_802051] (16,17). This is very likely the case for the ESP block, especially since the clinical and anatomical studies have conflicting findings regarding the loco-regional effects. Although intravenous lidocaine has shown some promise to prevent post-operative cognitive dysfunction (18,19), its effect on postoperative pain is not well studies. One study utilizing low dose lidocaine failed to show improvement in pain scores or opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], but the study did not utilize standardized multimodal analgesia 
i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)  regimen (20). It is currently unknown whether the analgesic benefits of 
interfascial plane blocks are due to the multimodal analgesic regimen, the loco-regional benefits of the blocks, the systemic levels of local anesthetics 
following the block performance or a combination of all. We hypothesize that the mechanism by [CONTACT_802052]. In addition, the safety of the ESP block using high doses of LA in cardiac surgery patients has not been rigorously assessed. We propose a pragmatic study to address both unknowns, the mechanism and safety of ESP following cardiac surgery.  
III. Study Aims  
1.  The hypothesis of this study is that the analgesic effects of ESP can be attributed to its systemic distribution rather than its locoregional effects.  A finding that lidocaine administered by [CONTACT_802053] (2- 5 ug/ml) at steady state will support 
our hypothesis whereas inability to reach analgesic levels will suggest that systemic distribution of local anesthetic is not a significant contributing factor of analgesia.  
 2.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_802037], plasma concentrations of local anesthetic have been known to reach toxic levels following bilateral paravertebral blocks.   This may also be true of ESP blocks.  This study will address this concern and help establish a safety profile for ESP blocks in the cardiac patient population.

                   5.  Administration : Per study, either through ESP catheter or  
  intravenously.                     6.  Toxicities and guidelines fo r adjustments :  Acute 
emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma levels encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics or to unintended subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution.  Management of Local Anesthetic Emergencies The first consideration is prevention best accomplished by [CONTACT_802054][INVESTIGATOR_802040]’s state of consciousness after each local anesthetic injection. At the first sign of change, oxygen should be administered.   The first step in the management of convulsions, as well as underventilation or apnea due to unintended subarachnoid injection of drug solution, consists of immediate attention to the maintenance of a patent airway and  assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen and a 
delivery system capable of permitting immediate positive airway pressure by [CONTACT_370908]. Immediately after the institution of these ventilatory measures, the adequacy of the circulation should be evaluated, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_802041]. Should convulsions persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_802042], and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously. The clinician should be familiar, prior to the use of local anesthetics, with these anticonvulsant drugs. Supportive trea tment of 
i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)  circulatory depression may require administration of intravenous fluids 
and, when appropriate, a vasopressor as directed by [CONTACT_510510]  (e.g., ephedrine).   
 If not treated immediately, both convulsions and cardiovascular depression can result in hypoxia, acidosis, bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Underventilation or apnea due to unintentional subarachnoid injection of local anesthetic solution may produce these same signs and also lead to cardiac arrest if vent ilatory support is not 
instituted. If cardiac arrest should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted.  
 Endotracheal intubation, employing drugs and techniques familiar to the clinician, may be indicated, after initial administration of oxygen by [CONTACT_370908], if difficulty is encountered in the maintenance of a patent airway or if prolonged ventilatory support (assisted or controlled) is indicated.   
     d.  Study Assessments and Activities 
  
i. Describe all study procedures, assessments, and subject activities  
Procedures Affecting Both Groups A.  Pre -Operative Phase (Standard of Care)  
•  Pre -operative fasting and carbohydrate treatment.  Patients are 
kept NPO for 8 hours before surgery except for an oral carbohydra te beverage given 2 - 4 hours before procedure. 
•  Pre -operative multimodal analgesic is initiated.  Gabapentin and 
acetaminophen will be given pre-operatively and continued postoperatively at regular intervals. 
 •  Anxiolytic medications.  Minimal anxiolytic medications given 
 before surgery including midazolam given by [CONTACT_802055].   B.  Intra-Operative Phase (Standard of Care - At discretion of    Anesthesia Provider)  •  Intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499].  Fentanyl IV given as  needed for pai n but typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 1 mg for procedure. 
 •  Hydromorphone 0.5 - 1 mg given near completion of procedure  •  Intraoperative multimodal analgesia.   If time since preoperative 
 acetaminophen dose significantly exceeds 6 hours, acetaminophen  1000 mg IV, or via NG route is considered  •  Postoperative sedation initiated.  Near the end of the procedure,  dexmedetomidine or propofol infusion is begun for postoperative  sedation in ICU while intubated 
i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)   •  All patients will receive dual post-operative nausea and vom iting 
 (PONV) prophylaxis in the form of ondansetron and 
 dexamethasone at appropriate time periods.    If the surgical procedure takes longer than [ADDRESS_1107097]    will be withdrawn from the study.   C.  Block Performance/Procedure  
•  Upon arriva l to the CV -ICU, patients will be assessed for 
eligibility to extubate based on hemodynamic and pulmonary stability on a case -by-case basis with the aim to extubate as early 
as possible.  When appropriate, extubation will proceed following the CV -ICU Fast Track Extubation protocol that is already in 
place.  Extubation is not required prior to the administration of study drug via IV or ESP catheters route.  Participation in the study can proceed as long as after assessment by [CONTACT_15098], the subject is extubated or ready to be extubat ed. 
  
 D.  Group ESP (Study Procedures) 
•  Bilateral ultrasound guided erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_146791] (ESP) catheters will be inserted either pre - or post-operatively. 
 •  After confirming that there  are no contra-indications, the subject   
will receive lidocaine via ESP catheter.   
 •  Patients will receive lidocaine at a dose of 2 mg/kg ideal body  weight (IBW) as bolus divided equally between the two ESP  catheters.  
 •  Subjects will then lie in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  •  Lidocaine infusion via ESP catheters either through 2 dedicated pumps or via a single pump and a y- connector at a rate of 2 
mg/kg/hour for approximately 48 hours.  • Blood samples will be drawn at 5, 30, 60, 120 minutes, 6 and 24 hours and assessed for lidocaine concentration.  
 •  Pain scores  (resting and with movement/cough) will be collected 
 from  bedside record and EPIC medical record.  Standard 
 assessment protocol already in place has this charted every 2 - 4  hours by [CONTACT_802056].  
 •  All patients will receive continued oral multimodal analgesia 
 •  When not eligible to receive oral medications (e.g. NPO), pain analgesia will be provided through an IV route.  This can include an IV PCA pump using hydromorphone 0.2 mg with a lockout of  10 minutes and a maximum dose of 6 mg in 4 hours continued           postoperatively.  
•  If oral medications are insufficient to provide pain relief, and the subjects are not receiving medications via PCA, pain medications 
i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)  will be provided IV. •  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_6086] (both oral and IV) will be 
assessed and reported in morphine equivalents.   E.  Group IV (Study Procedures)     •  Patients will receive lidocaine at a dose of 2 mg/kg ideal body  weight (IBW) through IV route.  •  Subjects will then lie in  a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
   •  Lidocaine infusion via IV route at a rate of 2 mg/kg/hour for  approximately 48 hours.  •  Blood samples will be drawn at 5, 30, 60, 120 minutes, 6 and 24 hours and assessed for lidocaine concentration.  •  Pain scores (resting an d with movement/cough) will be collected 
 from bedside record and EPIC medical record.  Standard 
 assessment protocol already in place has this charted every 2 - 4  hours by [CONTACT_802056]  •  All patients will receive continued oral multimodal analgesia  
•  When not eligible to receive oral medications (e.g. NPO), pain analgesia will be provided through an IV route.  This can include an IV PCA pump using hydromorphone 0.2 mg with a lockout of  10 minutes and a maximum dose of 6 mg in 4 hours continued           postoperatively.  
•  If oral medications are insufficient to provide pain relief, and the subjects are not receiving medications via PCA, pain medications will be provided IV. 
   •  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_6086] (both oral and IV) will be assessed and reported in morphine equivalents.

i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)   
 
VII. Safety Monitoring Plan  
i. Definition of adverse events, serious adverse events :   
 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality or relationship to the drug.    An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defe ct. 
 Any adverse experience that places the subject, in the view of the invest igator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, or 
it is suspected that the use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s death.  
 
ii. What procedures will be used to monitor subject safety?   

i:rsa \hso\webstuff \protocoloutline.doc (01/03)   
Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
(adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient’s state of consciousness should be accomplished. It should be kept in mind at such times that restlessness, anxiety, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, depression or drowsiness may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity.  
 For the purpose of being prepared to deal with the side effects of lidocaine (Bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, infusion site reactions), the blocks will 
only be performed in the Cardiac ICU, where pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures are available to treat these side effects.  The foundation of local anesthetic toxicity is out lined in seizure management 
with pharmac ological seizure management, advanced cardiac life support 
(ACLS) to support the heart and use of 20% lipid emulsion to reverse local anesthetic toxicity.  Oxygen can be provided for patients needing improved oxygena tion and all the emergency medications, pharmacists 
and intensivists are readily available in the ICU.  
 
iii. Who (list names) will identify, document, and report adverse events?  Nursing staff in the CVICU should report adverse events to [CONTACT_802058] or Dr . Rakesh Sondekoppam within [ADDRESS_1107098] is stabilized this information will be reported to a member of Anesthesia Innovative Research Core who will report the event to the IRB.  
iv. What is the frequency for review of summarized safety information and who will perform the review (e.g., safety monitoring board)?    No committee is currently in place for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
 
v. What are the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284706]?    If an adverse/serious adverse event occurs, the study will be paused until careful evaluations is performed.   
 
VIII.  Analysis Plan  Study variables will be collected and tabulated. The continuous and discrete variables will be presented as mean and standard dev iation after calculation 
and the categorical variables will be presented as frequencies. Normality of distribution will be assessed using Q-Q plots followed by [CONTACT_167672][INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk test. 
Normally distributed data will be assessed using independent sample t- test an d 
non-normally distributed data will be assessed using Mann-Whitney U- test. 
Categorical variables will be tested using chi -square tests or F isher ’s exact 
test. Tests for equivalence will be applied for the primary outcome measures

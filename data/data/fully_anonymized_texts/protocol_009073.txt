I. OBJECTIVES 
Primary Objectives 
1. To assess the complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery 
(CRp) rates with combination therapy of E7070, idarubicin and cytarabine in patients 
with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HRMDS), and. 
2. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of combination therapy with combination 
therapy of E7070, idarubicin and cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory AML 
or HRMDS. 
Secondary Objectives 
Determine the duration of response, dis ease-free survival, and overall survival. 
II. BACKGROUND 
The Disease 
The cure rates for patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies are dismal.  
Therefore, new agents need to be identified, tested in clinical trials, and incorporated into 
effective regimens to improve the prognosis of these patients.  This study is designed for patients with relapsed/refractory AML and HRMDS whose duration of first CR was less than 1 year.  Once front-line therapy fails, patients’ t herapeutic options are limited.  This population of 
patients with disease that has relapsed or is refractory to established frontline therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101355] 10% to 20%.
1  Even if a small proportion of these patients achieve 
a remission, the remissions are short lasting. 
Rationale for Proposed Therapy 
Idarubicin and Cytarabine 
While a combination of an anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin) and cytarabine is 
standard ‘induction’ regimen for patients with newly diagnosed AML, the ‘best’ salvage 
regimen for patients with relapsed disease is unclear. While patients with initial CR duration of 
over 1 year clearly benefit from high-dose cy tarabine (HDAC) based regimens, the probability 
of achieving a second CR for patients with shorter first CR duration is very low. Cytogenetics, age, failure of prior salvage attempts add to the poor outcome of these patients. Investigational agents alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapy in clinical trials should be the 
most appropriate approach for these patients.   
 
III. BACKGROUND DRUG  INFORMATION 
A. E7070 
(Information detailed in Investigator’s Brochure: all references in parentheses are Eisai reports 
outlined in Investigator’s Brochure) 
E7070 is a sulfonamide anticancer agent that was selected out by G1 cell-cycle arrest effect in 
murine leukemia P388 cells and antitumor effect in human tumor xenograft models in mice. E7070 induces G1 cell-cycle arrest and delay in G1/S transition in both P388 cells (P1&P2) 
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 6 of 25 
and the colorectal cancer CRC cell line HCT116 (P3).  Cell cycle arrest in these cases is 
followed by [CONTACT_101368] (P2).  These effects of E7070 on cell cycle progression and apoptosis were found to be time-dependent (P2). 
Gene expression analysis using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays has revealed that 
E7070 treatment causes characteristic repres sion of subsets of genes involved in redox 
metabolism, cell cycle control, immune response, and signal transduction (P5). A significant reduction in DNA topoisomerase II alpha and glutathione synthetase transcripts may provide a molecular basis for combination therapy with irinotecan (CPT-11) and platinum agents, 
respectively. 
Proteomic studies using E7070-based affinity matrixes have identified cytosolic malate 
dehydrogenase (cMDH) as a specific binding protein of E7070.  cMDH is a critical metabolic 
enzyme involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis. It catalyses 
the reversible conversion of oxaloacetate to malate using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD and NADH) as cofactors.  The core structure of E7070 competes with NADH in binding 
to cMDH at a physiologically relevant concentration (P6). It has yet to be demonstrated that 
this binding property is a prerequisite for the antitumor activity of E7070. 
Potential interactions with other medications 
Human liver microsomal studies have shown that there is potential for CYP450 (CYP2C9, 
2C19 and 3A4) inhibition by [CONTACT_101369].  As a consequence, there is a hypothetical chance of 
an interaction between indisulam and a number of drugs.  Some drugs with which this 
interaction may be observed have a relatively narrow therapeutic index and so are of potential concern.  The most important of these are listed below:  
• oral anticoagulants 
• terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporin, tacrolimus 
• theophylline 
• diazepam 
• sulphonylurea anti-diabetics 
• phenytoin and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].   
There have been reports of drug interactions between E7070 and oral anticoagulants. Three 
patients from the Phase I program who were receiving chronic therapy with the oral anticoagulant acenocoumarol experienced bleeding and/or a further prolongation of the prothrombin time following treatment with E7070 at a dose of 700 mg/m
[ADDRESS_111869] with acenocoumarol by [CONTACT_101370].  Displacement of adenocoumarol’s plasma protein binding by E7070 may also occur, but to a minor extent.  In view of these findings, clinicians are advised to exercise caution during the introduction and after the withdrawal of E7070 therapy in patients stabilized on oral anticoagulation. 
Pre-clinical work outlined below indicates synergy of E7070 with traditional chemotherapeutic 
agents. 
E7070 Dosing 
 
Section 5.4.1 Table 34 in the Investigator’s Brochure is the summary for recommended phase 
2 doses for single agent E7070 and for the weekly schedule, 400 mg/m
2 weekly times four is 
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 7 of 25 
the recommended dose. In our proposed study, the dose of E7070 is scheduled at 400 mg/m2 
weekly times two to allow for the addition of chemotherapy and to avoid undue toxicity with the 
combination.  
 
Moreover, in a phase 2 study (E7070-E044-214) combining E7070 with chemotherapy, the dose of E7070 was 400 mg/m
2 with irinotecan 125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 in a 21 day cycle 
(Table 5.5.5 Page 93 of Investigator Brochure) and this was tolerated with acceptable level of toxicity (diarrhea, vomiting, cytopenias being most frequent toxicities). 
 
These data has been used to arrive at the proposed doses in the current protocol.    The doses of idarubicin and cytarabine to be administered are lower than the usual 12mg and 1.5 gram per meter squared that is usually used, to avoid undue toxicity when combined with E7070. 
 
B. Cytarabine 
 
Cytarabine (Ara-C, Cystosar) is commercially  available from Pharmacia, ON, Canada L4W 
5J5 or other manufacturers . 
 
Cytarabine is an antimetabolite that is cell cycle specific. It is a pyrimidine analogue that 
affects rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101356] S phase and inhibits cell development from G
1 to S phase. 
Cytarabine is primarily metabolized in the liver, with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours. Eighty to ninety percent of the drug is excreted in the bile. Moderate amounts of the drug cross the blood-brain barrier, and cytarabine has been shown to cross the placental barrier.  
 
How Supplied: Cytarabine is available in a freeze-dried preparation in multi-dose vials, 100 mg 
and 500 mg. The solution pH is 5.0 when reconstituted. 
 
Solution preparation: Five ml of bacteriostatic H 2O for injection (made with 5% dextrose or 
normal saline) should be added to 100 mg to get 50 mg cytarabine per ml. Diluents containing benzyl alcohol should not be used. 
 
Stability and storage: Before mixing, cytarabine is stable at room temperature. After mixing, 
reconstituted solutions are chemically st able at room temperature for eight days. 
 
Route of administration: Intravenous. 
 
Overdosage: Doses up to 3 gm/m2 for six doses have been used.  
PRECAUTIONS: Dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops (1-2 drops every 6 hours for 2-7 days) 
should be administered to all patients to ameliorate conjunctivitis. 
C. Idarubicin  
 
Idarubicin is commercially available and will not be supplied for this protocol. Please see 
package insert for further information.

Page 8 of 25 
Use: Treatment of acute leukemias (AML, ANLL, ALL), accelerated phase or blast crisis of 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), breast cancer  
 
Contraindications:  Hypersensitivity to idarubicin, other anthracyclines, or any component of the 
formulation; bilirubin >5 mg/dl; pregnancy  
 Warnings/Precautions:  The U.S. FDA currently recommends that procedures for proper 
handling and disposal of antineoplastic agents be considered. Can cause myocardial toxicity 
and is more common in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have 
preexisting cardiac disease; reduce dose in patients with impaired hepatic function.   Adverse Reactions: >10%: Cardiovascular: Transient EKG abnormalities (supraventricular 
tachycardia, S-T wave changes, atrial or ventricular extrasystoles); generally asymptomatic and self-limiting. Congestive heart failure, dose-related. The relative cardiotoxicity of idarubicin 
compared to doxorubicin is unclear. Some investigators report no increase in cardiac toxicity 
at cumulative oral idarubicin doses up to 540 mg/m2; other reports suggest a maximum cumulative intravenous dose of 150 mg/ m2. Other cardiovascular side effects include arrhythmias, chest pain, and myocardial infarction.  Central nervous system: Headache  
Dermatologic: Alopecia (25% to 30%), radiation recall, skin rash (11%), urticaria  
Oral: mucositis 10-20%  Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting (30% to 60%); diarrhea (9% to 22%); stomatitis (11%); GI hemorrhage (30%)  Genitourinary: Discoloration of urine (darker yellow)  Hematologic: Myelosuppression, primarily leukopenia; thrombocytopenia and anemia. Nadir: 
10-15 days Recovery: 21-28 days  Hepatic: Elevations of bilirubin and transaminases (44%) 1% to 10%:  Central nervous system: Seizures  Neuromuscular & skeletal: Peripheral neuropathy <1%: Hyperuricemia   
Overdosage/Toxicology:  Symptoms of overdose include severe myelosuppression and 
increased GI toxicity. Treatment is supportive. It is unlikely that therapeutic efficacy or toxicity 
would be altered by [CONTACT_101371].   Drug Interactions:  Patients may experience impaired immune response to vaccines; possible 
infection after administration of live vaccines in patients receiving immunosuppressants  
 
Stability:  Store intact vials of solution under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C/36°F to 46°F); protect 
from light. Solutions diluted in D5W or NS for infusion are stable for 4 weeks at room temperature and 7 days under refrigeration.   
Mechanism of Action: Similar to doxorubicin and daunorubicin; inhibition of DNA and RNA 
synthesis by [CONTACT_101372]/Kinetics: Absorption: Oral: Variable (4% to 77%; mean: ~30%) 
Distribution: Vd: 64 L/kg (some reports indicate 2250 L)  
 
Metabolism: Hepatic to idarubicinol (pharmacologically active)  
 Half-life elimination: Oral: 14-35 hours; I.V.: 12-27 hours Time to peak, serum: 1-5 hours  
 Excretion: Oral: Urine (~5% of dose; 0.5% to 0.7% as unchanged drug, 4% as idarubicinol); 
hepatic (8%) 
 Protocol # 2009-0570

I.V.: Urine (13% as idarubicinol, 3% as unchanged drug); hepatic (17%)  
 
Dosage: Refer to individual protocols.  
I.V.:  Leukemia induction: 12 mg/m2/day for 3 days  
Leukemia consolidation: 4-8 mg2/m/day for 2 days  
 
Extravasation management: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_101357]. Cooling of site for [ADDRESS_111870] 
extremity 24-48 hours, then resume normal activity as tolerated. Application of cold inhibits vesicant's cytotoxicity. Application of heat can be harmful and is contraindicated. If pain, erythema, and/or swelling persist beyond 48 hours, refer patient immediately to plastic surgeon for consultation and possible debridement.  
 
IV. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a phase 2 study of E7070 in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML with a particular focu s towards patients with primary refractory 
disease or who are receiving first salvage therapy or beyond. Patients with newly diagnosed AML who do not qualify for front-line induction studies will also be eligible.  HRMDS patients 
will also be eligible. Patients will be treated according to the schedule below: 
 
A. Treatment Plan 
 
E7070 400 mg/m
2 intravenously (IV) approximately over  1 hour on day 1 and day 8 (± 2 
days on Day 8 only) followed by:  
 
• Idarubicin 8 mg/m2 IV approximately over 1 hour daily x 3 (days 9-11) and 
• Cytarabine 1.0 g/m2 IV approximately over 24 hours daily on day 9-12 (age <60 
years) or days 9-11 (age ≥ 60 years). 
• Dexamethasone 10 mg IV daily for 3-4 days with cytarabine 
 
Variations in infusion times due to minor differences in IV bag overfill/underfill and 
institutional procedure on flushing chemotherapy lines will not result in protocol deviation. 
 
Patient will undergo disease assessment on day 28 ± 3 days at the discretion of 
treating physician. This assessment can be repeated or delayed at the discretion of 
treating physician if there is ground to believe that the patient is benefiting from study drug. Patients who derive clinical benefit e.g. CR, CRp, PR or marrow clearance of blasts may receive up to two additional cycles of E7070 in combination with chemotherapy at the above doses. Each cy cle will be approximately 28 days (+/- 2 
days). Dose modifications and delays are allowed for persistent cytopenias or non-hematological toxicities.    Patients not achieving less than an objective response after cycle [ADDRESS_111871] by [CONTACT_1697]. If such a patient achieves an objective response as defined in response criteria after the second 
cycle may receive one more cycle of therapy  on study. If a patient does not achieve an 
objective response after two cycles of ther apy, the patient will be removed from study 
for lack of response.

XIII. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE FOR ACUTE LE[LOCATION_006]EMIAS AND MDS 
International Working Group Criteria3, 4 will be used to define response. 
 
1. Complete remission (CR):  The patient must be free of all symptoms related to leukemia 
and have an absolute  neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, platelet count ≥  100 x 109/L, and 
normal bone marrow differential ( ≤ 5% blasts). 
 
2. Complete remission without platelet recovery (CRp): As per CR but platelet count  < 100 x 
109/L. 
 
3. Partial remission (PR): CR with 6 to 25% abnormal cells in the marrow or 50% decrease in 
bone marrow blasts.   
 
4. Marrow CR:  Bone marrow:   ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥  50% over pre-treatment 
(MDS only) 
 
5. Morphologic leukemia-free state:  Normal marrow differential (<5% blasts); neutrophil and 
platelet counts are not considered.  (AML only) 
 
6. Hematologic Improvement (HI):  HI should be described by [CONTACT_101377], 
positively affected cell lines (e.g. HI-E; HI-E + HI-N; HI-E + HI-P +HI-N) 
 
a) Erythroid response (HI-E):   
 
• Major response:  For patients with pretreatment hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL, 
greater than 2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin; for RBC transfusion-dependent subjects, transfusion independence. 
• Minor response:  For patients with pretreatment hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL, 1 to 
2 g/dL increase in hemoglobin; for RBC transfusion-dependent patients, 50% decrease in transfusion requirements.  
 
b) Platelet response (HI-P): 
• Major response:  For patients with a pretreatement platelet count less than 100 x 
10
9/L, an absolute increase of 30 x 109/L or more; for platelet transfusion-
dependent patients, stabilization of platelet transfusion independence. 
• Minor response:  For patients with a pretreatment platelet count less than 100 x 
109/L, a 50% or more increase in platelet count with a net increase greater than 10 
x 109/L but less than 30 x 109/L. 
 
c) Neutrophil response (HI-N): 
• Major response:  For absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.5 x 109/L before 
therapy, at least a 100% increase, or an absolute increase of more than 0.5 x 
109/L, whichever is greater. 
• Minor response:  For ANC less than 1.5 x 109/L before therapy, ANC increase of at 
least 100%, but absolute increase less than 0.5 x 109/L. 
 
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 16 of 25 
7. Progression/relapse after HI:  One or more of the following:  a 50% or greater decrement 
from maximum response levels in granulocytes or platelets, a reduction in hemoglobin 
concentration by [CONTACT_2669] 2 g/dL, or transfusion.  
 
XIV. CRITERIA FOR REMO VAL FROM THE STUDY 
 
The investigator may remove patients from the study for any of the following reasons: 
 
• Clinically significant progressive disease 
• Failure to achieve any clinically signific ant response after two cycles of therapy  
• Unacceptable adverse events/toxicities 
• Investigator thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the patient (e.g. 
potential for worsening of existing infection or other toxicities) 
• The patient has an intercurrent, non-leukemia-related illness that would, in the judgment 
of the investigator, affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree and require discontinuation of protocol therapy 
• Patient request 
• Patient is non-compliant with protocol requirements 
 
 
XV. ADVERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS ADV ERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING 
 
A. Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrenc e in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered an investigational product.  An AE does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with  the medicinal product.  For this study, 
the medicinal product is E7070. 
The criteria for identifying AEs are: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered re lated to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacer bation of an existing disease 
• Any deterioration in non-pr otocol-required measurements of laboratory value or 
other clinical test (e.g., ECG or X-ray)  that results in sym ptoms, a change in 
treatment, or discontinuation from study drug 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g. headache) not present at 
Baseline. 
An abnormal laboratory test result may be considered as an adverse event if the 
identified laboratory abnorma lity leads to any type of  intervention whether 
prescribed in the protocol or not. 
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 17 of 25 
A laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_101378]: 
• results in the withdraw al of study treatment 
• results in withholding of study treatment  pending some investigational outcome 
• medical evaluation, results in the init iation of an intervention (e.g. potassium 
supplement for hypokalemia) 
• Any out of range laboratory value that in  the Investigator’s judgment, fulfills the 
definitions of an AE with regards to subject’s medical profile 
• Increases in severity compared to Baseline by ≥ 2 NCI grades (see Appendix A 
for NCI CTCAE Ver 4.0 criteria), with the exception of lymphocytes, albumin, 
cholesterol, glucose and phosphate.  For these tests, a change of ≥ 2 grades 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_101379], will be considered an adverse event. 
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are 
considered to be part of the clinical syndrome that is bei ng reported as an AE.  Any 
laboratory abnormality considered to c onstitute an adverse event should be 
reported on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (CRF). 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review a ll laboratory findings in all 
subjects and determine if they constitute an adverse event.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in decid ing whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
B. Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be recorded by [CONTACT_101380] a MDACC Adverse 
Event log.  The Investigator or physici an designee is responsible for verifying and 
providing source documentation for all adv erse events and assigning the attribution 
for each event for all subjects enrolled on the trial.  Adverse event logs will be 
scanned into Clinic Station when a patient is  removed from study or approximately 
every 6 months.  For this protocol, adverse events and protoc ol specific data will be entered into 
PDMS/CORe.  PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this 
protocol. 
All AEs encountered during the clinical study  will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, 
regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected 
beginning from the time the subject signs the study consent.  Adverse events in clinical investigation subjects include any  change in the subject’s condition.  This 
includes symptoms, physical find ings, or clinical syndromes. 
Subjects with AEs that are ongoing at the su bject’s last study visit must be followed 
until resolution or for [ADDRESS_111880]’s last study visit, whichever comes 
 Protocol # 2009-[ADDRESS_111881]’s last study visit, whic hever comes first, with the exception that 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves or the event or sequelae stabilize. 
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator to categorize each AE 
according to its severity and its rela tionship to the study treatment. 
C. Assessing Severity of Adverse Events 
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE Ver 4.0) is used to assign severity scales to AEs (Appendix A).  
They are: 
Grade 1 = Mild 
Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe Grade 4 = Life Threatening Grade 5 = Death AEs that are not defined in the NCI CT CAE should be evaluated for severity 
according to the following scale: 
Grade 1 = Mild 
Grade 2 = Moderate Grade 3 = Severe In addition, all AEs reported using the NCI  CTCAE classification and graded as 4 
or 5 are to be considered serious. 
The criteria for assessing severity are di fferent than those used for seriousness. 
D. Assessing Relationshi p to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study 
treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study 
treatment 
• The course of the event, considering es pecially the effect of discontinuation of 
study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
• Whether the event is known to be asso ciated with the study  treatment, or with 
other similar treatments 
• The presence of risk factors in th e study subject known to increase the 
occurrence of the event 
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 19 of 25 
• The presence of non-study treatment related factors which are known to be 
associated with the occurrence of the event 
E. Classification of Causality 
Not Related:   A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not 
a reasonable possibility. 
Related:   A causal relationship between t he study treatment and the AE is a 
reasonable possibility. The Investigator mu st further qualify the degree of certainty 
as “possible ” or “probable .” 
F. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Reporting requirements will be as per  institutional guidelines. 
Adverse events (AE) related to study conditions  
The serious adverse event (SAE) reporting period will begin with the signing of the 
informed consent.   
AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, and reported as SAEs if they 
become serious.  This also applies to patients experiencing AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of investi gational product, or th ose experiencing AEs 
that are present at the end of their participation in th e study.  Such patients should 
receive post-treatment follow-up as appropriate. 
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)   
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
(21 CFR 312.32).  
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 20 of 25 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse 
events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office. 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs 
and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or 
unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
•
 All life-threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the study 
drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol-specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_111882] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, 
or there has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that  occur after the [ADDRESS_111883] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_79438] (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97102], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy. 
 
G. Expedited Reporting 
Eisai, Inc. must inform Investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable events, 
in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (i.e., 
within specific timeframes).  For this reason, it is im perative that investigational 
sites provide complete SAE informati on in the manner described above. 
H. An Unexpected Adverse Event  is one that is not listed in the current Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure (CIB) / Package Insert or that differs from the event mentioned in the CIB / Package Insert because of greater severity or specificity.  
 
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable pos sibility that the 
drug may have caused or contributed to an adverse event. It includes assessing 
temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechalle nge information, association (or lack of 
 Protocol # 2009-0570         
November 15, 2013 
Page 21 of 25 
association) with underlying diseases, and the presence (or absence) of one or 
more likely causes.  The investigator must attempt to determine whether an adverse event is in some way related to the use of the study drug.  This relationship should be described as 
follows:  Unlikely:   The event is clearly due to causes distinct from the use of the study 
drug, such as a documented pre-existing condition, the effect  of a concomitant 
medication, or a new condition that, bas ed on the pathophysiology of the condition 
and the pharmacology of the st udy drug, is unlikely to be related to the use of the 
study drug.  Possible:   The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug or the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug, 
but the event could have been produced by a concomitant medication or an 
intercurrent medical condition which, based on the pathophysiolog y of the condition 
and the pharmacology of the st udy drug, is unlikely to be related to the use of the 
study drug.   Probable: The event follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from administration 
of the study drug and the event  follows a known response pattern to the study drug 
and the event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_101381] a concomitant medication. 
 Definite:  The event follows a reasonable te mporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug, the event  follows a known response pattern to the study drug, 
and based on the known pharmacology of t he study drug, the event is clearly 
related to the effect of the study drug.  Unknown:  Based on the evidence available, causality cannot be ascribed. 
 
Please see Appendix G regarding data capturing of adverse events and adverse events source documentation.  
 
XVI. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
The Investigator and study staff will be responsi ble for the accountability of all clinical 
supplies (dispensing, inventory, and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) following Eisai, Inc. instructions 
and adhere to GCP guidelines as well as lo cal and / or regional requirements.  
 Under no circumstances will t he Investigator allow the study drug to be used other 
than as directed by [CONTACT_3181]. Clinical supplies will not be administered to any individual who is not enr olled in the study.  
 An accurate and timely record of the receipt of all clinical  supplies, administration of 
study drug to the subject, and subsequent de struction of all used and unused study 
 Protocol # 2009-[ADDRESS_111884] be maintained. This includes, but may not be limited to: (a) documentation 
of receipt of clinical supplies, (b) study  drug dispensing/return reconciliation log, 
(unused vials will be shipped back, all used vials should be destroyed on-site per 
MDACC institutional policy) (c) study dr ug accountability log, and (d) all shippi[INVESTIGATOR_101360]. All forms will be provided by [CONTACT_101382], Inc. Any comparable forms that 
the investigational site wishes to us e must be approved by [CONTACT_101382], Inc.  
 The supplies and inventory records must be made available, upon request, for 
inspection by [CONTACT_101383], Inc., a representative of the Food 
and Drug Administration, or a representative of a non-U.S. health authority. All used 
and unused study drug, including empty co ntainers, are to be accounted for and 
destroyed according to site policy and procedur e throughout the course of the trial.  
 The CRAs will review drug accountability duri ng investigational site visits and at the 
completion of the study.

XVIII. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS 
 
Ethical Principles 
 
The study will be conducted according to the principles outlined by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicabl e amendments; the International Conference on 
Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice; and FDA regulations regarding the 
conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human subjects.  
 
Informed Consent 
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain written informed consent from a patient or a patient’s legal representative before any study-related procedures are performed.  The 
Investigator will provide an informed consent in compliance with ICH, GCP, and U.S. FDA guidelines (21 CFR 50).  The informed consent document must clearly describe the potential 
 Protocol # 2009-[ADDRESS_111886] be approved by [CONTACT_101384] a potential 
patient.    
 
One copy of the patient's signed, dated, and witnessed written consent will be kept in the 
patient’s medical record, and one copy will be given to the patient or the patient’s legal representative. 
 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 
 
The Investigator must obtain approval of the protocol, the informed consent document, and any other material used to inform the patient about the nature of the trial from the local IRB in the form of a written letter.  In the approval letter, which must be signed by [CONTACT_101385]’s designee, the following items should be clearly stated:  trial title, 
protocol number and version, study-related documents (protocol, informed consent material, advertisement when applicable), IRB review date, and IRB decision.  The trial should not start until a copy of this written approval has been received by [CONTACT_737]. 
 
If the Investigator is a member of the IRB, the Investigator may participate in any discussion of the study but may not participate in the final vote deciding whether to approve the study.  
 
Annually, or more often if stipulated by [CONTACT_1201], and at the completion or termination of the study, the Investigator will report the progress of the trial to the IRB. 
 
Additional Responsibilities of the Investigator 
 
The Investigator(s) agrees to perform the study in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice and FDA regulations.  The Investigator is required to ensure compliance with respect to the investigational drug schedule, visit schedule, and procedures required by [CONTACT_760].  
 
The Investigator should be able to recruit the required number of suitable patients and should have sufficient time to properly conduct and complete the trial.  The Investigator should have available an adequate number of qualified staff and adequate facilities for the duration of the trial and should ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately informed about the protocol, the protocol-defined procedures, protocol therapy, and trial-related duties and 
functions. 
 
The Investigator should be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions.  During and 
following a patient’s participation in a trial, the investigator should ensure that adequate medical care is provided to a patient for any adverse events related to the trial.   
  
Confidentiality 
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the confidentiality of all patients 
participating in the trial and all of their medical information is maintained.  Case report forms 
must never contain the name [CONTACT_4007] a trial patient.  All case report forms and any identifying information must be kept in a secure location, with access limited to the study staff directly participating in the trial.  Personal medical information may be reviewed by a representative of Eisai, Inc., of the IRB, or of regulatory authorities in the course of auditing the trial.  Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain such information as confidential.

XIX. LABORATORY TESTS 
 
All labs for eligibility determination and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_101361]/or biopsy for disease 
evaluation will be done at MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Safety labs and Long Term Follow-up 
labs may be done with patients’ local physician.   See Section XI. 
 
 
 
XX. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment of E7070 with 
chemotherapy in Leukemia patients. The effica cy will be measured by [CONTACT_101386] 
(CR + CRp + PR+ marrow clearance of blast) during Cycle 1. The sample size and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101362]’s two-stage design. 
 
The efficacy will be assessed based on the Simon’s two-stage Minmax design. The new treatment will be considered promising if the response rate is 25% or higher, and will be 
considered unworthy of further investigation if response rate is 10% or less.  The maximum 
sample size of 40 patients is chosen to differentiate between response rates of 10% and 25% with 90% power at a significance level of 0.1. In particular, [ADDRESS_111887] stage. If there are two or fewer patients with response, the trial will be terminated; otherwise another 13 patients will be treated for a total of 40 patients. If, among 40 patients, 
there are 6 or fewer patients with response, the treatment will be concluded ineffective. The 
probability of early termination due to futility is 0.48. 
 
A Bayesian sequential monitoring method
5 will be used to monitor the toxicity. We stop the trial 
if the toxicity is likely to be greater than 33%. That is, stop the trial if  
Prob {toxicity rate > 33% | data} > 0.80. 
The prior distribution of toxicity rate is assumed to be beta (0.67, 1.33).  Following this rule, the trial will be terminated due to toxicity if [# toxicity]/[# patients evaluated] ≥  2/3, 3/5, 4/7, 5/10, 
6/13, 7/15, 8/18, 9/20, 10/23, 11/26, 12/28, 13/31, 14/34, 15/37, or 16/40. 
 A toxic event will be defined as death or a CTCAE 4.0 grade 3/[ADDRESS_111888] deviations. Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon rank test will be used in univariate analyses of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. 
Overall response (CR + CRp + PR) rate and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated 
using a binomial distribution. Overall survival  and progression free survival functions will be 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The two-sided log-rank test will be used to examine the difference of survival functions among diffe rent groups. Toxicity will be reported by [CONTACT_24975],

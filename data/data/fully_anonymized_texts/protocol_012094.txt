Background  
Lipodystrophy is a rare disease of deficient adipose mass, characterized by [CONTACT_81773], diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, acute pancreatitis, and early cardiovascular 
events.  Apolipoprotein C -III (apoC -III) regulates triglyceride metabolism, and apoC -III levels strongly 
correlate with serum triglycerides in a variety of patient populations. Patients with genetically low levels of 
apoC-III have lower triglycerides and reduced cardiovascular disease, while individuals with genetically 
elevated levels of apoC-III have higher triglycerides and increased non -alcoholic fatty liver disease and 
insulin resistance .  Pharmacologic reduction of apoC-III using anti -sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) reduce 
triglycerides by ~60 -70% in a tested patient populations.  
 
Aim 
The purpose of this study is to determine if apoC-III reduction using an ASO to apoC-III (ISIS 304801) will 
reduce triglycerides and improve insulin resistance, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis in patients with 
lipodystrophy.   The primary hypothes is to be tested is: 
1. ISIS 304801 will reduce log10 fasting serum triglycerides . 
Secondary and tertiary hypotheses to be tested are: 
2. ISIS [ADDRESS_88964] is a  16-week , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
design.  Subjects will be treated with ISIS 304801 at a target dose of 300 mg per week  or placebo .  Following 
this phase, all subjects will enter a 12 month open -label extension in which they will receive active drug.  
Patients who experience benefit (triglyceride lowering ≥50%) may receive an additional 12 months of open -
label drug (up to 24 months, total). Measurement  of the primary outcome (serum triglycerides) and key 
secondary outcomes will be performed at baseline prior to the intervention, after 16 weeks  (primary and 
secondary outcomes) of blinded drug  or placebo, and after an additional 4 months of active drug in subjects 
initially randomized to placebo.

2. Introduction  
2.1 Lipodystrophy  
Lipodystrophy syndromes are a group of rare metabolic diseases characterized by [CONTACT_81774], 
diabetes, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_81716] 1-4.  These syndromes are categorized according to the 
distribution of fat loss into gene ralized or partial and according to the underlying etiology as inherited or 
acquired 2-4. This classification scheme yields 4 major lipo dystrophy subtypes: congenital generalized 
lipodystrophy, acquired generalized li podystrophy, familial partial lipodystrophy, and acquired partial 
lipodys trophy.  These syndromes constitute a significant medical unmet need as these patients are refractory to 
current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_81717] a ttempt to reduce the risk of 
serious associated complications (coronary artery disease, diabetic nephropathy, cirrhosis and pancreatitis).  
 
Deficiency of adipose tissue in patients with lipodystrophy leads to a deficiency of adipose -derived hormones, 
inclu ding leptin, which in turn contributes to the metabolic complications of lipodystrophy.   Between [ADDRESS_88967] results were achieved in pat ients with generalized lipodystrophy who had low 
leptin levels [mean (SD): 1.3 (1.1) ng/mL], while patients with PL who had a wider range of baseline leptin 
values [mean (SD): 4.9 (3.1) ng/mL] had a more varied and attenuated response.  Based on these data , 
metreleptin was approved by [CONTACT_81775]  2014, for patients with generalized, but not partial, 
lipodystrophy.  Because of the risks associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies and 
lymphoma, Myalept is available only through a risk e valuation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program, 
which requires prescriber and pharmacy certific ation and special documentation 15.  
 
The current study focuses on partial lipodystrophy for which there is no specific treatment  and an unmet 
medical need . Partial Lipodystrophy (PL) has a higher prevalence (estimated ~2 -3 in one million) than 
generalized lipodystrophy, but the true prevalenc e is unknown because these patients are greatly under -
diagnosed 2,3.  Like generalized lipodystrophy, both genetic and acquired forms exist. Acquired 
lipodystrophies may be  caused by [CONTACT_6589], autoimm une mechanisms or other unknown mechanisms 
    10

Submitted  to IRB :   (idiopathic). An acquired form seen in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on protease 
inhibitors has become the most prevalent form of PL, with an estimate of 100,[ADDRESS_88968] is mainly clinical and needs to be considered in patients presenting with the triad of 
insulin resistance (with or without overt diabetes), significant dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_81718], and fatty liver  16. Patients often present with diabetes and severe insulin resistance 
requiring high doses of insulin. Other evidence of severe insulin resistance is provided by [CONTACT_81776] (with symptoms like hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea). Some patients 
develop severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting i n epi[INVESTIGATOR_81719]. In many patients, the TG levels 
remain persistently elevated despi[INVESTIGATOR_81720]. Radiographic evidence of 
hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis with hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases is  common 17.  
 
Careful clinical assessment of fat distribution through visual and physical examination can confirm the 
diagnosis. Patients with FPL have reduced subcutaneous fat in the limbs and truncal regions and may have 
excess subcutaneous fat deposition in neck, face and intra -abdominal regions. Patients with the Dunnigan 
variety have normal body fat distribution in chi ldhood and gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the 
extremities and trunk around the time of puberty. In women, the loss of fat may be most striking in the 
buttocks and hips. At the same time these patients accumulate fat on the face (“double chin”), neck and upper 
back (“Cushingoid appearance with buffalo hump”).   The extent of adipose tissue loss usually determines the 
severity of the metabolic abnormalities. Patients display prominent muscularity and phlebomegaly (enlarged 
veins) in the extremities and c omplain of disproportionate hyperphagia. The condition in females is more 
easily recognized than in men, and so is reported more often. Patients may also have a family history of 
similar physical appearance and/or fat loss.  Genetic testing, when available , is confirmatory. 2,16,18 
  
Current treatment includes lifestyle modification such as reducing caloric intake and increasing energy 
expenditure via exercise. Conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_81721] (metformin, 
thiazolidinediones, GLP -1s, insulin), and/or high TGs (dietary fat restriction, fibrates, fish oils) are not very 
efficacious in these patients 3. 
 
Partial Lipodystrophy is an orphan indication for which there is a significant unmet medical need. 
Diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia associated with this condition can lead to serious complications 17 
such as:  
• Acute pancreatitis, especially when triglyceride levels are >1,000 mg/dL  
• Accelerated microvascular complicatio ns from uncontrolled diabetes  
• Accelerated cardiovascular disease from lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance  
• Steatohepatitis that can progress to cirrhosis  
• Proteinuric nephropathies which can progress to end stage renal disease  
  
In patients with generalized lipodystrophy the metabolic complications are partially related to leptin 
deficiency, and can be ameliorated in part by [CONTACT_81777]. However, leptin deficiency alone cannot 
explain the severity of metabolic disease in pa tients with PL who have variable leptin levels. Unpublished

data from our group  showed that elevated apoC -III plays a role in the hypertriglyceridemia seen in both 
generalized lipodystrophy and PL and might therefore represent a therapeutic target in these  patients.  
 
These data show (left graph) that apoC -III is significantly higher in lipodystrophy patients compared to age, 
sex, and race matched obese controls (30.4 ± 22.7 mg/dL in lipodystrophy versus 16.1 ± 6.9 in controls, 
p<0.0001).  In addition, apoC -III levels are very strongly correlated with triglyceride levels in patients with 
lipodystrophy (right graph, R2 = 0.52, p<0.0001), such that an elevated triglyceride level is highly predictive 
of an elevated apoC -III level.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By [CONTACT_81778] -III and TG levels, ISIS [ADDRESS_88969] and 
reduce their risk of acute pancreatitis. In addition, apoC -III inhibition may also improve insulin sensitivity in 
these patients and potentially lead to a reducti on in the complications associated with diabetes. It is unknown 
whether this mechanism could improve hepatic steatosis and reduce cirrhosis risk.  
 
2.2 Therapeutic Rationale  
ApoC -III is a 79 amino acid glycoprotein synthesized principally in the liver 19 (Figure 1). ApoC -III is a 
major regulator of lipoprotein metabolism and plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_37496] 20. It is a 
component of TG -rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and a potent inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL ) 21. At higher 
concentrations, apoC -III also inhibits the activity of hepatic lipase 22, an enzyme which plays an important role 
in the conversion of dense VLDL to intermediate -density lipoprotein (IDL) and to LDL 23, as well as in the 
remodeling of HDL 24. In addition, increased apoC -III content adversely affects apoE -mediated hepatic 
uptake of TG -rich remnants 25. Thus, elevated plasma apoC -III levels are associated with impaired hydrolysis 
and retarded clearance of TG -rich particles, resulting in the accumulation of VLDL -TG and chylomicrons in 
plasma and the development of hypertriglyceridem ia 26.

In humans, decreased apoC -III has been associated with low triglycerides and protection from cardiovascular 
disease, while gene variants with elevated apoC -III have been associated with high triglycerides and fatty 
liver disease. A heterozygous null mutation in the apoC -III gene (R19X) in Old Order Amish individuals 
causing life -long apoC -III deficiency (~50% of normal) resulted in lower plasma TG levels (fasting and post -
prandial), a cardioprotective lipid profile (i.e., higher HDL -C and lower LDL -C) and reduced atherosclerosis 
(as measured by [CONTACT_81780]) compare d with noncarriers 27.  
 
Jorgensen et al. had similar findings and showed that lifelong low levels of nonfasting triglycerides due to 
three loss -of-function mutations (R19X, IVS2+1G→A, A43T) in apoC -III were associated with reduced risk 
of ischemic heart disease in the ge neral population 28. Recent genetic studies involving mendelian 
randomization suggest that this association may be causal 29,30.  By [CONTACT_22242], gain of function polymorphisms 
in Apo -CIII that  lead to lifelong increases in Apo -CIII have been associated with increased triglycerides and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

The clinical effects of  apo-CIII inhibition in hypertriglyceridemia have been  recently published. In one study, 
apoC -III inhibition with ISIS [ADDRESS_88970] reduction of 
apoC-III levels, with concomitant 56 -86% reduction in fasting trig lycerides 33. 
 
In patients with lipodystrophy, preliminary data from our group has demonstrated that apo-CIII levels are 
elevated  compared to controls , and correlate strongly with triglycerides  34.  Moreover, triglyceride reductions 
with leptin replacement correlated with reductions in apo-CIII.  These data support the idea that apo-CIII 
excess plays a r ole in the hypertriglyceridemia of lipodystrophy, and that apo-CIII lowering could represent a 
promising therapeutic target in this condition.  
 
2.3 ISIS 304801  
2.3.1 Mechanism of Action  
ISIS 304801 is a second -generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) dru g targeted to human apoC -III. It is 
complementary to a region within the 3ʹ untranslated region of the apoC -III mRNA and binds to the mRNA 
by [CONTACT_37800]. The hybridization (binding) of ISIS  304801 to the cognate mRNA results 
in the RNase  H-mediated degradation of the apoC -III mRNA, thus preventing production of the apoC -III 
protein. Maximal antisense -mediated reduction of target mRNA levels is typi[INVESTIGATOR_37497] 90% of control 
levels in sensitive tissues 35,36. Furthermore, reduction in target mRNA levels using this approach correlates 
directly with a subsequent reduction in target protein levels.  
 
2.3.2 Chemistry  
Chemically, ISIS  304801 is a synthetic chimeric oligomer of 20 nucleotide s (i.e., a 20 -mer) that are connected 
sequentially by [CONTACT_37693]. The nucleotide sequence of ISIS  304801 ( Figure 2) is 
complementary to a 20-nucleotide stretch within the 3ʹ untranslated region of the apoC -III mRNA transcript at 
base position 489 -508. Structurally, the oligonucleotide has 3 regions. Two of them, the 5 nucleotides at the 5′ 
end and the 5 nucleotides at the 3′ end, are compo sed of 2ʹ -O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE) -modified 
ribonucleotides. These MOE -modified nucleotides confer (1) increased affinity to the target mRNA 37,38, (2) 
increased resistance to exonucleases and endonucleases (thereby [CONTACT_81781] i n tissue) 39, and (3) 
amelioration of some of the high dose toxicities thereby [CONTACT_81782] (DNA) 40. The 
third region, the central portion of the oligonucleotide, is composed of 10 o ligodeoxynucleotides. This 
chimeric design is called a MOE -Gapmer, and ISIS  304801 employs this chimeric structure to enable use of 
the RNase H -mechanism for antisense activity. This is because while the 2ʹ -MOE modifications confer 
increased stability and affinity, they do not support RNase H catalysis of RNA hybridized to 2ʹ -MOE -
modified nucleotides 38. This is caused by [CONTACT_37802] 2ʹ -
alkoxy:RNA hybrids that are not recognized by [CONTACT_37695] H enzymes 41,42. By [CONTACT_81783] 2ʹ -MOE 
modifications to nucleotides flanking the phosphoro thioate oligodeoxynucleotide core, the beneficial 
attributes of the 2ʹ -MOE chemistry are preserved while also retaining RNase H recognition.

2.3.3 Preclinical Experience  
Inhibition of apoC -III using ISIS  304801 h as been shown to potently reduce hepatic apoC -III mRNA as well 
as plasma apoC -III protein and TG in a dose - and time -dependent fashion in several species, including human 
apoC -III transgenic mice, and other rodent and monkey models. Treatment with ISIS  304801 also resulted in 
reduced VLDL and chylomicron TG and reduced postprandial TG in hypertriglyceridemic monkeys 43. 
 
The pharmacoki netics (PK) and toxicity of ISIS  [ADDRESS_88971] been assessed in mice, rats, and cynomolgus 
monkeys. General toxicity studies with ISIS  304801 for up to 39 weeks of treatment followed by a 20 -week 
recovery period are complete. The preclinical toxicology progr am for ISIS  304801 consists of single -dose 
safety pharmacology studies in the monkey (cardiovascular) and mouse (neurobehavioral and pulmonary 
assessment studies), in vitro  and in vivo  genetic toxicity assessment, repeat -dose fertility and/or 
developmental  reproductive toxicology studies in the mouse and rabbit and evaluation in the in vitro  human 
Ether -á-go-go -related gene (hERG) assay.  
 
ISIS 304801 treatment -related findings in mice and monkeys were generally consistent with those expected 
for the 2′ -MOE -class of ASOs. Treatment -related findings included effects consistent with drug accumulation 
in tissues in rodents and monkeys, species -dependent proinflammatory response in rodents and monkeys and 
complement activation and reductions in platelet counts i n the monkey. In the mouse and monkey general 
toxicity studies, reduction of hepatic apoC -III mRNA (>75%) was not associated with any findings that could 
be considered related to the pharmacologic inhibition of apoC -III for up to [ADDRESS_88972] doses tested where drug 
exposure w as higher than that in rodents.  Because these changes were not observed in monkeys, the fi ndings 
in the heart are considered to be rodent -specific and not relevant to humans. Nevertheless, such effects are 
monitorable by [CONTACT_81784]  T that will be included in this clinical 
study.

genotoxic (in vitro and in vivo). ISIS  304801 had no effects on fertility or embryo/fetal development in the 
mouse or rabbit reproductive toxicity studies. In these studies, ISIS 304801 was detected in placental tissue 
but not in fetal tissue indicating that little, if any, drug was able to cross the placenta to reach the fetus. 
Reduction of apoC -III mRNA (64% in males and 47% in females) also did not affect fertility or cause  
untoward effects on embryo/fetal development in mice.

ISIS 304801 Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
2.3.4 Clinical Experience  
Detailed information concerning t he clinical studies conducted with ISIS 304801 can be found in the ISIS 
304801 Investigator’s Brochure.  A summary is included below.  
 
ISIS 304801 has been evaluated in one Phase 1 study and two Phase 2 studies, all double blinded and placebo 
controlled.  The total exposures comprise 99 patients and healthy volunteers administered ISIS 304801 from 
50 to 400 mg subcutaneously up to 3 months (compared to 37  administered placebo).  
 
All clinical trials of ISIS  [ADDRESS_88974] shown very large and clinically meaning ful reductions in fasting apoC -
III and TG (~80% and 70%, respectively, mean reduction from baseline with 300  mg dose) with a very high 
degree of consistency of response between the different patient groups.  This includes healthy volunteers, 
patients with moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia not on background TG -lowering therapy, patients with 
moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia on a background of stable fibrate therapy, patients with Familial 
Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS), and patients with hypertr iglyceridemia and T2DM.  Comparison of the 
effects of ISIS  304801 at the 300 mg/week dose across several patient populations is shown in Table 2.

Submitted  to IRB :   fructosamine, glycated albumin, and HbA1c a nd by [CONTACT_746] a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at 
baseline and at the end of the treatment period.   
 
Statistically significant decreases were observed in the mean change from Baseline in % glycated albumin and 
in fructosamine [ADDRESS_88976] d ose and in HbA1c and fructosamine at the end of the Follow -up Period 
([ADDRESS_88977] dose).  These significant effects later in the Follow -up Period were likely a result of 
the long duration of response of ISIS  304801.  Trends were also observed t owards improvement in all 
measures of peripheral insulin sensitivity, but the small sample size of patients with valid clamps performed 
within the protocol -specified time window likely precluded statistical significance.  
 
In clinical studies conducted to d ate, ISIS  [ADDRESS_88978] on the

aminotransferase [AST], bilirubin) despi[INVESTIGATOR_81722] [ADDRESS_88979] -treatment period and was no t associated with platelet -related adverse events (AEs).  
 
The most frequently observed AEs with ISIS  [ADDRESS_88980] 2 days (~15% of 
injections), were almost always mild, resolved spontaneously, were non -progressive, and were not associated 
with systemic sequelae.  
 
2.4 Ra tionale for Dose and Schedule of Administration  
The dose and schedule selected for this study is 300 mg of ISIS  304801 or placebo per week for 16 weeks , 
followed by a 12 month open label extension of 300 mg of ISIS  304801 per week . Patients who experience 
benefit (triglyceride lowering ≥50 may receive an additional 12 months of open label drug (up to 24 months, 
total). The dose of [ADDRESS_88981] level ( NOAEL) was defined by [CONTACT_81785]. Nonclinical 
findings were not considered to be related to the pharmacologic inhibition of apoC -III. 
 
The safety data to date  suggest that ISIS  304801 has been well tolerated at dose levels up to 300 mg in 
patients with high TG (including type 2 diabetes patients and administration in combination with fibrates and 
statins) with the most common AEs being local to the injection si te and predominantly mild. A pooled 
analysis of safety for the Phase 2 studies did not demonstrate any clear difference in safety or tolerability 
between the different doses tested (100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg per week for 13 weeks). Analysis of the 
cohorts  in which ISIS  304801 was studied at different doses demonstrates dose -dependent pharmacology with

5. Statistical Considerations  
5.1 Sample Size Justification  
The primary outcome variable is the change in log10 fasting triglycerides from before treatment to 16weeks of 
active drug treatment  compared to placebo groups .  
Preliminary data are available for 28 patients treated with ISIS 304801 and 24 treated with placebo.  For the 
ISIS 304801 group, these data show a d ifference from baseline to follow -up of -423 (SD 400, 95% CI -578 to 
-268) mg/dL and -0.485 (SD 0.221, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.40) log10 mg/dL.  Converting the difference in log10 
mg/dL to a percent change [100*(10^ -0.485 -1)] results in a percent change of -67 % (95% CI -73% to -60%). 
For the placebo group, the absolute change is -12 (SD 406, 95% CI -12 to 184) mg/dL and -0.011 (SD 0.224, 
95% CI -0.105 to 0.084) log10 mg/dL.  The percent change for the placebo group is -3% (95% CI -21% to 
21%.   
 
    23 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   For comparison o f placebo and ISIS [ADDRESS_88993] chosen a SD of 0.25 log10 mg/dL and a difference of 
0.50 log10 mg/dL. A trial with 5 patients in each group has 79% power to detect a difference of 0.50 log10 
mg/dL triglycerides in the change from baseline to follow -up be tween the ISIS and placebo groups, assuming 
a SD of 0.25 log10 mg/dL and a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  
 
 
Where preliminary data were available, sample size calculations were performed for secondary and tertiary 
study outcomes in addition to the p rimary outcome.  The preliminary data and power estimates for a sample 
size of 10 subjects (using one -sample t -test for off versus on drug comparisons) are summarized in the table 
below.  Based on these calculations, the study should be adequately powered to detect differences in total 
body insulin sensitivity, hepatic insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose, apoC -III serum level, HDL -C, VLDL -C, 
and apolipoprotein B48 .  
 
Based on these calculations, we plan to enroll a maximum of 20 patients, with a goal of 10  patients 
completing the study  (defined as completing 16 weeks of active drug treatment) . The accrual ceiling of 20 is 
planned because subjects will consent to the study prior to screening, thus we are accounting for up to 10 
screen failures in the accrual  ceiling.

6.3.4 In-person follow -up visits  
Patients will come to NIH for follow -up visits every 4 months.  Testing will be performed as per the Study 
Schedule (Appendix A)  
 
6.3.5 Home nurse visits  
Home nurse visits  for safety and/or efficacy labs and vital signs will be conducted every  week  (unless  the 
patient is coming for an in -person visit)  for the duration of the study , as detailed in Appendix A.  Home (or 
visits at a location convenient for the subject) visits will be completed by [CONTACT_81792], sourced 
through a home health care agency, Global Care Clinical Trials.   Service providers will receive detailed 
training on all necessary study proc edures and are also required to comply with patient privacy and data 
protection laws as well as regulatory guidelines for Good Clinical Practices and ICH guidelines.   Home health 
care is provided to ease patient burden while still allowing for adequate saf ety monitoring. If feasible, patients 
can also complete these visits as outpatient visits at the NIH clinical center .  Visits will be approximately [ADDRESS_89002] of the lab tests is required by [CONTACT_4289].  Patients will be made aware there is a

All visits (home and in -person) will have a visit window of at least +/ - [ADDRESS_89003] 6 months of the open label extensi on, and every 2 months thereafter (unless the patient is coming 
for an in-person visit), as detailed in Appendix A.  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_89004]-Treatment  
After completion of the open label extension (week 68), patients will enter the [ADDRESS_89005] -treatment evaluation period, patients may choose to re ceive an 
additional 12 months of open label drug (up to 24 months, total).  They will be offered this option if their 
triglycerides improved by ≥ 50%.  Justification for this additional extension are:  
 
a.  The patients received ≥50% improvement in triglyce rides and they have no other effective 
treatment options.  
b. To collect additional safety data over a longer term  
c. To collect additional efficacy data over a longer term  
 
Home health care visits will not be available during the extended open -label period.  Pat ients must obtain 
platelet and other safety monitoring locally through their health insurance provider or pay out of pocket .  This 
monitoring will include weekly CBC for platelet count, and monthly CBC with differential, lipid panel, 
coagulation studies, u rine protein:creatinine ratio, liver function tests, and chemistry panel.  Hemoglobin A1c 
will be measured every [ADDRESS_89006] listed in section 6.4 except liver biopsy.  All concomitant medications, including those for diabetes or 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], may be adjusted as clinically appropriate per the judgment of the investigator during the 
extended open -label  period.  
 
6.3.8 Follow -up Visits for Early Termination from Treatment Period

6.4 Study Assessments  
 
6.4.1 Patient Reported Outcomes  
1. Hunger and Widespread Pain Diaries : All patients will complete hunger and pain questionnaires at 
each in -person v isit. (Appendix H).  
 
2. Quality of Life Assessments :  All patients will complete Quality of Life Questionnaires (EQ -5D and 
SF-36) at each in -person visit.   (Appendix F & G).  
 
6.4.2 Detailed Metabolic Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
1. Anthropometric measurements:  Physical exams and vital signs will be performed as indicated in the 
Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A).  Height will be measured in the early morning on the first full 
day of the first inpatient visit. Vital signs will include weight, blood pressure, pu lse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_81725].  Blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded after the patient has been 
in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes.  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should always be 
measured on the same arm (pref erentially on the left arm).  Waist circumference will be measured at 
the iliac crest in triplicate to the nearest tenth of a cm using a stretch -less, tension -sensitive tape 
measure  at the times indicated in the Schedul e of Procedures (Appendix A).  Skinfo ld measurements 
will be obtained in triplicate to the nearest mm using regularly calibrated Lange skinfold calipers at 
the times indicated in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A).

CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   2. Fasting labs : Blood samples will be obtained following a minimum [ADDRESS_89011] for analytes described 
in Appendi x A. Ideally the morning blood draw will be coordinated so that it will be collected 10 
hours after the evening meal.  Additional serum and plasma samples will be stored for future analysis.  
 
3. DEXA scan for total body composition :  DEXA scans will be conducted prior to administration of the 
first dose of study drug and repeated after the 16 week placebo controlled period, and again after 16 
weeks of open -label drug in those previously assigned to placebo.   A DEXA scan (iDXA, GE 
Healthcare, Madison WI) will be performed to determine total and regional body fat and lean soft 
tissue masses, bone mineral content and density. D EXA produces photons at two different energy 
levels, 40 and 70 KeV. The photons pass through tissues and attenuate at rates related t o elemental 
composition. Bone mineral, with highly attenuating calcium and phosphorous, is readily distinguished 
from soft tissues. The different elemental profiles of fat and bone -mineral free lean components 
allows for the analysis of soft tissue fat con tent, so that bone mineral, fat, and bone mineral fat -free 
lean components may be resolved.   
 
4. Glucose and Lipid Turnover:  Stable isotope tracers will be used to measure glucose and lipid 
turnover.  Endogenous glucose production will be measured using stead y-state infusion of [6,6 -
2H2]glucose tracer.  The fractional rate of gluconeogenesis will be measured using steady -state oral 
dosing of deuterated water ( 2H2O) 45. The rate of lipolysis will be measured using steady -state 
infusion of deuterium -labeled 2H5-glycerol, and the fatty acid turnover rate will be measured using 
steady -state infusion of [U-13C16] palmitate .  Subjects will fast after [ADDRESS_89012]’s body water pool to approximately 0.5% 2H2O.  Beginning a t 
~5 am,   a primed [6,6 -2H2]glucose infusion will be given for 3 hours, after which blood samples to 
measure isotope enrichment will be measured over a period of 30 minutes at steady state.  Two hours 
after the [6,6 -2H2]glucose infusion begins, a primed 2H5-glycerol infusion, and unprimed [U-13C16] 
palmitate  infusion will be given for one hour, and isotope enrichment will be measured over a period 
of 30 minutes at steady state.  To assess the effects of hyperinsulinemia on glucose turnover, the 
glucose trac er infusion will be continued during the euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp study, 
below, with blood samples for tracer enrichment obtained during the steady -state period of the clamp.  
 
5. Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp :  This is the gold-standard test to measure insulin sensitivity.  
For insulin treated subjects, an overnight insulin drip may be given beginning at [ADDRESS_89013], insulin will be infused at a dose of 120 
mcU/m 2*minute.   This dose is designed to suppress endogenous glucose production and near -
maximally stimulate glucose uptake in this group of very insulin resistant subjects.  20% dextrose 
enriched with 2.5% [6,6 -2H2]glucose tracer will be infused at a vari able rate to maintain blood 
glucose at approximately 100 mg/dL.  If subjects remain hyperglycemic without dextrose infusion 
after 1 hour of insulin infusion (by [CONTACT_81793]), a higher steady 
state blood glucose concentrati on for the clamp may be used . During the insulin infusion, blood 
samples (0.5 mL) will be obtained every 5 minutes to measure blood glucose at the bedside.   At 
steady state, the rate of dextrose infusion provides an estimate of insulin -stimulated glucose d isposal.  
Additional samples will be drawn to measure the glucose and lipid tracers (described above), insulin, 
    31 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   and other hormone levels.  If technical problems occur with a clamp study (e.g. IV failure or failure to 
attain steady -state glucose and insulin  levels), the clamp may be repeated if blood volume limits 
permit.  
 
6. Mixed meal test : The effect of a standardized liquid meal (Boost -plus) with fixed, balanced 
macronutrient content will be assessed.   Blood samples will be obtained for glucose, insulin, C -
peptide, lipid analysis, and research storage at -10, 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes after 
consuming the liquid meal.  Visual analog scales for hunger and satiety will be obtained at the  0 and  
60 minute time point s. 
 
7. Lipoprotein lipase acti vity: Measurement of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities in plasma 
will be performed using blood samples obtained 10 minutes after  intravenous infusion of 60 units/kg 
of unfractionated heparin using the methods of Iverius and Nilsson -Ehle 46,47.  Lipoprotein lipase and 
hepatic li pase are bound to vessel walls and only released into the blood with an infusion of heparin.  
 
8. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) :  H epatic, 
muscle and central body fat will be measured by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI) and magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Studies are performed on a 3T MRI scanner using phased -array coils. 
Hepatic and muscle fat fraction will be determined 48.  Visceral a nd subcutaneous fat measurements 
will be obtained using standard T1 Spin Echo technique which presents fat as a bright signal that can 
be segmented for area and volume measurements.  In addition, MRI scanning will be performed for 
angiography (without gadol inium), vessel wall, and endothelial function 49. Each subject will be asked 
to perform a hand -grip exercise to obtain arterial dimensions. Before entering the magnet, we shall  
measure the maximal force production while hand squeezing a nonmagnetic hand -grip device. Later 
in the magnet at roughly one quarter of his/her maximal force, we will obtain MR data before, during, 
and after this exercise. The use of the device will be co ntinuously monitored and the subject will be 
able to switch hands if one hand becomes fatigued.  
 
9. Carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT) :  cIMT is an established marker of coronary artery disease 
and cardiovascular risk.  This is a non -invasive test using ultrasonography of the carotid arteries in the 
neck.   
 
10. 7-point plasma glucose : Plasma glucose will be measured prior to each meal,  90 minutes  after each 
meal, and at bedtime.  Area under the curve for glucose will be calculated using the trapezoidal  
method.  
 
11. Liver biopsy : An optional liver biopsy will be performed in patients at the initial visit and at the end 
of the open label extension period (after 12 -16 months of exposure to ISIS 304801). Biopsies will be 
performed transcutaneously  unless there is a clinical reason for another approach (e.g. transjugular).   
These biopsies are performed primarily for research purposes, although clinical data about the 
severity of non -alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) wil l 
be obtained as well.  Patients will sign a research consent for each liver biopsy prior to the procedure.  
Patients will be allowed to refuse the biopsies and continue to participate in the rest of the study.  
Platelet count will be obtained prior to per cutaneous  liver biopsy , and the biopsy will not be

platelets (Platelets < 75,000 k/uL) which may place them at a potentially higher risk for bleeding.  
About ha lf of the liver biopsy sample will be fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen and will be stored for 
molecular analyses and Metabolomics studies in collaboration with [CONTACT_17914] at the University of 
Michigan . 
 
Histologic analysis : Specimens will be graded for the severity of NAFLD/NASH pathology. 
Histological features of NAFLD/NASH will be studied using the validated NASH -CRN (NASH 
Clinical Research Network) scoring system (3). This scoring system comprises histological features, 
4 of which [steatosis (0 -3), lobular inflammation (0 -3), hepatocellular ballooning (0 -2) and fibrosis 
(0-3 with grade 1 divided in three categories as well)] are evaluated semi -quantitatively.  NAFLD 
activity score (NAS) is the unweighted sum of steatosis, l obular inflammation and hepatocellular 
ballooning scores. Total of this together with the fibrosis score constitutes the total NASH score.   
 
12. Metabolomics:   Studies will be done in the Molecular Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_81726]. Elif Oral.  
Plasma samples collected in the fasting state and liver biopsy samples will be extract ed according to 
the method of Bligh and Dyer 50 for analysis.   Lipomic studies will include measurement of 
subclasses of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_81727].  Unbiased metabolomics studies of plasma will be 
conducted using LC/MS an d GC/MS.   
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_89014] a single (not serial) plasma PK completed at the end of their week 1 visit.  The plasma 
PK of ISIS  304801 following extensive sampling will be assessed at Week 16 ( Week 1 OLE)  for all subjects , 
and Week s 32 (Month 4 OLE).  Additionally, plasma trough levels throughout the [ADDRESS_89015] data s et.  The maximum observed drug concentration (C max) and the 
time taken to reach C max (Tmax) will be obtained directly from the concentration -time data.  Partial areas under 
the plasma concentration -time curve from zero time (predose) to selected times (t) after the SC administration 
(AUC t) will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule.  The plasma disposition half -life associated (t 1/2λz) 
with the apparent terminal elimination phase will be calculated using a non -compartment method, if 
appropriate, u sing available data (Week 68 and later), from the equation t 1/2λz=0.693λ z, where λ z is the rate 
constant associated with the apparent terminal elimination phase.  A minimum of three data points will be 
used to define z and the correlation of determination values (r 2) had to be at or greater than 0.8 for the 
estimate to be accepted.  The samples at Week 68 (assumed pre -dose value for Week 69), Week 74, and

Potential relationships between selected PD and PK measures may also be explored, where deemed 
appropriate.  
 
6.4. 4 Immunogenicity Analysis  
 
Immuno genicity (IM) results (screen positive/negative, confirmed positive/negative or unevaluable, and when 
applicable, titer of anti -ISIS 304801 antibodies) before, during, and after treatment with study drug 
(ISIS  304801) (i.e., sample ADA status) will be list ed by [CONTACT_10637].  Subject ADA status 
(positive/negative or unevaluable) for all evaluable patients, along with the study day associated with the first 
positive IM status emerged (T first, i.e., onset of ADA development), the last positive IM s tatus observed (T last), 
the duration of ADA response (number of days between T first and T last) if appropriate, the last ADA sample 
collection day, and subject maximum titer if applicable, will be listed by [CONTACT_10637].   
 
Additionally, the samp le and subject IM incidence (number) and incidence rate (percent) will be summarized 
as the total number and percent of evaluated subjects with antibody negative, positive, and unknown status by

7.1.[ADDRESS_89021] (DSMB) will be assembled by [CONTACT_81798], tolerability and efficacy (as needed) data collected on ISIS  304801 
during this study.  The membership of the DSMB will be d etermined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_81732].   Based on its ongoing assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS  304801, the DSMB will 
provide recommendations to the Principle Investigator for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81733]. The DSMB will meet approximately 3 times per year  (exact schedule to be determined by [CONTACT_81799]), and additional ad hoc meetings may be called by [CONTACT_81800] (e.g. unexpected death of study participant, new serious safety issue identified in the drug develo pment 
program).  Study data (blinded during the initial 4 month placebo controlled period) will be provided to the 
DSMB via from the study database  maintained by  [CONTACT_81801].  The NIDDK statistician will have 
access to the unblinding scheme , and can provide  this to the DSMB on request.  The Investigator will review 
and respond to the DSMB recommendations in writing. Any recommendations of the DSMB will not be 
binding but require due consideration by [CONTACT_81802]/ NIAMS IRB. If the 
DSMB recommends continuation of the study without modification, no formal response will be required. 
However, if the recommendations request action, such as a recommendation for termination of the study or 
modification of the protocol, th e Investigator will provide a formal written response to the DSMB stating 
whether the recommendations will be followed and the plan for addressing the issues.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_89022] to audits and/or monitoring visits to en sure compliance with the protocol and 
applicable regulatory requirements consistent with the NIDDK quality assurance program plan.  Audit and/or 
monitoring visit results will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_81734].   
Study documents and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81735].   
 
As required by [CONTACT_8415] 21 CFR 312.50 (and NIH OHSRP’s SOP 23), trial procedures will be subject to review 
and/or monitoring visits to ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable regulatory requirements with 
the NIDDK quality assurance program plan.  Aud it and/or monitoring visits results will be reported to the 
Principal Investigator/Sponsor for further reporting to the FDA consistent  with applicable regulations.  The 
specific monitoring plan will be developed with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_81736] y of monitoring visits 
determined by [CONTACT_81803], data collection status and regulatory obligations.  Study 
documents and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81737] h the protocol plan.  
 
7.1.4 Adjudication Committees  
All SAEs that occur during the study that are consistent with a major acute cardiovascular event (MACE) will 
be adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee as outlined in the MACE Adjudication Charter .

CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :    
All AEs and SAEs that occur during the study that are consistent with an event of acute pancreatitis will be 
adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee according to the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis 51 
and as outlined in the Pancreatitis Adjudication Charter.  In addition, data for prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_81738] s or suspected pancreatitis will be collected by [CONTACT_81804]’s medical chart and these 
events will also be adjudicated.  
7.2 Adverse Events, Protocol Deviations, and Unanticipated Problems  
The collection, monitoring and analysis of adverse events  will be the responsibility of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_81739].   
 
7.2.1 Definitions  
Adverse  events,  protocol  deviations,  unanticipated  problems  (UP),  serious  adverse  events,  sponsor  and serious,  
are defined  as described  in NIH HRPP  SOP 16 (“Reporting  Requirements  for Unanticipated  Problems,  
Adverse  Events  and Protocol  Deviations.”)  with further details and modifications given below . All adverse  
events  occurring  during  the study,  including  those  observed by  [CONTACT_81805],  will be 
recorded, and will be summarized for the NIDDK/NIAMS IRB by [CONTACT_81806].   
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the Study or use of 
investigational drug product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the investigational drug product.  
 
Adverse Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is a ny AE caused by [CONTACT_81807]. A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug  caused the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a  lesser 
degree of certainty about causality  than an adverse reaction.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is any AE that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the  following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening: that is, p oses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10461] 24 ho urs to a medical facility and does not 
always qualify as an AE . 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
    37 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   • Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the patient (whether the patient is 
male or female)  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10462], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may je opardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blo od dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
Protocol Deviation:   
Any change, divergence, or departure from the NIDDK/NIAMS  IRB-approved research protocol. The impact 
of a PD is characterized by [CONTACT_81808].  A protocol deviation is serious if it meets 
the definition of a Serious Adverse Event (see above) or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of 
subjects or others . 
 
7.2.2 Mo nitoring and Recording Adverse Events  
Any pre -existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the Study (i.e., 
before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as AEs unless the pre -
existing condition worsened. The Investigator should always group signs and symptoms into a single term 
that constitutes a single unifying diagnosis if possible.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
The collection of SAEs will begin after the patient signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the 
patient’s follow -up period. When the Investigator is reporting by [CONTACT_756], it is important to speak to 
someone in person versus leaving a messa ge. An Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be completed 
and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor and to Ionis or designee.  
 
Detailed information should be actively sought and included on Follow -Up Serious Adverse  Event Forms as 
soon as additional in formation becomes available. All SAEs will be followed  until resolution. SAEs that 
remain ongoing past the patient’s last protocol -specified follow -up visit will be evaluated by [CONTACT_81809] . If the Investigator and Ionis agree the  patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator will 
determine the follow -up requirement.  
 
Non-Serious Adverse Events  
The recording of non -serious AEs will begin after the patient signs the informed consent form and will stop at 
the end of the patient’s  follow -up period. The Investigator will monitor each patient closely and record all 
observed or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report Form.  
 
7.2.3 Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious)  
The Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_81740] g should be documented on the Adverse Event Case Report Form:  
 
Relatedness  
    38 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   The event’s relationship to the Study Drug (ISIS 304801 or placebo) is characterized by [CONTACT_31806] (1) of the 
following:  
• Related: There is clear evidence that the event is related to the u se of Study Drug, e.g., confirmation 
by [CONTACT_38000] -challenge test  
• Possible: The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition, concomitant therapy, or 
other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 
304801 or placebo) administration  
• Unlikely/Remote: An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., concomitant 
medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal relationship to Study Drug (ISIS 304801 
or placebo) adm inistration and/or exposure suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely (For 
reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be grouped together with Not Related)  
• Not Related: The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s underlying medical condition, 
concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator believes no relationship exists 
between the event and Study Drug  
 
Severity  
The event’s severity is characterized by [CONTACT_080]:  
• Mild: The event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_10553]’s usual daily activities  
• Moderate: The event causes the patient more discomfort and interrupts the patient’s usual daily 
activities  
• Severe: The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with the pa tient’s usual daily 
activities  
 
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria must be indicated.   
 
Action Taken with Study Drug  
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 304801 or placebo) due to the event is characterized by [CONTACT_81810]. 
• None: No changes were made to Study Drug (ISIS 304801 or placebo) administration and dose  
• Permanently Discontinued: Study drug was discontinued and not restarted  
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose: Dosing was temporarily interrupted or dela yed due 
to the AE and restarted at the same dose  
• Reduced Dose: Dosing frequency was reduced  
 
Treatment Given for Adverse Event  
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for t he AE should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
Case Report Form. Treatment should also  be recorded on the concomitant treatment or ancillary procedures 
CRF, as appropriate.  
 
Outcome of the Adverse Event  
If the event is a non -serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by [CONTACT_080]:  
• AE Persists: Pati ent terminates from the trial and the AE continues  
• Recovered: Patient recovered completely from the AE  
    39 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   • Became Serious: The event became serious (the date that the event became serious should be 
recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the corresponding SAE)  
• Change in Severity (if applicable): AE severity changed  
 
If the event is an SAE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by [CONTACT_080]:  
• Ongoing: SAE continuing  
• Persists (as non -serious AE): Patient has not fully recovered but the event no longer  meets serious 
criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious AE eCRF (the  SAE resolution date 
should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered: Patient recovered completely from the SAE (the date o f recovery should be  entered as the 
SAE resolution date)  
• Fatal: Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
7.3  Reporting  
Serious  unanticipated  problems  and serious  protocol  deviations  will be reported  to the NIDDK/NIAMS  IRB 
and Clinical Director  as soon  as possible  but not more  than [ADDRESS_89023] learns  of the event.  Not 
serious  unanticipated  problems  will be reported  to the NIDDK/NIAMS  IRB and Clinical Director  as soon  as 
possible  but not more  than [ADDRESS_89024] learns  of the event.  Non-serious protocol deviations will 
be reported to the NIDDK/NIAMS  IRB (as soon as possible but not more than [ADDRESS_89025] learns 
of the event) only if they represent a departure from NIH policies  for the conduct of human subjects research, 
adversely affect the health care of the subject(s) or compromise the interpretation or integrity of the research.  
Non-serious protocol deviations that result from normal subject scheduling variations or technic al issues 
associated with sampling that does not impact the health of the subject or the interpretation of the study data 
will not be reported.  
 
For studies conducted under an IND, any event that is a serious, unexpected, and suspected adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) (related to study drug) will be reported by [CONTACT_81811], 
NIDDK /NIAMS  IRB, Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) , and Ionis Pharmaceuticals  as soon as possible 
and no later than 7  days  (for a death or life -threatening event) or 15  days  (for all other SAEs) after the 
investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the information.  All serious, unexpected, and suspected 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]RS) will be reported in aggregate at the ti me of continuing review.  
 
IND Safety Reports will be submitted to the FDA by [CONTACT_81812].  
 
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. If an ongoing SAE changes in 
its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new info rmation becomes available, a follow -up SAE report 
should be sent to the FDA.  All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
Deaths  will be reported  by [CONTACT_81813]/NIAMS  IRB 
within  [ADDRESS_89026] occurred among study participants  
since the previous review will be summarized at the time of continuing review.  
 
    40 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   7.[ADDRESS_89027] refrain from sperm/egg donation and practice effective 
contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form until at least  [ADDRESS_89028] dose 
of study treatment.  
 
For the purposes of this study, women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has 
experienced menarche, and who does not meet one of the following conditions:  
 
• Postmenopausal:  12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea in females >55 years of age or, in females 
≤55 years, 12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause  and FSH 
levels in the postm enopausal range for the laboratory involved  
 
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy  
• Post hysterectomy  
 
For the purposes of the study, effective contraception is defined as follows:  
For male patients:  
• Effective male contr aception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at follow -up, or the 
use of condoms together with spermicidal foam/gel/film/ cream/suppository .  Male patients must also 
encourage their female partner to use effective contraception from the time of signing the informed 
consent until 3 months after the patient’s last dose of study treatment.  Effective contraceptive for the 
female partner includes: surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), hormonal contraception, 
intrauterine contrac eption/device, or barrier methods (female condom*, diaphragm, sponge, cervical 
cap) together with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository .  Male patients with partners that are 
pregnant must use condoms to ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the st udy drug.  
For female patients:  
• Using 1 or more of the following acceptable methods of contraception:  surgical sterilization (e.g., 
bilateral tubal ligation), hormonal contraception, intrauterine contraception/device, or any 2 barrier 
methods (a combinatio n of male or female condom* with diaphragm, sponge, or cervical cap) 
together with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . 
*Note:  A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between the two can 
result in either product f ailing.  
 
If a patient becomes pregnant or a pregnancy is suspected, or if a male patient makes or believes that he has 
made someone pregnant during the study, then the Investigator  must be informed immediately.  An Initial 
Pregnancy Form should be submitte d to Ionis  or designee within [ADDRESS_89029] learning of the occurrence 
of pregnancy.  Follow -up information including delivery or termination is reported on Follow -up Pregnancy 
Forms and reported within 24 hours.  
 
Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the patient’s responsibility.  
 
    41 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   Female patients :  If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including follow -up), a pregnancy test 
will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed pregnancy will be i mmediately withdrawn from treatment 
with Study Drug.  However, the patient will be encouraged to complete the post -treatment follow -up portion 
of the study to the extent that study procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued 
study participation, the study physician will assist the patient in getting obstetrical care and the progress of the 
pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known  (i.e., delivery, elective termination, 
or spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Investigator and Ionis or 
designee  may require access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks after birth.  
 
Male patients :  The progress of the pregnancy in a male patient’s pa rtner should be followed until the 
outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion).  Male 
patients are not required to stop the study drug if their partner becomes pregnant.  If the pregnancy results in 
the birth of a child, additional follow -up information may be requested for the mother and infant.  Follow -up 
will be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_37726].  
7.4.[ADDRESS_89030] results may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], constitute or be 
associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results that are associated with 
symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bleeding du e to thrombocytopenia, tetany due to hypocalcemia, or 
cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in 
preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs.  Clinically significant abnormalities will be m onitored by 
[CONTACT_81814] .  The Investigator will consult with the  Ionis 
Medical Advisor as needed, and for any exceptions to the above policy .  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not 
clinically significant  (NCS) by [CONTACT_37723].  Similarly, laboratory 
abnormalities reported as AEs by [CONTACT_37724].  
 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory r eports.  The signed clinical 
laboratory reports will serve as source documents.  
 
7.4.3 Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an S AE, even 
if the patient  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; the Study Center must document all of the following:  
 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled (or was on a 
waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s  consent to participate in the Study  
 
• The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_81741]’s consent to participate in the Study and the timing of the procedure or treatment  
 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole reason for the 
intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
 
7.4.4 Dosing Errors  
    42 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   Study Drug (ISIS  304801 or pla cebo) errors should be documented as Protocol Deviations.  A brief 
description should be provided in the deviation, including whether the patient  was symptomatic (list 
symptoms) or asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional. Dosing details should be captured on the 
Dosing Case Report Form.  If the patient  takes a dose of Study Drug (ISIS  304801 or placebo) that exceeds 
protocol specificat ions and the patient  is symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE 
and be reported per Section 7.2 . 
 
Should an overdose occur, the Investigator or designee should refer to the Guidance to Investigator’s section 
of the Investigator’s Brochure and  contact [CONTACT_81815] [ADDRESS_89031] 
measurement prior to Day 1 . 
 
Confirmation Guidance : At any time during the Study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Periods), the initial 
clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monitoring criteria presented below must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_10533] (ideally in the same laboratory that performed  the initial measurement) on new 
specimens.  All new specimen collections should take place as soon as possible (ideally within 3 days of the 
initial collection).  For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], if the initial laboratory result is observed during the Treatment Period , 
the results from the retest must be available prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug (ISIS  304801 
or placebo).  
 
Re-dosing Guidance:   Patients with initial laboratory test values that reach a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81742] -
dosed until the re -test results are available.  In general, patients who do not meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37502].  However, the Investigator will decide  whether additional close monitoring 
of the patient is appropriate.  If any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81743], 
the patient will be permanently discontinued from further treatment with Study Drug (ISIS  304801 or 
placebo), evaluated fully as outlined below and will be entered into the post -treatment e valuation port ion of 
the study.   Consultation will be conducted between the Investigator and the Ionis Medical Advisor as needed.  
 
7.5.1 Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests  
The following rules are adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced  Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and 
Drug Administration, July 2009. For a definition of baseline please refer to guidance above.  
 
For patients with Baseline ALT or AST below  [ADDRESS_89032] measurement that is >[ADDRESS_89033] (or the greater of [ADDRESS_89034] if the baseline value was >ULN) at any time during the Study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Period), the 
initial measurement(s) should be con firmed as described above.  Additional, confirmatory measurements 
should also be performed if ALT or AST levels increase to [ADDRESS_89035].  
 
    43 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   For patients with baseline ALT or AST between ≥2 and <[ADDRESS_89036] measurement that is 2 x the ba seline level any time during the study 
(Treatment or Post -Treatment Period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as described above. 
Similarly, confirmatory measurements should also be performed if ALT or AST levels increase to [ADDRESS_89037].  
 
Frequen cy of Repeat Measurements:   Patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels that are continuing to rise 
should have their liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, ALP, INR and total bilirubin) retested at least bi -monthly 
until levels stabilize and begin to recover (ALT  and AST levels become ≤1.[ADDRESS_89038] or 1.2 x baseline value).  
 
Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations:  For patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels >[ADDRESS_89039] [or the greater of [ADDRESS_89040] if the baseline value was >ULN], the  following 
evaluations should be performed:  
1. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases  
2. Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications, herbal and 
dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets  
3. Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel  
4. Serology for viral hepatitis (HAV IgM, HBsAg, HCV antibody, CMV IgM, and EBV antibody panel)  
5. Serology for autoimm une hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody (ANA))  
 
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic computed 
tomography (CT) or MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, with consultation wi th 
the Sponsor Medical Monitor  as needed .  Repetition of the above evaluations should be considered if a 
patient’s ALT and/or AST levels reach [ADDRESS_89041] 7  days apart, 
for the criterion below should be retested every two weeks with serum creatinine and urine chemistries until 
creatinine and P/C ratio stabilize : 
 
• P/C ratio change from baseline >  50% and ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_89042]  
 
7.5.3 Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results  
Actions to be taken in the event of reduced platelet count are shown in Table 3 in Section 7.6.3.  
 
7.5.4 Safety Monitoring for Minor Bleeding Even ts 
Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically relevant, non -
major bleeding events (which are defined in Section 7.6.3), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival 
bleeding on brushing teeth.  If a minor bleeding event occurs, additional testing of coagulation parameters 
(aPTT, PT, INR) and platelet count should be performed , and the Investigator will consult with the Sponsor 
Medical Monitor as needed.  
 
7.5.5 Safety Monitoring for Constitutional Sy mptoms  
Patients will be instructed to promptly report any signs of symptoms of fever or constitutional symptoms that 
may arise during the study and the Investigator should closely evaluate all potential causes, including 
    44 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   concomitant illness.  If patients e xperience  persistent consti tutional symptoms, the Investigator will determine 
whether additional monitoring or laboratory tests are required , with consultation with the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor as needed . 
 
7.5.6 Safety Monitoring for LDL -C Elevations  
Beginning at Week 1 6 (after which treatment is unblinded) , laboratory alerts will be in place to notify the 
Investigator if a patient has an LDL -C > 160 mg/dL on two consecutive visits.  If this occurs, the Investigator 
will consider  initiat ion or adjust ment of  treatment to lower LDL -C according to published  guidelines (e.g., 
initiate statin therapy, increase the statin dose for patients who are already on treatment, add ezetimibe if on 
maximal statin therapy) 52. 
 
7.5.7 Safety Monitoring  Rule for Documented Severe Hypoglycemia  
Classification of Hypoglycemia  
1. Alert value for hypoglycemia  
≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) plasma concentration  
 
2. Severe hypoglycemia  
Requires assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other 
corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event. Neurological 
recovery following plasma glucose levels returning to n ormal is considered sufficient evidence that an 
event was induced by [CONTACT_81816] . 
 
3. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_37472] ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 
mmol/L).  
 
4. Asymptomatic hypogly cemia  
Not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_81744] ≤70 mg/dL 
(≤3.9 mmol/L).  
 
5. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_81745] ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L).  
 
A documented severe hypoglycemic event  is defined as one in which the patient requires assistance of 
another person to obtain treatment for the event and has a plasma glucose level ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9  mmol/L). 
The rescue treat ment of hypoglycemia may include IV glucose or buccal or intramuscular glucagon. The 
definition of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia includes all epi[INVESTIGATOR_81746] -treatment and which were thus though t to place patients at risk for injury to 
themselves or others. Note that “requires assistance” means that the patient could not help himself or herself. 
Someone being kind that assists spontaneously the patient when not necessary does not qualify as “requ ires 
assistance.”  Severe hypoglycemia will be qualified as a SAE only if it fulfills SAE criteria.  
 
    45 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   If a patient presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia, the Investigator will need to take immediate action to 
confirm the patient’s glucose level and treat t he patient accordingly. Patients must be instructed on the 
monitoring and management of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_81747].  Instructions should be provided 
to all patients on the appropriate use of a glucose meter. The experience of hypoglycemia may vary greatly 
from patient to patient.  However, there are certain classical signs and symptoms, of which patients should be 
aware as a clue that their blood glucose may be low. Common symptoms include headache, heart pounding, 
confusion, disorientation , numbness or tingling, pale skin, shakiness or tremulousness, increased appetite, 
anxiousness or nervousness, lightheadedness or dizziness, sweating, and weakness.  Many of these symptoms 
are listed in the diary provided to patients.  These diaries will b e used only to assist the investigator in 
assessing the event.  Appropriate source documentation should capture the necessary information on the event 
with the aid of the diaries.  Patients must be given adequate instructions on the use of the diaries.   
 
If patients suspect they might be having a hypoglycemia reaction, they should check their blood glucose using 
their meters as soon as possible, before treatment if possible, provided they feel it is safe to do so.  If there is 
doubt about safety they shoul d treat the event first, using some sugar, milk, or juice for example, then obtain 
and record a blood glucose value as soon as possible thereafter.  The time and nature of treatment should be 
noted, and especially if any blood glucose result was before or after treatment.  It would be helpful for the 
patient to note if a contributory factor (eg, missed or reduced meals, unaccustomed physical activity) occurred 
earlier in the day of the event.   
 
Doses of insulin and sulfonylureas may be reduced at the Investigator’s discretion for hypoglycemia.  Doses 
of other diabetes medications (e.g. metformin) should not be changed.  
 
7.5.8 Monitoring Rule for Hyperglycemia  
Assessment for rescue will be performed at each “visit” (including both telephone contacts and in -person 
visits).  Routine fasting SMPG and central lab alerts on FPG (and HbA1c after week 12) are set up to ensure 
that glycemic parameters remain under predefined thresholds values. If one fasting SMPG value exceeds the 
specific glycemic l imit on one day, the patient checks it again during the two following days. If all the values 
in three consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact [CONTACT_1755] a central 
laboratory FPG measurement (and HbA1c after week 12 ) is performed.  
 
The threshold values are defined as follows, depending on study period:  
• From baseline visit to week 12  (including value at week 12 ): FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L)  
• From week 12   to week 24  (including value at week 24 ): FPG >240 mg/dL (1 3.3 mmol/L)  or 
HbA1c>9% (for patients with baseline HbA1c <8%) and HbA1c increase of more than 1% from 
baseline (for patients with baseline HbA1c ≥8%).  
• From week 24   up to week  68 : HbA1c >9% (for patients with baseline HbA1c <8%) and HbA1c 
increase of mo re than 1% from baseline (for patients with baseline HbA1c ≥8%).   
 
In case of FPG/HbA1c above the threshold values, the investigator should ensure that no reasonable 
explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular that:  
• Plasma glucose was actually measured in the fasting condition (i.e. after at least [ADDRESS_89043])  
    46 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   • Absence of intercurrent disease which may jeopardize glycemic control.  In case of an emergency 
(e.g., surgery, infection), the investigator can take appropriate mea sures for glycemic control.  If the 
measure does not exceed 7 days, then it will not be considered a rescue.  If the measure lasts beyond 7 
days then it will be treated as a rescue.   
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate  
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate  
 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic control, the investigator should undertake 
appropriate action, i.e.  
• Investigation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in AE/ concomitant  medication 
parts of the e -CRF),  
• Stress on the absolute need to be compliant to treatment,  
• Organize a specific interview with a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional and 
stress on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and lifestyle recommendatio ns, 
• Schedule a FPG/HbA1c assessment at the next visit.  
 
If none from the above -mentioned reason can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease FPG/HbA1c 
under the threshold values, rescue medication may be introduced at the investigator discretion and according 
to local guidelines.  
 
Any patient who d iscontinues early from the placebo -controlled or OLE periods will be encouraged to attend 
a final in -person follow -up visit (Week 80 visit assessments per Appendix A) approximately [ADDRESS_89044] dose of Study Drug.  If the patient declines or i s unable to participate in the above, a home nurse 
visit for safety/efficacy labs .  
 
If possible, an in -person visit for all assessments for primary and secondary efficacy and safety parameters 
planned in final primary endpoint assessment visit will be per formed before adding the rescue medication. If 
an in -person visit cannot be conducted in a timely fashion, a home nurse visit for safety/efficacy labs will be 
attempted.  If rescue medication is required, patients will continue the study treatment and rema in in the 
study, although planned tests that will be affected by [CONTACT_81817].

7.[ADDRESS_89060] Selection  
The primary anticipated benefit of ISIS 304801 is TG reduction.  The severity of hypertriglyceridemia in 
patients with lipodystrophy is quite variable.  In this study, we are targeting the patient population to those 
with severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) who are not only at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, 
but also at  risk for acute pancreatitis.  Patients with generalized lipodystrophy already have available a highly 
effective, approved therapy: leptin replacement.  However, there are currently no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_81754].  Hence, the  population of partial lipodystrophy patients with severe 
hypertriglyceridemia has substantial unmet medical need, and ha s the greatest benefit to risk ratio from 
participation in this study.  Based on our experience, we expect that the majority of subject s who enroll in this 
study will be female as females typi[INVESTIGATOR_81755].  In addition, we 
anticipate that the majority of subjects will be Caucasian based on the demographics of partial lipodystrophy.  
Patients under [ADDRESS_89061] benefit, non -institutionalized adults who are unable to give informed consent but 
are considered able to comply with the study demands, will be eligible.  If we enroll patients who are unable 
to provide their own cons ent, we will follow the procedures specified in NIH SOP 14E (“Research Involving 
Adults Who Are or May Be Unable to Consent” ).  If the study team has a concern that an adult patient may be 
unable to consent, the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team will be contact[CONTACT_81819]’s ability to provide informed consent.  If the NIH Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) 
determines that the subject is not able to consent, an appropriate surrogate (assessed by [CONTACT_81820]) will 
be as signed. Consent for research participation will then be obtained from either the surrogate or a legally 
authorized representative. Individuals designated as durable power of attorney (DPA) for health care or other 
valid advanced directive, or court -appoint ed guardians are accepted as legally authorized representatives.  If 
after study enrollment, the patient is unable to comply with the protocol demands, they will be withdrawn 
from the protocol.   
 
7.10 Risks/Benefits Analysis including Considerations of Al ternatives to Participation  
7.10.[ADDRESS_89062] shown very large and clinically meaningful 
reductions in fasting apoC -III and TG (~80% and 70%, respectively, mean reduction from baseline with 
300 mg dose) with a very high degree of consistenc y of response between the different patient groups.  This 
includes healthy volunteers, patients with moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia not on background TG -
lowering therapy, patients with moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia on a background of sta ble fibrate 
therapy, patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS), and patients with hypertriglyceridemia 
and T2DM.  In 2 subjects, triglycerides decreased from ~1000 mg/dL at the end of the placebo controlled 
phase, to <150 mg/dL after [ADDRESS_89063], triglycerides decreased from >500 at study entry to <[ADDRESS_89064] co mpleted the placebo -controlled 
period, insulin sensitivity increased on open label drug, and hemoglobin A1c decreased in parallel (by ~1%).   
Two subject s have not yet completed the placebo controlled phase.  Thus, based on current data, the drug 
appears h ighly effective in controlling triglycerides, improving insulin sensitivity, and lowering A1c.   
    52 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   Patients may also experience benefits in diabetes control.  Small studies of ISIS [ADDRESS_89065] shown 
significant decreases in glycated albumin, fructosamine, and/or HbA1c, and t rends towards improvement in 
insulin sensitivity . 
 
The additional [ADDRESS_89066] manifested ≥ 50% 
improvement in triglycerides on study drug because of the prospect of di rect clinical benefit for individual 
subjects as well as the prospect of acquiring additional generalizable knowledge about the potential risks and 
benefits of this treatment in the patient population.  
 
7.10.2 Risks/Discomforts  
1. General :  Some patients may find the time needed  to complete the research studies an inconvenience 
in their routine lives.  
 
2. ISIS 304801 : A detailed discussion of side effects of ISIS  304801 is given in the Background section 
(2.3.3 and 2.3.4) of the protocol.  Briefly, p re-clinical studies of ISIS  [ADDRESS_89067] frequently observed AEs 
with ISIS  304801 were local reactions (pain, tenderness, erythema, pruritus or swelling) at the 
injection site. Injection site reactions persisting for at least 2 days were infrequent (~15% of 
injections), were almost always mild, resolved spontaneously, were non -progressive, and were not 
associated with systemic sequelae.  
 
Thrombocytopenia: Phase [ADDRESS_89068] -treatment period and was not associated with platelet -related adverse events. In 
Phase 3 studies of ISIS  304801 in patients with familia l chylomicronemia, two of 56 subjects 
experienced S[LOCATION_003]Rs of severe low platelet count, with nadirs of 17,000 and 9,000/mm 3. Neither 
patient experienced bleeding during these events.  No patient has developed severe thrombocytopenia 
in this study or in the m ulticenter industry sponsored study in partial lipodystrophy.  The one patient 
in the NIH study who developed platelets <100K did so in the context of pancytopenia due to viral 
bone marrow suppression, which promptly rebounded to the normal range without i ntervention.  
Adverse events possibly associated with the study drug have included systemic inflammatory 
reactions, the current case of heart failure, and the case of pancreatitis reported separately to the IRB 
in this study.  Due to N of 1 cases and lack of biological plausibility, it remains uncertain whether 
these events are causally related to study drug.    
 
Anaphylaxis: One patient with partial lipodystrophy enrolled in a drug -company sponsored study of 
ISIS [ADDRESS_89069] therapy (fluids, antihistamines, steroids).  The study drug was 
permanently discontinued in this patient after this event.  
 
    53 
CR 2019  version (IRB approved 9/24/2019)  
16-DK-0038  
Submitted  to IRB :   Heart failure: One patient with partial lip odystrophy enrolled in the NIH  study of ISIS [ADDRESS_89070] also experienced pulmonary hypertension.  She  was discharged home 
after an approximately two -week  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81756] 40 mg twice a day (for 
continued diuresis) and close follow -up with her local cardiologist.   Heart failure has not been 
observed in other patients (or animals) who have taken this drug, but a causal relationsh ip with the 
study drug  could not be ruled out so  the study drug was permanently discontinued in this patient after 
this event.   
 
3. Physical examination/Anthropometric measurements :  These tests are similar to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_81757] a doc tor’s office and do not present any special risk.  
 
4. Self-monitoring of blood glucose : Home blood glucose monitoring will be performed at a frequency 
approximating standard of care for patients with type 2 diabetes, and thus should present no added 
inconveni ence or risk to patients participating in this study.  
 
5. Blood Sampling :  Peripheral blood draws (venipuncture) performed during this study for research will 
not exceed 10.5 mL/kg, or 550 mL (whichever is smaller) per 8 -week period  for adults .   Patients may 
experience some discomfort at the site of the needle entry, and there is a risk of bruising at the site.   
There is a remote risk of fainting or local infection.   
 
6. DEXA: The effective radiation dose with total body D EXA scanning is 0.[ADDRESS_89071] up to four DEXA scans (total radiation dose  
0.[ZIP_CODE]  rem) per year.  
 
7. Glucose and Lipid Turno ver: The stable isotope s 13C is not associated with any toxicity at the doses 
used in these  studies 54.  Deuterium at the doses given may cause temporary dizziness.  This risk will 
be minimized by [CONTACT_81821] 2H2O dose into four aliquots, and by [CONTACT_81822].  If subjects nee d to get out of bed (e.g. to use the bathroom) the patient will first sit 
upright in bed for a few minutes prior to standing, and a nurse will be available to supervise and 
assist.   Palmitate must be complexed to albumin prior to delivery, and thus carries  the risks associated 
with use of human blood products.   To minimize exposure to human albumin, uniformly labeled 13C16 
palmitate will be used, permitting use of the minimum possible dose of this tracer.  
 
8. Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp Study : In order to assess insulin sensitivity, patients will 
receive an intravenous infusion of insulin and – via a second intravenous access – increasing amounts 
of glucose to maintain euglycemia.  Insertion of the necessary intravenous lines may cause the above -
mentioned discomfort and a possible skin infection.  Insulin infusion can induce hypoglycemia and 
hypokalemia.  Either event is very unlikely, since patients undergo frequent blood glucose 
measurements and are constantly observed for the presence of hypoglyc emic symptoms by [CONTACT_81823]/or physician.  However, in order to prevent complications, two patent, well -
functioning intravenous lines are required during this procedure.   A stat potassium will be measured 
at the end of the insulin infusion, a nd oral KCL 40 mEq will be given if potassium is less than 3.5.

9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) : While MR 
scanning is thought to be safe, the procedure may cause anxiety in some patients since current 
equipment used at the Clinical Center uses a closed tube. Adult patients will be offered sedatives such 
as Valium if they express worry about being in a closed space. No intravenous contrast will be used in 
these studies.  The hand -grip exercise may produce  mild fatigue.  
 
10. Lipoprotein lipase activity : The primary risk of lipase assays involving heparin infusion of 60 
units/kg is bleeding (in <0.1% of subjects).  Testing will not be performed in subjects at increased 
bleeding risk, including those with platele t counts, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time 
outside the normal range within [ADDRESS_89072] also involves minor ris ks associated 
with intravenous line placement.  
 
11. Mixed meal : This test requires one IV, but no adverse effects are anticipated.  
 
12. Carotid intima -media thickness :  This is a non -invasive ultrasonographic test.  No adverse effects are 
anticipated.  
 
13. Hunger and pain questionnaires : Patients may find it a minor inconvenience to fill out the

14. Liver biopsy: Risks and discomforts of liver biopsy are as follows:  
a. Pain.  About 20% of persons who undergo a liver  biopsy experience pain in the side of body 
over the liver after the biopsy.  This pain usually lasts from a few minutes to several hours 
and may require pain medication.  In rare cases, the pain lasts a day or two.  
b. Fainting .  About 2% of persons pass out due to vasovagal reaction after a liver biopsy.  This 
is unlikely to cause harm, as patients will be lying in bed during the biopsy.  Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_81758], and may be given prior to the biopsy in 
individuals  prone to these reactions.  
c. Infection .  A rare complication of liver biopsy is infection that spreads to the rest of the body 
because the needle goes through skin that is not completely clean or sterile or goes through 
infected bile (as occurs in patients w ith gallstones sometimes).  Antibiotics can treat such 
infections.  
d. Biopsy of another organ .  In rare instances, the biopsy needle misses the liver and hits another 
internal organ, such as the lung, gallbladder, kidney, or intestine.  This complication can be 
avoided by [CONTACT_81824].  Usually, the other organ is not 
damaged by [CONTACT_81825]; however, it is possible that surgery might be needed to 
repair the hole.  The most important complication of liver biopsy is bleeding .  A small amount 
of bleeding probably occurs in many patients after liver biopsy, but the amount of bleeding is 
usually too small to be detected or felt .  Severe bleeding occurs in about one of every [ADDRESS_89073] likely to occur in someone with cancer of the liver or 
with abnormal clotting studies, but bleeding can also occur in patients with mild forms of

Submitted  to IRB :   liver disease.  Most cases of severe bleeding stop on their own with bed rest and observation 
for several days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  In rare instances, a blood transfusion or even surgery is 
needed to sew up the tiny hole in the liver made by [CONTACT_81826].  Very rarely, in less  than one 
in 10,[ADDRESS_89074] 40 years.  During this time, three patients develo ped serious, life -threatening 
complications of biopsy (two in the early1990s and one in 2014).  The first patient, who had 
cirrhosis due to hepatitis C and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, bled intraperitoneally 
from the liver biopsy and died after surgi cal attempts to stop the bleeding were unsuccessful.  
The second patient had Gaucher’s disease and advanced cirrhosis with severe coagulopathy 
and was treated with platelet transfusions and fresh frozen plasma to correct the bleeding 
tendency; he tolerated  liver biopsy well and was discharged a day later, but then returned in 
shock with a severe intra -abdominal bleed, and died despi[INVESTIGATOR_81759]. The third patient had a history of Pre -B cell ALL status -post bone marrow 
transp lantation and chronic coagulopathy.  The patient was seen on consultation for concern 
of liver graft -versus -host disease and developed a severe intraperitoenal bleed after liver 
biopsy.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_81760], including transfusions, arterial embo lization and 
exploratory laparotomy, bleeding could not be stopped and the patient died.  Subjects will be 
kept overnight in the Clinical Center after the liver biopsy with careful monitoring for any 
evidence of bleeding.   The percutaneous liver biopsy wil l not be performed if the platelet 
level is below 75 K/ul.  
  
e. Risks and discomforts of medications  used during liver biopsy are as follows:  Three 
medications are often used during a liver biopsy:  Xylocaine to numb the skin, a sedative such 
as Versed (mida zolam) to make subjects drowsy during the biopsy, and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_81761] a tendency to faint.  All three medications are safe when given in the usual doses.  In 
rare instances, they can induce allergic reactions which can be a skin rash, itching, wh eezing, 
an asthma attack, or even anaphylaxis - or allergic shock.  All of the allergic complications 
can and will be treated if they arise.  Xylocaine, when given in high doses can also cause 
heart blockage, seizures, coma, or even death; but, in the dose s given in this study it has no 
obvious effect on the heartbeat .  Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_81762], difficulty 
focusing the eyesight, constipation and difficulty passing urine.  All these side effects will 
disappear within a few hours.  Ver sed or Midazolam for sedation causes sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_81763].  In high doses, it can cause over -sedation with coma and depression of 
breathing and even death.  This medication is given in small amounts with careful monitoring 
of sedation.  Standard me dications and equipment used for conscious sedation will be 
available during the procedure.

planned procedures by [CONTACT_81827]  (as listed on face sheet ). The consent process 
will take place prior to any study procedures , however, the research team will talk with the subjects p rior to 
coming to NIH to determine eligibility and to provide dietary recommendations .  The current 
NIDDK/NIAMS  IRB-approved informed consent document will be signed by [CONTACT_43987].  
A witness will additionally sign the document to attest only to the validity of the signature [CONTACT_81835], not 
the validity or quality of the consent.  A copy of the consent will be given to the subject for future reference. 
The signed documents will be sent to the Medical Records Departme nt for placement in the subject's 
permanent CC medical record.  The consent process will additionally be documented in the elec tronic medical 
record (CRIS).   
 
We do not plan or anticipate the enrollment of non -English speaking subjects. However, they are not excluded 
from participation either. If there is unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is no 
translated extant IRB -approved consent document, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or those authorized to obtain 
informed consent will us e the short form consent process as described in MAS Policy M77 -2, NIH SOP 12, 
45 CFR 46.117 (b), and 21 CFR 50.27 (b).  The summary that will be used is the English version of the extant 
IRB-approved consent document. We request prospective IRB approval o f the use of the short form consent 
process for up to a maximum of 5 requests (either for individual participants or families of participants) in a 
given language, and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the use of the 
short form. Should we reach the threshold of 5 subjects and/or families speaking a single language, we will 
request an additional use of the short form from the IRB and will notify the Board that we plan to have any 
consent documents frequently used with t hat population translated into the language(s) they speak.  
 
Subjects have the right to withdraw participation from this protocol at any time.    
 
7.13 Research Use, Storage and Disposition of Human Subjects’ Samples and Data  
For future reference and potenti al use, we will store all samples (blood or fluids) in our locked freezers for an 
unlimited period of time. Samples will be labeled with coded identifiers linked to patient identity only via a 
secured database. Research records and data with personal ident ifiers will be stored in our locked offices , the 
medical record department , and the electronic study database . The electronic study database will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_81801].  Representatives of Ionis  Pharmaceuticals will have access to research 
records and data with personal identifiers only when the representative is physically present in the NIH 
Medical Records department.  The electronic study database will not contain any personal identifiers, 
although it will contain dates on which labs or tests are performed.  T his material will additionally be 
protected by [CONTACT_81828].  Access to records and data associated with 
personal information will be restricted to the Pri ncipal Investigator, Co -Investigators, study support staff, and

plasma of patients with lipodystrophy.  These markers (or “assay systems”) were developed in [CONTACT_81840] mi’s laboratory and include: (1) LPL activity (post -heparin  plasma) and mass, (2) HTGL 
activity  (post -heparin plasma) and mass, (3) GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1 mass, and (4) GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1 autoantibody.   They will run 
the above stated assays using specimens collected before and aft er leptin treatment.  Research has shown that 
Leptin lowers triglycerides in these patients, and hence we would hypothesize that LPL and HTGL activity 
might be increased after leptin treatment.  Therefore, we will send to the collaborators deidentified pla sma

Submitted  to IRB :   Appendix K:  Single Patient Allowed to Stay on Study  
 
This amendment (for Appendix K) is in response to the Problem Report dated 6 -2-17. Briefly, a patient 
with partial lipodystrophy and known steatohepatitis was enrolled in the protocol with an ALT of 140.  
This represents a protocol deviation as the exclusion criteria state that ALT needs to be <3xULN (NIH 
ULN is 33U/L). The study team in advertently missed this when enrolling the patient and were alerted to 
problem when reviewing her week [ADDRESS_89086]’s study medication was held pending discussions 
with the IRB and the drug manufacturer, Ionis Pharmaceuticals.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_81769], Andres Digenio, on [ADDRESS_89087] 
the authority to allow this patient to continue participa ting in the study.  He also affirmed that, as a 
representative of Ionis, he was fine with allowing the patient to continue study drug as a protocol 
violation.  The company would not wish us to change the exclusion criteria for the study, however, as the 
drug is currently in development and the company wishes to avoid any ambiguity about potential liver 
safety signals.  He affirmed that, although the drug is metabolized by [CONTACT_4852], there is no known safety 
signal for hepatoxicity with this drug.  However, the drug has never been tested in patients with liver 
enzymes as high as this patient’s.   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_81770], Chris Koh (an AI on the study) and 
Yaron Rotman (not associated with this study).  Both documented (attached to problem report) that they 
did not feel that this patient’s liver disease, and specifically, having an ALT >3x ULN, would increase 
risk to this subject.  The risk of idiosyncratic drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is not increased in patients 
with underlying liver disease, such as this patient.  Patients with advanced liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis) 
may be at increased risk for hepatic decompensation due to DILI if it occurs.  However, this patient does 
not have evidence of advanced liv er disease (she has stable or improving ALT/AST over several years, no 
cirrhosis on biopsy, and normal liver synthetic function).  
 
Therefore, given this patient’s unchanged prospect of direct benefit from study participation, without any 
increase in risk, we plan to continue her participation in the study and resume dosing of the study drug.  
Because we respect the company’s request to not change the overall study exclusion criteria, we will not 
change the ALT/AST exclusion criteria, and will not enroll add itional subjects who violate these 
exclusion criteria.

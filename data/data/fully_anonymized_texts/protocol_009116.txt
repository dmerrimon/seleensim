 A. Null Hypothesis  
1. Hypomineralized enamel treated with hydroxyapatite  toothpaste would  not regain up to 20% mineral 
density relative to healthy enamel.  
2. The effectiveness of hydroxyapatite toothpaste in remineralizing MIH would not be significantly different 
from that of 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste.  
B. Specific Aims  
The objective of this in situ cli nical study is to determine whether a toothpaste formulation containing 
hydroxyapatite is effective in promoting remineralization of molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH), in 
comparison to a toothpaste formulation containing 1450 ppm fluoride. Effectivene ss will be declared if the MIH 
lesion  regain up to 20% mineral density relative to healthy enamel . 
C. Significance / Background  
MIH  is a qualitative enamel defect observed on  at least one first permanent molar (FPM) with or without affecting 
permanent maxilla ry incisors1. Clinically, it’s diagnosed when a FPM  presents with a demarcated opacity, larger 
than [ADDRESS_180342] -eruptive enamel 
breakdown, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_155886], shaped, and extended restorat ions, or a history of extraction of FPMs  in an otherwise 
sound dentition, are also diagnostic criteria of MIH. The location, asymmetry and varying severity of the defects, 
distinguishes them from other enamel mineralization defects such as fluorosis4. The severity of the affection can be 
divided into 2 categories, mild and moderate/severe. These categories are differentiated clinically by [CONTACT_155890], the degree of hypersensitivity and the esthetic concerns3. It is also corre lated with 
reduced levels of mineral density (MD) of the affected enamel to 2.24 g/m3 in mild cases and 1.93 g/m3 in 
moderate/severe cases in comparison to a 2.51 g/m3 average MD of normal enamel5.  
Hypomineralization can affect  both primary and permanent teeth, but the molar -incisor model is the most common 
with a reported prevalence between 10% to 20%6,7. As for their etiology, MIH defects can result from genetic or  
systemic environmental factors. Perinatal and postnatal factors appear to be  the most  strongly associated with its 
occurrence8. In fact, premature birth and associated complications, hypoxia, dioxin exposure and other childhood 
illnesses such as ear or respi[INVESTIGATOR_155887]. If  
these conditions develop in the early childhood, up to age 3, when the crowns of the FPMs  and incisors are 
21-570H, Amaechi, Form BB, 01- 05-22, NS.doc  4 
 undergoing mineralization, they predispose the child to MIH3,9. Consequently, the time of onset, span and severity 
of the conditions dictate the pat tern and intensity of the lesions.  
Management of MIH defects is complicated by [CONTACT_155891] -exposed dentinal 
tubules10. This process causes subclinical inflammation of the pulp and hypersensitivity that lead to a higher 
anesthetic threshold and negligence of oral hygiene by [CONTACT_155892]11. Additionally, esthetic and functional concerns are frequent in these patients and are associated with a 
lower oral health related quality  of life12. The treatment of teeth with hypomineralization defects is twofold, 
preventive and/or interventional. Therapeutic interventions must take place when the teeth display severe defects, 
enamel breakdown, decay or signs of pulpal inflammation/infect ion13. This approach includes restoration with glass 
ionomer, composite resin or preformed metallic crowns for posterior teeth and micro- abrasion with resin infiltration 
and composite restoration for anterior teeth and extraction with space management for non- restorable teeth3,14. 
However, when MIH diagnosis is established early, the prevention of the progression of the defect is recommended 
by [CONTACT_155893]. In fact, increasing the mineral content of the enamel to a 
threshol d close to the norm can improve its physical properties, hence improving the esthetic and functional 
outcomes. Several techniques pertaining to remineralization of MIH lesions have been described in the literature 
including the use of low -level laser thera py or the application of pastes and varnishes containing arginine, fluoride 
(with or without tricalcium phosphate), casein phosphopeptide -amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP -ACP) or casein 
phosphopeptide -amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP -ACFP)13. Toot hpastes containing nanohydroxyapatite 
(HAP) were shown to have comparable effects to fluoride toothpastes in terms of remineralization of incipi[INVESTIGATOR_155888], while excluding the risk of fluorosis15. The synthesized particles of HAP 
are structurally similar to the crystals found in enamel and dentin, have analogous properties and can readily 
penetrate enamel surface16. However, their use as a mean of increasing mineral density in MIH defects has  not been 
investigated. Thus, the  objective of this study is to determine the eff ectiveness of a toothpaste containing HAP in 
promoting remineralization of teeth with MIH defects.  
D. Experimental Design  
Production of S amples  
30 freshly extracted permanent teeth with MIH will be collected  from the pediatric clinics of the University of 
[LOCATION_007] Health San Antonio (UTHSA).  These teeth were extracted as part of the patient’s standard of care and 
21-570H, Amaechi, Form BB, 01- 05-22, NS.doc  5 
 donation will be done based on the patients willing ness. If the pat ient wishes to donate the teet h, the y will be 
placed in a container within the pediatric dental clinics and will be donated without in identifiable information  
attached to them. The teeth will be cleaned of debris/stains and examined with a transilluminator. Teeth with MIH  
but free of  caries or other malformations will be selected and cleaned with pumice to remove the pellicle. Using a 
water -cooled diamond wire saw, [ADDRESS_180343] so that the different layers from the outer surface to the inner surface present in each block 
are: outer enamel surface, enamel, dentino -enamel junction  (DEJ) and dentin.  
Measu rement of baseline mineral d ensity of the tooth blocks  
Micro computed X -ray tomography ( µ-CT) is a high resolution, non- destructive radiographic method of analysis  
that generates qualitative images and quantitative analysis  of the mineral density ( MD) in tooth samples. For this 
reaso n, images will be collected from the samples to measure the mineral density of the MIH enamel lesions before 
(MDb) and after ( MDt) remineralization treatment as well as the mineral density (MDs) of healthy enamel samples . 
The µ- CT scanning and analysis procedure will be performed as described in our previous publications.17 
Study Population/ Participants  
Fifteen  subjects (8 females, 7 males)  will be recruited into the study. The subjects to be included should be 18 to 60 
years old in good general health with no known history of allergy to personal care/consumer products . They must 
have  a minimum of 20 natural uncrowned teeth (excluding third molars) , no active unrestored cavities  and a normal 
salivary flow rate (stimulated and unst imulated flow of ≥0.7 ml/min and ≥0.2 ml/min respectively) ascertained from 
a preliminary sialometry  test. They also should give written informed consent, be available throughout entire study,  
and be w illing to wear intra -oral appliance  24 hours per day and use only assigned products for oral hygiene 
throughout the duration of the study.  
The exclusion criteria are having advanced periodontal disease , a medical condition that require s premedication 
prior to dental visits/procedures , an impair ed salivary funct ion, wearing an orthodontic retainer(s) , not having  
enough teeth to secure the oral appliance , having diseases of the soft or hard oral tissues, using  drugs that can affect 
salivary flow , using antibiotics one month prior to or during this  study , participa ting in another clinical study one 
week prior to the start of the washout period or during  this study period, using tobacco products , having an allergic 
21-570H, Amaechi, Form BB, 01- 05-22, NS.doc  6 
 history to common toothpaste ingredients , and having a compromised immune system  (HIV,  AIDS, immuno-
suppressive drug therapy) as determined by [CONTACT_155894] a double -blind, randomized, crossover, single center, controlled clinical trial. The study will be blinded to 
both the study team and t he subjects. Recr uitment of potential subjects will be from the local San Antonio area. The 
subjects will be identified with code numbers (CP01 to CP 15). The approval of the UTHSA IRB  will be obtained . 
This study will be conducted in compliance with International Conferenc e on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical 
Practice Guidelines. At the screening visit, each subject will complete a medical / dental history and read  and sign 
an informed consent form. Following consent, a visual oral health exam will be perf ormed by a licens ed dentist. 
Subjects will be enrolled based on all the inclusion and e xclusion criteria and other screening evaluations  such as 
preliminary sialometry , and then randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences . 
Construction of the in -situ appliance  
The 3 blocks from each tooth will be used , as follows : two blocks with MIH lesions will be used for 
remineralization assessment and one healthy tooth block will serve as control for the MD  of healthy enamel. The  
MIH -bearing blocks will be cove red with polyeste r gauze (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., [LOCATION_003]), which will 
facilitate plaque retention on the surface of the tooth blocks on intra -oral exposure. Following recruitment, a n 
impression of the subject’s lower dentition will be tak en using an alginate impressio n material. A dental technician 
will fabricate a lower removable intra -oral appliance. Each of the MIH -lesion -bearing blocks will be mounted  on 
each side within the acrylic portion of the removable appliance, using Intermediate Restorative Material (IRM) 
cement (fluoride –free). All appliances are sterilized with ethylene oxide prior to delivery to the subject.  
Test Product Description  and Labeling  
The toothpastes to be used for treatments are 10% HAP toothpaste, 1450 ppm NaF fluoride tooth paste , and non-
fluoride toothpaste (washout ). The [ADDRESS_180344] products  will be coded by [CONTACT_155895]/packaging company, who 
will retain the code until the completion of the study and data interpretation. The experiment will consist of two 
distinct treatmen t phases , Phase [ADDRESS_180345]'s previously used toothpaste. During this period, no appliance will 
be worn, and s ubjects  will be  using only the provided washout toothpaste and a soft-bristled too thbrush twice daily . 
Following the washout period, the intra -oral appliance will be fitted to each subject  by a qualified dentist. 
Immediately after fitting of the first appliance (on day [ADDRESS_180346] treatment phase) , each subject will receive a soft 
bristled manual toothbrush for use throughout the duration of the study and a toothpaste according to the treatment 
phase. They will make the first use of the test product under the supervision of the s tudy coordinator. For the 
remainder of the study, subjec ts will complete the procedure at home and as instructed . 
The subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth with the appliance in the mouth, two times daily , for [ADDRESS_180347] -remineralization mineral dens ity (MDt) of all the MIH -lesion -
bearing blocks exposed intra -orally for remineralization will be assessed with µCT . For the lesion -bearing blocks , 
21-570H, Amaechi, Form BB, 01- 05-22, NS.doc  8 
 this process will yield the following information: the pre -test ( MDb) and post -test ( MDt) mineral density of the 
lesions  and t heir associated images, while f or the healthy tooth blocks, the MD s and the µCT images . 
At every visit , the dental examiner will visually examine the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity and peri -oral 
area using a dental light and dent al mirror. Additi onally, subjects will be asked about and examined for any adverse 
events. Subjects may call and request a visit for any concern of potential adverse event.  
 
Data Handling  
Using the µCT  images, the pattern and the extent of remineralizatio n produced within each lesion by [CONTACT_155896]. This will be clearly shown by [CONTACT_155897] - and post -test images 
side-by-side. For all calculations, the absolute MD will be measured and used. For the remineraliz ation blocks, the  
values of the MDb and MDt for each test product will be compared using paired t -test to determine any significant 
change (remineralization) made by [CONTACT_55804] ( intra-group comparison). However, to make comparisons 
between the two pr oducts (intergroup comparison), percentage change in MD calculated relative to the control will 
be determined for each test product  as such :  % Change  in MD  (%∆MD) = [(MDb  – MDt) /MDb]  x 10 0 
The percentage MD  recovery following remineralization will be calc ulated as follows:  
% MD recovery (%MDR) = [(B -T)/(B-S)] x 100, with S = mean MDs of healthy enamel blocks, B = mean MDb of 
MIH enamel blocks before remineralization , and T = mean MDt of MIH enamel blocks after intra- oral exposure . 
Sample Size C alculation  
The power analysis and sample size calculation were  performed using nQuery Advisor software (Statistical 
Solutions, Cork, Ireland) . The sample size for this study is based on the primary efficacy parameter, % MDR 
following [ADDRESS_180348] 80% power  at the 5% signif icance level, using 
two-sided testing, to detect a mean treatment difference in %MDR of approximately 8.1% assuming a within 
subject standard deviation of approximately 12.6%. In the absence of available [ADDRESS_180349] -treatment data from a 
previous results obtained by [CONTACT_155898] a demineralization and remineralization study using HAP toothpaste15. In 
that study the mean %  chang e in mineral loss  was equal to 30.[ADDRESS_180350] been verified by [CONTACT_155899], 
comparison s of the mean values of MD, %ΔMD  and % MDR  between the two treatment groups as well as the intra-
group comparisons will be performed using the paired S tudent’s  t-test (STATA version 10.0, StataCorp LP, [LOCATION_003]) 
at a significance level of 5%. The primary endpoints  of the present study are expected to be enhanced 
remineralization of MIH  lesion.

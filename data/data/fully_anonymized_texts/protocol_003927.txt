Specific Aims 
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is  the leading cause of dementia in the  elderly and the 6th leading cause of death in 
the U.S.[ADDRESS_354663] 2/3 of individuals with AD in the US are women.1 There is no cure for AD, and presently no 
interventions to prevent or delay neuropathologic progression of the disease. Cerebrovascular damage is a 
well-recognized component of AD and there is strong evidence that traditional cardiovascular risk factors 
significantly increase the risk of AD.2 The loss of estrogen with menopause appears to augment the age-
associated increase in the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors3-6 which could also explain the additional 
increased risk of AD in postmenopausal women.  
Estrogen, specifically 17β -estradiol (E 2), helps maintain neuronal integrity and cognitive function.7-9 A 
major site of E 2 action is the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which supports executive cognitive function and working 
memory10 and is also affected in AD.[ADDRESS_354664] shown beneficial effects of E 2 on 
cognition,17 the pi[INVESTIGATOR_290646]’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) found an increased risk of cognitive 
decline and dementia with conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus progesterone in postmenopausal women ≥65 years of age.
18-21 The specific formulation of hormone therapy  (HT) as well as the timing of administration 
relative to menopaus e may help to explain the conflicting results from clinical trials,[ADDRESS_354665] cardiovascular disease by [CONTACT_290670] (NO ) production and promoting a 
vasodilatory state.23-25 E2-deficient postmenopausal women show arterial stiffening and impaired endothelial -
dependent vasodilation (endothelial dysfunction) compared to age- matched premenopausal women, and E 2-
based hormonal therapy appears to attenuate these i mpairments in treated compared to untreated women.26-[ADDRESS_354666] is to investigate vascular dysfunction as a mechanism for the effects of E 2 on 
cognitive function. To do so, we will measure vascular and cognitive function in 51 healthy women nearing 
menopause ( 40-60 yrs) who wil l be enrolled in [CONTACT_290709]’s NIH -funded Females, Aging, Metabolism and 
Exercise (FAME) study before and after [ADDRESS_354667] (GnRHa) , plus or minus exercise,  versus placebo. In addition, this sub- study proposes an E 2 
add-back portion (separate from the parent FAME study)  in the GnRHa no exercise group. These participants 
will complete and additional 3 mo of GnRHa plus transdermal E 2 add-back (see Methods, 2.c.2, Fig 2. Study 
Design) with  vascular and cognitive measures at the end of the add -back period.  
This study provides critical additions to previous work by: 1) conducting a novel investigation of arterial 
stiffness and endothelial dysfunction as possible mechanisms accounting for the observed effects of GnRHa on cognition; 2) studying younger women to better distinguish the effects of E
2 deficiency from those of aging; 
3) incorporating a true E 2 add-back condition to distinguish between E 2 and progesterone effects and 4) 
extending the duration of GnRHa treatment to help clarify cognitive effects.  
Specific Aim 1.  Determine the effects of 6 mo of ovarian hormone suppression with GnRHa on:  
1) Patterns of activation in the PFC during tasks of executive cognitive function using functional magne tic 
resonance imaging (fMRI). 
2) Arterial stiffness determined by [CONTACT_290671], and endothelial function measured by [CONTACT_145303] -mediated dilation (FMD).  
2 
 Hypothesis 1a. GnRHa treatment will significantly decrease PFC activation, increase arterial stiffness 
and decrease endothelial function compared to placebo.  
Hypothesis 1b.  Changes in PFC activation with GnRHa will be inversely associated with expected 
increases in arterial stiffness and positively associated with expected declines in endothelial function.  
Specific Aim 2.  Determine the effects of 3 mo of exogenous E 2 add-back on:  
1) Patterns of brain activation in the PFC during tasks of executive cognitive function using fMRI.  
2) Arterial stiffne ss and endothelial function as measured in Specific Aim 1 (2).  
Hypothesis 2a. E 2 add-back will restore PFC activation, arterial stiffness and endothelial function to 
baseline (pre- GnRHa) levels.  
Sub-study Exploratory Aim : A sub -study will enroll late- perim enopausal and postmenopausal women who 
have recently completed vascular testing under another protocol. The protocol for participants in this Sub- study 
is limited to cognitive testing and fMRI scanning at a single timepoint. The aim of this Sub- study is to  compare 
vascular and cognitive measures in the above intervention population (premenopausal women before and after 
placebo or GnRHag with or without exercise) with late- perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. These 
comparisons will generate preliminary data for an antic ipated R01- level application.   
 
Research Strategy  
1. Significance.   
1.a. Importance of the problem. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is  the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and 
the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S.1 Costs of caring for individuals with dementia is expected to reach 
$1.1 trillion by 2050, with a 500% increase in combined Medicare and Medicaid spending1. Almost 2/3 of 
individuals with AD in the US are women.1 There is no cure for AD . Currently approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_290647]. Although delaying the onset of clinical 
symptoms by 5 years could reduce prevalence by 50% in [ADDRESS_354668] reported beneficial effects of  HT on cognitive function and risk of dementia in 
postmenopausal women.
17 However, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_290648] (MPA),  although not with CEE alone.18-[ADDRESS_354669] to the “critical timing hypothesis”, which holds that HT initiated near the time of menopause may be beneficial, but when started after a prolonged period of E
[ADDRESS_354670] to the women in more positive observational studies, who 
tended to be younger and closer to menopause.40,41 Data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation 
(SWAN)  study, designed to assess cognitive performance and the effect of HT across the stages of 
menopause, provides initial support for the critical timing hypothesis. Investigators reported HT initiated prior to the final menstrual period had beneficial effects on verbal memory (subserved in part by [CONTACT_163702]) and processing speed, while HT initiated after menopause was detrimental.
42 More recently, an ancillary study to 
WHIMS in younger women (WHIMSY) reported no effect – beneficial or harmful - of CEE or CEE+MPA 
compared to placebo on multiple cognitive domains.43 Although participants in WHIMSY were younger (50- 55), 
they were still on average 9 years postmenopause. The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study44 (KEEPS) 
recently reported findings from the ancillary Cognitive and Affective Study in [ADDRESS_354671] 
demonstrated E 2 reduces the formation and accumulation of beta- amyloid50 and phosphorylated tau protein,51 
precursors of the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that define AD. Although the hippocampus appears to be a key E
2-sensitive structure, examination of other brain regions that may be vulnerable to 
changes in E 2 with aging is needed. The PFC, located at the anterior frontal lobes is a primary site of E 2 action 
in the brain, and a region also vulnerable to AD pathology. The PFC has abundant E 2 receptors,52 and E 2 
concentrations 7 -fold higher than the hippocampus.53 The PFC supports executive cognitive function,11 which 
encompasses a complex set of higher level cognitive tasks that serve to regulate pur poseful, goal -directed 
activities. These include attention, reasoning, planning, initiating actions, inhibiting inappropriate responses, coordinating tasks, cognitive set -switching and monitoring task performance.
54 Executive function is critical for 
problem solving and activities of daily living, and also serves to enhance learning and memory.55 Working 
memory – the temporary storage and manipulation of new information - is another aspect executive functi on 
supported by [CONTACT_163702].[ADDRESS_354672] rigorously evaluated 
executive function.56  
Experimental studies in humans provide evidence for beneficial effects of E 2 on PFC -mediated 
cognitive functions.15,57-60 Joffe et al demonstrated improved working memory in perimenopausal and early (<5 
years) postmenopausal women after 12 weeks of transdermal E 2 treatment.58 E2 treatment also increased PFC 
activation by [CONTACT_290672] a subset (n=11) of women. A similar increase in PFC activation during working memory tasks was shown in postmenopausal women treated with [ADDRESS_354673] investigation of potential 
mechanisms  underlying the effects of E 2 on executive function. We address important limitations of previous 
work by: 1) including an E [ADDRESS_354674] 
effects of GnRHa; and 2) extending the treatment duration to [ADDRESS_354675] cognition , Craig’s work suggests effect occur  within a relatively short time frame (8 weeks), making 
mechanisms such as E 2-related changes in body composition and subsequent insulin sensitivity less likely; 
indeed these parameters showed no change after [ADDRESS_354676] small vessel cerebrovascular disease, supporting a link between peripheral and cerebral vascular health.
32 As 
in the peripheral circulation, nitric oxide (NO) appears to play a key role in cerebral vascular function. NO synthase (NOS) inhibition has been shown to reduce cerebral blood flow and impair cerebral autoregulation in humans.
65,[ADDRESS_354677] protective effects on the peripheral vasculature, as  evidenced by [CONTACT_290673], whereas this difference rapi[INVESTIGATOR_290649].68,69 Peripheral endothelial dysfunction, characterized by [CONTACT_290674] -dependent 
vasodilation, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and precedes the development of clinical atherosclerot ic disease, making it an excellent early indicator of overall vascular health.
70 Arterial stiffness, 
measured by [CONTACT_290675], is also a major risk factor for CVD.71 E2 
receptors are present on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.23 E2 is known to increase NO 
bioavailability by [CONTACT_290676] (e)NOS24 and to inhibit the 
production of harmful reactive oxygen species that can scavenge NO.25,[ADDRESS_354678] recently 
shown that endothelial function is reduced74 and arterial stiffness is increased (Hildreth et al, in review) across 
the stages of the menopause transition in healthy women. Moreover, these preliminary data demonstrate that acute ovarian hormone suppression increases arterial stiffness and reduces endothelial -dependent 
vasodilation in premenopausal women (Figure 1). Much less is known about the effects of E
[ADDRESS_354679], women will be studied after 6 months of ovarian hormone suppression. This longer duration is likely to produce even more pronounced/consistent effects on brain activation. The use of fMRI in this study is resource -intensive. However, fMRI is widely available, requires no ionizing radiation,  and is sensitive to early 
brain changes occurring prior to clinically obvious cognitive impairment . This approach is thus consistent with 
identifying subtle early changes in cognitive function that would precede clinical symptoms and functional impairment when interventions are most likely to be effective. Further, this study design allows us to glean information from shorter -term studies, rather than studying women over years of E
[ADDRESS_354680] Kohrt’s collaboration. Enrolling participants from [CONTACT_290710]’s FAME study investigating the bioenergetic and metabolic consequences of the loss of ovarian function in women saves on recruitment and screening costs, as well as the substantial cost of GnRHa treatment. This permits funds from this K23 award to support the fMRI imaging and analys is. 
3. Approach  
3.a. Preliminary work. Through my work as a lead 
investigator on [CONTACT_290711]’s R01- supported 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_290650] (POEM ) study, I 
have gained substantial experience in running a large complex clinical intervention trial, including recruiting, screening and enrolling a carefully characterized population, and experience with the IRB approval process. From work on the POEM study I have also 
become comfortable with the assessment of cognitive function in the research setting . I have worked closely 
with [CONTACT_290712] [CONTACT_290677], which included several of the cognitive tests to be used in the proposed work. I have [ADDRESS_354681] -authored publications on cognitive 
function (see Biosketch). As part of my previous T32 
support, I added vascular measures, including carotid artery compliance and endothelial function, to the POEM study. I have collaborated with [CONTACT_290713] on this aspect of the POEM study, as well as serving as co-
investigator on her R01 -supported study, Biological mechanisms of arterial stiffening with age and estrogen 
deficiency . [CONTACT_290714] and I have co- authored 2 papers on the results of this study (see Biosketch) on 
endothelial function
74 and arterial stiffening (in review; first author) across the stages of the menopause 
[ADDRESS_354682] two additional manuscripts in preparation to be submitted this summer on 1) the role of 
telomeres; and 2) oxidative stress on vascular function in women with aging and E [ADDRESS_354683] published the primary manuscript from the R01-funded Testosterone and Exercise in Aging Men study (PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Schwartz), and with [CONTACT_290714] have begun analyzing the vascular data performed in that study. This has included analysis of ultrasound data for the determination of carotid artery compliance that will be used in the proposed study. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_290651] -artery mediated FMD is a major goal of this career development award. Although 
preliminary data is not required for this award, data from [CONTACT_290714]’s work demonstrates significant reductions in brachial- artery FMD in response to [ADDRESS_354684] (Fig 1, manuscript in preparation; candidate is co -author).  
3.b. Methods                  
Figure 2. Study design.  
Subjects.  Volunteers will be participants who have been 
recruited, screened and randomi zed to participation in the 
FAME study. Women will be nearing menopause (40- 60 
yrs) with normal menstrual cycles. Subjects will have had a medical history, physical examination, depression assessment, and clinical laboratory evaluation (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and TSH). Participants will be excluded from FAME for the following: irregular menstrual cycles, serum FSH>25mIU/mL measured during the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle, pregnant or lactating, on hormonal therapy, known hypersensitivity to leuprolide, score of ≥18 on the Beck Depression Inventory, proximal femur or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] T-score < -2.0, abnormal vaginal bleeding, thyroid dysfunction, uncontrolled hypertension (>150/90), currently 
exercising ≥30 min/d >4 d/wk or BMI≥ 35kg/m
2. Eligible FAME volunteers will be randomized to receive monthly 
injections of placebo (saline) or GnRHa (leuprolide acetate, 3.75 mg) for 6 mos. GnRHa -treated women are 
further randomized to endurance exercise training, or no exercise. Prior to beg inning the intervention treatment 
for FAME , volunteers will also be invited to participate in this study of vascular mechanisms for the cognitive 
effects of ovarian suppression. Participants will  be excluded for: Mini Mental State Examination77 score ≤27, 
history of neurologic disease or major psychiatric illness, major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_290652] 12 months, history of learning disability, or < high -school education. In order to protect the health and safety of the 
participants, exclusion criteria for this study will include any contraindication to magnetic resonance scanning 
(e.g., metal in body, claustrophobia, pregnant). These exclusions are specific to MRI and are consistent with most studies involving MRI. Potential participants will be screened for the presence of any of these exclusion criteria prior to participating in this MRI study.  
Volunteers will undergo vascular and cognitive/fMRI testing at baseline and 6 months, corresponding to the beginning and end of the FAME study. Baseline testing will be performed during the early follicular phase (i.e, days 2- 6) of the menstrual cycle. 
 
Separate from the parent FAME study, women randomized to GnRHa and no exercise will complete an additional 3 months of GnRHa + transdermal E
2 add-back,  with vascular and cognitive/fMRI testing at 9 
months (Fig 2).   
Sub-study.  An additional group of up to [ADDRESS_354685] 6 months will al so be enrolled.  
There is no intervention performed in this group, rather, they will serve as a comparison to the other premenopausal intervention groups. Similar to premenopausal women, late perimenopausal and 
postmenopausal women will be excluded for: Mini Mental State Examination
77 score ≤27, history of neurologic 
disease or major psychiatric illness, major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_290652] 12 months, history of learning disability, < high -school education, or contraindications to MRI. Experimental procedures in this group of 
participants will be limited to cognitive testing, fMRI and apolipoprotein ε4 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Experimental procedures 
Drug intervention. Volunteers will receive monthly intramuscular injections of placebo (saline) or leuprolide 
acetate (3.75mg depot suspension; Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Park, IL) for 6 mo. A subset (N=10) of women receiving GnRHa will continue for an additional 3 mo. Absence of pregnancy will be confirmed before each dose. A single injection of leuprolide produces an initial stimulation (~2 wk) followed by a prolonged 
6 
 suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_290653]; repeated monthly dosing maintains 
suppression of ovarian function. Leuprolide has been used clinically for up to [ADDRESS_354686] size, and vaginal dryness. There may be a development or worsening of depression and the occurrence of memory disorders.  In 
studies of women with uterine fibroids, GnRHa 3.75 mg/mo induced amenorrhea in 61%, 86%, and 90% of women after 1, 2, and 3 mo of treatment, respectively.
80,81 Return of  menses typi[INVESTIGATOR_118472] 2- 3 mo of 
cessation of therapy. Injections will be administered in a blinded manner, but participants on GnRHa may know their assignment because of the induction of amenorrhea and menopausal symptoms. Subjects will be instructed not to discuss their assignment with the outcome assessors. Subjects receiving an additional 3 mos 
of GnRHa  in this sub -study  will also receive weekly transdermal 17β -E
2 add-back therapy (0.075 mg/d) and 1 
cycle of MPA (5mg/d x 12 d at week 6 of E 2 add-back). The rationale for the MPA is to prevent break -through 
bleeding, and thus enhance participant retention, and to prevent potential endometrial hyperplasia,  although 
this is unlikely to occur during the 3- mo intervention. Additionally, we are interested in isolating the effects of E [ADDRESS_354687] to this proposed sub-study during this period. Study drug for the 3- month E
2 add-back portion unique to this sub- study will be  
paid for by [CONTACT_17210]- study  (Figure 3) . 
Brachial artery FMD . Brachial artery FMD and endothelium -independent dilation will be performed as 
previously described,82-84 and will conform strictly to published guidelines for assessing FMD in human 
subjects.85 The dilation of the brachial artery in response to the stimulus of forearm ischemia has been shown 
to be dependent on the release of NO from the vascular endothelium.86 Brachial artery diameter and flow 
velocity will be acquired by [CONTACT_2207] (GE Vivid i) and analyzed using commercial software (Vascular Analysis Tools 5.5.1, MIA). Endothelial -independent dilation will be determined by [CONTACT_290678] (0.4 mg). Blood press ure will be measured prior to the FMD. All images
 will be coded 
by [CONTACT_290679]. Placement of the ultrasound probe will be measured with a tape measure and landmarks identified (e.g., branch- points and veins) to ensure that the sa me location of the 
brachial artery is analyzed. In [CONTACT_290714]’s laboratory, the coefficient of variation (CV)  and intra -class 
correlation coefficient (ICC)  for trial -to trial reliability measured in 10 individuals for baseline brachial artery 
diameter, peak diameter and FMD (%) were 2% and 0.97, 1.5% and 0.99, and 2.2% and 0.99, respectively.  
Carotid artery compliance.  Common carotid artery diameter will be measured from the images derived from a 
GE Vivid i ultrasound machine equipped with a linear array transducer as previously described.  Carotid 
diameter images will be analyzed using software (Carotid Analyzer) as previously described.87 A longitudinal 
image of t he cephalic portion of the carotid artery will be acquired ~1 cm distal to the carotid bulb.  Time points 
that correspond with systolic expansion (within 60ms of the ECG T- wave) and basal diastolic relaxation (onset 
of the ECG R -wave) will be selected.  The distance (diameter) between the vessel far -wall boundary 
(lumen/intima interface), and a near -wall boundary (adventitia/media interface), will be measured. Similarly, far 
wall intimal- medial thickness will be measured at end diastole as previously described.88 The pressure 
waveform and amplitude will be obtained from the common carotid artery using arterial applanation tonometry, a high -fidelity strain gauge transducer (Millar Instruments), as previously described.  This tonometer has been 
shown to register a pressure wave with harmonic content that does not differ from that of an intra- arterially 
recorded wave, and the use of the tonometer on an exposed artery records a waveform identical to that recorded intra -arterially. The combination of ultrasound imaging of the common carotid artery with 
simultaneous applanation tonometric -obtained arterial pressure waveforms from the contralateral artery 
permits noninvasive determination of carotid artery compliance. The CV and ICC for trial -to trial reliability 
measured in 13 individuals for carotid artery diameter, carotid artery distention, pulse pressure and carotid artery compliance were 0.7% and 0.99, 4.2% and 0.99, 3.7% and 0.97, and 3.1% and 0.99, respectively.  
Pulse wave velocity . Arterial stiffness will be measured using the combination of high -resolution ultrasonography 
and applanation tonometry in a large elastic artery in the central circulation (carotid) 87.  Indirect measures of 
central  arterial stiffness (pulse- wave vel ocity [PWV], pulse wave analyses [PWA]) will be performed using the 
SphygmoCor XCEL (Atcor) system 89. PWV is measured using a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper thigh 
and applanation tonometry of the carotid artery in the neck89. PWA provides a measurement of central aortic blood 
pressure and augmentation index by [CONTACT_1299] a blood pressure cuff over the brachial artery in the upper arm 89. The 
[ADDRESS_354688] lies down on a table and is placed into a long donut -shaped magnet.  A specially 
designed coil will be placed around the head to provide better images (as is done with standard clinical examinations).  As the MRI scan is performed, the subject will hear loud rappi[INVESTIGATOR_290654] a MRI scan.  
Because the cognitive challenge of a working memory task has been shown to reveal differential patterns of activation for young versus older individuals 
[ADDRESS_354689] (Perlstein, 2003) will be administered to participants through a 
projector screen viewable from inside the scanner bore and using button boxes to respond. Participants will use the index fingers of each hand to indicate either a  “target” or “non-target” response. In the 0 -back 
condition, the target is any letter that matches the pre -specified “target” letter (i.e., “c”). In the 1 -back condition, 
the target is any letter identical to the letter immediately preceding it (i.e., the letter presented one trial back). In the 2 -back condition, the target is any letter that was identical to the one presented two trials back. Stimuli are 
pseudorandom sequences of letters presented in a fixed central location using E -Prime presentation software 
(Psychology Software Distribution, York, U.K.). Stimuli are presented for a 920- ms duration with a 1380- ms 
interstimulus interval. Participants complete 12 trials in each block and complete a  total of 9 blocks (three 
blocks of each of the three conditions). A short break (5– 20 s) between every [ADDRESS_354690] baseline brain activity. Prior to the start of the actual task, participants are trained on each of the three conditions. Participants are practice with three types of feedback on their 
performance (passive viewing, immediate feedback, and feedback at the end of block) per condition, until they demonstrate that they understand the task and their performance stabilizes. Reaction times and accuracy measures are obtained for each trial. The total task will be divided into three fMRI runs of around 10 minutes. In addition, a high -resolution structural scan will be obtained (6 min) as well as a rest ing-state scan that will 
allow for investigation of functional connectivity (6 min).  
Images will be acquired on a Siemens [ADDRESS_354691] T2 -weighted gradient -echo echo- planar imaging (EPI) technique angled 
parallel to the AC -PC line, while high resolution anatomical images will be obtained with a T1- weighted full 
head 3 dimensional MPRAGE 5 echo sequence (IPAT built- in) in the sagittal plane.  The rationale for using 
fMRI is  that this neuroimaging modality avoids ionizing radiation (e.g. with PET or SPECT) yet allows 
localization of activity (vs. EEG). fMRI is widely available and has been used in earlier studies, facilitating comparison with previous work.  
Cognitive function.  Standard cognitive tests that have demonstrated sensitivity to E
215,60,92,93 will be 
administered by a trained psychometrician in a private setting. The battery takes approximately 1 hour to complete and consists of the following tests (see also Appendix A):   
1) Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test94   4)  Digit Span Forward and Backward95  
2) Wide Range Achievement Test 4 -reading96  5)  Controlled Oral Word Association Test97 
3) Trail Making Test A and B98    6)  Stroop Col or Word Interference Test99 
This battery is not sufficient for comprehensive cognitive evaluation or clinical diagnosis. Nonetheless, any subject that meets  pre-specified cut -points for potentially significant cognitive impairment will have her results 
reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Grigsby [CONTACT_290680].

Laboratory Measures . Fasting plasma 
concentrations of glucose, insulin, total -, HDL - and 
LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, estrone, estradiol, 
total testosterone, progesterone, DHEAS, albumin, 
SHBG and hemoglobin A1c will be measured at baseline and 6 months as part of the FAME study. These measures will be repeated at 9 months in the E
2 add-back group with costs for those 9 -month 
assays covered by [CONTACT_17210]- study . All assays will be 
performed by [CONTACT_290681].  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_290655]112Arg polymorphism (i.e ., 
APOEε -4 allele) will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Christina 
Aquilante’s laboratory at the University of Colorado using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and pyrosequencing. Investigators will remain blinded to genotype and results will not be revealed to participants as this does not provide clinically relevant information at this time.  The genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_290656]. This test is not part of the parent FAME study and will be covered by [CONTACT_17210]- study.  Figure 3 shows which interventions, tests and 
procedures will be done as part of the FAME study and which will be done as part of the sub- study.  
Questionnaires.  The following questionnaires will be administered at each of the 3 monthly Lupron injection 
visits for those subjects participating in the estrogen add- back portion of the study:   
1. Menopausal Symptom List100. This questionnaire records the frequency and severity of menopause -
related symptoms, including vasomotor, psychological and general somatic symptoms.  
2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]101. This questionnaire monitors sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_172510].  
We will also obtain a reproductive/pregnancy history using a questionnaire. Because pregnancy complications have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, data from this questionnaire will support further investigation into whether these factors contribute to vascular aging in women.  
 
3.c. Analysis Plan and Sample Size Justification  (prepared by [CONTACT_290682] , MS and Kim McFann, 
PhD) 
fMRI analysis : Standard image pre- processing will be conducted with the FM RIB Software Library (FSL; 
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/index.h tml), including motion correction with MCFLIRT, brain tissue extraction with 
BET, spatially smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 8 mm), mean -based intensity normalization, and 
high-pass temporal filtered to remove low -frequency noise. Data from any individual with more than 2mm 
motion in any direction will be discarded. Statistical analyses will be conducted with FM RIB’s improved linear 
model convolved using a double- gamma hemodynamic response function. For comparisons across individuals, 
parameter and variance estimates for each participant’s data will be registered to Montreal Neurological 
Institute standard stereotaxic space (MNI152) with the two- stage registration procedure implemented in 
FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool. The FM RIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME 1+2) will be 
used to model the mixed- effects variance for each contrast of interest, taking into account both fixed effects 
(e.g., hormonal status) and random effects. Statistically -defined clusters will be considered signific ant, if they 
exceeded a specific voxel- wise threshold (e.g., p  < 0.0025, Z=3.02) and consisted of at least the required 
number of contiguous voxels to correct for a whole- brain error rate at p  < 0.05 as determined by [CONTACT_290683] (AFNI; Cox, 1996). Based on group differences in the relevant studies described above we expect that our sample of 17 individuals per group will be adequate. Specifically, Desmond and Glover
102 found that with a liberal threshold of 0.05, about 12 subjects are required 
to achieve 80% power at the single voxel level for typi[INVESTIGATOR_124976]. Our sample size will be 42% larger.  
Vascular measures:  Two-sample t tests with an alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_354692]. Moreau’s laboratory measuring FMD before and after ovarian hormone suppression in 22 premenopausal women found a change of 2.8±1.9% (unpublished data). For FMD, 17 subjects/group give 80% power to test the null hypothesis of no difference against the alternative of a meaningf ul 2 ± 2% change
26,29,103. 
For carotid artery compliance, 17 subjects/group also give 80% power to test the null hypothesis of no difference against the alternative of a meaningful 0.25 ± 0.[ADDRESS_354693] using data from 17 volunteers receiving an additional 3 months  of 
GnRHa with E 2 add-back; at an  alpha =0.05 level, there will be > 80% power to detect a meaningful 1 SD 
change in either FMD or compliance.   
Correlation among changes : To address hypothesis 1b, we will estimate the correlations of changes in PFC 
activation with changes in arterial stiffness and changes in endothelial function over the first 6 months of 
intervention. With  N=17 (assuming the placebo data will add little to an evaluation of change), a Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient of 0.[ADDRESS_354694] significant; that is, power is just over 50%.  
Laboratory measures : The hormone levels will be used to demonstrate ovarian suppression with GnRHa, and 
subsequent increase in E [ADDRESS_354695] for day -to-day variability in E 2 levels between 
vascular and cognitive/fMRI testing. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_290657] E
2; this will be evaluated by [CONTACT_290684], regressing the change in PFC activation, arterial 
stiffness, or endothelial function on an indicator for treatment and the potential covariates.   
 
Measures of cognitive function: Although we are not powered to detect clinically meaningful changes in these 
measures, we are interested in any changes in performance with ovarian suppression or E 2 add-back. 
Suggestive trends will inform hypothesis generation and design of future studies.  
3.d. Proposed Timeline. See Fig 4.      Figure 4. Proposed Timeline      
3.e. Mentors. Mentors’ research expertise and responsibilities under this proposed career 
development award are described below.  
[CONTACT_9691] S. Schwartz , Senior faculty mentor . 
[CONTACT_19072] will supervise the proposed career 
development and research. As Division Head of 
Geriatric s, he will ensure [CONTACT_290715] can devote 
at least 75% of her time to activities directly related to this proposed career development application. He will assist her development into an independent investigator by [CONTACT_290685], supporting her in obtaining needed resources, assisting in the development of new collaborations, and supporting her academic advancement and promotion.  
[CONTACT_290716] L. Moreau, Co- mentor . [CONTACT_290714] will mentor [CONTACT_290715] in the acquisition and analysis of the 
vascular measures to be used in this study, so that she is able to perform these measures independently. [CONTACT_290714] will assist in the analysis and reporting of findings from the proposed study and provide guidance on 
future grant applications. With [CONTACT_19072], she will also provide mentorship in professional development to 
promote the candidate’s successful transition to an independent research career.  
[CONTACT_221243] T. Banich, Consulting mentor.  [CONTACT_290717] will supervise the neuroimaging and fMRI analysis  at her 
laboratory in Boulder, and oversee the candidate’s training in neuroimaging and assessment of executive function in clinical research. [CONTACT_290717] will
 assist [CONTACT_290715] in data interpretation and preparation of 
manuscripts, and provide guidance as she prepares her R01 application toward the end of the award period.  
[CONTACT_290718], Consulting mentor.  [CONTACT_290719] [CONTACT_290686]. He will review any  profiles that meet pre- specified criteria for potentially significant 
impairment, and discuss these results with participants and their health care providers. He will assist the candidate in understanding the attributes and uses of specific cognitive tests, such that the candidate will be able to effectively work with neuropsychologists to develop appropriate cognitive testing batteries for future research.  
[CONTACT_290720] M. Kohrt, Consulting mentor . [CONTACT_290721] will provide scientific advice and infrastructural support (e.g., 
access to study population) to leverage the limited research funds available through the K23 Career Development Award. In addition to specific scientific mentorship, [CONTACT_290721] will provide guidance on general clinical research issues (e.g., study design, randomization, recruitment and adherence, unbiased outcomes assessment, data and safety monitoring) and on career advancement.  
3.f. Limitations. Enrolling participants from the FAME study is a major strength that permits  the majority of the 
K23 resources to support the cost of fMRI imaging and analysis , yet it  imposes additional subject burden. To 
[ADDRESS_354696] dropped and only 
one drop was due to side effects of GnRHa.  The FAME study is early in its recruitment. Target enrollment is 24 
in each of the 3 arms (placebo, GnRHa and GnRHa + exercis e) and there are currently no other ancillary 
studies. We are thus confident we can enroll sufficient numbers  from the parent study.  The candidate will apply 
for additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_290658] , CCTSI Co -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and Center for Women’s Health award 
mechanisms to support the enrollment of additional subjects if needed. In this event, she would be able to 
utilize the existing recruiting mechanisms and resources from the SCOR grant.  
This model of ovarian hormone suppression does not mimic the gradual process of natural menopause. 
However, menopause occurs at a time when women are also beginning to experience other age-related physiological changes, making it difficult to isolate the effects of aging from those of ovarian failure. Because this is a  mechanistic study, this model strengthens the design to allow us to effectively study how changes in 
arterial stiffness and endothelial function due to loss of ovarian function may mediate changes in cognition . 
Ideally we would have a placebo group during  the add- back portion of the study; due to resource constraints 
and subject burden this was not included. To preserve blinding, cognitive testing and fMRI analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_290687]. Ideally we would measure changes in cerebral arterial 
compliance in response to ovarian hormone suppression, but these methods have not been developed. The measures of peripheral vascular function proposed for this study are non -invasive, well - validated, and have 
been correlated with white matter changes in the brain.
32   
Participant burden, location and scheduling of equipment preclude performing the vascular and fMRI 
testing on the same day. Although this raises the possibility of day -to-day variability affecting our results, this 
will be minimized by [CONTACT_290688] (i.e., days 2 -6) of the menstrual 
cycle at baseline. Testing for visits 2 and 3 (for subset receiving add- back) will be done while participants are 
receiving GnRHa. We will measure E [ADDRESS_354697] limited our assessment of cognitive function to examination of the PFC and tests of executive function/w orking memory. This approach is based on the existing literature supporting the PFC as the site of E
[ADDRESS_354698] brain activity in individuals with existing  cerebrovascular pathology ;
105 this is unlikely to be 
problematic in our relatively young, healthy volunteers. The use of fMRI is a new direction for the candidate; 
key mentorship in this area will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Banich, a recognized expert in the use of fMRI in clinical studies, and by [CONTACT_290689]. As research increasingly moves toward detection of preclinical changes in brain activity and cognition, the candidate’s ability to incorporate neuroimaging into future research is a major strength of this application.   
     We are proposing to study one possible mechanism for the effects of E
[ADDRESS_354699] effects on beta- amyloid accumulation and deposition, tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial actions on brain activation, antioxidant properties, and effects on insulin sensitivity, body composition and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. It is also possible that other ovarian hormones (e.g. progesterone, testosterone, DHEA) may have important effects on cognitive function. Likewise, other aspects of GnRHa treatment, including hot flashes, and effects on sleep and mood may affect cognition. Data on menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and depression as well as hormone levels, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], insulin sensitivity and body composition will be collected as part of the FAME study allowing us to account for these potential covariates.  
3.g. Interpretation and future directions  
[ADDRESS_354700] we will observe the hypothesized negative effects on brain activation and vascular function in response to GnRHa treatment. If changes in PFC 
activation and vascular function are correlated as we hypothesize, this would lead us to investigate whether other therapeutic or lifestyle interventions that target vascular function (i.e. exercise) could counteract the negative effects of ovarian suppression. Future studies could also measure intra -cranial blood flow and 
compliance, structural brain changes or brain expression of E
2 receptors to more closely examine effects on 
the brain. If changes in PFC activation are not correlated with changes in vascular function, this would lead us to investigate other possible mechanisms for the negative effects of ovarian hormone suppression on cognition (e.g. infla mmation, oxidative stress, amyloid accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation).  
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_354701] the effects of E 2 deficiency .  If PFC 
activation and vascular function are not restored, or only partially restored, this would lead us to investigate the contributions of other ovarian hormones or effects of GnRHa.

 Protection of Human Subjects  
The proposed study meets the definition of a clinical trial in that it is a prospective biomedical research study of 
human subjects that involves random assignment to pharmacologic and behavior intervention groups. However, we consider it to be clinical research on a small number of subjects, rather than a ‘clinical trial’ because it is designed to reveal mechanistic consequences of the loss of ovarian function. It is not a Phase III clinical trial.  
1. Risks to Human Subjects  
a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics. 
We will enroll a total of 51  subjects in this study. Subjects will be healthy women 40- 60 years of age who are 
enrolled in the  Females, Aging, Metabolism and E xercise (FAME) study ([CONTACT_290709], PI). For detailed 
subject characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, please see the Research Strategy, section 2.c.2.  
b. Sources of Materials.  
The research materials that will be collected from human subjects include:  
• medical records when necessary to follow up on health status  
• blood and tissue samples for screening and for study -specific outcomes, as described in the research 
strategy  
• data from all the study procedures, as described in the research strategy  
The identity of subjects and the data acquired as a result of this study will be treated with professional standards of confidentiality. All HIPAA guidelines for the protection of health information will be followed. Only members of the research team will have access to protected health information (PHI) collected from the 
volunteers. Confidentiality of electronic data will be maintained by [CONTACT_290690]. The master document linking patient names with identification numbers will be maintained in a separate password- protected file with restricted access. Paper records will be kept in individual study charts 
that are stored either in a locked cabinet or in a locked office. Data records will be maintained for at least [ADDRESS_354702] access. Sharing of data with investigators or monitoring 
personnel outside the institution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_290659], in a manner that is compliant with HIPAA regulations.  
c. Potential Risks. 
• Vascular measures (brachial artery FMD,  carotid artery compliance and pulse wave velocity).  There are no 
known risks to participants associated with these procedures.  Some participants may have discomfort in 
the hand (pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]) during the cuff occlusion portion of the FMD measurement.  
• Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements. The magnetic field of the MR environment 
has the potential to cause burns or bodily injury if ferrous metal objects are implanted in the body, or if personal articles containing ferrous material are brought into the environment.The risk of MRI to pregnant 
women and fetuses is currently unknown. The MRI may cause discomfort due to scanner noise. There may be some discomfort from lying still and in one position for a long time. At sufficient exposure l evels, 
peripheral nerve stimulation is perceptible as “tingling” or “tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” sensations. PNS symptoms will usually subside shortly after the scan is completed. Participants may feel nervousness or feelings of claustrophobia.There is a risk that the image will reveal an observation concerning an individual research participant that has potential clinical importance but is beyond the aims of this protocol. In the event of the confirmation of a significant anomaly in a participant’s brain image, this informat ion will likely be distressing 
to the participant.  
• Cognitive testing. Subjects may experience frustration or anxiety during the testing session. It is possible that this testing could reveal previously unrecognized significant cognitive impairment that could be distressing to the subject.   
• Study drugs.  As participants in the FAME study, all participants in this proposed research will be 
randomized to receive placebo (saline) or GnRHa (leuprolide acetate) 3.75 mg/mo by [CONTACT_290691] 6 months (6 doses), plus or minus exercise. Women randomized to GnRHa and 
no exercise will receive 3 additional monthly doses after completion of the FAME study, for a total of 9 doses. During these 3 additional months, these women will also receive week ly transdermal 17β -estradiol 
0.075 mg/d (12 doses), and oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 5mg/day for 12 days (12 doses) at the beginning of week 6 of estradiol therapy to minimize breakthrough bleeding and thereby [CONTACT_290692] 
13 
 participant retention.  
Leuprolide acetate  
Contraindications for use include: hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogs or any of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_290660]; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding; known or suspected pregnancy; lactation.  
In women who are pregnant, use of leuprolide acetate  may cause fetal abnormalities.  
Leuprolide acetate may cause an anaphylactic reaction in volunteers with hypersensitivity to GnRH.  
Regular menstruation should stop during leuprolide acetate therapy but spotting or breakthrough bleeding may occur. Cessation of menses does not ensure that pregnancy will not occur. Normal menstrual function is usually restored within 2- [ADDRESS_354703] over the 24- week intervention should not 
be clinically significant and should be recovered slowly after discontinuation of leuprolide acetate treatment. There may be a development or worsening of depression and the occurrence of memory disorders.  
Leuprolide acetate therapy for 24 weeks may cause an increase in fat mass (1 -2 kg), a decrease in fat-free 
mass (1 -1.5 kg), an increase in total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol (5 -10%), and an increase in triglycerides 
(15-20%).  
Local injection site reactions including induration and abscess may occur.  
Transdermal 17β -estradiol  
Contraindications to use include: hypersensitivity to estradiol or any of the components in the transdermal formulation; arterial thromboembolic disease; breast cancer; deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; estrogen -dependent neoplasia; undiagnosed vaginal bleeding; liver disease; pregnancy; or thrombophilic 
disorder. Transdermal estradiol may cause irritation at the application site, edema, fluid retention and weight gain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, headache, depression, breast tenderness and withdrawal bleeding. Rare but serious side effects include heart disease, myocardial infarction, breast cancer, hypercalcemia, gallbladder disease, venous thromboembolism, anaphylaxis, stroke, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pulmonary  embolism and breast cancer.  
Medroxyprogesterone acetate  
Contraindications to use include: hypersensitivity to progesterone or any of the ingredients, breast cancer, liver disease, estrogen or progesterone- dependent neoplasia, pregnancy, thromboembolic dis orders, 
cerebral vascular disease, and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. Oral progesterone may cause weight gain, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, nervousness, amenorrhea, menstrual spotting, reduced libido and fatigue.  Rare but serious side effects include anaphylaxis, decreased bone mineral density and fracture of bone.  
• Venipuncture. There is a small risk of local hematoma, infection, and thrombosis associated with intravenous blood sampling. 
• Confidentiality and privacy. The use of questionnaires, interviews, and collection of personal medical 
information poses a risk to confidentiality and privacy and may cause embarrassment.  
 
2. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
a. Recruitment and Informed Consent.   
Subjects will be recruited from the FAME study. After volunteers complete screening and are determined to be 
eligible for the FAME study, they will be invited to participate in this sub- study. Interested participants will meet 
individually with a member of the research team to review all aspects of the study and consent form in a 
private, quiet environment. Volunteers will be encouraged to ask any questions they may have regarding the study and what is expected of them should they choose to participate. A description of the MRI procedures is included in the consent form, and all participants will be given a verbal description of the MRI screening 
process and potential risks of MRI studies.The member of the study team obtaining consent will stress that: 1) all research participation is voluntary, 2) subjects may withdraw at any time, and 3) the decision to participate or not participate will not affect the subject’s medical care or any benefits to which the subject is entitled. They will further be asked to explain the consent form in their own words to ensure understanding of the study and 
what is expected of them. The consent form details the experimental protocol and potential risks, and must be signed prior to any participation in the study. The protocol and consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_290693] (COMIRB) and the CTRC. The CTSA at the University of Colorado AMC has 
a designated officer for review of human subjects protections for research utilizing CTSA resources. Each volunteer will be given a copy of the signed consent form; the original will be kept in the subject’s study file. In compliance with HIPAA, each participant will sign the institutional COMIRB/HIPAA form: Authorization to Use or Release Health Information for Research Purposes. This form describes all information that will be obtained 
[ADDRESS_354704] Risks.  
• Vascular  measurements  (brachial artery FMD, carotid artery compliance, and pulse wave velocity). There 
are no known risks to participants associated with these procedures.  If a participant has significant 
discomfort or pain with the cuff occlusion for the FMD measurement, the procedure will be stopped.  
• fMRI measurements. This protocol will be performed using an MR scanner employing pulse sequences 
and hardware that have been approved by [CONTACT_290694]. The field strength is 3 Tesla and all relevant operating characteristics (RF power deposition, rate of change o f the field gradients, coil 
design) fall within the limits of FDA guidelines for NMR exposure. Participants will be carefully screened to exclude those who may have metal in or on their bodies that cannot be removed (e g., bullets, metal filings, body pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982], etc.). MR Facility rules strictly forbid staff from entering the magnet room carrying metal objects. The risk of claustrophobia is minimized by [CONTACT_290695] -reported claustrophobia and 
making sure the subject is lying comfortably with head and neck supported and providing ear protection 
with headphones, a mirror to see out, a button to signal distress, and an intercom.  Scan time will be kept to a minimum.  If they are unsure about whether or not they may be pregnant, female participants will be given the opportunity to complete a urine pregnancy test immediately before the scanning period, and those with a positive result will not be scanned. With regard to PNS, participants are given a squeeze ball to use in case of an emergency. They  are informed that if they experience PNS related sensations or are 
otherwise uncomfortable, they can alert the MRI technologist via the squeeze ball and the technologist will stop the scan immediately.  
 
In the case of an anomalous finding in a brain image , the following procedure is followed:  
 1. The technologist and/or research personnel flag potential abnormalities.  
2. The MRI technologist notifies the INC Director of Operations, the MRN Director of Research and Clinical Operations, and the P.I.  
3. The scan gets  queued to the radiologist worklist in COINS.  All cases of suspected incidental findings 
are sent for formal neuroradiologic review at MRN.  
4. The radiology review contains a written summary of the findings and classifies the referral status into one of thes e categories:  
• There is not enough information from the MRI scan to complete a full review. No obvious abnormalities found.        
• MRI shows nothing obvious that needs medical attention.  
• MRI shows something that may or may not be of medical concern.  Partic ipants should consider 
discussing the enclosed report with their doctor.  
• MRI shows something that needs to be brought to the attention of your doctor.  Participants may 
also be contact[CONTACT_290696]/or MRN Medical Director about this report. 
5. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_290661] (coded via URSI) as soon as the review is 
completed. If an urgent referral is recommended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290662].  
6. If a referral is recommended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290663]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_290664] (this information is in the letter mailed to the participant as well). Routine referrals are handled on a case by [CONTACT_290697]/Medical Director to determine if the participant should receive a call in advance.  
7. All cases reviewed will generate a formal radiology report, which is printed on letterhead and a copy of which is mailed to the participant. In the case of an urgent referral, someone from the study team or the Medical Director will contact [CONTACT_290698].  
• Cognitive testing. Testing will be conducted in a dedicated, private, quiet room by [CONTACT_290699]. Any subject who expresses distress or discomfort with the testing may elect to take a break, or stop the testing. Subjects meeting pre- specified cut -points on any of the cognitive tests t hat may 
indicate clinically significant cognitive impairment will be flagged for review by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Grigsby. [CONTACT_290719] [CONTACT_290700]. We have o btained  a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to provide an 
additional level of protection for the cognitive tests.  
15 
 • Study drugs. The risks associated with use of the study drugs will be minimized by [CONTACT_290701]. All participants will have been screened for contraindications to GnRHa through the FAME study. Participants will be observed for [ADDRESS_354705] pregnancy; 
contraception (not hormonal) must be used.  
• Venipuncture.  The risks of hematoma and infection are minimized by [CONTACT_290702] . 
• Confidentiality and privacy. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_290703], when possible, and by [CONTACT_290704] a private setting.  
Evaluation of study -relate d events  
Participants will meet with a study clinician every [ADDRESS_354706] results likewis e are for 
research purposes only and no clinical interpretation will be provided unless significant impairment is suspected. The potential benefits of the study to women in general could be significant , including information 
about the loss of ovarian hormones on vascular function and cognition. This knowledge could lead to new interventions to prevent or delay cognitive decline.  
 4. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
Results from this study will add to the scientific knowledge of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment, specifically possible vascular mechanisms – arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction – that may underlie 
the effects of estrogen on cognitive function in women. This information will be important in informing future studies  of therapeutic or lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay cognitive decline in the aging population.  
 
5. Data and safety monitoring plan  
The NIH requirements for a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) are as follows (from the SF424 guide): 
“NIH specif ically requires the establishment of Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) for multi -site 
clinical trials involving interventions that entail potential risk to the participants, and generally for Phase III clinical trials. Although Phase I and Phase II  clinical trials may also need DSMBs, smaller clinical trials may not 
require this oversight format, and alternative monitoring plans may be appropriate.” As discussed above, the proposed study is viewed as mechanistically driven clinical research but not a ‘clinical trial.’ In this context and 
based on the NIH DSMB recommendations, we propose that safety monitoring can be performed by [CONTACT_5051], with oversight by [CONTACT_290705]. During the first 6 months of this study which coincide with subjects’ participation in the FAME study, the Safety Officer will be monitoring the safety of the vascular studies, fMRI studies and cognitive testing only, as any GnRHa- related safety issues will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_290706] . 
Roles and responsibilities of the Safety Officer  
The Safety Officer will: 1) monitor recruitment, enrollment, and adherence of study participants; 2) approve criteria for modifying or discontinuing the drug interventions for individual subjects; and 3) review serious adverse events (SAEs). Any data sets that the Safety Officer may ask to review will be prepared by a biostatistician. The Safety Officer will remain blinded to treatment status unless, for safety reasons, it is decided that knowledge of the treatment code is important.  
The objectives of the Safety Officer will be to assess the safety of the interventions and to assure the highest 
[ADDRESS_354707] safety. The Safety Officer will: 1) review the protocol as funded and make suggestions for 
any changes (especially safety related); 2) determine appropriate adverse effect endpoints to be monitored 
and generate individual - and study -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]; 3) review study progress and data quality; 4) determine 
formatting for data reports; 5) review endpoints for safety and efficacy; 6) submit reports and suggestions to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290665]; and 7) add to or modify this list of objectives.  
Because of the nature of the study, the Safety Officer will need to monitor safety only and not efficacy. In the event the Safety Officer determines that the study or a phase of the study should be stopped for reasons of safety, this will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290665]; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_290666] -AMC IRB.  
Safety Officer meetings will address issues of protocol design (including any proposed changes in design, data management or analysis), recruitment, retention, data management, and data quality. The Safety Officer will summarize any information to be noted or acted on by [CONTACT_978].  
Defining and reporting serious adverse events (SAEs)  
We will promptly notify the IRB (within 5 days of the occurrence) when unexpected SAEs (unanticipated problems) occur, defined as death, life threatening illness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], congenital anomaly/birth defects, and persistent/significant disability. Any SAE that is unexpected and related or possibly related to the drug or other research intervention will be reported. SAEs that are unrelated to the research intervention will not be reported to the IRB (however, we will report these to the Safety Officer and 
NIH if they wish to be informed). Risks that are described in the protocol and consent will not be reported promptly to the IRB unless they occur more frequently or are more serious than expected. One exception to this rule is in the case of a death. All deaths must be reported, whether or not the death was related to the research.  
In addition to following the requirements above, we anticipate that the Safety Officer will define study -specific 
SAEs th at trigger the cessation of the intervention for an individual. Because the study interventions include a 
drug intervention that is used clinically (i.e., risks are known), we do not believe study -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_290667].

Background: Standing trunk extension postures  have been used for many years 
as a mechanical approach to low back pain  (LBP), sometimes directed by 
[CONTACT_721845], sometimes subconsciously  performed by [CONTACT_4676] s to 
relieve LBP. However, no study to date has investigated  the eff ect of standing 
trunk extension postures  on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721778] .  
Objective: The purpose of this study will be  to evaluate in subjects with LBP  
following a period of trunk loading, how spi[INVESTIGATOR_721779]/or pain, symptoms’ 
centralization, and function  outcome measures respond to:  (1) standing repetitive 
trunk extension  posture ; and (2) standing sustained trunk extension posture . 
Lumbar range of motion ( ROM ) achieved during these two trunk extension 
postures will be compared to spi[INVESTIGATOR_721780] . 
Methods:  A pre -test, post -test comparison group design (randomized clinical 
trial) will be used to determine how spi[INVESTIGATOR_721781] a period of spi[INVESTIGATOR_721782]. 
The study will use a 2 (between subjects – type of tr unk extensio n: sustained vs. 
repetitive) x 3 (within subjects - time: before vs. after  vs. 2 weeks after  
intervention ) mixed design to evaluate the effects of sustained and repetitive 
trunk extension in standing on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], pain, symptoms’ centraliza tion and 
function . 
Statistical Analysis: A 2(Strategy) X 3(Time) mixed  ANOVA will be used to 
statistically identify significant interactions and main effects  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_721784], pain  
and function  outcome measures . Post -hoc pairwise comparisons will be used to 
locate significant differences between the different conditions  (Time) .  
Significance will be set at α = 0.05. Pearson product -moment correlations will be 
used to measure correlations b etween lumbar ROM  in relation to spi[INVESTIGATOR_721785] . The Kruskal -Wallis 1-factor ANOVA for d ifference 
scores will used to determine changes of intensity and location of symptoms 
following sustained versus repetitive standing trunk extension. Spearman Rank 
correlation will be  used to evaluate the relationship between spi[INVESTIGATOR_721786] .

private industry, state and local government employees. Among these injuries 
and illnesses, 16.6 % were lo w back related equating to 191, [ADDRESS_985846] from work  (US Department of Labor, Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, 2016 ). An analysis funded by [CONTACT_721846]. The authors further  reported that the annual cost of pharmaceuticals for 
pain management was $16.[ADDRESS_985847] of lumbar s urgeries was $2.[ADDRESS_985848] costs estimates were $18.9 billion for disability 
compensation and $6.9 billion for productivity loss ( Gaskin 2011 , The Economic 
Costs of Pain in the [LOCATION_002] ).  
A joint clinical practice guideline  developed  by [CONTACT_721847]  (LBP) into 
three categories: (1) nonspecific LBP; (2)  LBP potentially associated with 
radiculopathy or spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078];  and (3) LBP potentially associated with another 
specific spi[INVESTIGATOR_429323] . Of those three,  lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation 
is one of the most common spi[INVESTIGATOR_721791] (Chou 2007, Goupi[INVESTIGATOR_5975] 1998, McCall 2000).  In order 
to better understand the IVD ’s role in the development or persistence of LBP and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078],  there have been many stadiometric studies primarily focused on 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_721792], Research Proposal  
 
 
 8 (Kourtis 2004; Magnusson 1996; Lazzarini 2014 ; Simmerman 2011 ). These 
studies stem from IVD  height preservation in th e aging spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Natural IVD  height 
preservation is so important that the biomedical field has examined the use of 
growth factors for IVD biologic regeneration (Masuda 2004) in order to more 
naturally preserve IVD  biomechanical and physiological function as opposed to 
surgical  disruption. To further understand IVD  functional properties, researchers 
have studied the IVD  hydraulic permeability and the influence that age and/or 
degeneration have on fluid movement (Gu 1999).  The authors reported that with 
IVD deg eneration, the radial permeability of the anulus fibrosus decreased , 
mainly because  of reduced  water content. However , the axial and circumferential 
permeability coefficients increase d, mainly due to structural change, leading to 
greater IVD isotropic permeability behavior  (Gu 1999).   
Sixty one percent of  time in the work and home environment  is spent in 
the standing posture  (US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016 ). 
Although prolonged weight bearing postures , such as standing and walking , have 
been associated with decreased spi[INVESTIGATOR_308431] (Tyrrell  1985, Puntumetakul et al 
2009 ), some studies reported  that seated weight bearing postures could result in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_721793] (Magnusson 199 6a). Sustained and repetitive lumbar extension 
postures frequently occur after periods of prolonged unloading such as sleep . 
These postures are  periodically repeated throughout the day  during activities 
such as standing and walking  (US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor 
Statistics  2016) .  
People presenting with directional preferences that include  lumbar

 [ADDRESS_985849] trunk extension  
(Stankovic 1990 , Swinkels 2009, Oliveira 2012 ). Significant and rapid changes in 
central and distal pain intensity and location have resulted from standing end -
range trunk extension  in patients with low back and referred pain (Donelson 
1991) . Additional studies reported that standing back extension exer cises 
resulted in back pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]’ prevention and decreased back pain in care 
workers (Matsudaira 2015; Dunsford 2011 ). Standing exercises have the 
advantage to be functional and easily performed in work and home settings 
(Tonosu 2016).   
 A positive relationship has been found between lumbar extension range 
of motion (ROM) and the centralization  process in patients with LBP (By[CONTACT_721848] 
2009 ). The centralization phenomenon is part of the clinical examination finding s 
used to identify specific treatment -based classification subgroups. Centralization 
is characterized by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_721794] a distal to proximal direction in response to therapeutic interventions 
including u nloading or specific movement strategies (Brennan et al 2006, Laslett 
et al 2005). The operational definition and measurement techniques for 
centralization have been laid out in several studies (Aina et al 2004, Werneke et 
al 2008) . A decrease d spi[INVESTIGATOR_721795], and functional ROM needs to  be restored to allow for the return to 
previous activity levels  (Battie 1987, Vaisy 2015 ). Several methods  have been 
used to increase spi[INVESTIGATOR_721796], repeated, passive postures , and 
propriocepti ve neuromuscular facilitation.  Both standing and prone lumbar 
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 10 extension postures  are effective for treating low back Dysfunction Syndrome 
(McKenzie 2003). However, which method is best suited for increasing spi[INVESTIGATOR_721797]  (Sady 198 2; Nordez 2017 ). One author found static  prone  
postures  to increase ROM more effectively with 30 -60 second sustained  postures  
as compared to 15 -second postures , but no difference between the effectiveness 
of 30 -second and 60 -second postures  (Bandy 1994 ; Page 2012 ).  
Repe titive postures  are another method used to increase ROM by 
[CONTACT_721849]. The McKenzie classification of 
Dysfunction Syndrome is defined as the condition in which adaptive shortening of 
soft tissues and resultant loss of mobility cause pain by [CONTACT_721850] -range movement  (Hefford 2008 ). Poor p ostural habits, 
previous trauma  and inflammatory or degenerative processes can lead to this 
dysfunction. These patients can develop contraction, scarrin g, adherence and 
adaptive shortening or imperfect repair and pain is felt when the abnormal tissue 
is stretched.  
Treatment of the Dysfunction Syndrome consi sts of postural correction , 
along  with repeated end -range movements  to remodel contracted  structure s. 
This intermittent stress is reported to provide an adequate stretching effect  and is 
most effective in the tre atment of extension dysfunction  (McKenzie 2003) . One 
study found that patients with LBP  chose to perform their extension posture  for 
home exercise  in standing 80.8 % of the time and only 19.2 % of the time in the 
prone position , resulting in similar  clinical outcomes  where b oth groups showed 
equal improvements in lumbar extension ROM  (By[CONTACT_721848] 2008) .

 11 Previous studies investigated the effects of postures and movements in 
lying (unloaded ) or seated positions on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783] (Owens 2009 , Gerke et al 
2010; Pape  2018 ). These studies  primarily focused on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721798] [ADDRESS_985850] 
rehabilitation programs focused on LBP prevention and management use both 
repetitive and/or sustained spi[INVESTIGATOR_721799]’ 
outcomes ( Peterson 2015 , Surkitt 2012 ).  Such  exercises can be performed in  
lying or standing  position .  Although patients with acute and recurre nt low back 
and referred pain  tend to respond  well to directionally preferenced  postures 
(Machado 2006 ), subjects with chronic symptoms tend to display  greater signs of 
sensitization,  biopsychosocial issues ( Huysmans 2017 ), and tend to respond less 
favorably to directional preferences postures and exercises ( Garcia 2017 ). In 
order to assess the biopsychosocial effect on clinical outcomes during this study, 
every subject will complete  the Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire  (FABQ) 
(Cleland et al 2008) .  
No study to date has investigated the effects of standing extension 
postures on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], pain, centralization  and function . Therefore , the 
purposes of this study will be to evaluate in a sample of LBP  patients  the effect of 
standing trunk  extens ion, both sustained and repetitive , following a period of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_721782],  on (1) spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783]; (2) pain; (3) symptoms centralization  and (4 ) 
function al measures .

 12 PURPOSE, AIMS, VALUES  
Purpose(s) :  
The purpose of this study is to a ssess the effect of commonly used 
standing trunk  extension postures  on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721800], symptoms’ 
centralization, and function in patients with LBP.  
Aim(s) :  
Our aim is to  better understand the effect of standing sustained and 
repetitive trunk extensions on spi[INVESTIGATOR_721801]’ symptoms 
intensity, centralization and function . With many patients commonly falling into a 
directional preference group and responding p ositively to mechanical spi[INVESTIGATOR_216969], it is our aim to investigate if such trunk extension postures  performed  in 
standing affect spi[INVESTIGATOR_721802], centralization and functional 
alterations.  
Value(s) :  
No previous study has examined changes in spi[INVESTIGATOR_721803].  The results of this study could impact 
rehabilitation programs that include standing trunk extension as a means of 
therapeutic intervention. This is valuable especially in aging population with 
degenerated IVD’s, loss of IVD height and propensities toward spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078],

Research Design(s)  
A pre -test, post -test comparison group design (randomized clinical trial) 
will be used to determine how spi[INVESTIGATOR_721810] a period of spi[INVESTIGATOR_721782]. The study 
will use a 2 (between subjects – type of trunk extension: sustained vs. repetitive) 
x 3 (within subjects - time: before vs. after vs. 2 weeks after)  mixed design to 
evaluate the effects of sustained and repetitive trunk extension in standing on 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], pain, centralization and function  outcome measures.  
Pre-study Approvals  
 The study will be submitted to the [LOCATION_007] Tech University Health Sciences  
Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval.  The trial will then be 
registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov  . 
Subjects / Specimens  
Systematic consecutive sampling of up to 100 subjects with LBP (40 
subjects completing both day s of data collection) attending “Sports medicine and 
Physical therapy clinic” in Fredericksburg ([LOCATION_007]) as patients or for the purpose 
of health and wellness will be recruited.  Flyers will also be posted  at physician 
offices  and the general Fredericksburg community and surrounding areas to 
inform subjects about the study  (Appendix A) . 
Inclusion Criteria : (1) Ability and willingness to come twice  to the clinic for 
approximately 60 minutes  each ; (2) Subjects with LBP and directional preference

 17 in back extension; (3) Age 18-80 (Yarznbowicz et al 2018) ; (4) Ability to stand for 
5 minutes; (5) Ability to sit for 10 minutes; and (6 ) Low back pain on Numerical 
Pain Rating scale (NPRS) of at least 2/10 and less or equal to 9/10 (Ferreira -
Valente 2011).  
Exclusion Criteria : (1) Pregn ancy by [CONTACT_71488]; (2)  history of back surgery or 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_721811]; (3) history of spi[INVESTIGATOR_721812]’s diagnosis of spi[INVESTIGATOR_721813] ; (4) current history of acute systemic 
infection, active inflammatory disease, or malignancy; (5) subjects engaged in 
legal/compensation claims for their back symptoms ; and (6) subjects unable to 
understand or speak English.  
Testing Sequence  
Subjects will be asked to attend two physical therapy sessions over 
approximately a 60-minute period each  to complete the study.  
Session 1  
Participants will complete a pre -screening questionnaire  regarding 
inclusion (Appendix B ). Each subject will watch an audio -visual po wer point 
presentation  explain ing the study,  test procedures  and describing the 
interventions (standing repetitive trunk extension and standing sustained trunk 
extension) . Written informed consent will be obtained. To determine directional 
preference, the investigator (JH) will use the guidelines set forth in th e directional 
preference definition  (Werneke 2011 ) and based off of standards set forth in 
randomized clinical  trials (May et al 2008).  Directional preference has been 
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 18 defined as either (1) a specific direction of trunk movement or posture noted 
during the physical examination or (2) a specific easing factor reported by [CONTACT_721851]’s 
pain, with or without the pain having changed location and/or increased the 
patient’s lumbar range of moti on (Werneke 2011) . A questionnaire including 
pertinent medical history will be completed  (Appendix C ). Subjects will complete 
(1) a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) to rate their current, minimum, 
maximum and average LBP over the last two days (Ferreira -Valente MA 2011)  
as well as paresthesia signs/symptoms intensity (Appendix D ); (2) Body Diagram 
for indicating location of symptoms (Appendix E ); (3) Modified Oswestry low back 
pain questionnaire (Fritz 2001 ) (Appendix F); (4) Fear Avoidance Belief 
Questionnaire (Cleland et al 2008)  (Appendix G ). A researcher will record 
subject’s height and weight . A Flow chart illustrates study sequence in details 
(Figure 1).  
 If the subject meets criteria for inclusion in the study, the subject will 
complete a familiarization procedure to determine the consistency to reposition 
themselves in the stadiometer. Subjects able to reposition themselves in the 
stadiometer with a SD of 1.3mm or less for five consecutive measurements 
(Stothart et al 2000; Gerk e et al 2011; Owens et al 2009) will be included in the 
study. The digital display will be covered to blind the researcher performing the 
measurements. The data will be automatically recorded by [CONTACT_721852] a laptop computer . 
At the beginning of data collection, a randomization plan generator 
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 19 (http://www.randomization.com  ) will assign each subject to one of two 
interventions : (1) standing repetitive  trunk extension at a rate of 10 per 45 
seconds  (Figure 2 ), repeated five times with [ADDRESS_985851] breaks ; or (2)  
standing sustained  trunk extension for [ADDRESS_985852] 
breaks (Figure 3 ). Each subject will complete one intervention. The intervention 
number assigned  will be recorded by [CONTACT_721853] . 
The subject will undergo the test sequence after a 10 -minute period of trunk 
unloading in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_721814], head in 
neutral posture, knees supported over a small bolster pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356], h ands placed on the 
abdomen (Kourtis et al 2004; Magnusson et al 1996a; Gerke et al 2011; Owens 
et al 2009). The subject will reposition on the stadiometer and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721815] a relaxed exhalation (Measurement 1)  (Figure 4 ). The subject  
then will undergo a five -minute period of loaded upright sitting with a 4.5kg bag 
secured on each shoulder and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721816] (Measurement 2)  
(Figure 5 ) (Kourtis et al 2004; Owens et al 2009; Gerke et al 2011). As continued 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783] r eduction has been demonstrated following loaded sitting, the 
subject will undergo an additional five minutes sitting without load and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721817] (Measurement 3) (Kourtis et al 2004; Owens et al 2009; 
Gerke et al 2011). Inclinometers wil l be used to take an initial measure of each 
subject trunk extension prior to intervention.  The subject will then undergo one 
intervention for [ADDRESS_985853] will  reposition on the stadiometer and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721818] (Measurement 4). Trunk extension will be measured to determine the 
strength of correlations between the degree of trunk extension during standing 
trunk exte nsion posture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783] , pain and centralization  testing 
outcomes changes  (MacDermid et al 2015).  The subject  will score their low back 
and lower extremity symptoms using N PRS (Ferreira -Valente MA 2011), and 
map their pain  on a body pain diagram (Appendix E ) prior to intervention , 
immediately  after and 2 -week  following the intervention to determine pain rating 
and centralizatio n of symptoms (Simmerman et al  2011).  The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_721819] a numeric overlay template to the patient’s body diagrams 
to document the most distal pain location scores between 1 and 6  (Appendix I ). 
Higher score will indicate a more distal symptoms’  location.  
Home instructions  
Subjects will be instructed to continue to use their medications, including 
medications aimed at decreasing their pain, as prescribed by [CONTACT_721854] -up two -week 
period.  A sheet including home exercise instructions will be provided to each 
patient. Instructions will in clude repetitive or sustained trunk extension based on 
random group assignment, performed approximately [ADDRESS_985854] will complete a  sheet recording home exercise compliance upon arrival in

Session 2  
Subjects will c omplete: (1) a NPRS to rate their current, minimum, 
maximum and average LBP over the last two days as well as paresthesia 
signs/symptoms intensity (Appendix D ); (2) Body Diagram for indicating location 
of symptoms (Appendix E ) (3) Modified Oswestry low bac k pain questi onnaire 
(Fritz 2001) (Appendix F ); (4) Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (Cleland et al 
2008) (Appendix G ). Each subject will then complete a familiarization procedure 
to determine the consistency to reposition themselves in the stadiometer as 
described in session 1.  The subject will undergo a [ADDRESS_985855] will reposition on the stadiometer and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721815] a relaxed exhalation (Measurement 1 ) (Figure 4). The subject 
then will undergo a five -minute period of loaded upright sitting with a 4.5kg bag 
secured on each shoulder and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721816] (Measurement 2) 
(Figure 5).  The subje ct will then undergo an additional five minu tes sitting 
without load and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721816] (Measurement 3). Inclinometers 
will be used to take an initial measure of each subject trunk extension prior to 
intervention. The subject will then unde rgo the same  intervention  as in session 1  
for 5 minutes as previously described (standing repetitive trunk extension or 
standing sustained trunk extension). The subject will reposition on the 
stadiometer and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721816] (Measurement 4). Trunk 
extension will be measured to determine the strength of correlations between the 
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 22 degree of trunk extension during standing trunk extension posture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721807], pain and centralization  testing outcomes changes (MacDermid et al 
2015).  The subjects will then score their low back and lower extremity symptoms 
using NPRS (Ferreira -Valente MA 2011), and map their pain  on a body pain 
diagram (Appendix H ). 
Investigator Blinding  
One investigator will be involved with data collection. The  invest igator, 
Jeremy Harrison, PT, DPT will carry out inclinometer measurements of lumbar 
and sacral posture, supervised positioning in the stadiometer and stadiometric 
measurements. The investigator will be blinded to the intervention (each subject 
will receive  a hidden random number and will perform independently the 
intervention in a treatment room) and the stadiometric measurements during the 
experiment. He will also be responsible for assigning subjects to their initial 
groups, supervising the subjects’  positioning in the different standing postures 
and confirming that a stadiometer reading is recorded on an Excel spreadsheet.  
Subjects Compensation  
Subjects will receive a one -month free membership to Hill Country 
Memorial Wellness Center in Fred ericksburg, [LOCATION_007] if they consent to participate 
in the study.  
Subjects Charges  
There will be no charge for the two physical therapy sessions, including 
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 23 examination and intervention. Following the two intervention sessions, s ubjects  
referred by [CONTACT_21108] (physicians, chiropractors, nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants) to physical therapy for LBP will have the choice to receive 
standard care and be charged  for physical therapy intervention.  
Confidentiality and data protection  
Electronic Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and 
Protected Health Information (PHI) will be followed and computer device has 
been encrypted (password protected). Excel spreadsheet will be used to store 
the data.  No Personally Identifiable Information will be retained in the Excel 
spreadsheet where the data will be stored.  
Data Analysis  
Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used utilizing SPSS 23.0 for 
Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL).  
1. Descriptive analyses : Descriptive statistics including mean, median, 
mode, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values , frequency 
counts  will be collected for age, height, weight, body mass index, pain, 
centralization, function (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) , 
Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire , spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721820] a 
period of spi[INVESTIGATOR_721782].  
2. Inferential analyses:  Levene’s test and Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test of normality will 
used to  test for variance and distribution of measurements of spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], 
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 [ADDRESS_985856] (or Wilcoxon sign -rank test if 
the data do not meet assumptions for parametric inferential statistics) will 
be used to assess differences i n spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], centralization and pain 
outcomes improvements following sustained and repetitive trunk extension 
postures.   
For experimental hypothesis 2 , 2 (between subjects - type of trunk 
extensio n: sustained vs. repetitive) x 3  (within subjects - time: before , 
immediately after and 2 -week after ) mixed ANOVA’s will examine 
differences in (1) spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783]; (2) pain; and (3) function  outcomes,  as a 
result of sustained and repetitive standing trunk extension after a period of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_721782]. Post hoc paired t -tests will explore further for significant 
differences in spi[INVESTIGATOR_721783], pain and function  outcomes between the six 
conditions.  
Experimen tal hypothesis [ADDRESS_985857] -moment 
correlations to determine the strength of correlations between the degree 
of trunk extension during standing trunk extension posture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_721807], pain and function , outcomes changes in patie nts with LBP. 
Spearman's Rank Order correlation will be used to determine the strength 
of the correlation between centralization and the degree of trunk extension 
posture in standing.  
 
 
Harrison, Research Proposal  
 
 
 25 Alpha level will  be set at 0.05 for significance for all tests and Bonferroni 
corrections performed as needed.

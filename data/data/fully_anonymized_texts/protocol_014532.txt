Appendix B: RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293200] & Metho dology
3.1a. Specific Aims & Methodology
In light of the urgent need for research on novel interventions to prevent illicitly-manufactured
fentanyl (IMF) exposure and overdose, we will determine whether a brief, theory-driven
overdose prevention intervention incorporating “take home” rapid fentanyl testing decreases
overdose among adults. We will enroll up to 550 PWUD at risk of overdose in a randomized
trial, hereby [CONTACT_293329] (RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]) .
InAim 1,we will assess the efficacy of the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293201]. In Aim 2,we will determine whether the intervention effects are mediated
through our model constructs, including knowledge, motivation, behavioral skills, and
self-efficacy to use the fentanyl test strips and engage in overdose risk reduction practices. In
Aim 3,we will determine whether there is heterogeneity of treatment effect related to key
participant characteristics, including age, baseline motivations to use the test strips, as well as
type and frequency of drug use. By [CONTACT_293330]-groups for whom intervention efficacy
is highest, these findings will guide optimal implementation of this brief intervention to reduce
overdose among PWUD.
Eligibility criteria include reported use of heroin, illicit stimulants, counterfeit prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], or
injection drug use in the past 30 days, regardless of treatment status (see Table 1). An
overview of the study design is included in section 3.1.dbelow. Participants will be randomized
1:[ADDRESS_357462] strips for personal use. Motivational interviewing “booster” sessions will occur
at 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_357463] strips provided on an as needed
basis. In the attention-matched control arm, participants will receive standardized overdose
education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training, with attention-control visits at 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_357464] session, and
information regarding where to obtain additional naloxone at subsequent visits. Follow-up
interviews will occur at 6 and 12 months. The primary endpoint will be the rate of self- reported
overdose over the follow-up period. Secondary endpoints (e.g., accidental overdose death and
suspected EMS runs for overdose) will be ascertained by [CONTACT_293331]. Consistent with recruitment rates in
our prior studies, we aim to enroll 20 participants per month starting in Year 1 until targetBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/[ADDRESS_357465] created a flyer (see Attachment B ) that provides specific
information about locations where naloxone can be obtained, as well as a link to a page that
contains this information on www.PreventOverdoseRI.org. In Rhode Island, naloxone is
available via pharmacies and community organizations to anyone in the state via standing
order authorized by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rich (RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293202]-investigator). Additionally, all participants will be
asked to provide a urine sample for a 12-drug panel rapid urine screen plus fentanyl rapid urine
screen (one sample) at each study visit. The urine screens are not meant to determine a
participant’s eligibility based on their self-reported drug use. The urine screens will measure
fentanyl and other recent drug exposure among participants to determine if there was
unintentional exposure to fentanyl. Once a urine screen is completed, the sample will be
disposed of immediately. Finally, participants will be asked to provide dried blood spots at three
study visits (i.e., baseline, 6 months and 12 months) to confirm results from urine screening in
the 12-drug panel above, in addition to detection of novel synthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_293203]. Testing of dried blood spots will be undertaken routinely throughout
and at the end of the study, and will not be used to determine a participant’s eligibility. After the
samples have been analysed for the study endpoints as specified in the protocol, remaining
samples will be stored for use in future Institutional Review Board approved substance use and
infectious disease (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C, and COVID-19) related research. Additional consent
will not be sought for this storage and future use.

3.1b. Detailed description of the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293207] (Experimental Arm)
The intervention is based on two behavioral frameworks: the
Information-Motivation-Behavior (IMB) model , and the self-efficacy model as applied to
addictive behaviors.
The RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293208] ( see also Figure 4 from grant proposal) :
1. education about the dangers of IMF and how to prevent overdose (information);
2. motivational interviewing to encourage risk reduction behaviors (motivation) and to
assess and improve participants’ confidence in implementing these behaviors (selfBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
efficacy);
3. hands-on training demonstrating how to use and interpret fentanyl test strips
(behavioral skills), including opportunities to practice using the test strips; and
4. provision of BTNX Rapid Fentanyl test strips1(see Attachment B) for personal harm
reduction use.
Specifically, the intervention will
directly increase engagement in
the target overdose risk reduction
behaviors, and indirectly through
fentanyl test strip utilization. In
other words, we hypothesize
that fentanyl test strip
utilization is an important, but
not exclusive, behavioral
mediator through which the
intervention will prevent
overdose among PWUD.
Survey Assessment Description (for complete survey instrument see Attachment A):
Information: Participants will be assessed on their knowledge of fentanyl and overdose
prevention strategies with multi-item scales (e.g., agreement with statements such as,
“Someone is more likely to overdose when using fentanyl-laced drugs than when using drugs
that aren’t laced with fentanyl,” and, “Do you know where you buy or get Narcan™, a
medication sometimes called naloxone?”).
Motivation: Participants will be assessed on their motivation to use the rapid fentanyl tests
(e.g., agreement with a statement reading, “I am concerned about my drugs being
contaminated with fentanyl”) and engage in overdose risk reduction behaviors (e.g., agreement
with a statement reading, “I am confident that I can ask someone to check on me after I use
drugs and call 911 if they think I am overdosing”).
Behavioral Skills: Participants will be assessed on their behavioral skills related to use of the
rapid fentanyl tests (e.g., “I feel confident in my ability to use the test strips to detect if there is
fentanyl in my drugs”) and engagement in overdose risk reduction behaviors (e.g., “What do
you do to avoid an accidental overdose?” and, “Have you ever given Narcan/naloxone to
someone who you thought was overdosing?”).
Self-Efficacy: Questions about harm reduction self-efficacy will be used to assess participants’
confidence to employ specific health-preserving skills in different types of high-risk situations

(i.e., when experiencing withdrawal, when feeling depressed, wh en feeling social pressure to
use drugs in a less safe manner). This scale has shown good internal consistency and
construct and discriminant validity.
Behavioral Outcomes: Participants in the intervention arm will be asked a series of questions
regarding fentanyl test strip utilization at all follow-up assessments. These questions were used
successfully in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and include items such as, “Of the [ADDRESS_357467] you, how
many tests did you use?” and, “What did you do when you found out your drugs were laced
with fentanyl?” As an additional measure of test strip utilization, participants will be asked to
return unused tests to the study office. We will also assess motivations for using the test strips,
including a desire to avoid IMF-contaminated drugs or purposely identifying fentanyl.
At each time point, participants will be asked about the practices they engage in to avoid
accidental overdose. Strategies to avoid overdose include the target overdose risk reduction
behaviors:
1. discarding IMF-contaminated drugs,
2. not using alone (and staggering drug use with another person who is able to administer
naloxone and call 911 in the event of an overdose), and
3. keepi[INVESTIGATOR_293209].
We will also assess other harm reduction practices, including taking a “tester” or lower initial
dose, avoiding injection drug use, and purchasing drugs from a consistent source.
Standard of Care (Attention-Matched Control Arm). Existing research suggests that training
people who are at risk for overdose and their peers on how to respond when witnessing an
overdose is a feasible and effective strategy for preventing overdose death. Given that this
represents current overdose prevention practice, participants in the control arm will receive the
standardized OEND training that occurs in Rhode Island. This program is based on the
common components of many community-based overdose prevention interventions in the US,
and includes information on risk factors for overdose, recognizing an overdose, performing
rescue breaths, administering naloxone, and recommendations to call 911. To ensure
equivalent attention to the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293210], control arm participants will return for retention
visits at 1, 2, and 3 months, and will answer a series of questions regarding substance use
and overdose risk behaviors.
Potential Moderators/Other Key Measures: The RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293211], psychological, and clinical assessments asked of everyone in the study.
Many of these questions have been pi[INVESTIGATOR_293212].
Consideration of Sex, Biological Variables, and Other Sociodemographic
Characteristics: Participants will report their age, sex at birth, current gender identity,
sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, employment status, and
recent and lifetime experiences of housing instability and homelessness, involvementBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
with the criminal justice system, and participation in sex work.
Substance Use Experiences: Participants will report on recent and lifetime substance
use patterns (i.e., age at first use, frequency of use, polysubstance use, binge use,
social context of use, route of administration), and perceptions towards fentanyl (i.e.,
intentional use of fentanyl, suspected exposure to fentanyl-contaminated drugs). The
questionnaire will also incorporate a number of standardized instruments, including the
Addiction Severity-Index Lite (drug and alcohol section), and the Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_293213] (SOWS).
Healthcare Utilization: Participants will report on health insurance status; prior mental
health diagnoses, past treatment experiences, use of medications (buprenorphine,
naltrexone, or methadone), and barriers to substance abuse treatment. We will
administer a modified version of the Circumstances, Motivation, and Readiness (CMR)
scale, which has been used to assess motivation to engage in substance use
treatment.
Rapid Urine Screen Tests, Dried Blood Spot and Survey Administration Procedures:
Participants will check in at the Brown University School of Public Health Lobby - [ADDRESS_357468] and be escorted to a private interview room by [CONTACT_89135] A . All
consenting procedures and surveys/interviews will be conducted in the private interview room.
Each visit will last [ADDRESS_357469] Research Assistants (RAs) will manage the visits to [ADDRESS_357470].:
● The first RA, Research Assistant A , will be responsible for the informed consent
protocol and conducting the survey assessment with the participant. They will also be
responsible for administering the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293214], which includes the provision of [ADDRESS_357471] Strips for
take-home, personal harm reduction use.
● The second RA, Research Assistant B, will be responsible for conducting the rapid drug
screen with the participant. Participants will provide a urine sample for a 12-drug panel
and fentanyl baseline urine screen.

3.1.c Participant Population
The target population for this trial are adults aged 18 to 65 who are at risk of overdose due to
consumption of IMF-contaminated illicit substances.
Eligibility Criteria: Participants will be enrolled in the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293216]: (a) 18 to 65 years
of age; (b) reside in Rhode Island; (c) are able to complete interviews in English; (d) are able to
provide informed consent; and (e) self-report past 30 day use of heroin, illicit stimulants (e.g.,
powder cocaine, crack, methamphetamine), counterfeit prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], or injection drugs,
regardless of treatment status.
These criteria are consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and were selected to capture a population of
PWUD who are at risk of being exposed to IMF-contaminated illicit substances, based on our
prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_293217]. We expect that the racial and ethnic
composition of our target population will be similar to that of the samples recruited for our prior
research studies involving the target population (approximately 60% white, 20% Black or
African American, and 15% mixed race). We also anticipate that males will be
over-represented among our target population (approximately 60%). Section 3.1.dbelow,
outlines the methods for ensuring wide recruitment, in addition to partnering with
community-based organizations to increase enrollment.
We will exclude: persons who report exclusive misuse of medications obtained from a
physician or diversion from someone else’s prescription (e.g., family members), since these
sources are unlikely to be associated with IMF exposure.

3.1d. Recruitment, Enrollment, Randomization, an d Retentio n procedures
Recruitment:  Consistent with our previous research, we will employ a combination of
field-based recruitment techniques (e.g., targeted  canvassing, word of mouth) and
Internet-based advertising to recruit potential study  participants. Our team successfully  
identified locations for targeted canvassing in our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732]. Project staff will conduct outreach  
and post study flyers in public and semi-public community  venues (e.g., bus stops, parks,  
community organizations, drop-in centers, shelters,  needle and syringe programs) in which  
PWUD are known to congregate. In addition, a recent  spatial analysis conducted by [CONTACT_293332], between [ADDRESS_357472] occurred in  
37 of 39 municipalities in RI. As such, recruitment  will occur throughout Rhode Island; for  
example, we will purchase advertising on bus routes  DQG UDGLR VWDWLRQV  that operate 
throughout the state.  Internet-based recruitment will include advertising  on drug information 
websites used by  [CONTACT_293333] (e.g., erowid.org, drugs-forum.com), online classifieds  (Craigslist), 
and social media  websites (e.g., Facebook), as well as Today at Brow Q
Communication resources: Sufficient iPhones, so that  each research assistant has access to  
one, will be purchased through Brown University’s  Computing & Information Services (CIS) to  
be used by [CONTACT_21171]. Throughout the study,  study cell phones will only be used by  
[CONTACT_293334]. At 
the start and end of the day, the primary cell phone  will be turned on or off and be checked in  
and out of a locked desk within the study office.  Each cell phone will be encrypted using a  
custom alphanumeric code, with settings enabled to  destroy all data on the phone after [ADDRESS_357473], stolen, or
otherwise not returned, the iPhone will be remotely
wiped of data. At the end of the study, all encrypted
cell phone data will be destroyed and all cell
phones will be wiped of data and returned to Brown
University’s Computing & Information Services
(CIS).
Enrollment and assessment will occur in two
stages: First, potential participants will text
message, email, or call a study hotline, at which
point a study staff member will screen for eligibility.
If eligible, the staff member will then schedule an
interview at the Brown University School of Public
Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
Health. At this time, all assessments will occur at our study offices, which are centrally located
and easily accessible to members of the study population. In some circumstances, the
interviews may occur at a semi-private location outside of BUSPH (ex. Public library study
rooms, clinics or other community partner agencies) (see Attachment I, Safety Protocol, for
field-based safety measures).
Randomization: Randomization: Participants will be randomized 1:1 using a randomization
table generated in SAS by [CONTACT_1758]’s Biostatistician,
which will be operationalized using the Randomization Generator Module in REDCap.
Randomization will be assigned during the baseline visit.4Intervention allocations will be
maintained in REDCap by [CONTACT_293335], such as the study Statistician, and revealed
only through REDCap by [CONTACT_293336]-baseline visits (See
Figure 3 ).
Blinding: Staff conducting the baseline and follow- up assessments will be blinded to
intervention assignment until completion of the STUDY ENROLLMENT INFORMED
CONSENT FORM at
the Baseline visit. Intervention allocations will be maintained in REDCap by [CONTACT_293337], such as the study Statistician, and revealed only through REDCap by [CONTACT_293338]-baseline visits.
Retention: To maximize retention, we will employ retention strategies that are effective with
PWUD.
For example, we have found that text messages are  the preferred mode of communication: over  
95% of participants in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_293218] a cell  phone and used it daily. We have included  
study cell phones in the budget so project staff can  text participants at least monthly to update  
contact [CONTACT_3031]. Additional retention strategies  to be employed include: (1) maintaining a  
tracking database of contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., phone  numbers, email addresses, social media  
handles  SK\VLFDO DGGUHVVHV IRU VHQGLQJ DSSRLQWPHQW UHPLQGHU SRVWFDUGV ); (2) conducting 
regular outreach in areas  that participants are known to frequent; (3)  providing honoraria for all 
study visits; (4) providing  free parking to participants visiting the study  office by [CONTACT_293339]; (5)  searching the public RI Department of  Corrections database to determine if 
a participant  is incarcerated for a period of longer than 90  days, at which point they will be 
withdrawn from the  study . These strategies were used  effectively in our RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293219], 
resulting in  a 90% follow-up rate.
3.1 e How confidentiality of data will be maintained (where data is kept, who has access 
to it, and how it is kept secure). The Principal Investigator, Brandon Marshall, PhD  is ultimately 
responsible for data safety and  monitoring of the study . This process will be monitored  on a 
weekly basis by [CONTACT_293340],  including the Project Director, Data Analyst, and  Senior Research 
Assistant, with quarterly  updates to the entire team of Co-Investigators. The  project team will be 
responsible for  ensuring that all policies and processes outlined  in the Data Use Agreement 
(with Rhode  Island Department of Health,  Attachment E ) are followed  accordingly, and that 
data are

will meet on a semi-annual basis with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_293220] (see Attachment F ). The DSMB will also review any adverse or severe
adverse events as outlined in the DSMP.
Stronghold computing environment: We will obtain a central storage service hosted by
[CONTACT_94748]’s Computing & Information Services (CIS) Stronghold project (see
Attachment G, Stronghold MOU). Stronghold is a HIPAA-aligned, secure computing
environment developed for housing, sharing, and analyzing sensitive data. The project’s Data
Analyst will oversee the database architecture, dataset storage, and all input/output (i.e.,
RIDOH data transfer) regulations. Stronghold is highly secure computer and storage
Windows-exclusive environment for research needs that involve very sensitive data needing
special handling, data usage agreements, etc.
All Stronghold users must: Be approved by [CONTACT_079], authorized in writing to
Brown University Computing & Information Services (CIS), and:
● complete appropriate training for working with sensitive data (e.g. CITI training);
● be in compliance with all relevant Institutional Review Board protocols;
● be in compliance with any data use agreements or other agreements governing the
use of the data stored on Stronghold;
● complete an on-boarding process led by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_293221], which includes a review of data security protocols and a guided
walkthrough of accessing the Stronghold virtual environment.
Data Transfers – there are select methods to import data, including but not limited to:
● Select Rhode Island state agencies and other offices using a secure VPN tunnel
● Encrypted USB drives
● Secure transfer through firewall exception
● Import and export servers
For the proposed project, we will conduct and automate secure data transfer of administrative
overdose records with RIDOH on a monthly basis (according to the timeline outlined in our
existing data use agreement, see Attachment E ). Any matching between personally identified
data sources is done within a secured area prior to any data (de-identified) being exported.
After the baseline survey, a separate consent procedure will be used to gain permission to
obtain information regarding overdose events (to be submitted as a future amendment, upon
RIDOH approval). To conduct the probabilistic, confidential data linkage with the RIDOH
administrative surveillance records, we will first create an encrypted, password-protected file
containing the linkage variables (e.g., sex, date of birth, zip code of residence). We will link
these surveillance datasets with participant data using a probabilistic linkage with the following
combination of identifiers: first and last name, date of birth, and sex. To conduct the
probabilistic match, we will use The Link King software. All linkages will be conducted withinBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/[ADDRESS_357475]-protected tablets and computers within the Centers
for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_293198] (CEEH) at the Brown University School of Public
Health. The REDCap™ platform exceeds patient confidentiality and data security requirements
for clinical trials, and are both HIPAA compliant and fully validated for FDA 21 CFR Part 11.
REDCap™ is a secure and web-based platform that allows input data from anywhere with
secure web authentication, data logging, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. For
remote data entry during field-based interviews, staff will be given iPads with data connectivity
that allow for direct and secure data entry into REDCap™.[ADDRESS_357476]. Access to data with identifiers is further restricted to the Systems/Data Manager alone.
Data are de-identified before analytic files are created, providing an additional level of
protection.
Furthermore, Center employees have signed an oath of confidentiality, and its violation is
sufficient grounds for immediate termination. All of our research assistants are CITI certified,
and will receive comprehensive orientation and intervention training for this research study
prior to interacting with participants or study data.
3.1f Analytic Plan
Assessing intervention efficacy in reducing emergency department (ED) presentation
for an overdose or overdose death (Aim 1, secondary endpoint). First, we will compare the
overall rate of patients experiencing this composite outcome over the 12-month follow-up
period in each group. Next, we will examine the time to first ED presentation or death using a
Kaplan- Meier analysis. Patients will be censored as of the first date of either of these
outcomes or at the end of the 12-month period. We will use Breslow’s method to test if the time
to either outcome differs between the groups, since this approach gives greater emphasis to
shorter time elapsed after the intervention, which has greater clinical significance. Third, Cox
proportional hazards modeling will be used to estimate hazard ratios for the treatment effect.
Multivariable models will be constructed to adjust for possible post-randomization confounding.
Examine whether the treatment effect is mediated by [CONTACT_293341] (Aim 2). If the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293222] (Aim 1), we will explore the extent to which this
relationship works through several possible mediators (see Figure 4). For mediation analyses,
first, we will examine, in multivariable regression models, which mediators, if any, are
significantly changed by [CONTACT_25234] (i.e., the rate of change differed by [CONTACT_3148]
5 https://rc.partners.org/research-apps-and-services/collect-data#redcapBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
assignment). For those that are significantly impacted by [CONTACT_25234], we will conduct path
analysis using structural equation modeling to determine whether the effect of the intervention
on overdose is through the hypothesized mediator(s). Structural equation modeling (SEM)
allows for the simultaneous estimation of total, direct, mediated and indirect effects of a causal
variable (i.e., the intervention) on the outcome (i.e., overdose) through a set of mediator
variables. SEM can handle outcomes and mediators with a variety of distributions (including,
Gaussian, Poisson and Binomial). Inferences for indirect effects can be estimated using
bootstrapped confidence intervals.
Determine whether intervention efficacy varies across participant subgroups (Aim 3).
We will examine if heterogeneity of intervention effect is modified by [CONTACT_293342], including: age; sex; type, frequency, and route of drug use; baseline
level of overdose risk (e.g., lifetime history of overdose); and pre-intervention motivations for
fentanyl test strip utilization. We will perform stratified subgroup analyses to determine if
treatment effects vary between groups of individuals.

3.2Informed Consent ProcedureBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
We will obtain verbal informed consent from participants at the start of the Screening process,
and e-signed informed consent for the interviewer-administered surveys at the Baseline
enrollment visit (see Attachment A for consent forms). Participants will be asked if they would
like a copy of the consent form emailed to them. The enrollment consent form will be reviewed
with the subject in a quiet, private location at the Brown University School of Public Health at
the start of the Baseline Visit. All participants will be given detailed explanations of their rights
as human subjects, including the purpose of the study, length of time for the interview process,
study requirements, and risks and benefits of the interventions.
Participants who refuse consent to participate, are unable to provide informed consent due to
altered mental status, or who cannot adequately hear and/or comprehend either consent
process, will not be enrolled.
Participants will be asked to sign electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_293223]; however, if necessary, paper consent forms will be
retained by [CONTACT_141122][INVESTIGATOR_2993]cipal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a secure, double-locked environment. Participants will
be offered a copy of the informed consent form via email or by [CONTACT_293343] a link to the form
online.
3.4Risks & Benefits
Potential Risks: We recognize that participants will be asked potentially sensitive information,
including illicit drug use and injection drug use history, and therefore may experience
discomfort, anxiety, or stress in responding to certain study questions. As such, as part of the
informed consent procedure, participants will be advised that their answers will be confidential,
and issues discussed will in no way impact their ability to obtain or be referred to medical care
or social services. In addition, at the start of the interview, participants will be informed that they
can skip and refuse to answer any questions that they may find uncomfortable or
embarrassing. If concerns arise prior to, during, or after the interview, or if participants request
further information, they will be referred either to the toll-free study number, or if they prefer, will
be given the contact [CONTACT_293344].
Among participants enrolled in the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293224], additional risks include
mistakenly believing that a substance does not contain fentanyl or a related potent analogue
after self- testing is complete. We will make every effort (through training, teach-back, and
automated text reminders) to ensure that participants understand the limitations of the rapid
tests, and specifically that a negative self-test result does not necessarily mean that overdose
risk is negligible. Interviewers will discuss and role-play how to implement overdose risk
reduction activities upon receipt of a positive or negative test. Risks and benefits of the fentanyl
test strips will also be addressed in the consent form at enrollment.
The risks to human subjects also include potential breaches of confidentiality. No names or
other identifying information will be included in the analytic files. The risk of breach ofBrown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/[ADDRESS_357478] extent possible, including through the use of
Brown’s research protection resource, Stronghold.
There is minimal physical risk to participants from the routine finger stick(s) used for dried
blood spot collection. The finger stick may cause a small amount of pain and bruising, and the
site may bleed slightly for a time after the blood is collected. There is also a very rare chance
that the stick site could become infected. If this happens, participants might require medical
treatment.
Alternatives to enrollment in the trial may include not participating in the trial.
Protection Against Risks
Possible risks to participants will be minimized in several ways. All members of the research
team will treat all data with strict confidentiality. Questionnaires will not include participants’
name [CONTACT_39649]. Participants’ names, other personally identifying
information, telephone numbers, and tracking information will be recorded in separate files and
will not be linked to any of the participants’ data. Access to these files will be encrypted,
password-protected and locked; access will be restricted to essential study personnel only. No
data will be reported on an individual basis; all findings will be reported in summary statistical
form only. All analyses will be presented in aggregate form with minimum cell sizes so that
individuals cannot be identified. Data will be stored and linked in the Stronghold environment.
Dried blood spots will be held in long-term storage using ultra-low temperature freezer facilities
(-70°C) managed and temperature-monitored by [CONTACT_293345]. Dried blood spot
specimens will be identified using the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293225], study visit number, date of study
visit. Multiple separate identifiers are necessary to minimize the risk of errors in specimen
handling and testing, e.g., transcription errors during specimen labelling or retrieval. As these
specimens are not collected in a clinical setting, these identifiers are not considered Protected
Health Information. Study personnel will attempt to contact [CONTACT_293346] a recommendation
for follow-up testing with a healthcare provider. Participants will be provided with a resource list
with information about where to get tested for infectious diseases at enrolment and if contact[CONTACT_293347]. A number of harm reduction and primary care services in
Rhode Island provide confidential and anonymous testing for HIV and hepatitis C virus for free
or at low cost. We will use the study retention tracking database for contact [CONTACT_3031], and
will provide participants with referral resources related to infectious disease screening during
enrolment and when reporting preliminary reactive results. At no time will participant infectious
disease and contact [CONTACT_293348].
All interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_293349]; these staff who are trained in
issues relevant to engaging the target population such as risk reduction and drug user stigma.
Additionally, staff will go through specific training for the purposes of the intervention, including
motivational interviewing, overdose recognition and response, and naloxone administration.Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/[ADDRESS_357479] successfully completed the Collaborative IRB
Training Initiative (CITI) at Brown University, an online human subject research protections
education program.
Individuals participating in the intervention arm will receive rigorous, comprehensive
one-on-one training regarding the procedures and limitations of the BTNX Inc. Rapid
Response™ fentanyl test strip. Participants will be informed that the test provides only a
qualitative, preliminary analytical result. We will also emphasize that the accuracy of the test’s
result may be compromised by [CONTACT_293350], adulterants in the sample, or the
presence of novel fentanyl analogues that are not captured by [CONTACT_293351]. During the study
follow-up period, automated text messages will be used to remind all participants of
their next follow-up visit.
The proposed text of these messages are as follows:
■“Don’t forget! You have plans at [time] on [date] at Brown University School of Public
Health. Does this time still work for you?” Text us if you have any questions.”
Benefits: The direct benefits to participants will include facilitated referrals to overdose
prevention services, addiction treatment programs, as well as medical care and other social
services, as appropriate. Risk reduction and motivational interviewing provided by [CONTACT_293352], naloxone, and (in the intervention arm) fentanyl test strips.
Finally, at the end of each interview, all study participants will receive a package of educational
material regarding overdose prevention (e.g., how to identify an overdose, where to obtain
naloxone) (see Attachment B ), as well as a list of substance abuse treatment services in
Rhode Island. After the first session, all participants will also receive a naloxone kit.

This study will test the efficacy of a novel drug-checking intervention to prevent fatal and non-fatal
overdose among adults who use drugs. We will evaluate whether the incorporation of rapid fentanyl
testing into a theory-driven overdose education and counseling program reduces rates of overdose
compared to standard overdose education and naloxone distribution. Results from this study will
significantly improve public health efforts to address the fentanyl overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_293228] 18-65. This
is a full clinical trial, building on the results of our fentan yl-test-strip pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (2016-2017). This study
is funded by [CONTACT_127181] (R01-DA047975).

strips for personal use. Motivational interviewing “booster” sessions (with additional test strips distributed on an 
as-needed basis) will be conducted a 1, 2, and 3, months. Participants in the attention -matched control arm will 
be followed at the same intervals and will receive a standard overdose education and naloxone distribution 
(OEND) training program. To meet our recruitment goals, we aim to conduct 20 baseline visits per month 
starting in Year 1, Quarter 3 and continuing until full enrollment is reached.  
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome will be the rate of self -reported overdose observed over the 12 -month follow up period. 
We will supplement the primary endpoint with data on fatal overdose events ascertained through a CDC - 
funded statewide overdose surveillance system.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion Criteria: We will enroll adults who: (a) are 18 to 65 years of age; (b) reside in Rhode Island; (c) are 
able to complete interviews in English; (d) are able to provide informed consent; an d (3) self -report use of 
heroin, illicit stimulant use (e.g., powder cocaine, crack, methamphetamine), injection drug use, or use of 
counterfeit prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (defined as prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_293272]) in the past 30 
days  (regardless of treatment status). Participants who refuse consent to participate, are unable to provide 
informed consent due to altered mental status, or who cannot adequately hear and/or comprehend either 
consent process, will not be enrolled. To assess counterfeit prescription pi[INVESTIGATOR_293273], participants will be asked if 
they purchased any prescription medications “on the street” (e.g., from a drug dealer), including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and stimulants. We will not enroll vulnerable populations such as prisoners, children, etc.  
Exclusion Criteria: We will exclude participants who exclusively misuse medications obtained from a physician 
or diversion from someone else’s prescription.  
Power Calculation and Sample Size  
We are seeking IRB approval for n=550 participants enrolled in the study. We provide power calculated for key 
outcomes below, based on an enrollment of 500 participants (n=250 per arm) to account for attrition. The 
following assumptions are based on findings from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_185908]. First, at baseline, 37% of 
participants reported a lifetime history of overdose, and 11% reported an overdose in the past six months. As 
such, for the primary analyses, we assumed that 20% of participants in the control arm will experience an 
overdose duri ng the 12 -month follow -up period. Second, we conservatively assumed an 80% retention rate in 
the trial, although we were able to retain 90% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_798].  
Given these assumptions, we have >80% power to detect a 50% reduction in overdoses (i.e., the  primary 
endpoint for Aim 1, see Research Strategy section C.9, Figure 6A). Similar effect sizes were assumed for an 
ED-based overdose prevention intervention,[ADDRESS_357558] been deemed as a benchmark for success by [CONTACT_293398]. For the second endpoint in Aim 1 (time to first fatal overdose or ED visit related to an overdose), 
we conservatively assumed that only 38% of self -reported overdoses would result in death or presentation to  
the ED, based on previously published data,65 for a rate of 8 per 100 pe rson-years in the control arm. As  Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
shown in Figure 6B (see section C.9), we have ≥80% power to detect a 50% reduction in the hazard of fatal  
overdose or ED visit for an overdose. Finally, we used a method to estimate sample size for evaluating  
mediation by [CONTACT_293399] (Aim 2).[ADDRESS_357559] >80% power to detect a statistically significant mediated 
effect for a coefficient for exposure  on mediator and mediator on outcome of at least 0.8, respectively.

C1. Data Management and Analysis  
The primary source of data will be survey responses, including self -reported behaviors. Surveys will be 
conducted on touch -screen tablets using REDCap™ (Research Electronic Data Capture) software, 
which allow for direct, secure, and remote data entry. Similar to other studies, we have found the 
combined computer -assisted personal interview and computer -assisted self -interview (CAPI/CASI), 
conducted by [CONTACT_23872], in -person interviewers, acceptable to the study population and efficient to 
administer. These proc edures will protect against loss of confidentiality, improve reporting of sensitive 
behaviors, and reduce participant burden.  
A second source of data will be datasets owned by [CONTACT_293401] (RIDOH). 
Specifically, secondary outcomes will include fatal overdose events among participants during the study 
period, as determined through linkage to administrative records. All fatal overdose events occurring in 
the state are certified and investigated by [CONTACT_293402]. These  Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/[ADDRESS_357561] 
data security and confidentiality protocols when accessing administrative datasets, as outlined in our 
existing BAA with RIDOH and as approved by [CONTACT_293403].  
Data acquisition and transmission:  
Stronghold computing environment: We will obtain a central storage service hosted by [CONTACT_293404]’s Computing & Information Services (CIS) Stronghold project. Stronghold is a HIPAA -aligned 
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), secure computing environment developed for 
housing, sharing, and analyzing sensitive data. The project’s Biostatistician will oversee the database 
architecture, dataset storage, and all input/output (i.e., RIDOH data transfer) regulations. Stronghold is 
highly secure computer and storage Windows -exclusive environment for research needs that involve 
very sensitive data needing special handling, data usage agreements, etc. See section F1. Trial Safety 
for additional information about Stronghold security.  
All Stronghold users must:  
●be approved  by [CONTACT_45822],  authorized  in writing to  Brown  University  Computing &
Information Services  (CIS);
●complete appropriate training for working with sensitive data (e.g. CITI  training);
●be in compliance with all relevant Institutional Review Board  protocols;
●be in compliance  with any data use agreements  or other  agreements  governing  the use of
the data stored on Stronghold;  and
●complete an on -boarding process led by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_293221], which  includes a  review  of data security protocols and  a guided  walkthrough  of
accessing the Stronghold virtual  environment.
Data Transfers – there are select methods to import data, including but not limited to:  
●Select Rhode Island state agencies and other offices using a secure VPN  tunnel
●Encrypted USB  drives
●Secure  transfer through firewall  exception
●Import and export  servers
For the proposed project, the Senior Research Assistant will conduct and automate secure data 
transfer of administrative overdose records with RIDOH on a monthly basis (according to the timeli ne 
outlined in our existing data use agreement).  
Data Entry Methods  
Survey data will be collected on password -protected tablets and computers within the Centers for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_293198] (CEEH) at the Brown University School of Public Heal th. The 
REDCap™ platform exceeds patient confidentiality and data security requirements for clinical trials, and 
are both HIPAA compliant and fully validated for FDA [ADDRESS_357562]’s Biostatistician will manage the REDCap™ database architecture, dataset storage, and all 
input/output (i.e., data transfer) regulations.

accuracy/adequacy. Descriptive statistics will provide examination of the variables’ distributional 
properties; if required, data will be transformed to achieve normality. For all analyses, we will adopt an 
intention -to-treat (ITT) approach to address potential problems inherent in following only inter vention 
completers (e.g., self -selection effects, differential attrition across groups). Prior to examining 
intervention effects, we will first assess the success of randomization on pre -intervention characteristics 
using one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with intervention group as the predictor variable. The 
extent to which groups differ on baseline characteristics will determine whether any of these should be 
included as covariates in the primary analyses (see below). Missing covariate data will be ha ndled 
using multiple imputation performed in two stages using chained equations that specify the conditional 
models for all of the variables with missing values.207-209
Assessing intervention efficacy in reducing self -reported overdose (Aim 1, primary endpoint) . 
First, in the ITT analysis, we will determine the efficacy of the intervention by [CONTACT_247341] -reported 
rates of overdose among those assigned to the intervention arm versus the control group. First, we will 
use logistic regression to determine the independent effect of the intervention on the proportion 
reporting an overdose over the follow -up period, adjusting for baseline covariates as needed. Second, 
we will use generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with a logit link function to e xamine 
differences in self -reported overdose rates at each time point by [CONTACT_293405], an intervention assignment indicator, and an interaction term that assesses the significance of the 
intervention influence over time. Th ird, in a per -protocol sub -analysis, we will determine the effect of the 
intervention on self -reported overdoses among those who used the fentanyl test strips.  
Per-protocol analyses will be based on principal stratification. Principal stratification is a s tatistical 
technique that is used to adjust for a post -treatment variable (e.g., utilization of fentanyl test strips), and 
treatment effects are estimated within each stratum of that variable.[ADDRESS_357564] is mediated by [CONTACT_293406] (Aim 2) . If the RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293274] (Aim 1), we will explore the extent to which this relationship works 
through several possible mediators (see Figure 4). For mediation analyses, first, we will examine, in 
multivariable regression models, which mediators, if any, are significantly changed by [CONTACT_25234] 
(i.e., the rate of change differed by [CONTACT_15500]). For those that are significantly impacted by 
[CONTACT_25234], we will conduct path analysis using structural equation modeling to determine whether 
the effect of the intervention on overdose was through the hypothesized mediator(s). Structural 
equation modeling (SEM) allows for the simultaneous estimation of total, direct, mediated and indirect 
effects of a causal variable (i.e., the intervention) on the outcome (i.e., overdose) through a set of 
mediator variables.211 SEM can handle outcomes and mediators with a variety of distributions 
(including, Gaussian, Poisson and Binomial).[ADDRESS_357565] effects can be estimated using 
bootstrapped confidence intervals.213
Determine whether intervention efficacy varies across participant subgroups (Aim 3) . We will 
examine if heterogeneity of intervention effect is modified by [CONTACT_293407], 
including: age; sex; type, frequency, and route of drug use; baseline level of overdose risk (e.g., lifetime

stratified subgroup analyses to determine if treatment effects vary between groups of individuals.

D1. Quality Assurance  
Quality Assurance Plan  
Prior to making any changes to the protocol, we will seek approval from the NIDA program officer (PO) 
as well as the Brown University IRB. Significant protocol changes will be uploaded to clinicaltrials.gov 
upon IRB and NIDA approval.  
The project’s Biostatistician will manage the database architecture, dataset storage, and all input/output 
regulations for the RIDOH data transfers and storage, as well as storage of the the primary data from 
the trial. The database will be maintained under several firewalls, with restricted access to the Internet 
except for data imports and software installations. Control systems will be implemented to prevent data 
migration without authorization, complete with real time notifications of breaches. The data will routinely 
undergo backup procedures to ensure in the event of system failure, the data is recoverable.  
Data Quality and Data Protocol Monitoring  
Frequent scanning of Stronghold servers will be done to identify potential security vulnerabilities. The 
Stronghold Team will attempt to make this service available as requested [ADDRESS_357566] read and write permissions to the secure transfer server.  
All Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_293198] (CEEH) offices are connected into a single 
virtual local area network (LAN) by [CONTACT_293408]. 
Servers are located in a physically  secured, temperature -controlled environment. All external network 
access is limited to a single gateway. Network traffic is filtered by [CONTACT_24975]. Network traffic that would 
present a major security risk is disallowed. Protocol filters that limit the nature and type of network 
traffic likewise defend the servers. These machines host a complete suite of Internet -working facilities 
as well as data storage and backup. The CEEH uses a variety of security techniques including firewalls 
and antivirus software to maintain a secure and reliable computer environment.  
Protocol Deviations and Noncompliance Reporting  
Protocol deviations and noncompliance reporting will be the responsibility of the Project Investigator 
and Project Director. Such issues will be monitored on a consistent basis, and if any deviations are 
found they will be reported promptly to the Brown IRB.  
Staff Training: Research Protections  
All staff will receive Brown’s mandated CITI online training for all Human Subjects Research, as well as 
additional H IPAA -specific training, Clinical Trials with Investigational Drugs and Medical Devices (U.S. 
FDA Focus), and Social and Behavioral Research Best Practices for Clinical Research. All training will 
occur prior to working with study data or research participa nts.

Staff Training: Overdose Response (see also: Safety Protocol)  
Additional in -person training will be provided to all staff by [CONTACT_165721] -based partner Rhode Island 
Disaster Medical Assistance Team's Medical Reserve Corps ( RIDMAT), or  the Project Director or RA 
who as attended the RIDMAT Train the Trainer program, on the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:  
●Overdose recognition and response (1  hour)
●How to administer naloxone (1  hour)
Program -specific trainings will be offered by [CONTACT_293409][INVESTIGATOR_293275]:  
●Safety Procedures and Response (see procedures below) (1  hour)
●Motivational Interviewing and Brief Intervention for RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852] (6  hours)
All research staff will be trained on how to recognize and response to a drug overdose prior to wor king 
directly with participants, as well as how to administer naloxone in the event of a suspected overdose.  
NOTE: we are NOT clinicians or medical professionals and so we are limited in the scope of what we are 
able to offer someone in these circumstances, but we are expected to call for immediate medical help if 
someone is unresponsive. If you or another staff are trained on recognizing and responding to an 
overdose, then you may proceed with the protocol for responding to a suspected overdose using a 
“naloxone kit.”**  
In the event of an overdose, the primary staff person is responsible for documenting the situation 
thoroughly and following -up with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_293276].  
All staff persons involved in witnessing or responding to an overdose should check in and debrief with the 
Project Director as soon as possible or before they leave for the day . 
**The Naloxone Kit : Includes two naloxone vials for administration, accompanied by [CONTACT_293410]. These items are kept in a pouch, clearly labeled 
“Naloxone Kit,” and there will be one at each study staff workstation in an unlocked drawer, and in each 
interview room at the School of Public Health. The RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293277], discarding all naloxone doses as the law allows, as they 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312], and re -ordering new Naloxone Kits from their community partner or supplier. The School of Public 
Health also has a publicly -accessible naloxone kit on the 3rd floor, directly across from the elevators.

E1. Regulatory  Issues 
Reporting of Unanticipated, Adverse, or Severe Adverse Events (SAEs)1 
The overall data and safety monitoring will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI), [CONTACT_293481] DL Marshall, PhD. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_293280] 
(DSMP), and complying with the reporting requirements. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a summary of the DSMP 
report to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on an annual basis as part of the progress report.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_293281], and that all 
study procedures and reporting of adverse events are performed according to the protocol. Severe 
adverse events (SAEs) will be monitored by [CONTACT_293415] -time throughout the trial. 
In addition, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also provide independent study monitoring 
during all patient recruitment activities as described below.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_293282]. If an adverse event occurs which 
changes the study risk level, the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_293283] (Brown 
University), DSMB, and NIDA, and will oversee the process of modifying the study as appropriate to

Given the severity of 
such an event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_293284] -reported, nonfatal  overdoses (at follow -up visits). Each 
self-reported or fatal overdose will qualify for review by [CONTACT_293416] (see b elow: Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events [AE] and Severe Adverse Events 
[SAEs]). All fatal overdose events occurring in the state are certified by [CONTACT_293417] 90 days. To ascertain fatal overdose events, we will obtain consent from participants at 
the start of the trial to link to overdose surveillance datasets with participant data using a probabilistic 
linkage with the following combination of identifiers: first and last name, date of birth, and sex.  
Report of Changes or Amendments to the Protocol  
All changes or amendments to the protocol will be submitted in writing and will receive prior approval 
from the Brown University IRB. We will also seek approval from the NIDA program officer (PO) as well. 
Significant protocol changes will be uploaded to clinicaltrials.gov upon IRB and NIDA approval.  
Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_293285] [Lan and DeMets, 
1994]2. The proportion of expected events (i.e., self -reported non -fatal overdose) is considered as the 
information statistic. The p-values will be constructed to maintain the overall study power of 0.05, two - 
sided. If the test statistic exceeds the boundary, then the study could be considered for early 
termina tion due to emerging differences between the two arms. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_293286].  
The study investigators will report all adverse events and significant adverse events to th e DSMB (see 
below). Moreover, all adverse and significant adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_293418], and all categories with a statistically significant (at a p < 0.05, two -sided) 
excess incidence in the intervention group  will be flagged. These flags will be reviewed and commented 
on by [CONTACT_4318], which may recommend early termination of the trial given evidence of harm based on 
these and other safety data.  
Finally, the entire trial will stop if any investigator judges it necessary for medical, safety, regulatory, or 
other  reasons  consistent with  applicable  laws,  regulations,  or good  clinical  practice.  Once  a concern  of 
this proportion is raised, the decision to stop the trial will be made through immediate consultation with 
the IRB, the DSMB, and  NIDA.  
Disclosure of any Conflict of  Interest 
All data sharing partners (e.g., RIDOH) and project investigators will agree to specific terms of use for 
the data according to a signed Data Use Agreement, which includes a request to disclose any potential 
conflicts of interest.  
All individuals who meet the definition of Investigator will participate in Brown’s FCOI or equivalent

analyzing sensitive  data.  
F1. Trial Safety  
Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants: Loss of Confidentiality  
This project uses primary and secondary data regarding illicit drug use and overdose events; therefore, 
confidentiality of study data is of utmost importance. Access to such records for legitimate research 
purposes has been approved by [CONTACT_293419], RIDOH, and o ur team has worked carefully 
to ensure the protection of these data.  
We recognize that a loss of confidentiality may also result in psychological harm to individuals or in 
social harm. As such, the research team will be using Brown’s state of the art Stronghold computing 
environment for the transfer, analysis, and protection of all research data. Data sharing partners will 
share only the required datasets and variables. Additionally, only select members of the analytic team 
will have access to any identifiable datasets. All data transfer procedures, analytic plans, and use of 
administrative datasets will be approved by [CONTACT_293403].  
Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants: Referrals for services or treatment  
To determine if participants would benefit from referrals for treatment or social services, we will offer all 
participants a community resources packet at the end of the baseline visit. These resources will include 
information regarding addiction treatment (including MAT), syringe exchange, peer counseling, and 
mental health care. We will then ask if they would be willing to hear about programs or organizations 
pertaining to those services most important to them. Based on their responses, we can then refer them to 
those specific organizations.  
Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants: Fentanyl Test Strips  
This study will use Fentanyl Test Strips purchased from BTNX, Inc. These are single -use, lateral flow 
immunoassay test strips for the qualitative detection of fentanyl in liquid and powder substances at the 
cut-off concentration of 20 ng/mL.  
BTNX, Inc. is aware of the research study and have pledged their support. Additionally, they have 
offered to individually number test strips for use in the study as well as provide technical expertise a nd 
assistance to ensure that the diagnostic abilities and limitations of the test strips are communicated 
effectively to participants. In addition, they will ensure that our team is kept abreast of new information 
regarding the ability of the test strips to detect additional novel fentanyl analogs.  
All participants in the Intervention Arm will receive face -to-face training on how to use the test strips, and 
the risks of using the test strips. Participants will be given plain -language handouts to take with them at 
each visit that reiterate the main training points and risks.

you with additional information about what is in your drugs.  
Research Database Infrastructure:  
This project will benefit from data security resources provided by [CONTACT_293420] “Stronghold” 
computing system. Stronghold is a secure computing and storage environment that enables Brown 
researchers to analyze sensitive data, while complying with regulatory or contractual requirements. 
Stronghold is currently self -certified to meet the security requirements and controls for HIPAA (Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and is undergoing the certification process for FISMA 
(Federal Information Security Management Act) and CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Security). We 
will use the Stronghold secure computing environment to store, maintain, and transfer dataset between 
Brown University and RIDOH.  
Stronghold is a secure virtual compute environment designed for remotely analyzing sensitive data. It 
uses encrypted SSH (Secure Shell) with two -factor authentication for remote access. Access to ea ch 
virtual network is limited to a single PI [INVESTIGATOR_293287] & Information Services (CIS). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_293288] a written 
agreement with CIS that authorized users must comply  with all necessary training requirements. CIS 
staff who have access to Stronghold have completed CITI course modules for working with human 
subject data as required by [CONTACT_59867]’s Office of Research Protection.  
Stronghold is accessible only from within the Brown campus network and by [CONTACT_293421] (using two -factor authentication) from outside the campus network. All network 
connections to Stronghold pass through at least two firewalls: a dedicated firewall on the Brown 
campus network and a host -based firewall in the Stronghold environment. Stronghold uses a Windows - 
exclusive virtual environment when accessed through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).  
The Stronghold system is physically located in a locked rack in a CCTV monitored data center on the 
Brown campus. Only certain authorized CIS staff have access to this locked rack. Entry to the data 
center is limited to authorized Brown IT personnel and their guests, and all entries are logged.  
This service is customized to the needs of individual users and their data use agreements. Each 
investigator is given a dedicated environment for their project to support their co -investigators, graduate 
students, research assistants, interviewers, and other collaborators. Access to the Internet is re stricted 
except for required locations for data imports or necessary software downloads. Import and export 
controls are in place to limit who can perform data migration, where sensitive data can come from and 
where desensitized or anonymized data can be moved to. Sensitive data is subject to file system 
auditing, and real -time alerting is available at the request of the PI.

group/study arm of the affected participant, whether the event appears to be related to the intervention, 
and whether participant will continue in the study).  
AEs must be reported to the NIDA PO at least once per year and can be reported as a part of the annual 
progress report. At a minimum, this report should describe the event, when it occurred, the study arm of 
the participant, and the outcome/resolution. If there were no AEs, a statement that no AEs occurred 
should be included in the progress report or communicated to the PO in writing.  
Our research team will follow FDA federal guidelines for reporting of all Adverse Events and Severe 
Adverse Events. The level of study risk, Adverse Events, and Severe Adverse Events will all be 
monitored and managed throughout the study by [CONTACT_293422].

Protocol Title : “Rhode Island Prescription and Illicit Drug Study (RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852])” ** title change  
Device Name: [CONTACT_293478]. Rapid Response™ Single Drug Test Strip  
Justification for NSR Determination  
Description of the Device: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a fentanyl 
overdose prevention intervention involving the use of take-home fentanyl test strips reduces the 
risk of overdose among people who use drugs. The device, known as the BTNX Inc. Rapid 
Response™ Single Drug Test Strip, is a rapid, qualitative test for the detection of a selected 
drug in human urine. We propose to use the product off -label by [CONTACT_293434] 
a small amount of an illicit drug sample dissolved in water. The fentanyl (FYL) test strip is a 
lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of fentanyl, fentanyl 
metabolites (i.e., norfentanyl), and related analogues (e.g., carfentanil). Prior research 
conducted by [CONTACT_293435] a detection limit of 0.13 micrograms/mL when used to test illicit drug samples 
dissolved in water (see Attachment B). The product has >90% specificity and >96% sensitivity 
when compared to a gold standard.[ADDRESS_357581] results appear on the strip within two minutes (see 
Attachment  B). 
Reports of Prior Investigations: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of using test strips to 
identify fentanyl contamination of illicit drugs prior to consumption, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_293305] [ADDRESS_357582] strips was high; overall, 95% agreed or strongly agreed that they 
planned to use the tests.[ADDRESS_357583] all pi[INVESTIGATOR_172165] (99%) reported that it would be easy 
to use the test strips to identify fentanyl contamination in illicit drugs prior to consumption.  
Among persons who returned for follow -up, a total of 62 participants (77%) reported using at 
least one test strip.3 Of these, 31 (50%) received at least one positive result. A positive result 
was associa ted with older age, homelessness, heroin use, injection drug use, ever witnessing 
an overdose, and concern about overdose or drugs being laced with fentanyl (all p < 0.05).  
Receiving a positive result was significantly associated with reporting a positive change in 
overdose risk behavior between baseline and follow -up (p ≤ 0.01). Among all participants, 79 
(98%) reported confidence in their ability to use the test strips and 77 (95%) wanted to use them 
in the future. A subsequent qualitative study found tha t the vast majority of participants found

To avoid 
confusion, we affixed labels to every package that visually show how to properly interpr et a 
result (see Attachment B). We will do so in the proposed clinical trial. After receiving a positive 
test result, many participants described precautions that they believed would prevent an 
overdose, such as using a drug with others around, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_293209], or using a  “tester” 
(a small amount of drugs). We found no evidence to suggest that the test strips were used to 
purposely “seek out” fentanyl, or result in other drug -using behaviors that may increase 
overdose  risk. 
Proposed Investigational  Plan: The clinical trial described herein proposes to use the fentanyl 
test strips in the same manner as that tested during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but incorporates the product 
into a broader overdose prevention intervention that involves educational components,  
motivational interviewing, etc. (see Clinical Trial Protocol). The consent form clearly explains the 
potential risks and benefits of using the test strips to prevent accidental exposure to illicitly 
manufactured fentanyl. All study procedures involving the product are described in detail within 
the Clinical Trial Protocol.  
Summary of NSR Determination : The results of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_293306] a useful harm reduction intervention to reduce fentanyl overdos e risk 
among people who use drugs. These results are consistent with a recently published study of 
[ADDRESS_357588] strips do not increase overdose risk or otherwise provide a false 
sense of security for the user. Therefore, we believe the study meets the criteria for an  
non-significant risk (NSR) device study under IDE regulations (21 CFR 812.b2). Nonetheless, 
we will carefully monitor the safety of all participants and will report adverse and severe adverse 
events to the Data Safety Monitoring board on a regular basis (see Attachment F - Data Safety 
Monitoring Plan).

ATTACHMENT I  RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_293309]  ● Visits that occur outside of BUSPH must follow all of the same safety protocols that have  
been  outlined  for visits  occurring  on-site. 
● Additionally,  Research  Assistants  performing  study visits in the field will go out in pairs  
so that no staff will ever be alone during a study visit. Research Assistants will also  
communicate  with the Project  Coordinator  or Project  Manager  and check  in at the 
beginning  and end of each  visit. Bathroom  Safety Procedures  ● The Primary  staff should  chaperone  the participant  at all times  while  they are at the School  
of Public Health, including while in the elevator. One exception is when a participant is using  
the bathroom,  when  the staff person  will remain  outside  the bathroom.  Primary  staff are to 
remind  participants  of the bathroom  rules:  o

with enacting  the Medical Response  Procedure  outlined  on Page . Session Delivery Safety Procedures ● When  in a respondent’s  presence,  the Primary  staff should:  o Sit near the exit and in a location where you can leave quickly if needed. Keep  
all personal and study items close to you and within sight. Be aware of your  
environment  at all times.  If you have  concerns  about  a situation, call the  
Project  Coordinator  and follow  the “[CONTACT_223440]”  procedures  outlined  in this 
document  (see below).  o With the exception  of your cell phone  and study  equipment,  never  take 
anything  into a participant  session  that you do not absolutely  need  for the 
session  (e.g.,  limit carrying  personal  items,  extra  cash,  etc.).  o Ensure  that you have  the Project Coordinator, Project Director, and study  
clinicians’ cell phone numbers programmed into your cell phone for quick use.  
If there  is a landline  present  in the study  rooms,  cell phone  numbers  for the 
Project  Coordinator  and Program  Director  are pre-programmed.  ● If a respondent  becomes  agitated  or confrontational  with you about  the study,  try to 
address  his/her  concerns.  If he/she  still seems  uncertain,  direct  them  to the Project  
Coordinator.  However,  don’t  push  the issue  if you feel unsafe.  If appropriate,  offer to Page 2 of 9

Once           you are in a safe area, call the Secondary staff and Project Coordinator to inform              them of the situation. ​You are in ​no way expected to stay in an unsafe situation in                order to complete a research study visit.Calling “[CONTACT_223440]” Safety Procedure ●If you do not feel that you are in immediate danger but feel uneasy about the situation,                you should place a call to “[CONTACT_223440]” (a study supervisor) to review the circumstances.              We use the term “[CONTACT_223440]” to immediately notify study supervisors of a possible serious              situation.○To do this, you can say something like, “ ​It looks like I may be missing an               important study document, will you hold on one moment while I place a call to my               supervisor? ​” When making the call to the Project Coordinator, you would say “ ​I            need to speak with Dr, West ​..​”●The Project Coordinator or staff who answers the call will then use YES/NO questions to              understand the situation and determine the best course of actio n.○If the Project Coordinator determines you should end the interview prematurely,          you then calmly explain to the respondent that you need to reschedule the            interview. You can use any reason that seems plausible such as, the equipment            isn’t working properly, you don’t have the proper consent form, or that you are             just not feeling well.○Calmly apologize for the inconvenience and let them know that we will have to             reschedule for another time. Follow up with the Project Coordinator immediately          and document the incident.Some examples of dangerous or unsafe situations might be: ●Drug use/sales●Observation that respondent is high or intoxicated●Violence or threats of violence toward you or others in the env ironment●General sense of hostility or aggressiveness toward you●Inappropriate language directed to you●Sexual advances●Any perceived threat or inappropriate behaviorAngry Respondents Procedure ●It is rare that the Primary Staff will encounter a situation where the respondent becomes              angry. However, in the case that a respondent becomes angry, it is the role of the               ​Page 3 of 9 Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021

The goal in             these situations is to calm the respondent down: ●Remain calm yourself.●Try to find out what they are angry about.●Listen.●Acknowledge their concerns, by [CONTACT_293437], “Okay, I understand          how that would be upsetting.”●Apologize for any inconvenience, discomfort, etc.●Validate their feelings.●Let them know what you will do to address their concerns, such as, “Talk to              your supervisor immediately,” or “Make the researchers aware of the         problem”, etc.●Actually write the concerns down in your notes in front of the respondent.●Offer to have your Project Coordinator call them to discuss the situation           further.●Call or text the Secondary staff or Project Coordinator if you feel the situation             is not calming down.●No matter how angry or insulting a respondent may be, the Primary staff must remain              polite and professional. They are not, however, required to remain in such a situation. If              a participant is very angry, their participation is not likely going to be valid. Furthermore,              we do ​NOT ​, at any point, want someone’s personal safety to be at risk.●The Primary staff will end the conversation with a brief thank you, and leave the situation               as unobtrusively as possible.Participant Safety Planning Procedure ●If the Primary staff observe behavior where they feel the participant’s safety is at risk, or               that the safety of others may be at risk, we encourage them to quickly involve the               Secondary staff member, the Project Coordinator or Project Director. This includes          observing behaviors that indicate the respondent may be high or intoxicated to the point             of not being able to participate in the study, and/or are unable to leave the study site                safely.●When the Primary staff observes what they consider to be impaired functioning, visible            intoxication, or concerning behaviors, they should:○Conduct a brief verbal assessment using the “Alert & Oriented X4” as outlined            below in Section 4 to generate a discussion regarding their ability to be alert and              oriented. This can be done at any point during the participant visit, including prior             to a participant leaving the building. Staff may also express concern for the            participant’s well-being.​Page 4 of 9 Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021

This will be a phone call to the on-call clinician, BH Link, or              9-1-1, depending on the severity of the situation.■If there is an immediate threat to their safety, the Primary staff is            instructed to always call 911, or directly ask the Secondary staff to           call 9-1-1. The Primary staff should stay with the participant, and, if           necessary, the Secondary staff should go down to the Lobby [CONTACT_293439].○The Primary staff will explain to the participant their concerns about safety, and            help them engage with the clinician via phone or video chat. The clinician will             support the participant by [CONTACT_40397] a safety plan with the participant prior to them             leaving the building. The Primary staff will support the safety plan by [CONTACT_293440]/or placing additional phone calls to BH Link mobile          crisis unit or 9-1-1 if needed. All related transportation costs will be charged to             the study.○The Project Director will ensure all documentation policies are followed as          needed (e.g. DSMB or IRB reporting and follow-up).●All research staff will be trained on how to respond to suicidal ideation/threats prior to              their work with research study participants.Harm to Self or Others Safety Procedure NOTE: we are NOT clinicians and so we are limited in the scope of what we are able to offer                    someone in these circumstances. However we should be empathetic and non-judgmental in            our response to this information, and offer the best available resources. ●If the Primary research staff observe behavior where they feel the participant’s           safety is at risk due to suicidal ideation or threat of self-harm, or that the safety of                others may be at risk due to threat of harm, we encourage them to quickly involve               the Secondary staff member, the Project Coordinator or Project Director as          available.●We will not be collecting any information regarding suicidal ideation or behavior in            this study.

This checklist serves as a guide to Sponsor-Investigators in determining and documenting information required by [CONTACT_293445] a medical device which falls under the FDA regulations (21 CFR812) in a human subjects’ research study and requires an
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). * Sponsor-Investigator  is the individual who initiates and also conducts the
regulatory requirements applicable to both sponsors and clinical investigators (21 CFR312.3). A device will fall under the FDA 
regulations i f data will be submitted to the FDA OR safety and/or effectiveness data are collected about the device. 
The IDE regulations (21 CFR8 12) describe three types o f device studies : significan t risk (SR), which require an IDE application

We would like to resume in -person survey questionnaires with participants at SPH [ADDRESS_357610]. 
for our NIH -funded, R01 clinical trial, The Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription  and Illicit Drug Study 
(RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]). This study involves recruiting individuals for six in -person contacts over the course of one 
year. Each visit is approximately [ADDRESS_357611] the research will work in person at 
121 South Main.  Specifically, two research assistants (Jackie Goldman, Tania Lobo Paz) will be a sked 
to return to in -person work.  Their supervisor (Jesse Yedinak) and the PI (Brandon Marshall) will 
continue to work remotely during this period, but will be available by [CONTACT_293453].  Please see the lab density sheet  for more information.  
Lab safety plan  
General procedures:  
Risks to staff and participants will be mitigated through the  use of personal protective equipment 
(masks, gloves for handling study equipment, including distribution urine tests, naloxone to 
participants etc.), regular sanitizing of spaces after each participant, and by [CONTACT_293454] (2). Social distancing guidelines will be followed by [CONTACT_941] 2

same day to discuss their symptoms.  
Work shift:  
භOn days where participant visi ts are scheduled, research staff will be working in -person. They
will arrive an hour before the first participant visit in order to prepare for the study visit and
perform requisite cleaning.
භWhen scheduling multiple visits in a day, there must be at least an hour in between visits to
allot for dis infection procedures, to ensure that participant visits do not overlap should
participant visits run overtime or a participant arrive early.
භAfter the final visit for the day, staff should plan to stay on site for an hour to clean and
disinfect the study space as well as personal work space.
භStaff will only work in the building on days when participant visits are scheduled. Otherwise,
staff will work remotely. If there are multiple visits during the day, that staff will stay on site
between visits and be allowed to conduct their non -participant facing work, such as phone
screens, attend zoom meetings related to this project or others, and perform other
administrative work related to this project and others.
භStaff will be requested to eat in either rooms [ADDRESS_357613] maintain social distancing
measures when they eat and wipe down high -touch surfaces before and after eating.
Procedures for social distancing:  
භEach staff  will have  their  own office  in which  to conduct their  work  and participant visits.
භEach staff  will have  their  own laptop  and phone.  No other  study  equipme nt will be shared.
භStaff  will agree  to stay more  than  6 ft apart  when  in a shared  space.
භParticipants  will be given  a disposable  mask  by [CONTACT_293455].
භParticipants  will be instructed  by [CONTACT_293456] and

This will be reevaluated as Brown University
moves to other stages of reopening.
Additional procedures for participant e ncounters/sessions:  
භStaff will ensure there are sufficient cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment on -
site at all times.  Cleaning equipment will be stored in room 256.
භStaff will disinfect their work space upon entering the building and upon completion of their
work day.
භAt all times, participants will be seated more than 6ft apart  from the research staff.
භStaff will conduct a health pre -screening with research participants prior to their study visits.
භParticipants will enter and exit [ADDRESS_357616] visit and at the completion of the final study visit each day.
භSigns will be posted reminding participants of how to properly wear their masks and
reminding them to wash their hands thoroughly after their visits.
Additional procedures for urine scree ning:  
භThere will be one dedicated restroom for participants to use for urine screens. No other staff
or participants are allowed to use that restroom.
භProtective equipment, such as masks and gloves, will be worn at all times during urine drug
screening, in accordance with the prior -approved protocols.
භThe restroom will be wiped down with disinfectant after each use.
Finally, as the research involves in -pers on, on -campus human subjects research activities, the 
following is at tested:  
1)I affirm that the study team will conduct a health pre -screening with research participants at
least a day prior to and on the same day as their study visits. If the  health pre -screening  and
research participants’ on -campus study visit are not within close proximity to one another, it
is advised that the study team conduct another health screening when the research
participant arrives for the study visit.Brown University IRB Original Approval: 4/18/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/22/2019 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 8/10/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/15/2020 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 02/26/2021 Brown University IRB Continuing Review Approval: 03/18/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 06/15/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 09/01/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 10/05/2021Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 11/09/2021 Brown University IRB Amendment Approval: 12/13/2021 
2)I affirm that the study team will discuss with research participants the safety protocols
implemented at Brown to reduce risk of transmission of COVID -[ADDRESS_357617] include any  Expectations of study participants .
3)I affirm that the study team will inform research participants of the Brown University
requirement that they wear a face covering during their study visit.
4)I affirm that the study team will provide research participants with information about
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention groups determined to be at higher risk for
severe illness , either verbally via a script or via an electronic method (for example, sent via
email or Qualtrics). This will enable participants to make an informed decision about personal
risks related to COVID -19.
5)I affirm that the study team will remind research participants of the following Phase I State of
Rhode Island guidance: “Older adults (65+) and those with underlying health conditions can go
to work and go out for food or medicine. But in accordance with federal public health
guidance, vulnerable individuals are strongly encouraged to otherwise stay home.”

Appendix C: Dried Blood Spot Protocol 
Dried Blood Spot Collection Policies & Procedures - The following are instructions to guide 
the collection, handling and storage of dried blood spots.  
When collecting blood samples, always use Universal Safety Precautions. These include:  
භTreating all blood samples as though they are infectious;
භWashing hands;
භWearing gloves;
භTaking precaution to avoid needle -stick injury; and
භDisposing of contaminated sharps and waste appropriately
1.Materials required
භWhatman 903 Protein Saver cards (DBS collection card)
භSterile, disposable lancets
භSpecimen bags (sealable plastic bags)
භHumidity indicator cards
භDesiccant packs
භAbsorbent underpads
භSterilising alcohol wipes
භGauze pads, cotton ball, and  plaster/band -aid
භSafety and clean -up materials including gloves,
a sharps container, sani -cloth wipes,
concentrated bleach for 10% bleach solution.
2.Sample collection and testing procedure
This section presents detailed instructions for collecting and storing a DBS sample. Please 
ensure that you read and understand the steps involved and collect each sample in accordance 
with these instructions. A simplified graphical representation of this procedure (Annex 1) is 
presented on page 4 for your future refe rence.  
Please examine Annex 2 (page 5) to fami liarize yourself with the appearance of a valid versus 
invalid DBS sample, and take note of the following tips for sample collection:  
භApply blood to only one side of the filter paper (DBS card)
භDO NOT press th e filter paper against the puncture site
භDO NOT layer successive drops of blood or apply blood more than once in the same
collection circle
භDO NOT “milk” the finger as excessive milking or squeezing the puncture site might
cause hemolysis of the specimen (destruction of red blood cells) or result in collection
of tissue fluids with the specimen, which might adversely affect the test result.

Note: Three complete circles are better than five incomplete ones! While the collection card may 
include 5 circles, only one participant’s blood may be collected on any given card.  
3.General test preparation
a)Gather the required materials and find a suitable surface to take the samples before
putting on the gloves
b)Label the DBS card with the encrypted study ID code and complete any clinical
information required on the card.
4.Fingerstick performed by [CONTACT_3476]
a)Explain the procedure to the participant so that they know what to expect. Ask which
finger they would like to use, noting that the ring finger (fourth from the thumb) is most
practical for the procedure.
b)Warm the participant’s hands and fingers to increase blood circulation if possible. To
further increase blood circulation, it sometimes helps to massage the whole hand and
finger to be stuck, not just the fingert ip. While the tester is organizing the specimen
collection materials, they can also have the participant open and close (“pump”) their
hand or squeeze and release a stress ball several times to increase blood circulation.
Having the participant hold their hand below the level of their heart before performing
the collection increases blood circulation as well.
c)Position the hand palm -side up. Choose the fingertip of the ring, or middle finger,
whichever is the least calloused. You can also use the index finger or thumb if it’s the
least calloused finger.
d)Clean that finger with the alcohol pad.
e)Using a sterile contact [CONTACT_293464], puncture the skin just off the center of the
finger pad. Hold the finger downward and apply gentle pressure beside the point of
the puncture. Avoid squeezing the finger to make it bleed.
f)Wipe away the first drop of blood, which tends to contain excess tissue fluid, with a
sterile gauze or cotton ball. Allow a new drop of blood to form before collecting the
blood specimen.
g)Allow a large drop of free -flowing blood to collect at the puncture site. Working
quickly, hold the DBS card by [CONTACT_293465], touch the filter paper gently against the large
drop of blood, and in one step allow a sufficient quantity of blood to soak through and
compl etely fill or saturate a circle.
DO NOT  allow the finger to touch the card;  
DO NOT  layer successive drops of blood or apply blood more than 
once in the same collection circle.  
h)Repeat Step g), collecting enough blood on the DBS
card to fill each of the  5 circles completely.
i)Give the participant a gauze pad and ask them to apply pressure to their finger.
j)Take the DBS card to a secure drying rack, ensuring it is labeled with the participant’s

encrypted study ID code, and allow it to dry for a minimum of f our hours before 
packing for storage.   
k)Once the bleeding has stopped, use a Band Aid to bandage the participant’s finger.
l)Discard your gloves in a biohazard container after the sample collection and don a
fresh pair for each new participant.
5.Cleanup and  decontamination
a)Dispose of used lancets and gloves in a sharps container.
Once the sharps container is full, close firmly, and set in the
designated area for pi[INVESTIGATOR_293320].
b)Due to the small amounts of blood being collected from each
participant,  it is unlikely that large spi[INVESTIGATOR_293321]. However, it
is important to treat any blood spi[INVESTIGATOR_293322]. Use a sani -cloth wipes
to wipe up the blood. If more than a few drops of blood are spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073], use the 10%
bleach solution and the san i-cloth wipes to clean the area. Dispose of the clinical
wipes in a sharps container.
c)At the end of each day, wipe down completely all surfaces using Clorox Clinical
Wipes, including tabletops, collection station chairs, and empty drying racks.
. Packaging  DBS samples for long -term storage
a)Once the DBS card has been allowed to dry
for a minimum of four hours, follow the steps
depi[INVESTIGATOR_293323]-term storage
b)Fold the DBS card to protect the collected
samples
c)Insert the DBS  card into the sealable plastic
bag, ensuring that the participant identification
label will be visible without opening the bag
d)Add two desiccant packets to the plastic bag.
These serve as a drying agent to protect the
sample
e)Add a humidity indicator card,  ensuring that it
will be visible without opening the bag
f)Seal the bag and store in a cool, dry, dark
place until it can be shipped to the
biospecimen bank at Rhode Island Biobank.
Humidity and UV light can damage the DBS
samples so it is important they ar e stored
appropriately.
Note: DBS samples can be stored at r oom temperature for a maximum of [ADDRESS_357619] be transferred to a -70˚C freezer. The total time at 
ambient / room temperature should be mini mised as much as possible

Management and Gaming Element s 
NCT number (if available):  STUDY0014832 4 
Date of the document:  3/4/[ADDRESS_298744] t he app for proof of concept on older subjects with dizziness in a 
clinical environment  (laboratory or clinic)  under the supervision of a clinician. The aim is to test 
whether when using the app older patients perform rehabilitation in a similar manner as when 
directly instructed by a clinician. A secondary goal is to evaluate  usability and enjoyment of the 
app. Data will be collected on 40 subjects (20 male and 20 female). Subj ect inclusion criteria are 
to be aged between [ADDRESS_298745] age, body height and mass and vestibular condition will be recorded. They will also 
be asked to answer a Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) as well as an Activities -specific 
Balance Confidence (ABC) scale questionnaire to assess how much they are affected by [CONTACT_245672].  
Each subject will perform a rehabilitation session with the prototype app and one session 
without the app. The session will be setup on the app by [CONTACT_245673]. The session without the app will include the same exercises at a similar 
recommended speed and range of motion. These will be performed without any feedback as 
they would typi[INVESTIGATOR_245670]  a patient doing their at -home exercises. The o rder in which 
the sessions occur will be randomized to avoid learning effects. Subjects are encouraged to 
take a break between the sessions  and can take a break at any time if desired . Each session 
will start with the participant practicing the games and exercises using the slower speed practice 
games and proceed when they feel ready. A physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245671]. This is to simulate first use of the app. It is envisioned that the fi rst time a patient will 
use the app this will be under supervision and assistance of a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Patients will 
perform a full rehabilitation session, lasting about 20 minutes after that.  
The real -time feedback during the exercises will be tested.  A clinician who is blinded to the 
feedback the patient receives (as in they cannot see the screen and will be listening to music on 
headphones in the case of auditory feedback) will identify each error the patient makes and will 
make notes whether this er ror continues or is corrected by [CONTACT_102]. This will be coded with 
numbers and recorded on video. Errors identified by [CONTACT_245674] a time stamp for comparison. Raw sensor data will be stored and analyzed to test 
the efficacy of the feedback and see if exercise execution improves after feedback.  
IMU data will be collected during both sessions  (with and without the app)  for comparison.  
Outcome measures, including range of head motion, movement velocity, and the number of 
repetitions performed, will be calculated. Data will be compared between the two sessions to 
investigate whether patients performed exercises similar with and without the app. 
Questionnaires will be answered to rate usability and enjoyment while using the app, as well as 
open ended questionnaires to identify areas of improvement.

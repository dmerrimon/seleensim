9 1 - Statement of Compliance  
1.1 Statement of Compliance 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. The purpose of this protocol is to ensure 
that this study is to be conducted according to the Common Rule at 45CFR46 (human subjects) and other applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.   
Study Number: 22 -[ZIP_CODE]  5 November 2022  
10 2 - Background  
2.1 Background 
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women and the second 
leading cause of cancer related death7. Screening for CRC reduces CRC incidence and mortality, 
and is recommended for average risk men and women between the ages of 45 and 75 by [CONTACT_73134]; which were updated recently to include 45-49 year olds, an additional 20 million individuals in the US
1. In [LOCATION_001] State, CRC screening rates 
are over 70%2 but only 48- 52% in Brooklyn family health centers (FHC) that provide free and 
subsidized health services to underrepresented minorities. Currently, invitations to screen are offered only when a patient is seen by [CONTACT_73135]. Consequently, many eligible individuals, particularly 45 -55 year olds who do not regularly access healthcare are under -
screened.  
  
Study Number: 22 -[ZIP_CODE]  5 November 2022  
11 3 - Rationale/Significance  
3.1 Problem Statement 
CRC screening rates are 72% in [LOCATION_001] State2 but 48-55% in the federally qualified health 
center where we anticipate performing the study. Hence, there is an unmet need to organize and 
implement CRC screening using multilevel interventions to improve screening rates.  
The current model for CRC screening is far from optimal and poses many barriers at the patie nt, 
provider and systems level. At the patient level: the current model requires an in -person or 
telehealth visit, which poses barriers through difficulty accessing transportation, time commitments and financial barriers. Furthermore, men and women aged 45-55 (on the younger end of the screening spectrum) may not have a primary care provider or seek routine medical care. Many individuals may not know they are eligible for CRC screening or the benefits of CRC screening. At the provider level, barriers includ e lack of up to date information and a lack of time 
to address CRC screening in a short clinic visit with many pressing urgent medical needs. The alternative method of screening we are proposing, an organized program of proactive invitation, has two main components: 1) identification  of screen eligible individuals using health records 
from the clinic; and 2) a proactive  invitation program, with (a) mailed invitation, (b) a package 
of materials so patients can complete a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) from their homes (i.e., FIT kit), and (c) instructions on how to schedule colonoscopy if they prefer this to completing the FIT. From a public health perspective, an outreach screening program is more likely to reach all individuals eligible for screening.                   Multiple trials have reported higher screening rates with proactive invitation through outreach efforts and programmatic approaches, compared to usual care
3,4.  Kaiser  Permanente Northern 
and Southern [LOCATION_004] implemented proactive outreach screening in 2008, based primarily on annual FIT.  Their reported rates of CRC screening are one of the highest in the country, at 81%
5,6.  In their recent publication, they reported that 323,349 health plan members were reached 
through the program. Completion rates for screening improved from 48% to 86% over 4 rounds of implementing the outreach screening process. The program detected 80% of patients diagnosed with stage I colon cancer within 1 year of screening
6.      
              
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
Disparities exist in the CRC screening rates in the Brooklyn family health centers compared to 
[LOCATION_001] State at large, likely driven primarily by [CONTACT_73136]. The purpose of this study is to establish the effectiveness of a proactive CRC screening outreach approach on improving CRC screening rates in an underserved population. We will also gather data regarding patient and provider perception of feasibility and overall experience with the proactive outreach program in order to better inform future screening implementation efforts. Ultimately, the 
broader goal is to decrease patient morbidity and mortality from CRC through improved screening rates.  
 
3.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
3.3.1 Potential Risks 
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79271] common cancer in men and women as well as the second leading cause of cancer related death
7. Given that CRC screening is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality, the 
benefits of improving screening rates far outweigh any potential risks associated with our study.    
Study Number: 22 -[ZIP_CODE]  5 November 2022  
13 4 - Study Objectives  
4.1 Hypothesis 
We hypothesize that CRC screening rates will improve in underserved populations with the 
implementation of a proactive approach that incorporates a mailed outreach invitation to screen 
with fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), followed by [CONTACT_73137].  
 
4.2 Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of a strategy of proactive invitation 
(eligibility assessment followed by a mailed invitation program and n avigation) vs. standard- care 
CRC screening at Flatbush Family Health.  
 
4.3 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective is to identify potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of 
a proactive outreach CRC screening program by [CONTACT_73138] a randomly selected sample of providers and patients . These  data can be used to 
inform further tailoring of an ongoing program of proactive CRC screening at this clinic , if 
shown to be feasible and effective.   
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79272]- intervention interview .  This subset will be verbally 
consented via teleph one prior to completing the interview. 
 The study team will operate mainly in the background, to facilitate mailings and reminders. All materials will be sent on behalf of the clinic , using the clinic’s usual stationery, and containing 
the electronic signature [CONTACT_73150]’s primary care physician, when applicable. The study team will be tracking the cost and effort involved to help the clinic determine the feasibility of long -
term implementation of a proactive screening program for CRC.  
 
5.1.1 Study Date Range and Duration The estimated duration for the study is approximately one year from the start of the intervention 
period (anticipated November 2022 – November 2023, depending on all approvals and other factors outside of the control of the study team).

5.3 Study Population Our study population includes men and women aged 45-75 who are patients in the Flatbush 
Family Health Center medical practice and are due or overdue for CRC screening. The patient population in the Flatbush  FHC medical practice is an underserved population that currently has 
lower CRC screening rates compared to the average screening rate in [LOCATION_001] State. Assessing the effectiveness of a proactive outreach CRC screening program is pi[INVESTIGATOR_73130].

16 6 – Methods   
6.1 Intervention  
6.1.1 Description of Intervention 
Our proposed intervention involves proactive outreach for CRC screening for patients receiving 
care at Flatbush FHC. More specifically, patients randomized to the proactive outreach group will receive a letter  from their clinic (mailed by [CONTACT_3476]) e xplaining colorectal cancer 
screening options (FIT vs colonoscopy) including a FIT kit  with completion and return 
instructions . The letter will also include information for navigation to a screening colonoscopy 
instead of FIT testing, if deemed to be the patient's preference. A study information sheet will be included to inform the patient that their data will be used for this research study and explain that the screening by [CONTACT_73140] a research procedure, but a standard of care screening test for which they are due or overdue.  Approximately 10-[ADDRESS_79275] not completed screening  
will receive a telephone call (with voice message left)  and text message, querying whether the 
FIT kit was received and  reminding the patient to complete th e test or request a new kit , if 
needed .  
 Finally, if the FIT kit has not been submitted after about two weeks from the reminder call/text 
message, the study team will m ail a final letter to the patient on behalf of the clinic , reminding 
them to complete and return the FIT kit.  
 If no FIT kit is returned after an additional three week s, there will be a final note uploaded to the 
patient's chart alerting the patient's primary care physician to complete further action regarding CRC screening as indicated.   Those patients with a positive FIT test result will be receive assistance with navigation to scheduling a colonoscopy by [CONTACT_73141]. Screening and diagnostic colonoscopy completion will be facilitated through phone calls to triage whether a colonoscopy can be scheduled over the phone or requires an in-person pre- colonoscopy visit. In 
addition, it will be facilitated through  ensuring t hat bowel prep is mailed to the patient with 
instructions or is available for pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up in clinic. Finally, bowel preparation instructions and 
appointment reminders will be performed via phone call, text or mail [ADDRESS_79276] in participating. Those who agree will be verbally consented over the phone prior to the interview.   
 
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79277] completed the at -home sc reening to take part in the interview. Interviews 
will be audio recorded and  professionally transcribed, with all identifiers scrubbed from the 
transcription.  
 
6.1.2 Method of Assign ment/Randomization  
The study biostatistician  will randomize 50 eligible patients to proactive outreach and 50 eligible 
patients to usual care, stratified by [CONTACT_73142]. Proactive outreach patients will be 
blind to the presence of an alternative  group assignment and "usual care" patients will be 
unaware of group assignment altogether.   
6.1.3 Selection of Instruments/Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measure is completion of initial fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or 
colonoscopy at [ADDRESS_79278] been extensively studied throughout the years.  
 
6.1.4 Intervention Administration  
Please note:  all days listed beyond day [ADDRESS_79279] a +5 day tolerance window. 
 
Day 0 :
 Patients randomized to the proactive outreach group will be mailed letters explaining 
CRC screening options and a FIT kit  with detailed instructions for collection and submission . 
 Day 10-14: In the proactive outreach group, if a FIT kit has not been submitted by [CONTACT_73143], the patient will receive a call or voice message from our research team to e nsure FIT kit 
was received and  reminding the patient to complete and return it or request a new kit, if 
necessary.  
 Day 28: If the FIT kit has not been submitted, the patient will receive a final letter reminding the 
patient to complete and return the FIT kit.  
 Day 56:  For patients who have still not submitted a FIT kit or requested screening via 
colonoscopy, there will be a final note in the chart alerting the patient's primary care physician to complete further action regarding CRC screening as indicated . 
 Days 7-180: Patients with a positive FIT test result will receive assistance with navigation to 
scheduling a follow-up colonoscopy. If patients indicated that they prefer colonoscopy to FIT testing, they will also receive assistance with navigation to s cheduling a colonoscopy. Assistance 
to scheduling a colonoscopy will include an initial phone call performed by [CONTACT_73144] a colonoscopy can be scheduled over the 
phone or requires an in-person pre-colonoscopy visit. In addition, study staff will ensure bowel prep will either be mailed to the patient with instructions or made available to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up in clinic, 
depending on patient preference. Finally, bowel preparation instructions and appointment

6.2.2 Adverse Events Definition and Reporting  
There are no anticipated adverse events with our proposed intervention. 
 
6.3 Study Procedures  
6.3.1 Study Schedule  
See section 6.1.4 for intervention schedule.  Data on control group CRC screening rates will be 
collected from clinic’s electronic medical records system ( EMR ) after the intervention period is 
over and prior to beginning data analysis. 
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_79281]-of- care,  preventative health screening for which patients are due or 
overdue to undergo. By [CONTACT_73145], we will avoid selection bias of enrolling individuals whom are particularly interested in receivin g CRC  
screening or research, thus improving our study's external validity and more accurately measuring the potential efficacy of our intervention on the population at large. In short, the traditional consenting process would negatively impact the reliability of study outcomes.   Additionally , providing information about the study prior to offering the proactive CRC 
screening  to intervention patients  may interfere with decision -making and the clinical care 
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79282] an 
individual’s behavior , attitudes  towards such screening, or their willingness to undergo any type 
of screening in general, due to fear or other stigma associated with research.  
 
Providing information about the study to the standard-care (control) group could also influence decision- making regarding CRC screening and interfere with the clinical care process for these 
patients.  
 The waiver of documentation of consent for the intervention group will include the subset of 
intervention patients who complete the qual itative interview. Information about the interview is 
included in the Study Information Sheet provided to all intervention patients in the initial FIT kit mailing. The study coordinato rs will verbally consent those patients who opt- in for the interview , 
using a study -specific NYU telephone consent script. 
 
6.3.3 Screening 
Screening for participant eligibility will be performed through the research  team  accessing 
patient charts through t he Flatbush FHC’ s EMR  (Epic) and applying the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria previously stated.  
 
6.3.4 Recruitment, Enrollment and Retention  
Patients will be identified for inclusion in the study via accessing the Flatbush FHC EMR (Epic) 
and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously mentioned. We will work with 
DataCore to obtain an initial list of eligible patients  once, at the beginning of the study. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_73131]. The list will contain the following information  about the eligible patients: MRN, full name, date of birth (or age), 
address, phone number(s), email addresses, biological sex, race, ethnicity, height/weight (or 
BMI), smoking status, and primary care physician’s name. Data for the patients that will not be included in the study will be deleted from the electronic list provided by [CONTACT_73146]. No information will be retained about these patients.  
 After the mailed intervention process is complete, data regarding colorectal cancer screening will be obtained for the control group patients . This will include whether colonoscopy, FIT, or other 
screening tests for colorectal cancer were completed during the study period. Approved waiver of consent and HIPAA authorization for this patient group will allow this information to be 
collected directly from Epic by [CONTACT_3476].  
 The primary care physicians at Flatbush FHC have been not ified that their interve ntion group 
patients  will be contact[CONTACT_73147] . 
All letters  from the FHC (initial and final) will contain their electronic signature. These patients 
will receive the Study Information Sheet as part of the initial FIT kit mailing (first conta ct). If 
they decide to opt out, only de-identified data will be retained  in REDCap for audits, summaries, 
and reporting purposes.   
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79283] result. These non-study visits are detailed 
below.  In person pre- colonoscopy screening visit (if applicable  and if required , days 7- 180): Patient will 
receive instruction from a certified R.N. or M.D. regarding colonoscopy preparation instructions, if not already provided by [CONTACT_73148] . Estimated length of visit: 10 -20 minutes  
 Colonoscopy procedure visit (if applicable, days 7-180): Patient will have colonoscopy performed by [CONTACT_73149]. 
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_79284] experienced.  Patients 
receiving the in tervention can participate in an interview regardless of whether or not they 
completed CRC screening.  
 The interviews will be conducted by a member of the NYULH research staff trained in qualitative interviewing techniques  and will occur either over the telephone or through HIPAA-
compliant WebEx sessions . The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, with any 
identifiers to be removed from the  transcription  records. The in terviews will take about 1 5 
minutes to complete.  Recording is required for participation.  
 
6.3.7 Removal of Subjects Given the nature of our proposed study and waiver of informed consent, participants in the usual 
care group will be unaware of their participation in this research s tudy and thus will not actively 
withdraw from the study. Participants randomized to the intervention group may opt out of the screening program or refuse screening at any time. Instructions for how to opt out will be provided in the study information sheet included in the initial mailing. Once 50 of the eligible 
individuals are randomized to proactive screening and 50 to usual care, those selected to proactive screening will be mailed the FIT kit packet and this number will serve as our denominator for the remainder of the study.

7.1 Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent and HIPAA Autho rization 
A waiver of informed consent (usual care group) .  
 
A waiver of written documentation of consent (intervention group) and HIPAA authorization (all 
participants)  will be obtained for this study. Verbal consent via telephone will be obtained for 
intervention group participants who are willing to complete the post- intervention interview.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_79287] (IRB) Review The protocol and all participant materials will be submitted to the IRB for approval. Any 
amendme nt to the protocol will be sent to the IRB for approval before the changes are 
implemented to the study. The IRB will be made aware of any reportable events and unanticipated problems.   
7.[ADDRESS_79288] Privacy, Confidentiality & Data Management The collection of personal patient information will be limited to the amount necessary to achieve 
the aims of the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is being collected. Only study personnel as listed on the IRB will have access to study data. Patient id entifiers that will 
temporarily be accessed/reviewed inclu de name, medical record number, date of birth, phone 
number, address, height, weight, smoking status, and CRC screening history. Electronic study data will be stored on a securely managed (MCIT) network drive and in REDCap, with password -protected access limited to trained, authorized study personnel . It is not expected that 
paper documents will be generated in association with this study, however, any hard copy documents will be kept in a locked cabinet in the PI's office. Electronic data will be exported into excel file format (password protected) and utilized for data analysis. De -identified data will be 
sent to a biostatistician for statistical analysis.  
 
7.4 Deviations/Unanticipated Problems  
Any unanticipated problems will be reported promptly to the IRB (within one business day of 
discovery for serious adverse events), within 7 business days of discovery for all other unanticipated problems.   
7.5 Data Collection Data will be collected at the beginning the study during the initial eligibility screening process as 
well as ongoing throughout the intervention period in order to ascertain FIT testing and/or colonoscopy completion results. Data will only be accessed by [CONTACT_23872], authorized study personnel. Data will be retained for the next 10 years for use in future studies following the completion of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79289] medical records including FIT testing/colonoscopy results, 
outreach attempts and outcomes, and any survey results collected and interview transcripts.  
 
7.8 Access to Source Sourc e documents will be obtained from the Flatbush  Family  Health Center ’s electronic medical 
record  (NYU Langone Health’s Epic system) . All study personnel listed on the IRB will have 
access to the study documents.  
 7.9 Data Storage / Security  
Electronic study data will be stored on a secure NYULH MCIT -managed  network shared drive  
and in REDCap . All hard copy documents will be kept in a locked cabinet in the PI's office. 
Electronic data will be exported into excel file format (password protected) and utilized for data 
analysis. De- identified data will be sent to a biostatistician  for statistical analysis.  
 
7.10 Retention of Records Study documents will be retained for the longer of 3 years after close out or 5 years after final 
reporting/publication. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if 
required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
7.[ADDRESS_79290]. Access to the dataset for any future research will require separate IRB approval. If any information is shared with external interested site(s), data set agreements with NYU LANGONE will be established.  
 Transcripts from the patient interview audio recordings will be de -identified and will be used to 
tailor and improve possibl e future proactive CRC screening efforts.  
Study data may be used to inform future funding proposals. The purpose of other possible future 
research is unknown at this time.  
Study Number: [ADDRESS_79291] for our study.

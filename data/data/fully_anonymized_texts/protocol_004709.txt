 2 2  INTRODUCTION  2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   Intrauterine devices (IUDs) provide highly effective contraception and are historically placed at the interval six-week PP visit for women who desire intrauterine contraception. Since ovulation can occur as early as 25 days postpartum, there is a risk that women could become pregnant between 4-6 weeks postpartum. The early postpartum (EPP) period, 2-4 weeks postpartum, could be a convenient time for women to receive contraception, including IUDs. Women can’t become pregnant in the first 25 days postpartum. The visit can be co-located with other health care visits, such as well baby [CONTACT_41995], that occur in this time frame.  Offering women EPP IUDs may decrease the risk of undesired pregnancy and rapid repeat pregnancy.  2.2 BACKGROUND   Intrauterine devices (IUDs) provide highly effective contraception and are historically placed at the interval six-week postpartum visit for women who desire intrauterine contraception. Since ovulation can occur 25 days postpartum, there is a risk that women could become pregnant between 4-6 weeks postpartum. Immediate postpartum (IPP) IUD placement, within 10 minutes of delivery, is safe and effective as well as convenient for providers and patients (ACOG, 2016). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_292559], there are significant barriers to widespread implementation, most importantly a lack of reimbursement mechanisms and training. Although efforts are currently in place to increase access to IPP IUDs, they are developi[INVESTIGATOR_292560], and additional strategies are urgently needed to allow for flexibility and multiple options for provision of highly effective contraception in the postpartum period.  Both immediate and interval IUD insertion carry unique risks. IPP IUD insertion is associated with an increased risk of expulsion (IUD being pushed out of the uterus) with rates as high as 24-38% (Chen, 2011; Goldwaithe, 2017) compared to IUDs placed at 6 weeks PP 3-5% (Chen, 2011). However, interval IUD insertion at 6 weeks postpartum is associated with a small increase in the risk of uterine perforation (IUD going through the uterine wall), particularly among breastfeeding women (Heinemann, 2015) and there is a risk that women will become pregnant by 6 weeks postpartum leading to undesired pregnancies and rapid repeat pregnancies.  The early postpartum (EPP) period, 2-4 weeks postpartum, could be a convenient time for women to receive contraception, including IUDs. Women can’t become pregnant in the first [ADDRESS_356967] shown that EPP IUD placement is feasible and acceptable (Baldwin 2016, Zerden 2017, Chen 2017). There were no perforations among participants in these studies and no complete expulsions. Partial IUD expulsion rates were low (2-5% at 6 months). However, these studies were not powered to determine IUD expulsion. The purpose of this study is to compare the expulsion rate of EPP IUDs inserted between 2-[ADDRESS_356968] effective methods of contraception, at time points earlier than the traditional six-week postpartum visit.

 3  2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  1. Loss of confidentiality: there is risk of stress, emotional distress, inconvenience, and possible loss of privacy associated with participating in a research study. There will be a need for medical record access to assess patient demographics and clinical outcomes. Most study data will be stored in the HIPAA-secure online REDCap database. Any printed study data (such as consent forms) will be secured in a locked cabinet/filebox, and only those directly involved in the study will have access to these including the investigators who will process the data. Data will only be saved under a secure file on a computer requiring a log-in password. Data will be shared between institutions and UCSD using REDCap, which is a secured HIPAA-compliant web application (https://redcap.ucsd.edu). NMCSD is not able to enter data directly into REDCap. NMCSD will, instead, use paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_292561]; UCSD staff will enter data into REDCap. Once data is entered into REDCap, UCSD will shred the paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Shared patient identifiers include: patient initials, date of service, baby [CONTACT_292568]. Consent will be obtained in the patient’s private postpartum room, in the private clinical space where participant can ask questions without feelings of embarrassment or discomfort, and/or over the phone from a private office. The physical exam will be conducted in a private examination room. 2. IUD expulsion or uterine perforation risk: there is a risk that IUD expulsion and uterine perforation could be greater than in the study group (EPP) compared to the standard of care group. Currently available data suggest that the risk of expulsion and perforation will be less than or equal to the risk of expulsion and perforation associated with the standard of care. There have been over [ADDRESS_356969] been low (<4%) and there have been no documented perforations (Baldwin 2016, Zerden 2017, Chen 2017). In addition, ultrasound studies have shown that approximately two-thirds of uterine involution occurs by [ADDRESS_356970] expulsion (Belachew, 2012) In the EPP period the uterine wall is thicker than [ADDRESS_356971] perforation (Watanagara, 2015). The practice of inserting IUDs at this time is approved and considered to be a category 2 practice (benefits outweigh the risks) from the CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria (CDC, Medical Eligibility Criteria, 2016). However, the data on this practice are minimal and thus there are potential risks to IUD insertion at this time which is why this study is urgently needed.  All patients will be informed of possible IUD expulsion and uterine perforation (known and unknown). Clinicians may also use ultrasound guidance for placement if they feel that ultrasound will mitigate the risk of expulsion or perforation. Participants will be assessed at a follow-up visit for IUD expulsion and uterine perforation. A study clinician will conduct a bimanual pelvic exam and a transvaginal ultrasound at this visit and provide any care clinically required to address any IUD side effects or complications.  3. There is a risk that an IUD could be placed when a woman is already pregnant. This is true only during the standard of care and it is a potential benefit of the EPP that women cannot yet be pregnant so soon after delivery (ovulation can’t occur until at least 25 days postpartum). Any woman who is > 25 days postpartum who has an IUD placed will be assessed for the risk of new pregnancy (will be asked if she has had unprotected intercourse and will be assessed for lactational amenorrhea). If > [ADDRESS_356972] benefit from participation in this study. However, this study will help determine if IUDs can be provided during the early postpartum period with low expulsion rates and high patient satisfaction rates. There may be a benefit to women in the EPP group to avoid unplanned early repeat pregnancies.  2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  The potential benefit of early postpartum contraception (the potential for decreased unwanted pregnancies, possible decrease in expulsion, and possible decrease in perforation) outweighs the potential risks of increase in expulsion and/or uterine perforation.  3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  OBJECTIVES ENDPOINTS JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINTS Primary   To determine if the risk of complete expulsion of EPP IUDs is non-inferior to interval PP IUDs   Diagnosis of IUD expulsion by [CONTACT_292569] 6 months postpartum. Expulsion defined as no IUD within the uterus by [CONTACT_292570] x-ray.     We propose that greater than or equal to a 6% difference in expulsion at 6 months postpartum between the two arms is clinically meaningful (6% non-inferiority margin). Secondary   To assess the proportion of participants utilizing the IUD at 6 months Transvaginal and speculum exam to confirm presence of the IUD at 6 months. From a public health perspective, the duration of IUD use is important for pregnancy prevention. To determine if the risk of partial expulsion of EPP IUDs is non-inferior to interval PP IUDs  Diagnosis of IUD expulsion by [CONTACT_292569] 6 months postpartum. Partial expulsion defined as IUD protruding from the external cervical os on speculum exam or any part of the IUD seen below the internal cervical os on transvaginal ultrasound. We propose that greater than or equal to a 6% difference in partial expulsion and perforation at 6 months postpartum between the two arms is clinically meaningful (6% non-inferiority margin). Tertiary/Exploratory    To assess the risk of perforation after EPP IUD compared to interval postpartum IUDs IUD not visible in uterus on transvaginal ultrasound, but visible on pelvic x-ray at 6 months.

 5 4 STUDY DESIGN   4.1 OVERALL DESIGN This is a multi-site, two-arm, non-blinded randomized controlled non-inferiority trial that includes 6 months of participation from enrollment to final follow-up.   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the EPP IUD expulsion rate at 6 months postpartum will be lower than the reported expulsion rate for IPP IUDs (24%) and non-inferior at a 6% margin to the expulsion rate for interval postpartum IUDs (previously reported at 3-5%). 4.[ADDRESS_356973] of care will serve as the control condition. We are using a 6% non-inferiority assuming a 4% expulsions rate in the interval group according to prior research. This difference is presumed to be clinically meaningful.  4.[ADDRESS_356974] visit at 6 months postpartum or the optional 12-month postpartum phone call.    5 STUDY POPULATION Postpartum women delivering a baby [CONTACT_292571] 4 study sites are eligible: University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego (UCSD); University of New Mexico (UNM); University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC),  and the Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD).

Potential participants who decline participation will be noted and counted as well. No identifying information will be collected from screen failures.     6 STUDY INTERVENTION  6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION Control: IUD placed 6-8 weeks postpartum (standard of care, interval placement) Intervention: IUD placed 2-4 weeks postpartum (early postpartum placement, EPP)  6.2 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Participants will be randomized to receiving EPP or Interval IUD placement by [CONTACT_187332] a computer-generated randomization scheme in alternating blocks of 4 and 6 stratified by [CONTACT_292572]. The group assignment will be in opaque sealed envelope that will be opened by [CONTACT_17033]. The participant will not be blinded to the group assignment.  7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  7.[ADDRESS_356976] with placement of an IUD, she will remain in the study under observation. Remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. Reasons for choosing another method of contraception will be documented and the participant followed for the study duration of 6-12 months.   7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY Participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study at any time. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_187319]. Medical care will be provided by [CONTACT_102]’s clinician as standard of care in the case of study withdrawal. Research participants who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study will not be replaced.   
Early vs. Interval Postpartum IUD Insertion  Protocol [ADDRESS_356977] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The sites will attempt to contact [CONTACT_292573]/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635], including [ADDRESS_356978] attempts should be documented in the participant’s study file.   8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  a. Admission/Enrollment Procedure All women in the 4 study health centers are educated about postpartum contraception during antenatal care. All postpartum women who do not receive an IPP IUD or tubal ligation will be asked if they are interested in the IUD for contraception while on the postpartum floor. If they plan to choose an IUD they will be asked for verbal assent to be pre-screened for the study. If a woman gives verbal consent to be pre-screened, a research assistant will administer the Pre-Participation Questionnaire/Eligibility Checklist. Women who meet inclusion criteria, meet no exclusionary criteria, and want to participate, will be formally consented to participate in the study. Signed informed consent forms will be collected. Subjects will be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_292563] a copy of the “Experimental Subject’s Bill of Rights,” and a HIPAA Authorization form for medical data to be released for research purposes. Enrolled participants will then be randomized to EPP or Interval PP IUD placement within 10 days of delivery. The Research Assistant (RA) will open the sealed envelope with the appropriate randomization envelope for the assigned participant number to unblind the participant to her assigned group. Participant numbers are assigned sequentially by [CONTACT_25733]. Participants will then be asked to complete the Baseline questionnaire.  For women who believe they want an IUD postpartum but are unsure whether or not they would like to be part of the study, study staff will provide them with our contact [CONTACT_3031], an informed consent form, a Subject’s Bill of Rights, and a HIPAA Authorization form for medical data to be released for research purposes. If they decide they are interested in participating while they are still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the RA will go to their postpartum floor within 24 hours and will pre-screen/enroll as outlined above. For interested women who are being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], staff will ask them to call us to discuss the study. Over the phone, the RA will ask for verbal consent to pre-screen for the study. If a woman gives verbal consent to be pre-screened, the RA will administer the Pre-Participation Questionnaire/Eligibility Checklist. For women who meet inclusion criteria, meet no exclusionary criteria, and want to participate, the RA will review the Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization forms and then ask the woman to sign the forms and bring the signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_292564]. The woman will be officially enrolled in the study at that point. The RA will then open the randomization envelope and schedule the first study visit at either [ADDRESS_356979] an IUD placement visit with their designated prenatal care provider between 14 and 28 days. Women will be scheduled to see a nurse midwife or physician based on their obstetrical history and prenatal care. IUDs will be placed by [CONTACT_102]’s usual prenatal provider or any provider that the patient would normally be referred to for IUD placement. Whether ultrasound guidance is used for placement will be at the discretion of the clinician. Participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_356980] for their time and participation after completing the IUD Insertion survey. If a patient in the interval group is seen by [CONTACT_292574] 2 weeks postpartum for other reasons an IUD will not be placed at that visit. Providers will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_356981] of care at the center. IUDs will be placed by [CONTACT_102]’s usual prenatal provider or any provider that the patient would normally be referred to for IUD placement. Whether ultrasound guidance is used for placement will be at the discretion of the clinician. Participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_356982] for their time and participation. Participants will be asked to complete either the insertion visit questionnaire or the string check questionnaire depending on their assignment group. Providers will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_356983] for their time completing a brief questionnaire for every patient seen at six weeks postpartum. D. Optional String Check Visit: Whether a follow-up string check visit is scheduled after six weeks will be at the discretion of the clinician according to standard practice of the clinic. String checks are not recommended by [CONTACT_292575]. If a string check is scheduled by [CONTACT_292576] (according to their personal practice or participant needs) then the participant will be asked to complete the string check questionnaire at that time.  e. Six Month Follow Up Visit All women will be scheduled for a 6-month follow up study visit to assess for IUD expulsion, perforation, pregnancy, IUD removals and acceptability. A study clinician will conduct a bimanual pelvic exam, a speculum exam, and a transvaginal ultrasound at this visit. Women will also be asked to complete the 6-month study questionnaire and will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_356984] for their time and participation. The clinician will attempt to stay blinded to the participant’s group assignment by [CONTACT_292577]. f. [ADDRESS_356985] (DSMB) to review adverse events if any of the following occur: • At the midpoint of enrollment  • If there is 1/3rd the expected enrollment at 6 months • More than four serious adverse events at any time deemed definitely, probably, or potentially related to the intervention   • Rate of any serious adverse events is greater than 1% (including blood transfusion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_292565], surgery related to IUD, death, IUD perforation, venous thromboembolism)   8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  The FDA definition of an Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).   8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)   An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.   • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
Early vs. Interval Postpartum IUD Insertion  Protocol 172101  
 10 • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.   [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.   • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  OR  • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (DE challenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. • Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. • Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. • Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). • Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370]. 
Early vs. Interval Postpartum IUD Insertion  Protocol 172101  
 11   [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21190] (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention. 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP  The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, by [CONTACT_187334], or upon review by a study monitor.  All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   All adverse events will be reported to all three IRBs in a timely fashion (UCSD, UNM, UIC, and NMCSD) regardless of where the adverse event occurred. The on-site PI [INVESTIGATOR_292566], in turn, report to their associated IRB. The management of information that is relevant to the protection of participants including adverse events, UPRs, protocol violations/deviations, interim results and protocol modifications will be the responsibility of each local PI [INVESTIGATOR_12758] ([CONTACT_292580]- UCSD, [CONTACT_292581] -UNM, [CONTACT_292582] – NMCSD, [CONTACT_292583] – UIC).  8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   All serious adverse events will be reported to all three IRBs in a timely fashion (UCSD, UNM UIC, and NMCSD) regardless of where the adverse event occurred. The on-site PI [INVESTIGATOR_292566], in turn, report to their associated IRB.

 12 8.3.7 REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS   The IRB at each site will provide guidance to PIs on informing participants regarding AEs and SAEs as needed.   8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.   8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING   The investigators will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to the lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include the following information:  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP;  • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported to the IRB within reasonable timing of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.     8.4.3 REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS   The IRB at each site will provide guidance to PIs on informing participants regarding UPs as needed.   9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES 
Early vs. Interval Postpartum IUD Insertion  Protocol 172101  
 13  • Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Complete expulsion of IUDs placed in the early postpartum is non-inferior to IUDs placed at the standard interval time, assuming a 6% non-inferiority margin.  • Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: o The proportion of participants utilizing the IUD at [ADDRESS_356986] interval time, assuming a 6% non-inferiority margin. o There will not be a clinically or statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants diagnosed with a pelvic infection. o Proportion of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing that they are satisfied with the IUD, and the timing of IUD placement, will be similar between groups.  9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  We hypothesize that EPP IUD expulsion will be non-inferior to interval insertion. We propose that greater than or equal to a 6% difference in expulsion at 6 months postpartum between the two arms is clinically meaningful (6% non-inferiority margin). Therefore, we estimate that 404 women will be needed [202 in each arm] to achieve an 80% power to detect a difference of 6% in expulsion at 6 months at a significance level of .05 (two-sided alpha), assuming a 15% loss to follow up and that 5% of IUDs would not be placed after randomization (due to patient preference or new medical contraindication or inability to place the IUDs) and assuming a 4% expulsion rate in the interval group. We estimate that enrolling 404 patients allows us to achieve an 80% power to detect a difference of 6% or more between groups with a 1-sided type 1 error of 0.25%.  9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  The following datasets will be utilized for analysis:  • Intention-to-Treat Analysis Dataset: All participants randomized with known outcomes at the 6 month follow up visit*. • Modified Intention-to-Treat Analysis Dataset: Participants who received an IUD within 6 months of delivery with known outcomes at the 6 month follow up visit*. • Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: Participants who received an IUD within the specified timeframe as designated by [CONTACT_292578] 6 month follow up visit (14-28 days in the early group and 42-56 days in the interval group)*.   *participants known to have an IUD outcome by [CONTACT_292579], pelvic examination, or a contact [CONTACT_8622] 240 days postpartum will be included.  9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S) 
Early vs. Interval Postpartum IUD Insertion  Protocol 172101  
 14  Our primary outcome, the proportion of women with complete IUD expulsion at 6 months after delivery in the two groups, will be compared in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) cohort using the Wald test. Women who change their mind about receiving the IUD after randomization, choose to receive the IUD after [ADDRESS_356987] of noninferiority. If the CI for the risk difference does not cross the prespecified 6% margin, noninferiority will be confirmed.  We will consider imputing missing data. However, if one group had no or few expulsion outcomes the model may not converge.  9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) Partial IUD expulsion and perforation will be analyzed with the same methods as the primary outcome. IUD discontinuation over the six-month study period will also be analyzed using survival analysis.  Data will be censored either (1) at the last date of contact [CONTACT_39646] a participant is lost to follow up or (2) time of IUD removal.  The Log-rank test will be used for an unadjusted comparison of the two survival functions. This will be presented graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves.   For other secondary outcomes, normally distributed, continuous variables will be compared using Student’s t-tests as appropriate. The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare other continuous variables that are not normally distributed. Proportions will be compared using chi-square tests.  For small cell sizes, Fisher’s exact test will be used as appropriate.  9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  AEs and SAEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_187335]. Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious treatment-emergent AEs will be presented in a table.  9.4.5 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  Baseline characteristics such as demographic information (age, education level, race, ethnicity and employment status) will be collected. At the time of enrollment, questions will also be asked about pregnancy history, past use of contraception, breastfeeding status and future fertility desires. Means and proportions of respondents in each of the two groups will be compared to assess for success of randomization.   9.4.6 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  Interim analyses will be carried out only when the conditions to convene a DSMB are met.

NUMBER OF SITES 1
RATIONALE Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or fat-related liver inflammation 
and scarring is projected to be the leading cause of cirrhosis in the 
[LOCATION_002] (U.S.) within the next few years. Women are at  
disproportionate risk for NASH, with approximately 15 million U.S.  
women affected. There is an urgent need to understand risk factors for 
NASH and its progression in women, and sex hormones may provide 
a missing link.
Our preliminary data support a detrimental role of androgens, or “male 
sex hormones” on fatty liver in women but no studies have evaluated 
whether androgens are associated with liver inflammation and/or 
scarring from fatty liver (aka NASH). To better understand the 
mechanism by [CONTACT_425650]/or 
metabolic co-factors that contribute to NASH, we are conducting a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_425597], spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], in women with NASH.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425598], like acne and hirsutism in women.
Though primarily a feasibility-focused study, we also aim to explore 
the pathways by [CONTACT_425651]-morbidities in women.

EFFICACY 
EVALUATIONSAs a pi[INVESTIGATOR_425606]. The primary goal of  
the study is rather to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of the study 
intervention and outcome measures in women with NASH while also 
exploring the mechanisms by [CONTACT_425652]. If the intervention is deemed to be feasible, and we detect a 
signal that spi[INVESTIGATOR_425607], then 
these data would be used to support a larger trial aimed at assessing 
the efficacy of spi[INVESTIGATOR_425608].
PRIMARY 
ENDPOINTSFeasibility endpoints:
●Adherence and acceptability of spi[INVESTIGATOR_425609]
●Adherence and acceptability of study outcome measures (MRI 
and optional EOT biopsy)
Determine the range of NASH on baseline biopsy to inform inclusion 
criteria for larger trials
SECONDARY  
ENDPOINTS●Biochemical endpoints: serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], HOMA-IR, liver enzymes
●Radiologic endpoints: liver fat quantity, visceral fat volume, liver 
inflammation, liver scarring
●Histologic endpoints: Change in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS)
●Expression of androgen receptors in the liver and circulating 
hormone levels.
SAFETY  
EVALUATIONSSpi[INVESTIGATOR_425610], commonly used medication to treat 
symptoms of high androgens in women therefore has a longstanding 
favorable side effect profile. Change in clinical safety labs and in 
person review of  potential side effects will be assessed at each study 
visit. Incidence of  adverse events will be collected.
Version #: 1.12 Version Date: [ADDRESS_537773] (DSMB) will review the progress of  
the study and perform an interim review of the safety data after the first  
[ADDRESS_537774] 95% 
confidence intervals for rates of agreement to participate, meeting 
eligibility criteria, completing follow-up will be calculated using the 
binomial distribution. Between-group analyses will be performed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle. We will attempt to collect 
complete follow-up data on every randomized participant, regardless of  
adherence to treatment. As randomization in this small sample may not 
result in the perfect balance of relevant biological variables (e.g., age or 
weight between groups) we will perform analyses adjusting for any of  
these that are substantially imbalanced. A planned interim analysis will 
be conducted after the first 10 participants (25%) have completed 3 
months of spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]. Interim results will provide useful preliminary 
safety and feasibility data.
Rationale for Number 
of SubjectsThe sample size of 30 was determined based on budget and feasibility 
within a 4-year grant timeline. The sample size is also reasonable for  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], and will allow us to estimate effects and feasibility with 
reasonable precision.
Version #: 1.12 Version Date: 9 Apr 2021 Page 12 of 351    BACKGROUND
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or fat-related liver inflammation and scarring is 
projected to become the leading cause of cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, and the leading 
indication for liver transplantation in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) within the next few years.(1,
2) Women are at disproportionate risk for NASH, with approximately 15 million U.S.  
women affected, and therapeutic options in NASH are limited. There is an urgent need to 
understand risk factors for NASH and its progression in women, and our preliminary data 
support a detrimental role of androgens, or “male sex hormones” on this process in 
women.(3)
To better understand the mechanism by [CONTACT_425653], we are 
conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_425611] a competitive inhibitor of the testosterone receptor 
known as spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425612] a favorable safety profile without the associated liver side effects of other androgen 
blocking medications. Moreover, it has been commonly prescribed for decades to treat  
symptoms of hyperandrogenism in women, such as hirsutism and acne. While this trial 
is a feasibility-focused study, we do aim to obtain preliminary data on pathways by 
[CONTACT_425654], including measures of NASH severity on biopsy and comprehensive 
serologic and imaging measures of metabolic co-morbidities.
1.1 Overview of Clinical Studies
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver 
disease, affecting one third of the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) population.(4) NAFLD 
encompasses a spectrum of pathology including isolated steatosis in approximately 
75% of individuals, with the remaining 25% having more serious fat-related liver 
inflammation and scarring, known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).(4) While 
isolated steatosis is more common in men, women have higher rates of NASH, with an 
estimated 15 million women in the U.S. affected.(5, 6) To prevent liver-related deaths 
due to NASH- associated cirrhosis and liver cancer- there is an urgent need to 
understand key risk factors for NASH in women and sex hormones may provide an 
important link.
Androgens, traditionally called “male sex hormones”, are produced in men and women.  
Data on androgens in women with NAFLD have largely focused on hyperandrogenic 
women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).(7) Indeed half of these women have 
imaging-confirmed steatosis and liver enzyme elevation.(8, 9) In our prior work in the 
prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort we 
showed that higher testosterone levels in pre-menopausal women were associated with 
subsequent risk of NAFLD in midlife. Importantly this association was present even 
among women without hyperandrogenism suggesting that androgens may play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in a broader spectrum of women that  
extends beyond the well-recognized subgroup of women with PCOS.(3) Although the

Testosterone has been further shown to directly regulate lipid metabolism within both 
visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes in women.(11) Androgens have been shown to 
regulate cholesterol clearance in the liver.(12) In mouse models of NASH, spi[INVESTIGATOR_425613]-IR and serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], key metabolic factors that  
contribute to NASH in humans.(13) Taken together, these data suggest a complex 
interplay of sex hormones within the liver and need for investigation into their role in 
NAFLD-related injury in women.
[ADDRESS_537776] a signal 
of these biologic effects, our data could be used to support a future, larger clinical trial 
aimed at evaluating the efficacy of an androgen-modulating therapy to treat NASH in 
women that incorporates the feasibility results identified in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment
The risks involved in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_425614], including understanding the role of androgens in 
the pathway of NASH and associated metabolic conditions, which may provide 
preliminary feasibility and biologic data to support larger trials to develop hormone 
targeted therapy to treat NASH in women.
The specific risks and methods for mitigating these are as follows:
1) Privacy breach: Eligible participants will be initially contact[CONTACT_425655] [INVESTIGATOR_425615]. If participants are interested and come for a screening visit, they 
will be sent the informed consent form prior to the visit to allow ample time to review.  
At the study visit, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425616] #: 1.12 Version Date: 9 Apr 2021 Page 14 of 35participant, describing the information we are seeking, procedures and indications, the 
voluntary nature of the study, the risks and benefits, and the ability to refuse or 
withdraw at any time without adverse consequences. The participant’s understanding 
of the study and its requirements will be confirmed, and any questions they have will 
be addressed prior to signing consent. A copy of the consent will be retained for the 
participant and the participant’s file, which is kept in a locked cabinet in a locked 
office.
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality for subjects in the study, despi[INVESTIGATOR_425617]. Maximal safeguards to maintain participants’ confidentiality 
will be employed, including: 1) unique study identification numbers on all forms and 
specimens 2) maintaining identifiers in a password-protected database, and 3) restricting 
access to the password protected database and locked study documents to essential 
study personnel.
2) Risks of frequent phlebotomy: The risks of routine blood drawing are rare but  
can include pain, bleeding, bruising at the site, anemia, dizziness, and very rarely 
an infection at the site. Only trained phlebotomists will perform blood draws. 
Phlebotomy risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_425656]. Should any adverse event occur, medical 
attention by a licensed physician will be provided immediately.
3) Risks of liver biopsy: About 20% of persons having a liver biopsy have some degree 
of pain over the liver that may last a few minutes to several hours. This rarely requires 
pain medication and usually resolves within 1-[ADDRESS_537777] people not needing to 
alter their daily activities or work schedule. A rare complication of liver biopsy is severe 
bleeding such that a blood transfusion or an operation is needed to stop the bleeding.  
These complications occur in less than one in 1,000 times. Very rarely (in less than one in 
10,000 reported cases), death has occurred from bleeding after a liver biopsy. Other rare 
complications of liver biopsy include infection, and puncture of the gallbladder, lung or 
kidney. These complications occur in less than one in 1,000 times.
On the day of the biopsy, women will receive baseline CBC and coagulation tests to 
ensure a platelet count > 50,000 and INR < 1.5. Women with values that do not reach 
these parameters will not undergo biopsy due to increased bleeding risks, although this is 
not anticipated to be the case as women with cirrhosis that might have such hematologic 
abnormalities are excluded at baseline. Women with renal failure will also have already 
been excluded. To reduce bleeding risk, patients are instructed to hold aspi[INVESTIGATOR_219213]- 
steroidal anti- inflammatory medications for [ADDRESS_537778] prior to discharge home to ensure < 10% 
decline in hematocrit. If greater hematocrit decline, the patient will undergo additional 
evaluation including ultrasound to ensure no significant post procedural bleeding. Patients 
are instructed to limit physical activity, including straining or lifting over [ADDRESS_537779]. If  
any injury occurs, medical attention by a licensed physician will be provided immediately.
4) Risks of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_425610], commonly prescribed blood
Version #: 1.12 Version Date: [ADDRESS_537780] is increased urination. Other side effects with a dose of 100mg 
daily in the absence of renal failure (an exclusion criterion for the current study) are <  
1%.
Potential side effects include breast tenderness, tiredness, headache, dizziness,  
lightheadedness, diarrhea, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], nausea, vomiting, fever, or confusion. There is 
a low risk of renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, dizziness and/or 
dehydration. To minimize any harm, all participants will have baseline renal and 
electrolytes obtained, an in-person study visit within one month of treatment initiation 
and then every [ADDRESS_537781] 
implicated spi[INVESTIGATOR_425618]. Urine pregnancy testing 
will be performed every 4 weeks in all pre- menopausal women. Urine pregnancy 
testing is not required for women who are not sexually active with men. As sex 
organ development begins between 6-8 weeks of gestational age, spi[INVESTIGATOR_425619] 4 of conception to avoid fetal risk if a 
woman were to become pregnant.

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Study Overview
This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (2:1), parallel group 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833]. [ADDRESS_537782] at Month 1, 3, 6, and at the follow up visit 
within 3 months of end of treatment (up to Month 9). Participants may opt to extend the 
Version #: 1.12 Version Date: [ADDRESS_537783] eligibility.  Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.
The following treatment regimens will be used:
●Experimental treatment – spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], 100 mg once daily
●Placebo or Comparator – one capsule, once daily
Total duration of study treatment will be 6 months or 12 months. Total duration of the 
study is expected to be ≤10 or ≤16 months (including up to 1 month for screening).
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION
5.1 Primary Endpoints
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_425624]. The primary goal is to  
establish if spi[INVESTIGATOR_425625], and if our study outcome 
measures are reasonable. The feasibility endpoints will include:
Rates (and reasons) for the following: a) % women that decline/women 
contact[CONTACT_425657] (i.e. need for a second liver biopsy, concern 
regarding randomization to placebo) b) % women enrolled/women screened 
(i.e. exclusion criteria too narrow), c) study dropout (i.e. medication side 
effects, too frequent study visits, and/or phlebotomy)
Describe the range of NASH histology seen on biopsy in consideration of  
designing a future clinical trial.
Radiologic endpoints: liver fat quantity, visceral fat volume, liver 
inflammation, liver scarring. These endpoints will be examined because 
they offer a non invasive way of  assessing visceral fat, another metabolic 
factor that may be altered by [CONTACT_425658], as well as other non 
invasive measures of assessing liver fat and inflammation that could 
potentially allow for avoidance of liver biopsy in future studies.
5.2 Secondary Endpoints
●Biochemical endpoints: serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], HOMA-IR, liver enzymes. These endpoints will 
be examined because existing data outside of NASH suggest that androgen blockade 
may alter these metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways are also keys players 
in the development and progression of NASH, therefore understanding the biologic 
mechanism of androgen blockade in women with NASH could be used to support the 
need for a larger clinical trial aimed at evaluating such hormone modulation to treat  
NASH in women.
●Histologic endpoints- Change in the NAFLD activity score (NAS), which measures 
different components of NASH on liver biopsy. If we detect a signal that  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_425626], these data could also help support need 
for larger trial evaluating efficacy of androgen modulating therapy for treatment of  
NASH in women.
●Expression of androgen receptors in the liver and circulating hormone levels. It is not 
known whether spi[INVESTIGATOR_425627], 
and this research question can help us to understand the mechanism of  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_425628]. Likewise, data are conflicting on whether 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_425629], and this pathway will be studied 
by [CONTACT_425659].
Version #: 1.12 Version Date: 9 Apr 2021 Page 17 of 355.3 Safety Evaluations
●In-person visits will be conducted at baseline, at one month (given highest risk of  
adverse events in first month of drug exposure) and every [ADDRESS_537784] implicated spi[INVESTIGATOR_425630]. Pregnancy testing will performed every month to ensure that if a participant  
were to become pregnant, spi[INVESTIGATOR_425631] 4 weeks of  
conception. This will ensure no fetal risks as human sex organ development begins 
between 6-8 gestational weeks.
●There will be continuous safety surveillance of participants through the reporting of  
incidence of adverse events (AEs). AEs will be recorded in a systematic manner at  
every study visit and when otherwise volunteered by [CONTACT_2299].

Version #: 1.12 Version Date: 9 Apr 2021 Page 25 of 3511 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND 
DOCUMENTATION
11.1 Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient-administered pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that  
investigational product. An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.
The Investigator or research assistant will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the 
occurrence of AEs during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s 
source documents. Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF. Adverse events  
will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, 
treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.
11.1.1 AE Severity
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown i n Table 1 below should be used to grade severity. It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not 
necessarily serious.
Table 1. AE Severity Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of  
the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as 
it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that  
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
11.1.2 AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.
Table 2. AE Relationship to Study Drug
Version #: 1.12 Version Date: 9 Apr 2021 Page 26 of 35Relationship  
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_425667].
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of  
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of  
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that  
suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of  
other factors.
Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the 
study drug.
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:
●Death
●a life-threatening adverse experience
●inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
●a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
●a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to  
prevent one of the outcomes listed.
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per  
UCSF HRPP Guidelines. The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been 
completed.
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site 
investigator will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC.
11.[ADDRESS_537797] Adjustment & Interruption Criteria
Dosage for investigational product should be held constant throughout the course of the 
study. In the event that the subject experiences adverse experiences that the Investigator 
suspects are related to the investigational product, a dosage adjustment or interruption of  
investigational product may be implemented. Subjects may also be permanently 
discontinued from investigational product by [CONTACT_425668] #: 1.12 Version Date: 9 Apr 2021 Page 27 of 35concerns (see section 12.3).
Subjects who are temporarily discontinued from investigational product are expected 
to continue in the study and should follow the regular visit schedule for the duration 
of the study. Rechallenge with investigational product may be initiated at the 
Investigator’s discretion upon discussion with the medical monitor. Additional safety  
monitoring may be initiated.

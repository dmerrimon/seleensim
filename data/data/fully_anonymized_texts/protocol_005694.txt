Brief Summary of Research:   
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the skin and joints that occurs in diverse 
ethnic groups worldwide.  There  is paucity of data on the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_730926] -skinned 
individuals. Unique issues in skin of color (SOC)  populations, including increased risk of 
dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_510890]), make studies dedicated to darker skin types 
essential for treatment of psoriasis in these populations . 
This will be a single -center, randomized, double -blinded, vehicle -controlled  clinical study to determine 
the efficacy of Enstilar® foam, a combination of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 
0.005%/0.064% , in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris  in SOC (FST IV -VI).  A total of 25  subjects (ages 
18+, male and female, BSA ≥2%, PASI Score ≥ 2, IGA mod 2011 score ≥ 2) are expected to  complete 
this study, which will run for a total of up to 12  weeks .  
The study consists of  three  periods: Screening (from 0  to 4 weeks); Double -blind, vehicle -controlled  
treatment period ( 4 weeks) , and open -label treatment period  (4 weeks) . During the second period (double -
blind, vehicle -controlled), a total of 20 subjec ts will be randomized to Enstilar ® and a total of 5 subjects 
will be randomized to vehicle. Those who meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are enrolled in 
the study will receive study drug (either Enstilar® or vehicle)  for the entire treatment  period.

Revised 9/2/14  2) Background  
 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the skin and joints. This condition occurs 
in different ethnic groups worldwide with varying prevalence. In the [LOCATION_002], the Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey estimated t he prevalence of psoriasis to be 3.2% in adults; a significant 
number of affected were of darker phototypes, including African Americans (1.9%) and Hispanics 
(1.6%).1,[ADDRESS_998459] undiagnosed psoriasis than whites (in part due to barriers to 
care and decreased health care utilization in thes e groups) .3,[ADDRESS_998460] in skin of color, and inflammation that typi[INVESTIGATOR_730927].8 The 
resolution of psoriasis lesions in darker skin types is associated with a higher rate of dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371] 
(both hyper - and hypo -pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]), which may be more bothersome to patients than the psoriasis 
itself.7,[ADDRESS_998461] and 
worse QOL in non -whites with psoriasis compared to whites.5,8,9,10 Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI)  scores  are consistently lower in blacks and Hispanics compared to whites, even when controlling 
for body surface area affected and severity of disease.[ADDRESS_998462] -inflammatory pi[INVESTIGATOR_730928] , make studies dedicated to 
darker skin types essential for treatment of psoriasis in these populations .  
 
Combination of calcipotriene a nd betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0. 005%/0.064%  aerosol foam (Enstilar®) 
has been shown to be effective in the treatment of  mild or greater  plaque psoriasis when used once daily 
for 4 weeks.13,14,15 Use of Enstilar ® has also been associated with significant impr ovement in health -
related quality of life.16 Nonetheless, pi[INVESTIGATOR_730929] ®  included a predominately 
white population; 87.1% of subjects in three pooled US phase II an d III pi[INVESTIGATOR_730930].17 Given 
the small number of no n-white subjects, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between diff erent 
race/ethnicity subgroups.17

psoriasis in patients with skin of color (Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IV -VI). This phase  will last 4 weeks 
(baseline to week 4). Subjects will be randomized in a 4:1ratio to Enstilar® or placebo, respectively. The 
study product will be applied once daily for 4 weeks.  
Phase 3 - Open-label and maintenance phase. Subjects who were randomized to  placebo during 
phase 2 will receive Enstilar daily x 4 weeks. Subjects who were randomized to Enstilar during 
phase 2 will switch to Enstilar twice weekly x 4 weeks as maintenance treatment.  
Prior to the start of the study, potential subjects will be give n an IRB -approved Informed Consent 
Document (ICD) containing a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) disclosure 
agreement to read, understand, and sign. After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for 
study elig ibility  at the Screening visit . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a medically qualified designee must review this 
information (i.e. medical history, concomitant medication, and eligibility review) for each subject to 
confirm their eligibility before enrollment.  
 
A total of 25  subjects w ho meet eligibility criteria will undergo Baseline / Day [ADDRESS_998468] any 
adverse events (AEs) or changes to health/concomitant medications that may have occurred since the

The procedures and assessment performed during this study are described in detail below:  
 
Informed Consent: Prior to the start of the study, potential subjects will b e given an IRB -
approved Informed Consent Document (ICD) containing a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) disclosure agreement to read, understand, and sign. All questions 
about the study should be answered to the satisfaction of the  candidate subject. They will have all 
of their study -related questions answered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], and if they agree to participate, the 
subject will sign the ICD . The subjects will retain one original copy and one photo copy will be 
kept in the study file. The subjects who sign an ICD will be assigned a screening number.  
 
Demographics: Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their demographics  at 
the screening visit . This will include date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity.  
 
Eligibili ty Assessment (Inclusion/Exclusion): After providing informed consent, subjects will be 
assessed for study elig ibility at the Screening visit , which includes limited physical examination,  
skin type assessment, vital signs, height and weight,  investigator s everity  ratings  (PASI, PGA, 
PSSI and PScIGA if applicable) , review of medical history and concomitant medications as well 
as prior medications/treatments, and urine pregnancy test (if applicable). These assessments will 
be described below. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a medi cally qualified designee must review this information (i.e. 
medical history, concomitant medication, and eligibility review) for each subject to confirm their 
eligibility before enrollment.  Eligibility will be assessed at Screening and Baseline visits.  
 
Medical History  and Concomitant Medications : At the screening visit, subjects will be asked 
about current medical conditions or history of any medical conditions. Subjects will also be asked 
about current medication use and use of medications for 1 month pri or to screening.  Concomitant 
medications will be reviewed and recorded at every scheduled visit.  
 
Psoriasis  Treatment History : At the screening  visit, s ubjects wi ll be asked about their current 
and all past treatments for psoriasis, including over -the-coun ter and prescription therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
 
Vital Signs:  Vital signs will be assessed at the screening visit . Whether action needs to be taken 
regarding abnormal vital signs (as defined below) will be at the investigator’s discretion. After the

Revised 9/2/[ADDRESS_998470] five minutes with back supported and both feet on the ground, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) will be measured using an appropriately sized cuff. 
Pulse will also be measured using either an automated machine or manually. Normal Blood 
pressure will be defined as systolic 90 to <120mmHg and diastolic 60 to <80mm Hg. Notable 
blood pressure will be hypertension (systolic ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic ≥100 mmHg). A 
normal pulse rate will be defined as 60 to 100 beats per minute. Notable pulse rates will be defined 
as bradycardia (<50b pm) and tachycardia (>100bpm).  
 
Height and Weight:  Height and weight will be measured by a de signat ed site individual at the 
screening visit . 
 
Physical examination:  Physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_093], sub -
investigator, or other qualified individuals  at screening . This will include examination of the heart, 
lungs, abdomen, e xtremities, and skin, as well as any additional body systems as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093].   
 
Photography:  Standardized photographs will be taken of the entire body (front and back) . The 
photograph will be taken  with the patient standing up in fr ont of a neutral background; 
photographs will be taken at a standardized distance with the patient facing towards and away 
from the camera  such that the entire body included in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] . Photographs will be taken at 
baseline and weeks 4 and 8.  
 
Body Sur face Area (BSA): The total body involvement of psoriasis will be recorded as a 
percentage of the totally BSA at screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 4, and 8.  
 
 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (I GA mod 2011): The IGA mod 2011 is a standardized rating 
scale f or assessment of overall psoriatic disease severity.  IGA mod 2011 (entire body including 
scalp) will be performed by [CONTACT_730953], 
baseline, and weeks 2, 4, and 8. If the subject has scalp involvement at the baseline visit, Scalp 
IGA (ScIGA)  will be performed.   For ScIGA, the IGA mod 2011 scale will be used to evaluate the 
severity of psoriasis on the scalp only.

[ADDRESS_998471] clear  Normal to pi[INVESTIGATOR_108997]; no thickening; no to minimal  
focal scaling  
2 Mild  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_22767]; just detectable to mild thickening;

3 Moderate  Dull bright red, clearly distinguishable erythema; clearly  
distinguishable to moderate thickening; moderate scaling  
4 Severe  Bright to deep dark red coloration; severe thickening with hard  
edges; severe / coarse scaling covering almo st all or all lesions  
 
 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (and Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (P SSI) if 
applicable)  
 
The investigator or trained qualified site staff will complete the PASI (and PSSI assessment) at 
screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 4, and 8.  
When calculating the PASI score, four separate body regions are evaluated: the head (including 
face, scalp, and neck), upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin area), and lower extremities 
(including the buttocks). These body regions corr espond to 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total 
body surface area (BSA), respectively. Therefore, the score for each body region will be 
multiplied by [CONTACT_730954] (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4) when 
calculating the PASI score.  
Three different parameters will be evaluated: erythema (E), desquamation (D), and induration (I). 
These will be gra ded on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). Desquamation refers to the scaling 
of a lesion. Induration refers to the thickening and plaque elevation.  
 
PASI is calculated based on the following formula:  
PASI = 0.1(E H+IH+DH)AH + 0.2(E U+IU+DU)AU + 0.3(E T+IT+DT)AT + 0.4(E L+IL+DL)AL

• Urticaria 
• Exacerbation of psoriasi s 
 
Observed uncommon adverse reactions (based on post -marketing data):  
• Atrophy of thin skin  
• Telangiectasia of the skin  
• Dryness of the skin  
• Perioral dermatitis  
• Secondary infections of the skin  
• Miliaria 
 
Other warnings:  
• Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria – Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria have been 
observed with the use of Enstilar ® foam. If either of these conditions develop, Enstilar ® 
should be discontinued until calcium levels normalize in the blood and/or urine.  
• Endocrine system effects – The systemic abs orption of topi[INVESTIGATOR_730940] -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may result 
in clinical glucocorticoid insufficiency either during treatment or upon withdrawal of the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560]. The risk of  HPA axis suppression is higher with use of high -potency 
steroids, treatment of a large surface area, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, 
altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.  
• Allergic contact [CONTACT_8748] – Topi[INVESTIGATOR_730941].  
• Risk of ultraviolet light exposure  – patients would have using Enstilar ® foam should 
avoid excessive exposure to natural and artificial sunlight (i.e. tanning booths, sun l amps) 
• Flammability  – The propellants in Enstilar ® foam are flammable. Subjects should avoid 
smoking, flames, and fire during and immediately following Enstilar ® application.  
 
 
 
Enstilar ® foam is designated as pregnancy category C, meaning that there are  no adequate and well 
controlled studies in pregnant women. Studies of calcipotriene administered orally in rats and rabbits 
have demonstrated increased maternal and fetal toxicity at doses above 144 mcg/m2/day (rabbits) and 
skeletal abnormalities at dosag es above 432 mcg/m2/day in rabbits and 324 mcg/m2 /day in rats.

When administered systemically, corticosteroids have been shown to enter hum an milk and can have 
negative effects on infant health. Possible risks of systemic corticosteroids on infants include growth 
suppression and altered production of endogenous steroids. It is not known whether topi[INVESTIGATOR_730945]/or cort icosteroids results in sufficient systemic absorption to produce 
detectable quantities of these medications in human milk. Enstilar ®, therefore, should not be used by

3) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
 
If a subject e xperiences a research injury, Mount Sinai St. Luke’s will provide or arrange for 
medical treatment at no cost. If the subject chooses to see their own personal doctor we will not 
offer to pay for the expenses. A research injury is any physical injury or il lness caused by 
[CONTACT_9286]. If a subject is injured by a medical treatment or procedure that would 
have been received even if the subject weren't in the study; that is not a research injury.  Payment 
for things such as lost wages, expenses other than medical care, or pain and suffering is not 
offered. To help avoid injury, it is very important to follow all study directions.  
 
Please be aware that some insurance plans may not pay for research -related injuries.  Subjects 
should contact [CONTACT_2030] i nsurance company for more information.  
 
 
4) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
The potential benefits to participating subjects are improvement of their psoriasis . 
 
5) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
 
Only subjects who have given us permissio n to contact [CONTACT_285921]. 
All conversations with subjects and potential subjects will be conducted in a private 
examination room with the subject. Subjects’ privacy will be protected by [CONTACT_730956] -related procedures in a pr ivate examination room. Family members will be allowed 
to remain in the room only if the subject allows this. No information regarding the 
subject’s disease, treatment or the fact that he/she is involved in a study will be conveyed. 
 Protocol Name:  A double -blinded,  placebo -controlled study to evaluate the

Revised 9/2/[ADDRESS_998477] personal data.   
The ICD (containing the HIPAA disclosure agreement) must be agreed to by [CONTACT_730957], local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and 
objectives of the trial, possible risks associated with participation. The investigator, or a train ed 
person designated by [CONTACT_093], will obtain written informed consent on two copi[INVESTIGATOR_55290] -specific activity is performed.  The subject will retain one copy, and 
one will be kept in the study file. The ICD used in this trial, and any changes made during the 
course of the trial, must be prospectively approved by [CONTACT_55308].  
 
6) Economic Impact on Subjects  
Leo Pharma , the manufacturer of the study drug , will provide the study drug. Leo Pharma also 
provided a grant toward  study -related tests and procedures. While in the study, the subject will 
still need to get regular medical care. The subject will still have to pay for the costs of regular 
medical care that is not a part of this study.  
 
Taking part i n this research study may lead to add ed costs to the subject. If the  physical 
examinations reveal information about his/her health, additional tests, treatments and doctors’  
appointments may be required which could present additional costs to him/her or hi s/her insurance 
company.  
 
7) Payments to Subjects  
Subjects will be compensa ted upon 
completion of the study. Subjects who complete only the screening visit will not be eligible 
for compensation. If the subjec t withdraws or is withdrawn before completing the study, 
he/she will receive an amount of money for the visits which have been completed.  They 
will not have to submit receipts to receive this reimbursement. This payment will come in 
the form of a check at  the end of the subject’s participation in the study.

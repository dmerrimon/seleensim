VERSION DATE  
November 30, 202 1 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of the stu dy an d the hypoth esis being tested.  
1.Demonstrate the ability to introduce and disseminate shared decision -making (SDM)
programs  to patients within the Partners Healthcare System .  We will measure the
volume and type of programs  that are “prescribed” to pa tients.
2.Assess  “prescribing” utilization, trends and patterns by  [CONTACT_530848],
and identify and understand the barriers and problems faced by [CONTACT_530849] s pecialty care.
Identification and understanding of the barriers will be gained through clinician
interviews.
3.Gain feedback from the patients about: their experiences , perceptions and satisfaction
with receiving SDM programs ; the effect the program  has on their decis ion preference;
what they think about the available options; and how they feel about making a decision.
This feedback will be obtained through  written  and online  surveys , and telephone
interviews.
4.Surgery shared decision making survey: Integ rate new mea sures to assess the quality
of elective surgical decisions across the Partners Healthcare network for patients with
knee and hip osteoarthritis, herniated disc and spi[INVESTIGATOR_530825] ,
and reporting that data back to clinicians and administrators, has the potential to make
a positive impact on the value of care provided to patients.
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Provide a brief parag raph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
Multiple studies assessing the value of decision aids, such as the shared decision -making 
programs  produced by [CONTACT_530850] , have found that thes e 
tools reduce uncertainty and decisional conflict, and increase knowledge and patient’s desire 
to participate in decision -making, without increasing anxiety.  Decision aids have been 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689387] of these tools and processes on the care experience from the 
patient and provider perspectives and on the actual care that patients receive.  
 
RESEAR CH DE SIGN AND MET HODS  
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gen der, medical cond ition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
The dissemination of the programs  will occur as part of rou tine care and wil l vary depending 
on the provider group and program. They may be sent in advance of the visit, or prescribed 
after the visit. The programs may also be put online and accessed by [CONTACT_23270] a 
password. One common way the programs are dist ributed is outlin ed as follows:  
1. Patient has visit with primary care clinician.  
2. Clinician determines patient is clinically eligible for one of the SDM programs and 
discusses it with the patient.  
3. Clinician “prescribes” program  through the electronic medical record, and gives  patient 
the one -page description of the program that automatically prints when the program is 
ordered.  The “prescription” function in the electronic medical record triggers an email 
message with the order information to be sent to the Bl um Pa tient and Fa mily Learning 
Center.   
4. The program  is sent (or given, in the case of the “pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up” option) to the patient with a 
questionnaire  and pre -paid, addressed envelope . The goal of the questionnaire is to 
assess the patient’s intentions with rega rd to the topic a nd the patient’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_530826] -making prior to viewing the decision aid. After viewing the decision 
aid, patients will also be asked a series of general knowledge questions about the 
target topic and a few questions evaluat ing the content a nd comprehensiveness of the 
decision aid itself.   
5. Some patients will receive a follow -up “post -visit” survey in the mail and a pre -paid 
addressed envelope se veral months after receiving a decision aid. The purpose of this 
questionnaire is to learn the exte nt to which viewing decision aids impacts patients’ 
conversations with their providers and ultimately their treatment decisions.   
 
 
It is difficult to anticipate the total number of patients who will receive a SDM program  
because the “pre scription” of the  program is incorporated into routine clinical care, similar 
to clinicians giving a pamphlet or other written patient education materials to their patients.  
We anticipa te the target enrollment of patient s to be 80,000 . Patients who are el igible are:  
 Adult patients in  the Partners Healthcare System  primary or specialty care practices.  
 Patients,  for whom a SDM program  is clinically appropriate, based on the clinical 
judgment of the clinician.  This includes patients with the following healt h 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     3  problems/concer ns: general healthcare options,  low back pain (chronic, acute, spi[INVESTIGATOR_16071], and herniated disc), osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, coronary artery /heart  
disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, uterine fibroid s, 
symptoms of me nopause, obesity, depression, ovarian cancer screening, prostate 
cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, advance directives, heart failure, 
diabetes,  breast cancer treatment, prostate cancer treatment,  insomnia, carotid artery 
disease, and chronic p ain.   
 
Patient decision aids are all available in English and Spanish except for 4 programs that are 
only available in English : Prediabetes: Choices you can make to prevent diabetes, 
Pregnancy: Birth Options if your baby [CONTACT_530851] g, and Pregnancy:  Your birth options 
after cesarean , Prostate Cancer: Is radiation or surgery right for you . 
 
The staff maintain a  program  log as part of their standard operating procedures so they can 
keep track of the programs that are sent to patients .  Routine follow -up with patients who  
received a program  is important to ensure proper “close the loop” process . Follow -up may 
include  a phone call , post -card or email reminder to patients . Follow -up will occur within [ADDRESS_689388] -viewing 
questions.     
 
Questionnaires will include solely, a coded unique numeric identifier for each patient. 
Therefore, all completed questionnaires will be stripped of any personal i dentifiers and/or  
HIPAA related information. Only MGH approved study staff for this protocol will have access 
to the information crosswalk needed to link this unique identifier with confidential personal 
information. The completed , coded  questionnaires  will be returned, wh ere study staff will 
enter the de-indentified  data into a secured online data warehouse.  The online surveys will 
be entered directly into the data warehouse. The operating process es are as follows:  
 
 Study staff provides  questionnaires,  which are then assig ned a systematic unique 7-
digit study ID.   
 Study staff provide s a tracking  log for each title  that is “prescribed .”  
 Staff will record in a secured, restricted -access tracking  log the primary care practice 
name (of the prescribing clinici an); patient’s na me, address, and phone number ; 
program topic; date sent ; and date returned.   
 Once questionnaires have been returned, a stud y staff will enter the coded  de-
identified  data into a secured online data warehouse separate from the information 
crosswalk with no  ability to link the data back to patient’s personal and HIPAA related 
information .  
 
The provider s’ perspective s will also be collected, periodically, through questionnaire s or 
individual interviews .  An email invitation  will be sent  to all eligible Partn ers Healthcare 
System  primary care physicians, specialists, nurses and other clinic staff involved in a 
patient’s care to complete  either  the questionnaire  or participate in an interview. The 
providers and staff will be able to choose to c omple te the quest ionnaire online or by [CONTACT_29160]. 
A reminder email will be sent to those who haven’t completed the questionnaire within a 2-
week timeframe.  Study staff will work individually with those interested in the interviews, at 
the time  of a specific pr oject.  
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689389] indicated their consent to be contact[CONTACT_530852] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_530827]: sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_380093], depressio n, and anxiety. 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_530853] a survey study. If they agree to participate they will be asked to review 
some additional patient educational materials  either online or  on paper. After the patient 
reviews the materials, they will be asked to complete and answer the questions via phone 
with study staff at a scheduled time. Consent will be implied by [CONTACT_530854]. If a patient would like to complete the questionnaire via paper, an 
information sheet, questionnaire, and return -envelope will be sent to the patient. The 
project goal is to have approximately [ADDRESS_689390] primary care physicians  
(PCP)  identify patients who they believe would good candidates to  participate in the 
interviews. The PCP  will provide the patient  with the information sheet and if the patient  is 
interested, the PCP will provide the research staff contact [CONTACT_530855] . Subjects  will be contact[CONTACT_530856] i n an interview. If they agree t o participate the y will be 
asked whether they prefer to conduct the interv iew in -person or via telephone and study 
staff will schedule a mutually convenient time. Consent will be implied by [CONTACT_530857]. A cover letter and an information  sheet will be se nt by [CONTACT_245255] (if 
subjects provide verbal consent to use personal email) for those interested in an interview.  
The project goal is to have approximately [ADDRESS_689391]. The interviews will 
be conducted in-person or remotely using a videoconference approved by [CONTACT_530858] 
(such as Hea lthcare Secu re Zoom or Enterp rise Zoom) . Each interview using the 
videoconference  will require a waiting room and secure password for that sp ecific meeting.  
During the interview, the moderator and research subject (physician or patient) will review 
all the steps in th e process. We wil l audiotape the interviews and a research coordinator will 
be present during the interview to take notes on the interaction. The interviews will take 
place at a location on the MGH campus convenient to the participant  or via th e approved 
videoconference pl atform . The interviews will follow structured gui des. 
 
Patien ts will be recruited from the database of patients who have received decision aids.  For 
patients who have given consent to be re -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], study staff will telephone the patient  
and invite them to participate in the interview . For patients who  were not as ked about being 
recontact[CONTACT_7678], w e will send the patient  an invitation  letter letting them know 
about the study opportunity and how to opt -out if they do not want  to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  We will 
also include the study information sheet  with the ma iling. If the person does not opt -out, 
study staff will call the patient  and ask if she/he is interested in participating. If they agree 
to participate, study staff will schedule  a remote intervi ew using a secure  videoconference  
at a mutually convenient time.  The patient will be asked to consent to participating in a 
secure videoconference  and will be asked permission for the researcher to audiotape th e 
call. Consent wil l be implied by [CONTACT_530859]. A letter indicating the date and 
time of the interview will be sent by [CONTACT_65056] (if the subjects provide verbal consent to 
use personal email). We will include English -speaking men and women  aged [ADDRESS_689392].  If not, they will not be eligible.  
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689393]. We will recruit physicians acro ss a range  of practices and  
specialties.  
 
Patients who received a  specialty  referral  where their physician provisionally ordered a 
decision aid  will also be contact[CONTACT_530860] . Their feedback on the referral process will 
be collected through individual  interview s or surveys. A c over letter and information sheet 
describing the study will be mailed to the patients so that they may choose to participate or 
not. A reminder phone  call will be placed for those who haven’t completed the questionnaire 
within a 2-week tim eframe. The patients’ demographic information will be collected through 
an RPDR data collection . 
 
The patients’ feedback will also be collected, periodically, through individual or group 
interviews.  An email or mailed invitation to participate i n intervie ws will be sent t o a sample 
of patients who indicated their consent to be re -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. The patients will be able to 
choose to participate in an individual or group interview. Participants will receive $ 20 for 
participation in the  45-minute  individual interview, $40 for th e 90-minute individual 
interview,  and $ [ADDRESS_689394]  not received a decision ai d, the 
patien ts’ medical records  will be pulled based on the relevant ICD-9, ICD-10, or procedure 
(CPT) codes associated with  a visit within the study timeframe.  
 
In collaboration with Partners Center for Population Health, patients acros s PHS who have a 
surgical procedure for one of the 4 identified clinical diagnoses: hip osteoarthritis, knee 
osteoarthritis, lumbar herniated disc and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_530828], will be surveyed about 
shared decision making . The shared decision maki ng surveys  will be integrat ed into the 
routine patient reported outcomes measurement (PROMS) assessments that are in current 
clinical practice at these sites for these clinical situations. The PROMs platform does not 
capture  or include the shared decision making sur vey for all surge ons and all patients  and; 
as a result, study staff will track all potentially eligible patients and will mail the survey to a 
randomly selected sample of patients who are eligible , but who did not complete the 
questions as part o f the PROM s platform.  Patients who complete the mailed survey will be 
asked if they are interested in participating in a short phone interview  to discuss their 
survey responses. The patient can indicate their interest in the interview on the survey . For 
patients who  completed the sh ared decision making items via the PROMS system, a n 
invitation letter will be sent to the patient who completed the PROMs questionnaire to invite 
them to participate in a phone interview .  
 
A report  of surgical pa tients will be c reated by [CONTACT_530861]. The  report will identify adults across the four hospi[INVESTIGATOR_530829], or who have recently had , one of the surgical procedures for the targeted diagnoses. , 
We will supp lement the eCa re report with a query from the Research Patient Data Registry 
(RPDR ) to identify and confirm eligible patients using their MRNs (from eCar e report) or 
using relevant ICD -[ADDRESS_689395] about surgeon visits, diagnoses and 
treatments related to the index diagnosis (hip or knee osteoarthritis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_530830]), imaging reports (X -Ray and MRI), pathology reports (post -surgical bone 
patho logy), clinical a nd patient features (e.g. BMI, disease severity), patient demographics 
and contact [CONTACT_3031] (to support mailing survey as needed). Specific diagnoses that may 
indicate that the procedure is not elective , or it’s for a differen t diagnosi s, will also be 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689396] queries to  help identify patients who should be 
excluded (e.g. to identify patients who had a hip replacement to treat a hip fracture as 
opposed to hip osteoarthritis) as outlined in Table 1. The list of patients genera ted by [CONTACT_530862]. For patients who are not captured by 
[CONTACT_530863] (e.g., patient -reported outcomes data), a 
limited review of that patient’s electronic medical record will be conducted, only covering 
the information listed above.  These data will help s tudy s taff identify a cohort of surgical 
patients who are po tentially eligible for the shared decision making survey. Table [ADDRESS_689397] reports. This limited review will be used to establish validity of the approach 
(i.e., eCare report and RPDR query) that we are using to identify elective surgical patient s 
for thes e four clinical a reas. 
 
Based on estimates from RPDR and from analysts at Center for Population Health, we 
anticipate that 5,[ADDRESS_689398] que ries. About 40% will have 
completed a PROMs assessment pre -operatively and 38% will have completed a PROMs 
assessment post -operatively. Our target is to receive 1,[ADDRESS_689399] a s ample of eligible  patients to receive 
a mailed survey in order to meet the minimum targets.  
 
Cancer Screening Study 2020 :  
A subset of patients who received decision aids on: breast cancer screening, colorectal 
cancer screening, prostate cancer screening,  or lung cancer s creening will be eligible for this 
study. The goal of the study is to understand the decision making process between patients 
and providers related to cancer screening tests. The research study will be a one -time 
survey asking pa tients to reflect on conver sations with their providers regarding the 
decision to screen for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, or lung cancer in 
the last 2 years. Our target is to receive 400 completed surveys across all 4 clinical 
context s. Eligible patients (see T able 2) will be identified and study staff will use RPDR 
queries to capture contact [CONTACT_530864] . A chart review wil l be 
condu cted to collect i nformation related to cancer screening tests and visit notes related to 
cancer screening tests . This project is funded by [CONTACT_522145] (AHRQ).   
 
Path to Lifestyle Change : Patient s who are eligibl e for the research study wi ll be part icipants in 
the Path to Lifestyle Change  program offered through the MGH Diabetes Center. As part of the 
Path to Lifestyle Change  program, the Healthwise® Decision Aid entitled “Pre -Diabetes:  Which 
Treatment Should I U se to Prev ent Type 2 Diabet es?” will be sent  to participants at enrollment 
in the clinical program. The goal of this research study is to survey patients using a secure

18 months  and 24 months) to colle ct patient -reported outcomes related to treatment 
decisions. The Path to Lifestyle Change  program is planning to recruit up to 200 participants. 
Once a patient has been enrolled in the Path to Lifestyle Change  clinical progr am, he/s he will  be 
asked permiss ion to use their email to send them a fact sheet and recruitment  letter  about a 
research  project . The clinician from the MGH Diabetes Center who enrolls the patient in the 
Path to Lifestyle Change  program will obtain permiss ion to send the information by e mail. For 
patients who do not provide their email, they will not be sent information about the study.

study endpoints.
 
See above section for study procedures.   
 
Study endpoints include:  1) demonstration of the ability to introduce and disseminate SDM 
programs  to patients, 2) a ssessment  and un derstanding  of “prescribing” utilization, trends 
and patterns by [CONTACT_530848], 3) feedback from patients about receiving

For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from stand ard care.  
Provi de information o n available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
No diagnosis or treatments will be offered or administered as part of this study. There is no 
medical intervention as part of this study. The standard  of care is that  clinicians  discuss 
appropriate treatment options, including their benefits and risks with each patient.  The standard 
of care at these sites is also to engage patients in shared decision making and to assess patient -
reported outcomes period ically to measur e the quality of  care.

For the ca ncer screening d ecision making surveys, participants will be informed that they 
may refuse to answer any question. It will also be emphasized that whether participants 
complete the survey or not, it will not impact the medical care that the y receive. 
Participants who wish  to complete the survey electronically will be provided with a link to 
the secure Mass General Brigham  REDCap survey platform.  Participants may also request 
the REDCAP survey link be sen t to them via email.  If email is prefe rred, st aff will discuss 
privacy  and obtain permission to send the survey via email without send secure (and confirm 
address). Study staff will read the following statement to patients, "The Mass General Brigham  
standard is to send email securely. This req uires yo u to initially set up an d activate an account 
with a password. You can then use the password to access secure emails sent to you from 
Mass General Brigham .  If you pre fer, we can send you “unencrypted” email that is not secure 
and could result in t he unaut horize d use or disclosur e of your information. If you want to receive

improvemen t and/or una cceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo c ontrol groups.
  
As stated above, there are no known risks to participating individual s in thi s projec t.  The 
clinicia ns discuss w ith their patients, who are clinically eligible for one of the SDM programs, 
whether or not such a decision aid is something t hey are interested in receiving and 
watching.  This is done in the same manner in whic h other patient educational info rmation 
in more traditional medium (i.e., handouts, brochures, pamphlets) is given to patients.  
During the course of the discussion, if t he patient expresses that he/she is not interested in 
program , it will not be sent to the pati ent.  It  is the patient’ s decision w hether or not to  view 
the programs .   
 
The questionnaires that are included with the program or that are mailed to patients 
separately are optional. Patients can voluntarily complete them and send them back, but 
are not required  to do so.  An information sh eet will accompany the questionnaire that 
explains the study in detail, including how we protect patient  privacy, and explains  that 
returning the completed surveys indicates their consent to participate in the pr oject. W e 
inform  patients that w e may share their survey data with their clinicians, as some providers 
have requested the feedback to make sure that their patients unders tand the key 
information in the program and to guide future conversations about the de cision. We also 
explain that we may look at their medical record to examine whether specific tests or 
treatments were done (for example, to examine w hether someone who vi ewed the knee 
osteoarthritis program had a knee replacement).  
 
All patients who receiv e a deci sion aid  or a study surv ey will also be able to indicate their 
consent to be contact[CONTACT_530866]. Of those patients who’ve given consent to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]: study staff  may 
contact [CONTACT_156999] v ia email or tele phone, depen ding on their preferred method, to 
solicit feedback on all aspects of programming.  The feedback may be obtained over the 
telephone , via email , or via focus groups.   Participation in any future contact [CONTACT_530867]; 
patients may  choose to not p articipate a t any time.  
 
The completion of the provider and patient questionnaire or interview is also voluntary, and 
they may choose to s kip any question they wish not to answer. No information will be 
shared that will perm it ident ificatio n of any individ ual.  
 
For patients involved in the medical chart abstraction, each patient’s information will be 
coded with a study ID to protect their p rivacy.      
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any for eseeable  risks a nd discomforts t o subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and

As stated above, there are minimal known risks to participating individuals associated wit h 
or attributable to this project. This is a project in which patients are provided wi th evide nce-
based decision aids in the form of DVD  programs  or online versions of these program,  which 
aim to help them make better, more informed decisions about the scr eening, management, 
and treatment options available to them .

EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
import ance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provi de 
a brief, real istic summary of  potential b enefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least  25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit fu ture pat ients wi th the disease/c ondition bei ng 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technologica l advances.  
 
Potential benefits to participants include:  
 Increased knowledge (i.e.  better und erstandi ng of treatment/ screening op tions and the 
risks and benefits of the different options)   
 Better decision quality; reduced uncertainty and decisional confl ict 
 Feeling more comfortable with decision  
 Increased patient involvement in treatment and scre ening de cisions 
 Improved  ability for  patients to take into account their own values and preferences when 
making healthcare decisions  
 Improved health outcomes  
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     12   Increased patient satisfaction  
 
There is no direct benefit to partic ipants who are include d in the  RPDR qu ery and eCare 
reports or who  complete the surgery  shared decision making survey.   
 
The knowledge we expect to gain from this project include: 1) a demons tration of the ability 
to introduce and disseminate SDM programs  to patients, 2) asses sment and unders tanding 
of “pres cribing”  utilization , trends and patterns by [CONTACT_530848], 3) insight 
from patients about receiving SDM  programs , and th eir decision preferences and  comfort 
with making a decision , 4) a more comprehensive a nalysis of the q uality of decisi ons for 
patients undergoing elective joint replacement and spi[INVESTIGATOR_530834] 5) identification of 
practices and surgeons who are able t o achieve shared decision making.

EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
The risks and benefits of the research mus t be fairly distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group  of pers ons, for  example, men, w omen, pregna nt women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or 
ethical re ason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is 
represent ative of  the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research.
 
Participants in this project will be adult patients with a provider in the Partner s Healthcare 
System adult primary and specialty care practice s. Patient decision aids are all availabl e in 
English and  Spanish exc ept for 4 programs that are only available in English: Prediabetes: 
Choices you can make to prevent diabetes, Pregnancy : Birth  Options if your baby [CONTACT_530868], and Pregnancy: Your birth options after cesa rean, Pr ostate C ancer: Is radiat ion or 
surge ry right for you . 
 
Participants will also be limited to those for whom a SDM  program  is clinically appropriate.  
This includes  men and women with the following health problems and concerns: general 
healthcare opt ions, low back p ain (chronic, ac ute, spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], and herniated disc), 
osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, coronary artery /heart  disease, benign prostatic 
hyperplasia,  abnormal uterine bleeding, uterine fibroids, symptoms of menopause, obesity, 
depressi on, ovar ian canc er screening, pr ostate cance r screening, colorectal cancer 
screening, advance directives, diabetes,  breast cancer treatment,  heart failure,  insomnia,

RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
addres s how, when, where and by [CONTACT_530871]: Protocol Summary  
Version Date:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689407] clinicians  currently discuss any patient education material they 
provide their patien ts. Those pat ients who are interested will then receive the  program , 
either via the mail , email,  or by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_530836] u p from the Blum Patient and Family Learning 
Center, depending on the patient’s preference.    
 
Clinicians are interested in automating the di stribution of  decision aids. To accomplish this, 
we will work with clinicians and practices to iden tify pat ients at  a decision poin t. Data will  be 
collected regarding the general practice patterns for the conditions covered to understand 
the number of elig ible patients . The investigators will work with Steve Atlas who has an IRB 
approved protocol to exa mine pra ctice pa tterns for quali ty improveme nt. For example, we 
may examine the number of men seen in MGH primary care practices who have never had a 
PSA tes t, and then w ork with providers to ensure that those men receive the appropriate 
decision aid in ad vance of  their n ext visit. The d ata will ena ble automation of distribution as 
well as evaluation of distribution rates to determine the  proportion of eligibl e patients we  
are reaching with each program.  
 
Quantitative data will be collected for the number and type  of programs “prescribed ,” both 
overall and by [CONTACT_530872].  This data will be strictly quantitative and will not be 
associated with any i ndividual pat ient or identifying information. Nothing about the patients 
will be associated with th ese numb ers.  Fu rthermore, this data will be  independent of active 
patient participation in the evaluation and feedback (i.e., patient questionnaires) portio n of 
the proj ect.  
 
All patients who receive a SDM  program  will be eligible to participate in the q ualitati ve 
(evaluation and feedb ack) portion  of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. A questionnaire will be included with all  SDM 
programs  that are sent or given to patients. The que stionnaire s may also be incorporated 
into standard patient intake procedures at clinics , such as th e touch screen computers or 
kiosks that pati ents use to complete standard assessments before seeing a provider in the 
orthopedic clinic.  Patients can choose to complete t he questionnaire and mail it back or 
complete the questionnaire over the telephone  or online , thus pro viding implied c onsent 
(i.e., voluntary completion of survey or questionnaire), or they can choose to not complete 
the questionnaire.  Patients who have n ot returned the questionnaire  within [ADDRESS_689408]-viewing questions.  
 
All patient s who receive a decision aid will also be able to indicate their consent to be 
contact[CONTACT_52911]. Of those patients who’ ve given consent to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]: study staff 
may contact [CONTACT_530873] e, depen ding on their pr eferred meth od, to 
solicit feedback on all aspects of programming. The feedback may be obtained by [CONTACT_530874] i nterviews or group interviews. The information  will help us make 
improvements to the patient educat ion mate rials. All emails that a re sent for recruitment 
will be sent in accordance with Partners’ institutional guidelines for information security. Any 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689409]

Patients who have indicated their consent to be contact[CONTACT_530875] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_530837]: sl eepi[INVESTIGATOR_380093], depression, and anxiety. 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_530876] a survey study. If they agree to participate they will be asked to r eview 
some addit ional patient ed ucational ma terials either online or on paper. After the patient 
reviews the materials, they will be asked to complete and an swer the ques tions via phone 
with study staff at a scheduled time. Consent will be implied by [CONTACT_941] c ompletio n of the  
questionnaire. If a patient  would like to complete the questionnaire via paper, an 
information sheet, questionnaire, and return -envelope wil l be sent to the patient. The 
project goal is to have approximately [ADDRESS_689410] primary care physicians 
(PCP) identify patients who they  believe woul d good candidates to participate in the 
interviews. The PCP will provide the patient w ith the informat ion sheet and if  the patient  is 
interested, the PCP will provide the research staff contact [CONTACT_530877] t heir interest  in participating. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_530878] p articipa te in an intervi ew. If they agree to participate they will be 
asked whether they prefer to conduct the interview in -person or via telephone a nd study 
staff will schedule a mutually convenient time. Consent will be implied by [CONTACT_530857] . A cover letter  and an info rmation sheet will be sent by [CONTACT_65056] (if 
subjects provide verbal consent to use personal email) for those interested in  an interview. 
All emails that are sent for recruitment will be sent in accordance wit h Partne rs’ inst itutional 
guidel ines for inf ormation security. The project goal is to have approximately [ADDRESS_689411], he/she will 
not be eligible. If the patient agrees to participate he/she will b e sent an information sheet 
describing the study  and a mut ually convenient time will b e schedu led for the patient to 
participate i n the interview. Consent will be implied by [CONTACT_530879].  
 
Physicians who prescribed a patien t decision ai d in the past will be sent a  recruitment email 
asking if they would like to participat e in the  60-minute intervi ew. Th e informatio n sheet will 
also be included . The physician will be asked to reply to the email to indicate if he/she is 
interes ted. For phys icians who respond to the email, a mutually convenient time will be 
scheduled for the physicia n to par ticipate in the interview. We will recruit physicians across 
a range of practices and specialties. All emails that are sent for recruitment w ill be sent i n 
accordance with Partners’ institutional guidelines for information security. Consent  will be  
implied  by [CONTACT_530880].  
 
Patients who received a specialty referral where their physician provisionally ordered a 
decision aid  through the Cl inical Referral Management System  will also be contact[CONTACT_530881].  Their feedback w ill be collected through 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     16  individual interviews or surveys. The information will help us to better understand deci sions 
around the referral process. A cover letter and information sheet describing the study will b e 
mailed  to the patients so that  they may ch oose to participate or not.  Any information 
provided by [CONTACT_530882].  The patients’  demogra phic informat ion will be 
collected through an RPDR data collection . 
 
Physicians who have placed the  referra l for pa tients through t he Clinical Referral 
Management System will also be contact[CONTACT_530883]. Thei r feedback wi ll be collected through an email survey. A cover letter and 
information sheet describi ng the s tudy wil l be included in  the email s o that they may choose 
to participate or not. Any information provided by [CONTACT_530884]. 
All email s that are sent for recruitment will be sent in accordance with Partners’ institutiona l 
guidel ines for  information sec urity.  
 
All eligible Partners Healthcare System primary care physicians, specialists, nurses and 
other clinic staff involved in a patient’ s care may be asked to complete either the 
questionnaire or participate in an intervie w. The e mail may  also include an  information  
sheet describing the study.  All emails that are sent for recruitment will be sent in 
accordance with Partners’ i nstitutional guidelines for information security.  Study staff will 
work individually with those int erested in the i nterviews, at th e time of a specific project.    
 
Medical chart abstraction will examine  visits, testing and treatment decisions for patients 
who have both  received a decision aid and those with target condition who have not. For 
patients wh o have n ot recei ved a decision a id, the pati ents’ medical records  will be pulled 
based on the relevant  ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT codes associated with a visi t, or with a provide r 
within the study timeframe.  
 
For the surgery shared decision making surveys, the pr ocedures  are as follows:  
1. Work w ith PROMs te am to schedule patients to receive the shared decision -making 
survey as part of their routine orthopedic PROMs as sessment at a  post-operative visit 
between [ADDRESS_689412] to pull data for eligible patients that was not 
available fro m the eC are repo rt. Staff may al so access EH R to pull data (e.g. PROMs 
completion and responses) that is not available through RPDR.    
4. Study s taff will trac k shared deci sion-making survey completion rates on the PROMs 
platform and upload survey data into the data base.  
5. Staff will compar e completion  data to targets across topi[INVESTIGATOR_530838], staff will use a computer -generated allocation scheme  to randomly select a 
subset of eligible surgical patients who did not receive the shared decision making 
survey on  the PROMs platf orm to recei ve it in the mail.  
6. The mailing will contain a cover letter signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_530839], an information sheet about the study, the 
survey, a $2 incent ive, and  self-addressed stamped return envel ope. The cover letter 
will include instructions for how to opt out of the survey if subjects are not 
interested.  
7. About two we eks after the mailing, research staff will make up to three attempts to 
call subjects who did not opt out to answer qu estions and encourage subjects to 
complete the survey.

10. One week after mailing, study staff will call patients who did not o pt out t o ask th em 
if they are i nterested in  participating in a 30 -45 minute interview.  
11. Patients who complete a phone interview, will be sent a thank you le tter and $20 
cash compensation.  
 
Surgeons who see patients with these conditions across the partic ipating sites wi ll be 
eligible f or a survey.  Study staff will give the paper survey to surgeons in person or send via 
email. The survey will ask for particip ant’s name [CONTACT_530914] a meeting. Once 
we get the survey we will mark each with a code  and use  the stu dy ID code as th e 
identifier . As needed, study staff will make up to three reminders via email. The brief survey 
will contain questions about  the surgeon’ s attitudes toward shared decision making, use of 
decision aids, and confidence in sha red deci sion mak ing skills. The survey parti cipation is 
voluntary and surgeon implies consent by [CONTACT_530865]. All emails th at are sent for recruitment will be sent in accordance with Partners’ 
institutional gu idelines  for inf ormation securit y. 
 
Cancer S creening Project 2020 :  
For the cancer screening shared decision making surveys, the procedures are as follows:  
 
1. Study staff will identify patients through the prescription log of individuals who 
received patien t educat ion mate rials in the for m of decisio n aids on cancer screening 
for: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer over the last [ADDRESS_689414], a one time survey and $2 USD for their 
consid eration of co mpleting the study.  
3. Participants can choose to complete the survey and mail it back , complete  the sur vey 
over the tel ephone , or online via a REDCap survey link , thus providing implied 
consent (i.e., voluntary completion of survey or questionn aire). Partic ipants can also 
choose not to complete the survey.   
4. Study staff will make up to three reminder  calls t o patients regar ding the sur vey

Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     19  CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, whe re, and by [CONTACT_530888], and the t iming of co nsent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than min imal risk and  all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physici an 
investigator mu st obtain i nformed consent.  When subje cts are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the potential for coercion will be  avoided.
 
There are no formal written consent procedures in this  project .  Whether o r not a patient 
receives one of the SDM progra ms is deter mined by [CONTACT_530889]’s desire to receive information about his or her health problem /screening in  the form 
of a shared decision -making  program .  This occurs through a di scussion between t he patient 
and clinician dur ing the off ice visit, much like any conversation that occurs when a physician 
gives educational material to a patient.      
 
Patients who receive a SDM  program  will also receive an information sheet describing the 
study and  a questionnaire . Patients can ch oose to com plete the questionnaire and mail it 
back, online,  or complete the questionnaire over the telephone , thus providing  implied 
consent (i.e., voluntary completion of survey or questionnaire), or they can  choose to not 
complete the q uestionnaire. There will be routine  post-card reminders and  follow -up phone 
calls made to patients who have not returned the questionna ire within [ADDRESS_689418] fo rmal written consent 
either, and consent will be implied by [CONTACT_530890]. The pr ovider 
questionna ire will pr ovide us with valuable feedback regarding the dissemination of the SDM 
programs , as well as their perspective barr iers and/or b enefits to prescribe  and refer  to 
eligible patients. Clinician consent w ill be implied by [CONTACT_530891] t he intervie ws 
or completing a survey . Clinicians will be provided with a study information sheet as well.  
 
For the patients in the specia lty referral survey , no formal written consent will be collected. 
Patien ts’ consent will b e implied b y the return of t he complete d survey or completion of a 
telephone interview. A cover letter and  information sheet describing the purpose and t ime 
commitmen t of the study will be  mailed  to the patients so that they may choose to  
participate or no t. A remind er phone  call will be placed  for those who haven’t completed the 
questionnaire within a 2 -week timeframe.  They can choose to complete the surv ey over the 
phone at that point.  
 
For those patients who’ve given consent to be re -contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]: study sta ff may cont act these 
patient s via email  or telephone, depending on their preferred method, to invite them to 
participate in a n individual or group interv iew or via su rvey. An information sheet describing 
the interview study, time commitme nt and remuneratio n (if appli cable)  will be pr ovided. If

For the surgery shared dec ision makin g surveys, there are no form al written consent 
procedures in this project. When the survey is included as part of the PROMs application, it 
is part of the standard of care. When surveys are mailed to patients, consent is implie d by 
[CONTACT_530893] n and retur n of the survey. Study staff  will protect the privacy of research 
study participants.  Patients can skip any question and may stop at any time.  There are no  
procedures in this research for which written consent is normally requi red. For the maile d 
survey, e ligible participa nts will re ceive a cover letter signed by [CONTACT_530894] t he principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_530840], as well as an information sheet that will 
provide deta ils about t he survey study. Participants can review the questions and choose 
whether or not they wish to participate. Surgeon s who receive  a surgery shared decision 
making survey will have implied consent by [CONTACT_530895]. Survey 
participation i s voluntary.  
 
Cancer Screening Study 2020 :  
No formal written consent will be obtained for participants of the ca ncer screenin g study 
survey. Potential participants will be mailed an information she et containing info rmation 
about the study and inviting pa rticipation. Participants may review the questions and the 
information provided in the mailing packet and choose w hether or not  they wish to 
participate. Participants may also contact [CONTACT_530896]. Consent  for 
participatio n will be i mplied by [CONTACT_530897]. Participa nts may request  the RED CAP survey link be sent to their email . 
Study staff will read the IRB policy reg arding send -secure vs. unencr ypted emails  and obtain 
verbal consent f rom participants via telephone to s end the survey link via email ba sed on 
participant email preferen ce. Survey participation is vol untary.   
 
All participants in the Path to Life style Chan ge program will be asked perm ission to send 
them an email  about this research project. If the participant gives permission to use their 
email, he/she will be emailed a cover letter and fact sheet  explaining the research project  
per Partners guidelines . The cover letter will  ask partic ipants to opt -out if they do  not want 
to participate in the survey research . For participants who do not opt -out, they will be sent 
an email with a secure  link to a REDCap  survey at ea ch of the four timepoints.  Consent will

While there are no  known risks or safety concerns to participating individuals associated 
with or att ributable to viewing information about health topi[INVESTIGATOR_530842], we will  monitor pa tient feedback obtained in the questionnaires and any 
conversations they might have with their clinician in which they express complaints or 
problems relate d to the project. The Stoeckle Center staff are available to answer ques tions 
or concerns  that patie nts might have.  We plan to keep records of any feedback, questions, 
concerns and/or complaints received about the project and will address the m as necessar y.   
 
The main risks to patients will be lo ss of privacy.  Questionnaires  will include sol ely, a coded 
unique numeric identifier for each patient  and provider . Therefore, all completed 
questionnaires will be stripped of any personal identifiers  and/or HIPAA  related information. 
Only MGH approved stu dy staff for this protocol wi ll have access to  the inform ation 
crosswalk needed to link this unique identifier with confidential personal infor mation. The 
completed, coded  questionnaires will be retur ned, where st udy staff will enter the de-
identified data into a secured on line data w arehouse. Data wi ll be store d using a secure, 
online data warehouse hosted by [CONTACT_530899] . All DatStat servers used for data 
collection are housed in a server room . The server room is in a building with 24/[ADDRESS_689420] udy data. Users ar e 
logged o ut after a period of time. A listing of the users with a description of their access 
privileges is available within the application. The following are log ged: failed a nd successful 
logins, attempts to access fi les/directories wi thout autho rity, successful and failed attempts 
to access sensitive data.   
  
All emails that are sent for recruitment will be sent in accordance with Partners’ institutional

Cancer Screening Survey Study 2020 :  
Data collection for the cancer screening survey will be from medical r ecords and pa tient 
surveys. There are no risks to partic ipant safety in co mpleting th e survey. To miti gate risk 
of loss to patient privacy all surveys will be coded with unique numeric identifier for each 
patient. The medical chart abstraction data will be  stored in a database on a Partners 
password protected c omputer. Only stud y staff wil l have access to this databa se. Study staff 
will protect the privacy of research study participants as described in the Privacy and 
Confidentiality section.    
 
It is possi ble that part icipants may be upset by a question in the interview or surve y, 
although  our prior experi ence using these questionnaires with patients who have knee 
osteoarthritis or low back pain have found that it is very rare for participants to be upset. 
Nevertheless,  study staff will screen surveys for advers e events and addre ss them as 
described in the next sectio n.  
 
There are no formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_530843].

surveys/questionnaires; proper disposal of printed computer data; limited access to study data; 
use of password -protected computer databases; tr aining for research staff on the importance  of 
confidentialit y of data, and storing resea rch records  in a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged wh en the research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, su ch as sexua l, criminal or il legal behav iors.
 
As the goals of this study are to 1) demonstrate the ability to introduce and disseminate 
SDM programs  to patients, 2) assess and unders tand “prescri bing” utilization,  trends and 
patterns by c linician and acros s practices , 3) obtain feedb ack from pa tients about receiving 
SDM programs , their decision preferences and comfort with making a decision, and 4) 
assess the quality of shared decisio n making for elective surgical decisions.  
 
The study st aff will process a nd manage t he distribution a nd return o f program s and 
questionnaires.  Once questionnaires have been returned, the study IDs will be removed so 
that any ability to link the questionn aires back to  patients is removed prior to any review, 
database entry or a nalysis of the data.  Patien t identifie rs on the program  log (name, 
address and phone number) will be removed before a copy of it is given to study staff.  The 
study database will no t contain any  patient information.  In this way, the pri vacy of the 
subjec ts and conf identiality of th e data coll ected will be maintained.    
 
No personal information will be captured during the qualitative feedback sessions. Patient 
privacy will be maintai ned.  All not es will be stripped of any personal identif iers and/or 
HIPAA related inf ormation.    
 
The interviews will be recorded. The interview data will be identified by a code only. Once 
the interview is completed, we will not keep the link that ties th e participant  to the 
interview. To ensure confidentialit y, all study mater ials will be kept in locked file cabine ts 
and on electronic drives on a Partners password -protected computer to which only the study 
staff has access.  
 
For the surgery shared decisio n making surv ey, study staff will run e Care reports  and RPDR 
queries  to gather inform ation on potentia lly eligibl e subjects and will review the subject’s 
medical record to confirm eligibi lity. We will have names and addresses of eligible  
participants and t his informati on will be kept separate from the study dat a (e.g. PROMs 
patient survey data). A separate  file on a password -protected Partners shared drive will 
contain the codes linked to identifying information. Only the MGH study staff and 
investigators w ill have acce ss to this file. These will be kept as long  as required by [CONTACT_3433] e 
research project. After th e study has  been completed the personal contact [CONTACT_530905].   
 
Cancer Screening Study 2020 :  
For the cance r screening s tudy, researchers will identify patients wh o received a decis ion aid 
in the HDSC database  and will r un RPDR queries to gather contact [CONTACT_530906]. We will have names and addresses of eli gible 
partici pants and this information will be kept sep arate from the stu dy data (e. g. patient 
survey s). All pat ients will receive a code number and the surveys will only be identified by 
[CONTACT_105751]. A separate file on a password -protected Partners share d drive will contain the 
codes linked to identifying inf ormation. Only the  MGH study staff and investi gators will  have 
access to this file. These will be kept as long as required by [CONTACT_74009]. After the 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_689424] informati on of all eligible participants will be 
destroyed.   
 
All pape r files (e. g. eligibility sc reeners) th at contain PHI will be kept in a locked file cabinet 
or in a secure offsite file storage location or on a password protected Partners shared dr ive.  
 
Patien t confidentiality will be maintained as is routine for all pa tient care privacy guideline s. 
All rese arch staff are CITI certified and will be trained on the importance of data 
confidentiality.  
 
 
SENDING SPECIMENS/DATA TO RESEARCH COLLABORATOR S OUTSIDE 
PAR TNERS  
Specimens or data collected by [CONTACT_530907] w ill be sent  to research coll aborators 
outside Partners, indicate to whom specimens/data will be sent, what information will be sent, 
and whether the specimens/data will contain ident ifiers that c ould be used by [CONTACT_530908] t o link the specime ns/data to individual subjec ts.
 
The de -identified program a nd decision aid  survey data will be shared with the sponso r, the  
Informed Medical Decisions Foundation . The sponsor is hos ting the data  warehouse 
described in detail above and it  will aggregate de -identified  data from other sites that are 
funded to collect the same data on implementation of the DVDs/booklets at primary care 
sites across the country. The data will not contain any identifie rs and other investigators, 
including the s ponsor, will not b e able to l ink the data to i ndividual s ubjects.   
 
A written summary of the interviews that does not contain any personal identifiers will be 
shared with the Healthwise, who is the f under . 
 
Cance r screening study 2020 :  
The research team is committed to ma king resour ces and data from  this propo sed research 
study available to other investigators in the research community. The patient information 
sheet states the data will be de -identif ied and made available to others for analysis and 
resear ch following study  completion . The study team will create  a clean and de -identified 
copy of the final data set which will include patient survey data in addition to the limited 
demographics and cancer  screening te st. Information for investigators intereste d in using 
this da ta will be made available on  the Health  Decision Sciences Center website and in 
publications of the data. [CONTACT_530915] will share a de -identified data set with outside 
investigators a t no cost, pe r approved MGH/Partners policies for data s haring. We will ne ver 
share t he key that will enable an i nvestigator to link the coded data to an individual. 
Investigators from other sites will be able to request the data and will be required to 
complete a data  use agreement that ensures that all local IRB requirements a re met befo re 
using the data , that they  will not attempt to identify any data in the dataset, and that they 
will not share the data set with anyone outside their project team. We wil l also make 
information necessary to interpret the data,  such as study pro tocols, dat a dictionaries, a nd 
survey t ools available to interested investigators.   
  
After the study results  have been published, de -identified data sets will also be deposited in 
an open acces s service such as, ICPSR ( https://ww w.icpsr.umi ch.edu/icpsrweb/ ). This is to 
promote research replicability, transparency and future use of the data. On ICPSR, 
individuals must register and  agree to ICP SR’s Responsible Use statement prior to acc essing 
datasets. A dditionally , before a datase t is made a vailable for access, ICPSR completes a 
detailed review of all datasets to assess disclosure risk. If necessary, ICPSR modifies data to 
reduce d isclosure ris k or limits access to datasets for which mo difying the data w ould 
substa ntially limit the ir utility or the risk of disclosure remains high. No information that 
Partners Hum an Subjects Resea rch Applica tion Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     26  contains identifiers or that could be used to link an individual to the data will b e included in  
the de-identified data set. The informatio n sheets will cont ain the fol lowing language:  After 
the study is completed, all identifiable information will be removed from the data and after 
removal, the de -identified information will be deposit ed in an open  access service to 
promote use of the data by [CONTACT_530909].   
 
 
Specifically addres s whether s pecimens/data will be stored at collaborating sites outside 
Partners for future use not described in the protocol.  Include whether subjects ca n withdraw 
their specimens/data, and how they would do s o.  When appropria te, submit documentation of 
IRB approva l from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_17787].
 
Since there will be no identifying information in the data submitted to the sponsor it will not 
be possible for an indivi dual to withdraw their information. We have  submitted the app roval 
for the protocol held by [CONTACT_530910].  
 
RECEIVING SPECIMENS/DATA FROM RESEARCH COLLABORATORS OUTSIDE  
PARTNERS  
Whe n specimens or data collected by [CONTACT_79161] c ollaborators outsi de Partners  will be sent to 
Partners in vestigators, indicate from where the specimens/data will be obtained and whether the 
specimens/data will contain identifiers that could be used  by [CONTACT_94886]/data to  individual subjec ts.  When a ppropriate, submi t documenta tion of IRB 
approval and a copy of the IRB -approved consent form from the institution where the 
specimens/data were collected.
 
Study staff at MGH will be a ble to access the aggregated data that the sponsor has collec ted 
from ot her participating  sites. MGH  study staff will not be able to link data to individual 
subjects  from other participating sites . We have attached the IRB approval held by [CONTACT_530911] d the other partic ipating sit es.

Objective:
Main Study
To evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib RA subjects who have 
completed Study M13 -[ADDRESS_535022] with upadacitinib.
Optional Vaccine Sub -study:   To assess the impact of upadacitinib treatment (15 mg QD or 30 mg QD) 
with a stable background of MTX on immunological responses following administration of Prevnar 13®
pneumococcal vaccine in RA patients (Appendix O).
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Site s:  118 sites
Study Population:   Adult female and male RA subjects who have completed the Last Visit (Week 12) 
of Study M13 -[ADDRESS_535023] met all of the 
specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   [ADDRESS_535024] been enrolled in this OLE study.
Methodology:
This is an extension study to assess the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in RA 
subjects who have completed Study M13 -[ADDRESS_535025] Visit (Week 12) of Study M13 -[ADDRESS_535026] 
20% improvement from RCT Baseline in both Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Sw ollen Joint Count 
(SJC), upadacitinib dose should be increased to 12 mg BID as long as the Investigator has no safety 
concerns.  After 6 w eeks of treatment with upadacitinib 12 mg BID, the improvement in TJC and SJC 
will be re- assessed at next scheduled visit (Week 12).  If the subject on [ADDRESS_535027] 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC fr om RCT Baseline the subject w ill be discontinued.  At 
Week 12, the same process will be follow ed.  If a subject still on [ADDRESS_535028] 20% 
improvement from RCT Baseline in both TJC and SJC, upadacitinib dose should be increased to 12 m g 
BID.  The improvement in TJC and SJC will be re -assessed after 6 w eeks of treatment with 12 mg BID 
at Week 18 (an optional study visit).  Subjects who fail to achieve at least 20% improvement from RCT 
Baseline in both TJC and SJC with [ADDRESS_535029] 2013 -003530 -33

Methodology (Continued):
After Week 12, if a subject fails to show at least 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in TJC and SJC 
at [ADDRESS_535030] will be discontinued.
Starting at Week 6 and during any scheduled or unscheduled visits thereafter, upadacitinib dose may be 
increased from 6 mg BID to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January 2017, see below  for more details) if 
a subject fails to achieve Low Disease Activity (LDA) status (CDAI > 10) and has no safety concerns 
per Investigator's judgment.
At any visit, upadacitinib dose may be decreased back to 6 mg BID (or 15 mg QD from January 2017) 
per Investigator's judgment if there are safety and/or tolerability concerns due to an adverse event or 
reaching one of the protocol specific toxicity management thresholds.  Dose increase back to 12 mg BID 
(or 30 mg QD from January 2017) is not allow ed.

3.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of patients affected by  [CONTACT_423668] b y persistent symmetric pol yarthritis of sy novial joints, and oftentimes 
includes sy stemic inflammatory  manifestations in extra -articular organ s ystems.  Earl y 
therap y with disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
although a significant proportion of patients either do not achieve disease remission or 
become refractory  to available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_423650].  Novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_423651].  Evidence suggests that inhibition of the Janus 
activated kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a promising approach for the treatment of 
patients with this chronic disorder.1
The JAK family  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine ki nase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with membrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain (CGC) receptors and the gl ycoprotein 
130(gp130) transmembrane proteins.[ADDRESS_535052] 40 cy tokine receptors signal through 
combinations of these four JAKs and their seven downstream substrates of the Signal 
Transduction Activators of Tr anscription (STAT) family .[ADDRESS_535053] s initiates expression of survival factors, cy tokines, chemokines and 
other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular trafficking and cell proliferation which 
contribute to inflammatory  and autoimmune disorders.
JAK3 and JAK1 are components of the CGC cy tokine receptor complexes and blo ckade 
of either inhibits signaling b y the inflammatory  cytokines interleukin (IL) -2, 4, 7, 9, [ADDRESS_535054] JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2.  Tofacitinib 
(Xeljanz®; [COMPANY_007]®) is a non -selective JAK inhibitor that targets all [ADDRESS_535055] 2013 -003530 -33
24
family ; the rank order of cellular potency  is JAK3, JAK1, JAK2 and Ty k2.[ADDRESS_535056] had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
MTX.9  The approved dose is 5 mg BID and it can be used as monotherap y or in 
combination with MTX or other non-biologic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs).  Recently  tofacitinib was approved in Japan, Russia, and Switzerland.
Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients 
with moderatel y to severely activ e RA, either alone or in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX) or other non -biologic DMARDs.  Based on in vitro selectivity  assay s and in -vivo
animal models, upadacitinib has demonstrated that inhibiting JAK1 with minimal impact 
on JAK2 is feasible at effica cious drug exposure levels.  Thus, the enhanced selectivity  of 
upadacitinib has the potential for an improved benefit/risk profile in treating patients with 
RA by  [CONTACT_423669]2 inhibitory  effects on ery thropoiesis and my elopoiesis.  Also, the 
minimum of activity  of upadacitinib against JAK3, which is involved in IL -[ADDRESS_535057] contributed to increased 
incidences of viral infection, re -activation of herpes zoster, and malignancies.
The toxicology  profile of upadacitinib has been evaluated in multiple chronic studies in 
rats and dogs.  Briefl y, nonadverse findings in rats included mild decreases in red blood 
cell counts, hemoglobin and dose -dependent decreases in circulating l ymphocy tes.  At 
very high doses of upadacitinib (50 to 100 mg/kg/day) the adverse findings included 
mortality  as well as tubular degeneration/regeneration in the kidney  and liver necrosis.  In 
dog studies there were dose -related decreases in hemoglobin and red cell mass (red blood 
cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit) and microscopic findings in popliteal 
lymph nodes (mixed cell inflammation in inter -digital skin of paws and draining lymph 
nodes) considered secondary  to potential upadacitinib -related immunomodulation.  A 
detailed summary  of the pre -clinical toxicology  results can be found in the current 
Investigator's Brochure.[ADDRESS_535058] on 
the exposure (AUC) of upadacitinib.  Therefore, upadacitinib can be administered with or 
without food in the present study .
Preliminary  results after multiple ascending doses of upadacitinib in healthy volunteers 
are available from Study  M13 -845.  The randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled 
study  was designed to eval uate the safet y, tolerability and PK of upadacitinib at four dose 
levels of 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg BID.  In each dose group, 8 subjects were 
randomly  assigned to receive upadacitinib and 3 subjects received placebo administered 
twice dail y (BID) for 1 4 consecutive day s.  No serious or fatal adverse events or AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported during the study.  Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) were reported in 7 (58.3%) subjects receiving placebo and in 
11(34.3%) subjects receiving A BT-494 with the overall incidence of TEAEs at 
2(25.0%), 2 (25.0%), 3 (37.5%) and 4 (50%) of subjects experienced TEAEs in the 3 mg, 
6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg dose groups, respectivel y.  All TEAEs were considered mild 
(Grade 1) in severity  and reported to have a reasonable possibility  of being related to 
study  drug except [ADDRESS_535059] common TEAEs in the upadacitinib 
treatment groups (n =32) were hea dache (15.6%), abdominal pain (6.3%), diarrhea 
(6.3%), and nasophary ngitis (6.3%).  No clinicall y meaningful changes in laboratory 
values, vital signs or ECG findings were observed during the stud y.
Preliminary  results indicated that at stead y state, upada citinib had minimal to no 
accumulation with a median T maxof approximately 2 hours and an effective half -life of 
approximately  3 hours.  Upadacitinib exposure was approximately  dose -proportional 
across the dose range studied.  Approximately 19% to 21% of u padacitinib was excreted 
as unchanged parent in the urine during a dose interval in the stead y state.

A detailed discussion of the pre -clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology  and safet y 
experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investi gator's Brochure.[ADDRESS_535061] Visit (Week 12) of 
Study M13 -[ADDRESS_535062] (12 – 24weeks) will have 
an opportunity  to enroll into this OL E study .  This is the first study  with upadacitinib of 
treatment durations longer than 24 weeks.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, s ystemic, autoimmune disease characterized by
[CONTACT_423670].  If left untreated, RA causes damage to 
cartilage, bone, and adjoining tissues which ultimately leads to severe disability , impaired 
function, and marked reduction in the quality  of life of subjects.  The p revalence of RA in 
the general population is approximately  1%, and increases with age in both genders, with 
women being more prone for developi[INVESTIGATOR_176356].
The etiology  of RA has not been fully  elucidated, but based on the pathologic mechanisms 
of RA, s everal pro -inflammatory  pathway s and cy tokines such as TNF, interferon gamma, 
IL-[ADDRESS_535063] s has been well validated in RA.  Several 
inhibitors of Janus activated kinases (JAKs), a family  of intracellular t yrosine kinases that 
transduces cy tokine -mediated signals, demonstrated proof of concept first with cur rently 
marketed tofacitinib and with other emerging second generation JAK inhibitors that are in 
the clinic for reducing the signs and s ymptoms in RA subjects.11,[ADDRESS_535064] 
potently  inhibits JAK3.1  Although tofacitinib improves the clinical signs and symptoms 
of RA, questions remain surrounding t he safety  profile regarding the incidences of serious 
infection, malignancies, herpes zoster, and hematologic adverse events.
Data from clinical studies in RA subjects with tofacitinib showed reduced levels of 
hemoglobin, absolute l ymphocytes counts, and t otal white blood cell counts in some 
subjects and also increased serum creatinine; total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL -C), 
and HDL cholesterol (HDL -C); and liver transaminases (ALT and AST).7,[ADDRESS_535065] been 
asymptomatic, reversible, and were not associated with any  overt declines in renal or 
hepatic function.
Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 selective inhibitor with minimal in hibitory  effects on JAK2 
and JAK3, which could potentially  minimize some of the reported safety  concerns with 
non-selective JAK inhibitors which are thought to be mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and 
JAK3 signaling pathways.  I nitiation of Phase 2 studies wi th upadacitinib was feasible 
based on acceptable safety and tolerability profile of upadacitinib in single ascending dose 
and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy  volunteers.  The current OLE study
 will 
allow the collection of long -term safety  data t o better assess the risk to benefit profile of 
upadacitinib.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624] -[ADDRESS_535066] 2013 -003530 -33

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, OLE stud y to assess the long -term safety , tolerability , and 
efficacy  of upadacitinib in RA subjects who have completed Study M13- [ADDRESS_535067] Visit (Week 12) of Study  M13 -[ADDRESS_535068] 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in 
both Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC), upadacitinib dose should 
be increased to 12 mg BID as long as the Investigator has no safet y concerns.  After 
6weeks of treatment with upadacitinib 12 mg BID, the improvement in TJC and SJC will 
be re -assessed at next scheduled visit (Week 12).
If the subject on [ADDRESS_535069] 20% improvement in both TJC and 
SJC from RCT Baseline the subject will be discontinued. 
At Week 12, the same process will be followed.  If a subject st ill on [ADDRESS_535070] 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in both TJC and SJC, upadacitinib 
dose should be increased to 12 mg BID.  The improvement in both TJC and SJC will be 
re-assessed after 6 weeks of treatment with 12 mg BID at Week 18 (an optional study  
visit). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_535071] 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in both TJC 
and SJC with [ADDRESS_535072] 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in 
both TJC and SJC at [ADDRESS_535073] will be 
discontinued.
Starting at Week 6 and during an y scheduled or unscheduled visits thereafter, upadacitinib 
dose may  be increased from 6 mg BID to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January  2017, 
see below) if a subject fails to achieve Low Disease Activity  (LDA) status (defined b y 
CDAI  > 10) and has no safet y concerns per Investigator's judgment.
At any  visit, upadacitinib dose may  be decreased back to 6 mg BID (or 15 mg QD from 
January 2017) per Investigator's judgment if there are safet y and/or tolerability  concerns, 
due to an adverse event or reaching one of the protocol specific toxicity  management 
thresholds.  Dose increase back to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January  2017) is not 
allowed.
From January  2017, all subjects who are at Week [ADDRESS_535074] the option to decrease the dose to 15 mg QD based on 
investigator's discretion.
The change to once daily tablet formulation in this study  is based on extrapolation of 
pre-clinical efficacy  models and anal yses of PK, pharmacod ynamic, safety , and efficacy  
data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (single and multiple ascending dose 
Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, respectively ) and completed Phase 2b randomized, 
controlled studies (RCTs) in RA subjects (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550).  The doses

selecte d, 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, are expected to approximate the exposures achieved 
with the 6 mg BID and 12 BID immediate release formulations, respectively, which 
should be efficacious with an acceptable safet y profile.  Preliminary results from an 
ongoing rela tive bioavailability  study  demonstrated that single 15 mg and 30 mg doses of 
the once- daily  formulation provide comparable AUC and significantly  lower C maxthan 
single doses of 12 mg immediate release (I R) formulation (AUC equivalent to 6 mg BID 
dose teste d in Phase 2) and 24 mg IR formulation (AUC equivalent to 12 mg BID dose 
tested in Phase 2), respectively , under fasting conditions.  At steady -state, the once -daily  
dose of [ADDRESS_535076] 2013 -003530 -33

following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_535099] dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated 
at least 1 month prior to Study  Day  1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject (periodic abstinence 
[e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and 
withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly 
effective birth control methods list ed above (excluding true abstinence).

If a patient receives an intra -articular injection during the stud y, the injected joint(s) 
should be scored as "NA = no assessment" for [ADDRESS_535120]
●For women of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy test will be performed 
monthly  at home between sched uled stud y visits.  The results of these tests will 
be verball y communicated (via telephone) to the site.  If a urine pregnancy test 
is positive, the subject must stop dosing, come in to clinic and have blood 
drawn for a serum pregnancy  test that will be a nalyzed at the central laboratory .  
A urine pregnancy  test will be performed at all scheduled study  visits as 
specified in Table 2, on all female subj ects of childbearing potential.  If urine 
pregnancy  test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue 
dosing.  If urine pregnancy  test is positive at any  visit, withhold dosing and 
perform a serum pregnancy  test for confirmation.  The se rum pregnancy  test

TB Testing
For subjects with a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (or [COMPANY_003]) test at screening of the 
preceding RC T, an annual QuantiFERON -TB Gold (or protein purified derivative [[COMPANY_003]]) 
re-test will be required at visits indicated in Table 2.  All subjects will be assessed for 
evidence of increased risk for TB b y a questionnaire ( Appendix L).
Subjects with a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test OR negative [COMPANY_003] TB skin test 
AND no new evidence of increased TB risk based on the questionnaire may continue in 
the study .
Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test (or 
equivalent) and/or [COMPANY_003] are not required to repeat either test d uring the study  and should 
be considered positive .
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test 
should be performed locally  (or through the central laboratory  if not locall y available) to 
rule out a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the 
subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the local testing result 
is negative, then the patient is considered to be negative.
●Interpretation of a positive annual TB te st in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test by  [CONTACT_423677][INVESTIGATOR_110958], the Investigator may  perform a local QuantiF ERON -TB Gold 
Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory  if not locall y 
available) to confirm the positive test result.  I f the repeat testing result is 
negative, the Investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her 
clinic al judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the 
test is considered positive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus.

M13 -[ADDRESS_535123] result (seroconversion), a chest x -ray (CXR) 
needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB.  
Expert consultation can be considered per Investigator's discretion.  An y positive TB 
scree n after the patient has started the stud y should be reported as an adverse event (AE).
Subjects with evidence of active TB infection will be discontinued from the trial.
For subjects with seroconversion on anannual TB test, if a CXR cannot be done due to
state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the Investigator should contact 
[CONTACT_423678].  CXR should 
be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/fac ility.   
If the subject is experiencing signs or s ymptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_176367]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled 
annual TB re -test, the case must be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeu tic Area Medical 
Director.
Obtain a CXR for subjects with newly  identified positive [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test and every  48 weeks for subjects with TB risk factors as determined b y the TB risk 
assessment form ( Appendix H) or for subjects living in areas endemic for TB.  An y 
positive TB test result after the subject has started study drug should be reported as an 
adverse event (AE).
The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source 
documentation.
TB Prophylaxis
If the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (newly positive TB test and the subject 
has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), proph ylactic treatment mu st be initiated (per 
local guidelines).  The prophy laxis needs to be completed.
Of note:  Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_423653]
M13 -[ADDRESS_535124] (alternatively, also known as a TB Skin Test) will be performed a s 
specified in Table 2according to standard clinical practice.  The TB Skin Test should be 
read b y a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_535125].  The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration 
equal to or greater than 5 mm for RA subjects i s considered a positive reaction.  The 
absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative."
Chest X- Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required at the visits indicated in Table 2
for those subjects with new TB risk factors per the latent TB risk factor questionnaire 
(Appendix L), or for those subjects living in areas endemic for TB or for those subjects 
with a newl y positive [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold.  Subjects can have a CXR any  
time during the stud y as warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator.
A radiol ogist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_423654] y findings and will sign and date the report.  In the 
assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_423655] e 
presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and

5.5.6 Drug A ccountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be document ed by  [CONTACT_176442] b y registering the arrival of medication through 
the IRT.  The original Proof of Receipt Note and the faxed I RT confirmation sheet will be 
kept in the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an I RT will be used to document investigational product accountability  
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number and the identification of person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  [CONTACT_779].  Empty /used study  
drug packaging should be returned b y the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and new packaging issued as necessary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT by  [CONTACT_176444], subject dosing diaries, and 
by [CONTACT_372895].  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliation has been completed, used packaging and unused study drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet [COMPANY_013]'s documentation requirements 
for on -site destruction).  The use of a third part y vendor for drug destructio n must be 
preapproved b y [COMPANY_013].  For sites performing on -site drug destruction or using a third
party  vendor for drug destruction, a cop y of the destruction methodology and date of 
destruction should be maintained at the site's facility .
Monitors will rec oncile the site's processes, source documents, subject's dosing diaries, 
IRT or site accountability records, and destruction records to assure site compliance.

option to increase the dose to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January  2017) throughout 
the treatment period if a subject is unable to achieve low disease activity with upadacitinib 
6 mg BID.  At an y time during the treatment period, the upadacitinib dose can be 
decreased back to 6 mg BID (or 15 mg QD from January  2017) per Investigator's 
judgment if there are safety  and tolerability  concerns.  Those subjects who are unable to 
achieve at least 20% improvement in both SJC and TJC (minimum clinical efficacy ) at 
defined time -points will be permanently  discontinued.  This design allows for collection 
of long -term safety  data and avoids continued treatment of those subjects who do not 
respond to study  medication.
From Janu ary 2017, all subjects who are at Week 72 or beyond will receive once -daily 
tablet formulation (15 mg QD or 30 mg QD).  Preliminary  results of a bioequivalent study  
demonstrated that single 15 mg and 30 mg doses of the once -daily formulation provide 
compar able AUC, but significantly  lower C maxthan single doses of 12 mg immediate 
release (IR) formulation (equivalent to 6 mg BID dose) and 24 mg IR formulation 
(equivalent to 12 mg BID dose), respectivel y.  At steady -state, the once -daily  dose of 
15mg QD is p redicted to achieve comparable daily  AUC, lower or comparable C max, and 
comparable C trough to 6 mg BID IR formulation, and the once -daily  dose of 30 mg QD is 
predicted to be equivalent to 12 mg BID IR.
Subjects who are on 6 mg BID (IR) capsule dosing will be transitioned to [ADDRESS_535159] the option to decrease to the 15 mg QD dose based on 
investigator's discretion. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_535160] is willing and the Investigator 
believes that continuing the therap y with upadacitinib is appropriate.
5.6.3 Selection of Doses in the Study
All subjects will be assigned to upadacitinib 6 mg BID at the beginning of OL E study .  
During the course of OLE treatment period the upadacitinib dose can be increased to 
12mg BID based on clinical efficacy  assessment and as long as the Investigator has no 
safet y concerns.  From January 2017, all subjects who are at Week 72 or beyond will 
receive once -daily tablet formulation.  Subjects who are on 6 mg BID dosing will be 
transitioned to 15 mg QD dosing.  Subjects who are on 12 mg BID dosing will be 
transitioned to 30 mg QD dosing.  The capsule formulation will not be available to 
subjects once the transition to tablet formulation has occurred.
The change in dose selection in this study  is based on extrapolation of pre -clinical 
efficacy  models and analy ses of PK, pharmacodynamic, safet y, and efficacy data from the 
Phase 1 studies in healthy volu nteers (single and multiple ascending dose 
Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, respectively ) and completed Phase 2b randomized, 
controlled studies (RCTs) in RA subjects (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550).  The doses 
selected, [ADDRESS_535161] 2013 -003530 -33
76

any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/sy mptom , severity , time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study  drug, and any  action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility " of b eing associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered 
intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query , observed b y site personnel, or reported spontaneously  by [CONTACT_303398].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.3 Definitions
6.3.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinic al investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, (meets protocol specific criteria [see Secti on 6.10 regarding toxicity  
management]) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_535164] 2013 -003530 -33
78
the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.3.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event mee ts any  of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_535165]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anom aly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_535166] and 
may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent an y 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  elective 
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.[ADDRESS_535167] will be monitored during the study  (see detailed 
toxicity  management in Section 6.10):
●Serious infections, opportunistic infection s, herpes zoster, and active TB;
●Malignancy (all t ypes) ;
●Adjudicated Gastrointestinal perforations;
●Adjudicated c ardiovascular events (e.g., major adverse cardiovascular event 
[MACE]);

●Adjudicated cardiac, e mbolic and thrombotic events (non -cardiac, non- CNS).
6.5 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will classify  adverse events according to the Rheumatology  Common 
Toxicity  Criteria v.2.0 ( Appendix M).10
6.6 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
Poss ibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship. 
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investig ator has not reported a relationship or deemed it not 
assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_237421], an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_112789].
6.7 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of stud y drug administration (Day 1) until 
30days following discontinuation of study  drug administration will be collected, whether  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_535169] signed the study -specific informed consent.

related missed/virtual visits, study  drug interruptions or discontinuations, or adverse 
events (including documentation of specific signs/sy mptoms of infection and testing 
results).
COVID- 19 infections should be captured as adverse events.  If the event meets the criteria 
for a serious adverse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the 
protocol and above . 
The following COVID -19 related supplemental eCRFs should be comple ted (for both 
serious and non -serious events):

6.8 Serious Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify  Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made 
aware of the serious adverse event b y entering the serious adverse event data into the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site 
having acces s to the RAVE®system or if RAVE is not operable should be documented on 
the SAE Non -CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of being made aware of the serious adverse event.

Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected after obtaining proper consent.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_535172] consists of safet y 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safety  
issues by  a safet y data monitoring committee), interruption of stud y drug dosing with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from 
study  drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is descri bed 
below.
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or a serious opportunistic infection.  
A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As

Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378].
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is 
confirmed, ( other than appendicitis or mechanical injury ) the subject must be discontinued 
from study  drug.
Cardiovascular Events:   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events should 
be appropriatel y assessed and carefull y monitored.  These events will be reviewed and 
adjudicated b y an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded 
manner.
Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thrombosis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.  If the diagnosis of deep vein th rombosis, pulmonary  
embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject 
should be discontinued.  
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from stu dy drug.  Information including 
histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

rhabdom yolysis consider checking CPK and aldolase, with clinical management and/or 
study  drug interruption as deemed appropriate b y the treating ph ysician.
ECG Abnormality: Subjects must be discontinued from stud y drug for an ECG change 
considered clinically  significant and with reasonable possibility  of relationship to study  
drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > [ADDRESS_535176] Laboratory Abnormalities:  For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment, following an y local guidelines.  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 5
(confirmation b y repeat testing is required) and may require an appropriate supplemental 
eCRF to be completed.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically 
significant b y the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.  If a repeat test 
is required per Table 5, the repeat testing must occur as soon as possi ble.

The proportion of subjects achieving Low Disease Activity  (LDA) o r Clinical Remission 
(CR), and the proportion of subjects achieving CR will be evaluated at Weeks 6, 12, 24, 
36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and every 24 weeks thereafter until the end of the study.  The 
criteria will be based on DAS28 [CRP] or CDAI  as follows:
DAS28 [CRP] CDAI
LDA 2.6 ≤ to < 3.2 2.8 < to ≤ 10
CR < 2.6 ≤ 2.8
DAS28 [CRP] score will be determined based on a continuous scale of combined 
measures of TJC, SJC, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity  (PtGA) (in mm), 
and hsCRP (in mg/L ).
DAS28 [CRP] = 0.56 √("TJC28" )+ 0.28 √("SJC28" )+ 0.36 ln (CRP + 1) +
0.014 PtGA + 0.96,
where √ is square root and ln is natural log.  A score > 5.1 generally means high disease 
activity ; 2.6 ≤ DAS28 [CRP] < 3.2 generally  means low disease activity  (LDA); DAS28 
[CRP] < 2.6 is generall y considered clinical remission (CR).
Clinical Disease Activity I ndex (CDAI) is a composite index (without CRP) for assessing 
disease activity .  CDAI is based on the simple summation of the counts of SJC28 and 
TJC28 along with Patient's Global Assessment (VAS [0 – 10 cm]) (PtGA) and Physician's 
Global Assessment (VAS [0 –10 cm]) (PhGA) for estimating disease activity.
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA + PhGA.
% Improvement in Joint Count from Baseline in RCT = [(Number of Swollen/Te nder 
Joints at Day  [ADDRESS_535189] –Number of Swollen/Tender Joints at Current Visit)/Number of 
Swollen/Tender Joints at Day  [ADDRESS_535190]]*[ADDRESS_535191] 2013 -003530 -33

In this stud y, the level of disease activity is interpreted as remission (CDAI ≤ 2.8), low 
(2.8 < CDAI ≤ 10), moderate (10 < CDAI ≤ 22), or high (CDAI > 22).
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy  Analysis 
The efficacy  anal yses will be conducted with the analy sis set described in Section 8.1.1
andthe observed cases (OC).  The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing 
evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will 
be excluded from the OC anal ysis for that visit. 
Frequencies and relative frequencies ( percentages) of ACR20/50/70 will be summarized 
with 95% confidence intervals at each post -baseline time point.  
The proportion of subjects achieving Low Disease Activity  (LDA) or Clinical Remission 
(CR), and the proportion of subjects achieving CR will be evaluated at Weeks 6, 12, 24, 
36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and every 24 weeks thereafter until the end of the study.  
Frequencies and relative frequencies will be reported with 95% confidence intervals by 
[CONTACT_765], and will be summarized based on DAS28 [CRP] and C DAI criteria respectively .
For each of the change from baseline measurement, namely, TJC, SJC, Patient's Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity , Phy sician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity ,

8.1.6 Safety  Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS] General Considerations
All subjects who receive at least one dose of upadacitinib in this OL E study  will be 
included in the safet y analy sis.  Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, 
premature discontinuation, and changes from Baseline in vital signs, ph ysical examination 
results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed b y visit.  Treatment -emergent 
adverse events will be tabulated by s ystem organ class and by  [CONTACT_6213].  
Mean change from Baseline for laborat ory and vital signs data will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_765].  For anal yses purposes, baseline for vital signs, phy sical examination results, and 
clinical laboratory  results for subjects will be the data collected at the visit immediately  
prior to starting double -blind treatment.  In an alternate assessment for summarizing the 
safet y and laboratory data, baseline data will be assumed to be the data collected at the 
visit immediately  prior to starting treatment with active upadacitinib.
Incidence of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and 
clinical laboratory values will be anal yzed.
Treatment emergent adverse events will be tabulated by s ystem organ class (SOC) and by  
[CONTACT_423688] (MedDRA) preferre d term.  Mean 
change from baseline for laboratory  and vital signs data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_765].
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
The impact of time between completion of RCT and roll -over to OLE will be explored.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Trea tment -Emergent A dverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary .  Treatment -emergent adverse events, defined as AEs 
that began or worsened in severit y after initiation of open- label study  drug upadacitinib in  
Upadacitinib
M13 -[ADDRESS_535193] 2013 -003530 -33

this OL E study , will be tabulated b y system organ class (SOC) and MedDRA preferred 
term.
Adverse events starting more than [ADDRESS_535194] will be counted in the 
severit y/relationship categories of "unknown" even if the subject has a second occurrence 
of the same event with a severit y/relationship present.  The only  exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severit y (i.e., "severe") 
or a relationship category of "reasonable possibility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severit y/relationship categories.
The AEs of special interest (i ncluding but not limited to serious infection, opportunistic 
infection, herpes zoster, TB, gastrointestinal perforations, malignancies, MACE, renal 
dysfunction, anemia, increased CPK, drug -related hepatic disorders and thrombotic and 
embolic events) will be summarized.
Subjects reporting more than [ADDRESS_535195] severe incident in each stud y period.  Subjects 
reporting more than 1 t ype of event within an SOC will be counted only  once for that 
SOC.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment- emergent AEs will be 
summarized as follows:
●Any event
●By [CONTACT_9313], and preferred term
●By [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximum relationship

All AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug will be presented in listing 
format.
A listing of treatment -emergent AEs grouped b y SOC and MedDRA preferred term with 
subject ID numbers will be generated.
The post -treatment AEs will be summarized in the same way as the treatment -emergent 
AEs described above.

16.2.5 Statistical A nalysis of Efficacy
Primary Variables
1. Proportion of subjects with satisfactory  humoral response to Prevnar 13®at the 
Week 4 visit of the sub -study  ([ADDRESS_535274] -vaccination).
Satisfactory  humoral response to Prevnar 13®is defined as greater than or equal to 
(≥)2-fold increase in antibody  concentration from the vaccination baseline in at least 6 
out of the 12 pneumococcal antigens (1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F).
Secondary Variables
1. Proportion of subjects with satisfactory  humoral response to Prevnar 13®at the 
Week 12 visit of the sub- study  ([ADDRESS_535275] -vaccination).
2. Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) of anti -pneumococcal antibody  levels to each 
of the [ADDRESS_535276]- vaccination.  95% confidence intervals for each upadacitinib dose 
group will be provided.
At [ADDRESS_535277] -vaccination, the geometric mean fold rise 
(GMFR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of anti -pneumococcal antibodies as 
compared with pre -vaccination will be summarized for each upadacitinib dose group.  
Calculations will be done using logarithmicall y transformed assay results, and then back -
transformed to the original scale. 
All efficacy  analy ses will be based on observed cases.  No multiplicity  adjustment is 
planned for an y anal ysis in this vaccine sub -study .
Determination of Sample Size
A total sample size of approximately  150 subjects is planned for the sub -study , where 
approximately  100 subjects are expected to be on upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose.  
Assuming a satisfactory  humoral response rate of 60%, the planned sample size of 
approximately  100 subjects for upadacitinib 15 mg QD group will provide a margin of 
error o f approximately  10% for this dose group when using a 95% confidence interval.

1. SYNOPSIS  
Name [CONTACT_790]/Company: Alexion Pharma GmbH (Alexion)  
Name [CONTACT_791]: asfotase alfa  
Name [CONTACT_3261]: Human recombinant tissue -nonspecific alkaline phosphatase fusion protein  
Title of Study: A Phase 2a Randomized, Multi -center, Open -Label, Pharmacokinetic , and Dose Response Study 
of Asfotase Alfa in Adult Patients with Pediatric -Onset Hypophosphatasia  
Study center(s): To be determined  
Studied Period: 13.[ADDRESS_1252046] patient enrolled: Q1 [ADDRESS_1252047] patient completed: Q 2 2016 Phase of Development: 2a 
Objectives:  
UPrimary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
asfotase alfa following administration of a range of dose regimens that encompasses the dose proven to be 
effective in c hildren (6 .0 mg/kg/week) in adult  patients with pediatric -onset hypophosphatasia (HPP) . 
USecondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this study is t o evaluate the safety and tolerability of asfotase alfa in adult patients 
with pediatric -onset HPP. 
Methodology:  
Study AA -HPP-[ADDRESS_1252048] 6 patients in each cohort completing the study : 
1. 0.5 mg/kg initial single dose; multiple dosing starting after 2 weeks at 0.5 mg/kg 3 times per week  
2. 2.0 mg/kg initial single dose; multiple dosing starting after 2 weeks at 2.0 mg/kg 3 times per week  
3. 3.0 mg/kg initial single dose; multiple dosing starting after 2 weeks at 3.0 mg/kg 3 times per wee k  
Randomization  will be stratified  by [CONTACT_514739] a similar distribution of gender in each cohort.  
Patients will receive a single dose on Week 1, Day 1 . On Week 3, Day 1 patients will start multiple dosing with 
the 3 times per week regimen (2 weeks after receiving the single dose). 
Safety, PK, and PD assessments will be performed at Baseline and at scheduled visits throughout the study . 
Patients may be asked to provide additional blood samples at an unscheduled visit at the request of the Sponsor 
or Investigator as part of a safety evaluation or for adjustment of the drug dose due to a safety concern . Adverse 
events (AEs) and concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893785].  
Number of P atients Planned:  
Screened: 36  
Randomized: 27  
Completed : 18 (minimum)  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
Men and non -pregnant women aged ≥[ADDRESS_1252049] either documented tissue -nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) 
gene mutation(s) or  Screening assessments demonstrating both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) below normal and 
pyridoxal -5′-phosphate ( PLP) above normal, and have not received asfotase alfa in the [ADDRESS_1252050], Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
Asfotase alfa : 
• 0.5 mg/kg (initial single dose); multiple dosing starting after 2 weeks at 0.5 mg/kg 3  times per week, 
given as subcutaneous (SC) injections  
Page 5 of 59 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AA -HPP-208    Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
• 2.0 mg/kg (initial single dose); multiple dosing starting after 2 weeks at 2.0 mg/kg 3  times per week, 
given as SC injections  
• 3.0 mg/kg (initial single dose); multiple dosing starting after 2 weeks at 3.0 mg/kg 3  times per week, 
given as SC injections  
Individual dose injections are limited by [CONTACT_893813] 1.0  mL; those patients whose calculated dose, based on the 
3 times per week regimen, exceeds 1.0 m L will require  multiple injections per dose.   
Duration of Treatment  Period :  
13.5 w eeks: 1 week of run -in, 9 weeks of dosing , and 3.5 weeks of wash- out for immunogenicity assessment  
Reference therapy, dos age and mode of administration:  
Not applicable   
Criteria for evaluation:  
UPharmacokinetics : 
Blood samples will be drawn at selected timepoint s to assess asfotase alfa activity in serum.   
UEfficacy /Pharmacodynamics U:  
Blood samples will be drawn at selected timepoints to assess the effect of treatment on PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893786]. The 
change from Baseline in PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893787].  
USafety:  
Adverse events (includes serious adverse events  [SAEs] , injection site reactions  [ISRs], injection associated 
reactions  [IARs] ), laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical 
examination, renal ultrasound, ophthalmology assessme nt, and urine pregnancy tests ( for women of 
childbearing potential only) . Anti -drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies ( NAb) will also be 
assessed.  
Statistical methods:  
All data collected in this study will be documented using summary tables, figures, and data listings. For 
categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, median, standard devi ation [SD], minimum, and maximum) will be presented. Descriptive 
statistics for PK parameters will include the number of observations, mean, SD, coefficient of variation ( CV), 
median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric %CV.  
Efficacy analyses w ill be conducted on the Full Analysis Set  (FAS) , consisting of all treated patients with a pre-
dose and at least [ADDRESS_1252051] 1  dose of asfotase  alfa. Pharmacokinetic analys es will be conducted on the PK 
Population, consisting of all treated patients for whom the PK profile can be adequately characterized.  
A sample size of 9 patients per cohort  (27 patients total) will provide sufficient power (>8 0%) to detect a 
difference of 2.[ADDRESS_1252052] analyzed using a fixed sequence testing procedure. A sample size of 
6 patients per cohort  (18 patients total) will provide sufficient power (>90%) to detect a difference of 3.2 µM 
using the same assumptions.  A mean difference of 3. 2 µM (SD  1.5 µM) was observed in adult pediatric -onset 
treated patients versus controls in Study ENB -009-10 for th e change from Baseline to Week  6 in PPi . Between 
6 and 9 patients per cohort  (18 and 27 patients total) will give sufficient power to detect a mean difference of 
2.3 to 3.2 µM (SD  1.5 µM).  
Efficacy/Pharmacodynamics:  
The primary endpoint, PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893788]-[ADDRESS_1252053]. A fixed sequence testing procedure will be performed with the comparison of the 9.0  mg/kg/week 
cohort compared to the 1.5 mg/kg/week cohort being performed first, and the  hypothesis testing for the second 
comparison 6.0 mg/kg/week cohort compared to the 1.5 mg/kg/week cohort only being performed if the null 
hypothesis is rejected for the previous comparison at a significance level of 0.05. The primary endpoint will be 
met if the null hypothesis is rejected for both comparisons at a significance level of 0.05 . Additionally, the shift

Protocol AA -HPP-208    Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
in the distributions and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the above comparisons will be reported using the 
Hodges -Lehman n-Sen estimate and the exact confidence limits reported .  
As secondary  analyses, descriptive statistics for t he absol ute levels and the change from B aseline in PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893789]. W ithin cohort, the change from B aseline to all study timepoints 
will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed -rank test . 
Finally, a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based repeated measures mixed model will be fit ted to 
estimate the change from Baseline in PPi [INVESTIGATOR_144109] p re-dose timepoint and tes t whether the change  differs from zero 
at each timepoint. The analysi s will include the fixed, categorical effect of v isit. The estimate of change from 
Baseline at defined visits will be provided, along with 95% CIs and p- values.  The treatment effect will also be 
explored.  
For the secondary endpoint, change from Baseline to pre-[ADDRESS_1252054]
P dose in Week 9 in PLP, similar methods as for PPi 
[INVESTIGATOR_893790] .  
Individual and mean (± SD) plasma PPi  [INVESTIGATOR_893791] v ersus time data will be pr esented graphically by 
[CONTACT_9084]. Additional analysis of the PD data may be performed if considered useful.  
Pharmacokinetics :  
Mean serum asfotase alfa concentrations versus nominal time and individual serum asfotase alfa concentrations 
versus actual time will be graphically presented. The individual serum concentration data for asfotase alfa -treated 
patients, with actual sampling dates and times , will be u sed to derive the PK parameters  by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental 
analyses using WinNonlin® 5.3 (or higher) (Certara, L.P., [ADDRESS_1252055] Louis MO [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003]). The 
following PK parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental methods: maximum observed serum 
asfotase alfa concentration (C RmaxR), time at which C RmaxR is observed (t RmaxR), area- under -the-concentration -time curve 
from time zero to the time of the last observed concentration (AUC RtR), area- under -the-concentration -time curve 
from time zero to infinity (AUC R∞R), elimination rate constant  (k ReR), and half -life (t R½R). Additional PK parameters 
may be  calculated, as appropriate.  An attainment of asfotase alfa PK steady state will be evaluated. Dose 
proportionality and time linearity assessment may be considered. PK -PD relationships may be explored. 
Additional PK -PD analyses may be considered if deemed useful.    
Safety :  
The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be 
summarized by S ystem Organ Class (S OC) and Preferred Term (PT) overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_427939]. Changes from Baseline in vital signs, laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) 
will be summarized. Shifts from Baseline in laboratory assessments as well as physical examination , renal 
ultrasound, and ophthalmology  findings will be summarized for a ll study visits. Immunogenicity data will be 
tabulated and summarized.

4. INTRODUCTION 
Hypophosphatasia (HPP)  is a rare metabolic bone disease caused by [CONTACT_893814](s) 
in the gene encoding tissue -nonspecific alkaline phosphatase ( TNSALP ) (Whyte 2013) , resulting 
in defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation. 
Hypophosphatasia is characterized by [CONTACT_893815] a 
failure to mineralize bone matrix. Extracellular accumulation of the TNSALP substrate, 
inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), functionally impa irs skeletal mineralization. Elevations in 
extracellular PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893792], 
causing a pronounced accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix. Failure to mineralize bone 
matrix in adults results in diverse complications that may include proximal muscle weakness, 
pain, and fractures, including multiple, recurrent, non-healing and non- traumatic fractures  
(Whyte 2013; Berkseth 2013) . Hypophosphatasia is also characterized by [CONTACT_893816] (ALP) and higher than normal levels of the TNSALP 
substrates phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) (Whyte 1985) . 
In adults, TNSALP activity plays a critical role in bone remodeling, ensuring adequate mineralization of the osteoid matrix, preventing fractures, pseudofractures, and other sequelae of 
osteomalacia that may lead to profound muscle weakness, decreased physical function, and increasing disability. The adult skeleton undergoes continuous remodeling throughout the entire 
lifespan to: 
• Provide the calcium and phosphorus necessary for metabolism 
• Provide the means by [CONTACT_893817]  
• Remove old, micro-damaged bone and replace it with new, stronger bone 
As bone remodels throughout life, osteoid is deposited at the sites of remodeling. The disease process in HPP inhibits bone mineralization at these sites of remodeling and results in “packets” 
of soft osteoid. As remodeling continues, the number of these sites on the skeleton with 
unmineralized areas of osteoid accumulate (ie, osteomalacia), bone strength is reduced, and the 
integrity of the ske leton is compromised. This compromised skeleton in HPP patients is prone to 
fractures. The number of fractures and pseudofractures experienced by [CONTACT_893818].  
The clinical manifestations of HPP range in severity; however , in general there is increased 
disease severity with an earlier age at onset of disease symptoms. Classifications of HPP 
described  in the literature  include pediatric-onset HPP (comprised of perinatal- , infantile -, and 
juvenile- onset HPP), where first sym ptoms of HPP present at <18 years of age, and adult-onset 
HPP, where symptoms appear at ≥18 years of age  (Whyte 2013) .  
Sever e functional deficits are commonly present in adults diagnosed with HPP (of any onset) 
including ambulation difficulties, weakness, shortened stature, and an inability to carry out activities of daily living. In HPP patients surviving to adulthood, long- term clinical sequelae 
include arthritis, pain, inability to remove previously placed internal fixation devices due to the 
risk of recurrent fracture , and the requirement for ambulatory assistive devices ( eg, wheelchairs,

wheeled walkers, and canes). The most common clinical features reported in adults diagnosed 
with HPP are musculoskeletal pain and fractures  (Berkseth 2013) .  
Asfotase alfa is a human recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase- Fc-deca-aspartate 
fusion protein. It is a soluble glycoprotein of 726 amino acids made from the catalytic domain of 
human TNSALP (Swiss-Prot, P05186), the human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 Fc domain (Swiss-
Prot, P01857) (to facilitate purification), and a deca-aspartate peptide domain (Kasugai 2000; 
Nishioka 2006) . 
Asfotase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to address the underlying cause of 
HPP, a deficiency of TNSALP activity, by [CONTACT_893819], thereby [CONTACT_893820]. 
Results from clinical studies to date demonstrate that asfotase alfa treatment was safe and well 
tolerated and elicits clinically meaningful improvements across a broad array of serious 
morbidities in HPP, including severely abnormal biochemistry, defective bone mineralization, abnormal bone structure, diminished physical function, and disability. 
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated 
adverse events (AEs) of asfotase alfa may be found in the Investi gator’s Brochure (IB).

5. OBJECTIVES 
5.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of asfotase alfa following administration of a range of dose regimens 
that encompasses the dose proven to be effective in children (6.0 mg/kg/week) in adult patients 
with pediatric -onset HPP.   
5.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective of this study is  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of asfotase alfa in 
adult patients with pediatric -onset HPP .

[ADDRESS_1252064] 6  patients in each cohort completing the study.  
Patients will be seen for a Screening visit and  will be evaluated after the patient (or legal 
guardian) provides written informed consent. The Screening visit will include assessments to 
confirm the diagnosis of HPP, including medical history to confirm onset of HPP symptom s 
prior to age 18. Patients w ho fail any of the eligibility criteria may be re- screened only after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
After completion of the Screening visit, patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for 
Study AA-HPP-208 will be randomized in a 1:1:1  ratio to 1 of the following 3 cohorts :  
Cohort 1: Asfotase alfa 0.5 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893821] 2  weeks at 0.5  mg/kg 3 times per week  
Cohort 2: Asfotase alfa 2.0 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893821] 2  weeks at 2.0  mg/kg 3 times per week  
Cohort 3: Asfotase alfa 3.0 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893821] 2  weeks at 3.0  mg/kg 3 times per week  
Randomization will be stratifie d by [CONTACT_514739] a similar di stribution of gender in each 
cohort. 
Patients will receive a single dose on Week 1, Day 1; on Week 3, Day 1 (Study Day 15) patients 
will start multiple dosing with the 3 times per week regimen as described above. All doses will 
be administered as subcutaneous ( SC) injections throughout the study.  
NOTE:   
The Week 1, Day [ADDRESS_1252065] 
be administered on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays during Week 3 through Week 9, as  
indicated in  Table 2  and Table 3. 
The dose regimens planned for this study (ie, 1.5 mg/kg/week, 6.0 mg/kg/week , and 
9.0 mg/kg/week) bracket  the recommended dose regimen in pediatric HPP patients  of 
6.0 mg/kg/week , and span a 6-fold dose range from the lowest to the highest dose, allowing the 
best opportunity to construct dose-response relationships in adult patients.  Weight -based (ie, 
mg/kg) dosing for asfotase alfa allows normalization of dosing across patient populations with different body weights (inter- patient) and within the same patient over time (intra -patient).  
Refer to Figure  1 for an illustration of the study design.

6.2. Assessments  
The study will be conducted as outlined in  Table 2  and Table 3. Study visits (in -clinic or 
inpatient) will occur during Screening  (Week -12 to Week -2), the Run- in Period (Week  -1), 
Week  1, Week  9, and Week 13. To facilitate scheduling of required study assessments at each 
visit, visits may be shortened or prolonged, as necessary, as long as the specified order of 
assessments and/or availability of results pertaining to  laboratory testing  and vital signs are 
adhered to. Following are important points to remember where study assessments are concerned: 
• The fasting blood and urine samples are to  be collected  first ([ADDRESS_1252066] with water 
ad libitum) , before any additional study- related procedures are performed. Once all 
fasting laboratory samples are collected, patients are allowed to eat and/or drink  at 
will. 
• Prior to study drug administration, results of same- day pregnancy testing for females 
of child-bearing potential must be negative. 
Patients may be asked to  provide additional blood samples at an unscheduled visit at the request 
of the Sponsor or Investigator as part of a safety evaluation. Laboratory samples collected for 
routine blood and urine testing will be processed and/or analyzed by a central laboratory. Urine 
samples for pregnancy testing in female patients of childbearing potential will be analyzed at local laboratories at investigational sites, and blood tests for injection -associated reactions 
(IARs) occurring following home admini stration  may be analyzed centrally,  at the  site or other 
local laboratories  as available. 
As blood samples taken for study- related testing are sometimes not entirely depleted for the 
analyses, patients or their legal representative(s) will be given the option to consent to  the use of 
the remaining portion of these samples for additional research. These samples will be used only 
for Alexion’s scientific research related to exploratory biology and biomarker assessments for 
asfotase alfa treatment and/or HPP. Each sam ple may continue to be labeled with the patient’s 
study identifiers (ie, patient ID). The patient or legal representative(s) may request that his or her 
samples, if still identifiable, be destroyed at any time; however, any data already collected from 
that sample will still be used for this research. The biological samples will remain the property of 
Alexion, and may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality is maintained. 
Further details of the study procedures and assessments are provided in the Study Operations 
Manual (SOM).

14. Study drug will be administered in the clinic for the first dose and all other doses that occur during study visits. All other study drug administration will occur at home  
under the supervision of home healthcare .  
15. All patients are required to fast for 8 hours prior to laboratory testing (water all ad libitum). All urine and blood samples for laboratory assessments must be collected 
prior to study drug administration. Single exception is blood sample collection for analysis of PK parameters at required post-dose timepoint s. For all patients, fasting 
samples should be collected at the beginning of the visit day, before any other study -related procedures are performed.  
16. A full ophthalmology examination will be performed at scheduled visits. The examination will assess for papi[INVESTIGATOR_893793], and will includ e 
assessments of visual acuity; adnexa; and slit -lamp biomicroscopy with examination of anterior chamber, lens, conjunctiva, cornea, and fundus. The ophthalmology 
examination should be performed by a qualified ophthalmologist. Sites will be provided ophthalmologic worksheets required to complete the full exam. Ophthalmology exams may be performed by a qualified optometrist (i.e., Doctor of Optometry, O.D.) as long as the optometrist works under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.  
17. Asfotase alfa anti-drug  antibody testing and PK /PD analys es must be performed on samples obtained at the same time (ie, pre-dose samples from the same study visit).   
18. Refer to Table  3 for timing of PK /PD and asfotase alfa anti -drug antibody  assessments.  
19. Serum sample for tryptase will be collected pre-dose on Day 1 . Samples will be drawn only if the patient has no active allergies at the time, and will only be analyzed if 
the patient experiences a subsequent IAR. For acute or severe IARs (eg, with signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity, irrespective of the time from adm inistration of study 
drug to onset), additional blood and urine samples must be collected to assess the reaction as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1252071] be collected to assess the reaction. Refer to Section  9.5 for details of sample collection.

8. TREATMENT  
8.1. Treatments Administered  
This study involves an evaluation of asfotase alfa administered by [CONTACT_893822] -weekly 0.5 mg/kg (1.5 mg/kg/week), 2.0 mg/kg (6.0  mg/kg/week), and 3.0 mg/kg 
(9.0 mg/kg/week) . Asfotase alfa should be administered only as a SC injection and should not be 
administered intravenously or intramuscularly. The maximum volume of medicinal product per 
injection should not exceed 1.0 mL . If more than 1.0 mL is required, multiple injections may be 
administered at the same time . Table 4 presents the treatment regimens.  
Table 4: Treatment Regimens  
Cohort  Regimen and Dose  
Cohort 1  Asfotas e alfa 0.5 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893823] 2  weeks at 
0.5 mg/kg 3 times per week  
Cohort 2  Asfotase alfa 2.0 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893823] 2  weeks at 
2.0 mg/kg 3 times per week  
Cohort 3  Asfotase alfa 3.0 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893823] 2  weeks at 
3.0 mg/kg 3 times per week  
The total amount of asfotase alfa administered may be adjusted at each study visit to account for 
changes in body weight.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for the following: 
• Explaining the correct use of the study drug to the patient or legal representative  
• Verifying that instructions are followed properly  
• Maintaining accurate records of study drug  dispensing and collection 
• Returning all unused study drug  to the Sponsor or designee at the end of the study 
8.2. Clinical Study Materials and Supplies 
Asfotase alfa is a fusion protein made from the soluble catalytic domain of human TNSALP, the human IgG1 Fc domain for purification, and a deca- aspartate peptide used as a bone targeting 
domain. It is derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and is supplied as a clear, colorless, 
sterile solution for injection in single use glass vials .

Protocol AA -HPP-208   Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
• Sponsor name [CONTACT_3816] 
• Instructions for use and storage 
Study drug  will be labeled according to the country’s regulatory requirements. 
Study drug must be refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C in a secure area with limited access 
immediately upon receipt and inventory at the investigational site. To ensure the integrity of the 
study drug, storage temperature at the investigational site must be monitored on a daily basis and 
appropriately documented throughout the study conduct. Study drug administered for home use 
by [CONTACT_893824] 2 C to 8°C.  
The following guidelines must be adhered to where study drug handling is concerned: 
• The Investigator must only supply study drug to patients enrolled in the clinical study  
• The Investigator must ensure study drug is stored under controlled storag e conditions, 
accessible only to those authorized by [CONTACT_441239] 
• The Investigator must ensure that study drug accountability is maintained on an ongoing 
basis during the study 
• At the conclusion or termination of the study, after final accountability for study drug inventory has been performed, the Investigator must ensure unused study drug supplies at 
the investigational site are returned to Alexion or designee in accordance with Sponsor 
instructions or destroyed if the site has appropriate facilities and written procedures to 
dispose of study drug 
Additional information on study drug accountability, handling, and disposal requirements can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
Note: In some cases, sites may be permitted to destroy  the study drug if, during the 
investigational site selection, the study monitor has verified and documented that the site has 
appropriate facilities and written procedures to dispose of study drug. The material must first be 
counted, reconciled, and approved for destruction by [CONTACT_16015]. 
8.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment  
Patients who meet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized to a cohort during Run- In Period  
(Week  -1). Assignment to cohorts will be determined by a computer -generated random sequence 
using an interactive voice- or web - response system (IX RS). Enough vial s for the calculated 
doses between visits will be dispensed to study patients  at each visit.  
Approximately 27 adult patients  who meet eligibility criteria for study participation will be 
randomized to in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 3 cohorts :  
• Cohort 1: 0.5 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893823] 2 weeks at 0.5  mg/kg 3  times per week  
• Cohor t 2: 2.0 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893823] 
2 weeks at 2.0  mg/kg 3  times per week  
• Cohort 3: 3.0 mg/kg initial single dose; followed by [CONTACT_893823] 
2 weeks at 3.0  mg/kg 3  times per week dosing

Protocol AA -HPP-208   Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
Randomiza tion will be stratified  by [CONTACT_514739] a similar distribution of gender in each 
cohort. 
8.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
Based on relevant non- clinical data, as well as current human experience with asfotase alfa in 
patients with hypophosphatasia to date, a dose of 6 mg/kg/week administered subcutaneously is 
the recommended dose in pediatric patients; t his dose regimen has b een approved for treatment 
of pediatric patients with HPP in the US, EU, and other countries. 
The dose regimen s planned for this study (ie, 1.5 mg/kg/week, 6.0 mg/kg/week, and 
9.0 mg/kg/week) bracket th e recommended dose regimen in pediatric HPP patients and span a 
6-fold dose range from the lowest to the highest dose, allowing the best opportunity to construct dose-response relationships in adult patients  with pediatric -onset HPP.  
Weight based (ie, mg/kg) dosing for asfotase alfa allows normalization of dosing across patient 
populations with different body weights (inter- patient) and within the same patient over time 
(intra -patient).  
8.5. Selection and Timing of Doses  
Patients will be randomly assigned by I XRS to 1 of the 3 cohorts ( Table 4). Weekly doses of 
asfotase alfa will be administered 3 days per week as detailed in Section 8.1. 
The number of vials used to prepare injections will be determined based on the patient’s weight 
at that visit. The first dose of asfotase alfa will be prepared and administered at the invest igational site on the Week 1, Day 1  study visit. Asfotase alfa will also be prepared and 
administered at the investigational site on dosing days that occur during all required study visits . 
The Investigator, patient, or designee may prepare and administer injections at study visits. For injections between study visits, asfotase alfa may be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_893825]. 
If a patient experiences an acute or severe IAR at home (eg, with s igns/symptoms of 
hypersensitivity, irrespective of the time from administration of study drug to onset), the patient or legal representative(s) should call the site as soon as possible to discuss with the Investigator 
the need for medical evaluation in the medical office/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Collection of blood samples for analyses outlined in Section  9.5 may be required upon recommendation of the Investigator and 
availability of these tests at the local laboratory.  
Throughout the study, injection sites should be rotated among 8 different body areas (both thighs and buttocks, both sides of the abdomen, and both upper arms) and carefully monitored for 
sign(s) of p otential reaction(s). Note that any injection sites with unresolved  injection site 
reactions (ISRs) should not be used for injections again until the reaction subsides. 
Full instructions for data collection using the electronic diary are included in the SOM.   
8.6. Blinding and Unblinding

8.7. Concomitant Medication/ Therapy  
Any HPP -related medication use by [CONTACT_25701] [ADDRESS_1252082] udy drug regimens required for compliance with the study protocol. 
Study drug compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_716]:  
• Study drug administration data will be entered into the electronic patient diary by [CONTACT_893826]  
• Missed and improperly administered study drug doses must be clearly documented in 
the patient’s electronic diaries and study records, and documented as protocol 
deviations 
• The patients will be instructed to return any used study drug at the next study visit for 
the purpose of performing drug accountability 
For drug accountability purposes, empty vials of asfotase alfa will be discarded in a s harps 
container and returned when the container is full, or at the last study visit.  
Treatment compliance is defined as taking 100% of the required doses of study drug; missed 
doses will be captured as a protocol deviation. Study sites are encouraged to make telephone calls to patients at regular intervals to ensure patient compliance with their assigned injectable study drug.  
In addition to the assessment of a patient’s compliance with the study drug administration, other 
aspects of compliance with the study treatments will be assessed at each visit based on the patient’s adherence to the visit schedule, completion of study diaries, and any other parameters 
the Investigator considers necessary.

ASSESSMENTS, SAFETY EVALUATIONS, SAMPLE 
COLLECTION AND TESTI NG, AND APPROPRIATENESS OF 
MEASUREMENTS  
Study procedures and their timing (including tolerance limits for timing) are summarized in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Details of the analyses to be performed for each assessment 
are summarized in Section  11. 
NOTE:   
The Week 1, Day [ADDRESS_1252083] 
be administered on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays during Week 3 through Week 9, as  
indicated in  Table 2  and Table 3. 
9.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
9.1.1. Asfotase Alfa Activity 
Assessment of PK will be performed on all patients. Blood samples for the measurement of 
serum  asfotase alfa activity will be collected at the visits and /or timepoints specified in Table 2  
and Table 3 ( timepoints for pre -dose PK sample collection have a window of -[ADDRESS_1252084] a window of ±15 minutes). 13TSerum  asfotase alfa activity 
will be measured at a central laboratory . Refer to the SOM and Laboratory Manual  for complete 
PK collection procedures as well as preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585]. 
9.2. Efficacy/ Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
9.2.1. Plasma Inorganic Pyrophosphate and Plasma Pyridoxal- 5’ Phosphate  
Blood samples for measurement of PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893798] [ADDRESS_1252085] of items. Each examination will include the following assessments: gen eral 
appearance; skin; head, ear, eye, nose, and throat (including tooth count); neck; lymph nodes; chest; heart; abdominal cavity; limbs; central nervous system; and musculoskeletal.  
If clinically significant changes from Screening/Baseline are noted, the changes will be 
documented as AEs on the AE tab of the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ). Clinical 
significance is defined as any variation in physical findings that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care. The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until 
Page 35 of 59 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AA -HPP-208   Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
the parameter returns to Baseline or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer 
medically necessary.  
9.3.2. Vital Signs  
The following vital signs will be recorded at the times specified in  Table 2 : height (cm), weight 
(kg), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury [mmHg]), heart rate 
(beats/minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths/minute), and temperature (degrees Celsius [°C] or 
degrees Fahrenheit [°F]). Vital signs will b e taken immediately prior to each study drug 
administration.  
If clinically significant vital sign changes as compared to Screening/Baseline are noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE tab of the eCRF. Clinical significance is defined 
as any variation in vital signs that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in 
medical care. The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parameter returns to 
Baseline or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.  
9.3.3. Serum Chemistry, Hematology, and Urinalysis 
Serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed at the times specified in  Table [ADDRESS_1252086] assess all abnormal laboratory values as either clinically significant or not 
clinically significant. It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside of the normal value range due to the underlying disease. As in routine practice, the Investigators should use 
their medical judgment when assessing clinical significance. Clinical significance is defined as 
any variation in laboratory measurements which has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory changes from Baseline are noted, the 
changes will be documented as AEs on the AE tab of the eCRF. The Investigator will also assess 
the relationship to study treatment for all clinically significant out of range values (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient with additional laboratory 
assessments until (1) values have reached normal ran ge and/or Baseline, or (2) in the judgment 
of the Investigator, out of range values are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures.  
9.3.4. Ophthalmology Assessments 
A full ophthalmology examination will be performed at the times specified in  Table 2 . The 
examination will assess for papi[INVESTIGATOR_893799], and will include assessments of visual a cuity; adnexa; and slit -lamp biomicroscopy with examination of anterior 
chamber, lens, conjunctiva, cornea, and fundus. Sites will be provided ophthalmologic worksheets required to complete the full exam. Ophthalmology exams may be performed by a qualified  ophthalmologist or optometrist (ie, Doctor of Optometry, OD) as long as the 
optometrist works under the supervision of an ophthalmologist (MD).

[ADDRESS_1252087] be colle cted and recorded as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
9.4.1. Adverse Event   
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign ( for example,  an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to this  medicinal product. 
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition, and abnormal laboratory findings that are considered 
to be of clinical significance are all considered to be AEs.  
The definition of an AE also covers medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the 
protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. 
Situa tions where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or 
condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not AEs. High ALP levels detected through clinical laboratory testing will not be considered an AE after 
initiation of the study drug  as these reflect circulating levels of asfotase alfa.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical Procedures  
Elective procedures that were pre-planned prior to the time that written informed consent was 
obtained are not considered to be AEs. Any complication or worsening of a pre- existing 
condition leading to the procedure 
Uis U considered an AE. In addition, any AE that occurs as an 
outcome of the planned procedure is considered an AE . 
Page 37 of 59 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AA -HPP-208   Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (invasive and non-invasive) such as surgery or 
angiography should not be reported as an AE or SAE . However, the medical condition or the 
diagnosis that was responsible for the procedure should be recorded. The procedure should be recorded in the narrative as treatment for the AE or SAE (eg, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure or treatment for an SAE of necrotic gall bladder). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Test Findings  
Abnormal test findings may be considered AEs or SAEs; however, Investigators are strongly 
encouraged to report the diagnosis, sign, or symptom rather than the abnormal result. The criteria 
for an abnormal test finding being classified as an AE or SAE are any of the following: 
• Test resu lt is associated with a sign or symptom  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing  
• Test result requires a medical or surgical intervention  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing outside of the protocol defined dosing or 
discontinuation from the study 
• Test result requires significant additional treatment (ie, addition of new medication, significant increase in dose of current medication ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lack of Efficacy  
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish drug effect.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Adverse Events  
All observed or reported AEs regardless of treatment or causal relationship must be recorded and 
reported as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
For all AEs, the Investigator must obtain adequate information for the following:  
1. Determine the  outcome of the AE 
2. Determine if  the event meets criteria for an SAE  
3. Assess the severity of the AE  
4. Determine the causality of the AE  
For all AEs, regardless of casual relationship, the Inves tigator must follow -up on the outcome of 
the event until the event or sequelae either resolve or stabilize.  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102], and/or parent or legal guardian and/or identified in response to an open-ended question from study personnel, or revealed by 
[CONTACT_893827]. Adverse event 
information will be collected from the signing of informed consent until completion of the study.  
Adverse Events must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical terms. Study personnel are 
advised not to use abbreviations or acronyms.  
Page 38 of 59 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AA -HPP-208   Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_1252088] each sign and symptom as an AE, when a diagnosis 
becomes available, study personnel are to update the AE page of the eCRF with relevant diagnosis only. 
Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness Assessment  of Adverse Events  
The expectedness of an AE is determined by [CONTACT_893828] (IB) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
An AE that fulfills any [ADDRESS_1252089] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
2. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
3. Results in death  
4. Results in or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745636]: Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
Adverse events that are associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893800]. All admissions to a health care facility meet this criteria, even if less than 24 hours. Criteria for seriousness are also met if transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893801] (eg, medical floor to the ICU).   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
− Rehabilitation facility  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57714]  
− Nursing facility  
− Emergency Room 
− Same day surgery  
− Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893802]; examples include admission for a pre- existing condition not 
associated with either a new AE or with worsening of a pre -existing AE, protocol-
specified admission, pre-planned admission 
5. Is life -threatening  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
whic h the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol AA -HPP-208   Alexion Pharma GmbH  (Alexion)  
16 November 2015  
6. Other medically i mportant SAE  
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893803]. 
These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456004]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator id entifies as related to study drug or procedure. [LOCATION_002] 
21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated 
detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the 
reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. The Sponsor has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated 
detailed guidances.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity Assessments  
Investigators will be instructed to rate the severity of AEs using the following criteria: 
Mild  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
Severe  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines. 
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated : severity describes the intensity of an AE, while 
the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Causa lity Assessment  
An Investigator causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) must 
be provided for all AEs (both serious and non-serious). This assessment must be recorded in the 
eCRF and any additional SAE forms as appropriat e.  
Not Related  Suggests that there is no association between the Investigational 
Product and the reported event. 
Unlikely Related  Suggests that the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_65082] a cause other than the Investigational Product but attribution cannot be made with absolute certainty and a relationship between the 
Investigational Product, and AE cannot be excluded with comple te 
confidence. 
Possibly Related Suggests that treatment with the Investigational Product may have 
caused or contributed to the AE (ie, the event follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the Investigational Product, but 
could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604]). 
Probably Related Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the 
Investigational Product administration exists and the re is likely 
association of the event with the Investigational Product. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of the Investigational Product, known or previously reported adverse 
reactions to the Investigational Product or class of drugs, or 
judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical experience.  
Definitely Related  Temporal relationship to the Investigational Product, other 
conditions (concurrent illness, concurrent medication reaction, or 
progression/expression of disease state) do not appear to explain event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, 
improvement on discontinuation, re- appearance on re- challenge.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Outcome 
If a patient experiences an SAE with an outcome of death:  
• The SAE resulting in death should have an outcome documented as death/fatal with an end date as the date of death  
• If the patient had additional AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of death, these 
events should be documented as ongoing with no end date 
• Only [ADDRESS_1252090] an outcome of death/fatal unless an autopsy report or 
Investigator states otherwise

[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy and/or Lactation 
Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients.  
For all Alexion products, both in development or post-approval, exposure during pregnancy must 
be recorded and followed. Exposure during pregnancy, also called exposure in  utero , can be the 
result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal 
exposure. 
If a patient within this study or a patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant while 
treated or exposed to study drug, the Investigator must submit a pregnancy form to Alexion via 
the same method as SAE reporting. Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance will supply the 
Investigator with a copy of a “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breast Feeding ” form 
and must be notified via the same method as SAE reporting. 
Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding would need to be reported via the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breast Feeding” form,  and any AEs an infant may 
experience following breastfeeding needs to be reported to Alexion or Alexion Global

The patient should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinued study drug or discontinues from the study. When the outcome of the pregnancy 
becomes known the form should be completed and returned to Alexion or Alexion Global 
Pharmacovigilance de signee . If additional follow -up is required, the Investigator will be 
requested to provide the information. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55613] a contraceptive medication. However, complications of 
pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and many may meet criteria for an 
SAE. Complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy such as ectopic 
pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly would meet criteria of an SAE and thus, should be reported as an SAE. Elective 
abortions without complications should not be rep orted as AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Adverse Event(s) and Serious Adverse Event(s) to the Sponsor  
All non-serious AEs must be recorded in the electronic data capture (EDC) system upon 
awareness.  
All SAEs must be reported to Alexion Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_1252091] the SAE data in the patient’s eCRF and verify the accuracy of the 
information recorded pages with the corresponding source documents. The SAE information will be sent via the Safety Gateway, a tool within the electronic data capture system, to Alexion 
Global Pharmacovigilance.  
Please note - The fax numbe r and email are provided below as a back -up/contingency for the 
site to report the SAE in case the site is unable to send the report via Safety Gateway.

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Injection -Associated Reactions 
Injection -associated reactions are defined as systemic signs or symptoms ( eg, generalized 
urticaria or itching, hypotension, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]) that occur within [ADDRESS_1252092] a systemic hypersensitivity reaction 
(eg, combination of 2 or more of the following types of signs or symptoms: generalized urticaria 
or itching, hypotension, difficulty breathing, swelling of the eyelids or lips, or gener alized 
edema). These AEs are to be captured as the individual AE(s) that occurred and are not to be grouped and recorded with the term “IAR” or “hypersensitivity.” 
For systemic hypersensitivity reactions, the investigational site will collect laboratory samples 
for analysis of the following: 
• Tryptase (serum)  
− Within 1 hour from time of reaction onset, if possible (no longer than 2 hours 
after onset)  
− At 24 hours (or later) from time of reaction onset 
• C5b-9 (EDTA plasma with protease inhibitors [P100 tubes]) 
− Within 24 hours from time of reaction onset 
• Hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis 
− Within 3 hours from time of reaction onset 
− At 24 hours from time of reaction onset 
Patients will undergo a one- time pre -dose collection of serum for tryptase analysis on Day 1 
prior to administration of study drug, in order to provide a B aseline tryptase value in case of a 
future IAR. The sample will be drawn only if the patient has no active allergies at the time, and 
will only be analyzed (along with the above assessments) if the patient experiences a subsequent 
acute or severe IAR.  If the patient has an ongoing active allergic process on Day 1, the tryptase 
sample should be collected as soon as possible after the resolution of the allergic event. 
Treatment guidelines ca n be found in the SOM. 
If a patient experiences a systemic hypersensitivity reaction  at home, the patient or legal 
representative(s) should call the site as soon as possible to discuss with the Investigator the need 
for medical evaluation in a medical faci lity. Collection of blood samples for the analyses 
outlined above may be required upon recommendation of the Investigator and availability of 
these tests at the local laboratory. If the patient lives near the investigational site, the medical 
evaluation may be done and blood for the tests may be drawn there. 
For patients who experience moderate or severe IARs, continuation of study drug injections in 
the study will be determined by [CONTACT_116333]’s Medical 
Monitor. In the case of a favorable benefit -risk assessment, where the decision is made to 
continue study drug injections, an individualized pretreatment strategy with antihistamines or 
Page 44 of 59

[ADDRESS_1252093] be recorded on the eCRF. If any sign(s) and/or 
symptom(s) of an IAR are considered serious, the Alexion Global Pharmacovigilance group or 
designee must be notified in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions (ISRs) are defined as AEs localized to the site of study drug 
administration that occur at any time during study participation that are asse ssed by [CONTACT_364783], probably, or definitely related to study drug. 
Injection site reactions may occur at any timepoint after study drug administration. There is no 
additional laboratory testing required for ISRs. 
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring for ISRs in patients throughout the duration of the 
study. As part of the study-required physical examinations, Investigators should evaluate 
injection sites for signs of reaction(s). All ISRs, whether non-serious or serious, must be recorded on the eCRF. If any ISRs are considered serious, the Alexion Global 
Pharmacovigilance group or designee must be notified in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anti -Drug Antibodies  
Patients will be monitored for development of antibody production against asfotase alfa (asfotase 
alfa anti -drug antibodies [ADA]) throughout this study ( Table 2 ). Serum will be collected and 
analyzed for the presence of ADA, and if positive further analyzed for titer, neutralizing antibodies, and characterization of the response. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  
The effects of asfotase alfa on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. 
All female patients of childbearing potential and sexually mature males will be required to use a 
medically accepted method of contraception throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_1252094] be immediately discontinued. See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for details on handling of 
pregnancies during the study.

9.5.1. Samples for Study Qualification and Health Monitoring  
Blood and urine samples will be collected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and to monitor patient safety . 
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. 
Tests are run and confirmed promptly whenever scientifically appropriate. However, when 
scientific circumstances warrant it is acceptable to retain  samples to batch the tests run  or to 
retain the samples until the end of the study to confirm that the results are valid. Certain samples 
may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or laborator y certification standards.   
As blood samples taken for study- related testing are sometimes not entirely depleted  for the 
analyses, patients or their legal representative(s) will be given the option to consent to use of the remaining portion of these samples for additional research. These samples will be used only for 
Alexion’s scientific research related to exploratory biology and biomarker assessments for 
asfotase alfa treatment and/or HPP. Each sample may continue to be labeled with the patient’s study identifiers (ie, patient ID). The patient or legal representative(s) may request that his or her 
samples, if still identifiable, be destroyed at any time; however, any data already collected from 
that sample will still b e used for this research. The biological samples will remain the property of 
Alexion, and may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality is maintained. 
9.5.2. Samples for Immunogenicity  
Blood samples for immunogenicity testing will be collected to determine antibody production 
against asfotase alfa at the visits  and times  specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2  and 
Table 3), venous blood samples of approximately 2.[ADDRESS_1252095] ADA 
in the presence of asfotase alfa. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for 
their ability to neutralize the activity of asfotase alf a.   
Samples may be stored for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1252096] patient visit for the study at a facility selected by [CONTACT_893829]. The duration allows the Sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to asfotase alfa.  
9.5.3. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements  
At the visits and times specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2  and Table 3), venous blood 
samples of approximately 2.5 mL each will be collected to determine the serum activity  of 
asfotase alfa. Instructions for the collection and handling of blood samples will be provided in 
the Laboratory Manual . The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sampling will be 
recorded.  
Bioanalytical samples collected to measure study drug  concentration wi ll be retained for a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_1252097] to the efficacy and s afety assessments in individuals with HPP.

10. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its representatives will do the 
following: 
• Provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate  
• Provide start -up training to instruct the Investigators and study coordinators. This 
training will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRFs, and study 
procedures. 
• Make periodic visits to the study site  
• Be available for consultation and stay in contact [CONTACT_893830]  
• Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in 
data collection  
• Conduct a quality review of the database 
In addition, the Sponsor or its representatives will periodically check a sample of the patient data 
recorded against source documents at the study site. The study may be audited by [CONTACT_13670], and/or regulatory agencies at any time. Investigators will be given notice 
before an audit occurs. 
To ensure the safety of p articipants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the Investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical 
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study. If requested, the 
Investigator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable IRB/IEC/ REB(s) with direct access to original source documents.  
10.1. Data Capture System 
An EDC  system will be used in this study. The site must maintain a separate source for the data 
entered into the EDC  system.  
Electronic patient -reported outcome (ePRO) measures or other data reported directly by [CONTACT_4677] (for example, daily dosing schedule) are entered into an ePRO instrument (for example, 
personal digital assistant [PDA], or by [CONTACT_893831]) at the time that the information is 
obtained. The ePRO device will be used to collect date including, but not necessarily limited to, 
dosing data; refer to the Study Operations Manual for further information. In these instances 
where there is no prior written or electronic source data at the site, the ePRO instrument record will serve as the source.  
Any data for which the ePRO instrument record will serve to collect source data will be 
identified and documented by [CONTACT_140842]’s study file.  
All data from the medical records of qualifying patients will be entered into eCRFs designed by 
[CONTACT_893832]. Electronic CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_893833]. Electronic CRF completion guidelines describing the procedures for recording

data on the eCRFs will be provided to the investigational sites and training on the guideline and 
use of the EDC system will occur prior to eCRF completion. 
Any data for which paper documentation provided by [CONTACT_81145]’s study file. Paper documentation provided by [CONTACT_81146], for example, a paper diary to collect patient-
reported outcome (PRO) measures.  
11. STATISTICS  
Alexio n will be responsible for data collection and editing, reviewing and validating all the 
information in the eCRFs, statistical analysis, and generation of the clinical study report.  
Prior to locking the database, all data editing will be completed and decis ions regarding the 
evaluability of all patient data for inclusion in the statistical analysis will be made. The rationale 
for excluding any data from the statistical analyses will be prospectively defined, and 
classification of all or part of a patient's d ata as non -evaluable will be completed and documented 
before the database is locked and before the statistical analysis is begun. The statistical analysis 
will not begin until the entire database is locked and signed off, in accordance with the Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the Alexion Biometrics Department.  
Alexion or designee will perform the statistical analysis of the data derived from this study. The 
analysis will be performed using the SAS® statistical software system Version 9.2 or later . 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated using WinNonlin®5.3 (or higher) (Certara, L.P., 
[ADDRESS_1252098] Louis MO [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003]). 
11.1. Analysis Populations  
11.1.1. Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all patients who are randomized to treatment and 
received at least [ADDRESS_1252099] 1 pre- treatment and 1 on- treatment  PPi 
[CONTACT_338580]. All analyses of PD/efficacy will be performed based on the FAS. Patients will be included 
in the analyses according to the treatment cohort to which they were randomized, irrespective of 
the treatment they actually received. The efficacy analyses based upon the FAS will be 
considered the primary analysis of efficacy.  
11.1.2. Per Protocol Set  
The Per Protocol (PP) population or PP Set consists of all patie nts in the FAS Population with no 
major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations will include:  
• Non-compliance with study treatment  
• Not receiving all doses of study drug 
• Not receiving the correct study treatment  
• Failing to meet key (pre -defined) el igibility criteria  
• Other major protocol violations

Determination of whether or not a patient  will be excluded from the PP Set will be done prior to 
the database lock. All analyses of PD/efficacy will also be performed based on the PP Set. 
Patients will be included in the analyses according to the treatment cohort to which they were 
randomized, irrespective of the treatment they actually received. The efficacy analyses based 
upon the PP Se t will be considered secondary analyses of efficacy.  
11.1.3. Safety Set  
All patients who receive any amount of study drug treatment will c omprise the Safety Set. 
Patients will be considered, for safety analysis, to be in the treatment cohort of the treatment they  
actually received.  
11.1.4. Pharmacokinetic Population  
All treated patients for whom the PK profile can be adequately characterized  will comprise the 
PK P opulation. The PK P opulation will be used for the analysis of PK data. PK analys es will be 
based upon the trea tment actually received.  
11.2. Efficacy /Pharmacodynamic  Endpoints

The PK data from patients will be tabulated and summary statistics will be reported for each cohort.  
The following PK parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental methods:  
• Maximum observed serum concentration (C
Rmax) 
• Time of maximum observed serum concentration (t Rmax) R  
• Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to time of the last observed 
concentration (AUC Rt) 
• Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC R∞) 
• Elimination rate constant (k Re) 
• Half-life (t R½)

11.4. Safety Endpoints  
Safety  variables include the incidence of AEs (includes SAEs; ISRs ; IARs ; discontinuations due 
to AEs; and drug- related serious and severe AEs), as well as clinical and laboratory tests (clinical 
chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and temperature), physical examinations, renal ultra sound, ophthalmology assessment, 
pregnancy testing (for women of childbearing potential), asfotase alfa anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) , and neutralizing antibodies (nAb). 
11.5. Statistical Methods  
All data collected in this study will be documented using summary tables,  figures, and patient 
data listings. For  categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented for each 
cohort and for the combined cohorts (where appropriate). For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, maximum) will be pre sented for 
each cohort and for the combined cohorts (where appropriate). Descriptive statistics for PK 
parameters will include the number of observations, mean, SD, coefficient of variation ( CV), 
median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric %CV.  All hypothesis testing will 
be 2-sided and performed at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Pharmacodynamic/ efficacy analyses will be  conducted on the FAS , consisting of all treated 
patients with at least 1 pre -treatment and 1 on- treatment PPi [CONTACT_10654]. Additionally , PD/ efficacy 
analyses will be conducted on the PP Set . Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted on the PK 
population, consisting of all treated patients for whom the PK profile can be adequately 
characterized. Safety analyses wi ll be conducted on the Safety Set, consisting of all patients who 
received at least 1  dose of asfotase alfa.  
For the PD/ efficacy analyses, patients will be considered to be in the treatment cohort to which 
they were randomized. For safety and PK analyses, patients will be considered to be in the 
treatment cohort of the treatment they actually received.  
11.5.1. Handling of Dropouts/Missing Data 
For each patient, there are 5 pre- treatment baseline samples ( -168, -156, -24, -12, and 0h) to be 
collected. The average value will be used for  analysis. Therefore, at least 1 pre -treatment 
baseline observation is required for the patient to be included for the assessment of the primary 
PD/efficacy analysis (PPi). If a patient  lack s a pre -treatment  value they will be excluded from the 
analysis. In addition, patients  will be required to have at least [ADDRESS_1252102] (LOCF). This imputation will occur only for the primary endpoint.   
Missing or invalid safety data will not be replaced.  
11.5.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics including gender, ethnicity, age at study treatment 
initiation, age at initial symptoms, age at diagnosis, and time since initial symptom onset will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_893834] (n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum) or frequencies and percentages, as appropriate. All data will be presented in by- patient data listings.

Medical/surgical history will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_893835]- patient data listings.  
Concomitant medication/ther apy data and pre- treatment medication data will be presented in 
listings. Concomitant medications will also be summarized in tabular form by [CONTACT_893836]. The WHO Drug dictionary will be used to code the 
medications.  
11.5.3. Patient Accountability  
All patients randomized to treatment will be included in the summary of patient disposition and accountability overall and by [CONTACT_9084] . A listing of patients indicating randomization to treatment, 
attendance at each visit, discontinuation from the study, and completion of the study will also be 
generated.  
11.5.4. Efficacy/ Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy /Pharmacodynamic Endpoint  
The primary efficacy /PD endpoint will be the change from PPi B aseline to pre-[ADDRESS_1252103] 
will be used. A fixed sequence testing procedure will be performed with the comparison of the 9.0 mg/kg/week cohort compared to the 1.5 mg/kg/week cohort being performed first, and the 
hypothesis testing for the second comparison 6.0 mg/kg/week cohort compared to the 
1.5 mg/kg/week cohort only being performed if the null hypothesis is rejected for the previous 
comparison at a significance level of 0.05. The primary endpoint will be met if the null 
hypothesis is rejected f or both comparisons at a significance level of 0.05. Additionally, the shift 
in the distributions and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the above comparisons will be reported using the Hodges- Lehman n-Sen estimate and the exact confidence limits reported .    
As secondary analyses, descriptive statistics for absolute PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893805]. Within cohort, the change from Baseline to 
all study timepoints will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed -rank test . 
Additionally , a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based repeated measures mixed model 
will be fit to estimate the change from Baseline in PPi [INVESTIGATOR_144109] p re-dose time point during the 
study period and test whether the change differs from z ero at each timepoint. The analysi s will 
include the fixed, categorical effect of visit.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -patient errors.  If this analysis fails to converge, the following structures will be 
tested and the final covariance structure will be determined by [CONTACT_100830]' s information criterion 
(AIC): first -order autoregressive, co mpound symmetry, and Toeplitz. The Kenward -Roger 
approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. The estimate of change from Baseline at defined visits will be provided, along with 95% CIs and p- values.  The treatment 
effect will also be explored.  
Individual and mean concentration versus time curves will be presented. Additional analysis of PPi [INVESTIGATOR_893806] i f considered useful.

Following dosing at Week 1, Day1 , mean serum asfotase alfa concentrations versus nominal  
time, and individual serum as fotase alfa concentrations versus actual  time will be graphically 
presented for both linear and semi- log scales.  The individual serum concentration data for 
patients in each cohort, with actual s ampling dates and times will be used to derive the PK 
parameters by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analyses using WinNonlin®5.3 (or higher) (Certara, L.P., 
[ADDRESS_1252105] Louis MO [ZIP_CODE] [LOCATION_003]). The followin g PK parameters will be 
calculated and summary statistics reported by [CONTACT_893837]: C RmaxR, t RmaxR, AUC Rt, RAUC R∞R, 
k ReR, and t R½R. Both the single-dose and multiple-dose PK  will be characterized. Descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean,  and geometric %CV) 
of the serum concentration and PK parameters will be presented. An attainment of asfotase alfa 
PK s teady state will be evaluated. Dose proportionality and ti me linearity assessment may be 
considered. Graphical displays of PK data will be presented as appropriate.   
Relationships between PK and PD parameters may be explored  if considered appropriate.  The 
PK and PD data from this study may be combined with data from other studies.  
11.5.6. Statistical Methods: Safety Variables 
Summaries for all safety variables will be computed and displayed by [CONTACT_9084].

summarized by [CONTACT_893841]. Listings of abnormal results 
will be provided. 
11.5.7. Statistical Methods: Study Drug Administration 
Study drug administration data will be presented by [CONTACT_325707] a listing.  
11.5.8. Statistical Methods: Power and Sample Size  
A sample size of 9 patients per cohort (27 patients total) will provide sufficient power (>80%) to 
detect a difference of 2.3  µM between the 9.0 mg/kg/week cohort compared to the 
1.5 mg/kg/week cohort, and between the 6.0 mg/kg/week cohort compared to the 
1.5 mg/kg/week cohort in the change from Baseline to pre-[ADDRESS_1252106]
P dose in Week  9 PPi (assuming a 
SD of 1.5 µM). This is based upon the use of a 2-sided, 2- sample t -test analyzed using a fixed 
sequence testing procedure with the comparison of the 9.0 mg/kg/week cohort compared to the 
1.5 mg/kg/week cohort being performed first, and the hypothesis testing for the second 
comparison 6.0 mg/kg/week cohor t compared to the 1.5 mg/kg/week cohort only being 
performed if the null hypothesis is rejected for the previous comparison at a significance level of 
0.05.  
A sample size of 6 patients per cohort (18 patients total) will provide sufficient power (> 90%) to  
detect a difference of 3.2 µM (SD 1.5 µM) using the same assumptions and fixed sequence 
testing procedure. A difference of 3.2 µM (SD  1.5 µM) was observed in adult pediatric -onset 
treated patient s versus controls in Study ENB -009-10 for the change from ba seline to Week  6 in

PPi. Between 6 and 9 patients per cohort (18 and 27 patients total) will give sufficient power to 
detect a mean difference of 2.3  to 3.2 µM (SD  1.5 µM). 
11.5.9. Statistical Methods: Multiplicity  
For the primary endpoint, a fixed sequence testing procedure will be used to control the Type I 
error rate. Statistical adjustment of p -values will not be performed.
